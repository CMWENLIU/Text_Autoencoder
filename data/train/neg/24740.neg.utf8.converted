KEEP YOUR RECEIPT.<br /><br />Tastes weird ...artificial & the stuff has white plastic crap in it."<br />I started to put it on a hamburger and said "Oh Hell no".<br /><br />Save your money.<br /><br />Was ok in "tarter sauce"..recipe:<br /><br />mince onions.<br />add lemon pepper, lemon juice, dill relish.<br />some stevia if you like sweet..and a small amount of this mayo.<br /><br />***<br />I tried to use as a pseudo sour cream...and well it ruined the entire recipe.<br /><br />***<br />As with all Walden Farms if you are not on a very low calorie diet..<br />then do not use zero calorie products.<br /><br />Walden Farms did refund my money.<br />I bought a half dozen of their products.
