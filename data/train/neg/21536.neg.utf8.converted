I ordered this as a Christmas present. When we opened it we found out that you need about $200 worth of equipment to make this. I am an amateur beer maker and thought this would be alot of fun. When you order extra there it says REFILL kit. That is EXACTLY what this is! A REFILL KIT!!! This advertising is extremely deceptive. It also says nothing about all the extra equipment you will need, so here are the thing you will need to buy;<br /><br />*Primary Fermentor: food grade plastic (30) little capacity.<br />*Carboy 23 liter glass or food grade plastic<br />*Racking tube and siphon hose<br />*hyrometer, thermometer, and test jar<br />*long hadled plastic Spoon<br />*Bottle Brush<br />*Bottle corker<br />*filter and filter pads From A wine retailer<br /><br />And now you are ready to go!!!
