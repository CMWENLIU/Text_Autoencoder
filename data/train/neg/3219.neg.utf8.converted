I have no complains about the nutritional benefits of Kashi Go Lean cereal. It's got the lowest fat content of any brand cereal on the market. It only has 130 calories per 45g serving.<br /><br />However, it is the worst tasting cereal that I've ever had (and I've had quite few in my lifetime). Combine this with Skim Milk and it's akin to eating cardboard pieces soaked in water. It is absolutely revolting, with a weird chemical after-taste that refuses to go away. The least Kashi could have done is throw in some raisins or dried strawberry pieces in there. Sure, the fat content goes up a gram or two but at least, you won't feel like throwing up each time you take a mouthful.<br /><br />I tried it for three weeks (one serving every day) to see if it was an acquired taste but I will tell you, it was as revolting on Day 21 as it was on Day 1. I've since then switched to Special K Protien Plus. It's got 2 extra grams of fat (that's 30 calories per 45g for the calorie counters out there), but hey, you can eat it and not feel like throwing up. That, I guess is reason enough for me to switch. I can walk the extra 20 calories off by parking the car at the far end of the lot.
