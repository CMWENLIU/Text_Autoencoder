I tried all of the different disposable products.  Waisted like 60 bucks on all of them.  Amazon was loving me.  They ALL leak.  I am back to regular manufacturer K-Cups or the My K-Cup (the one you can get in the store) (That's the only one that doesn't leak).<br /><br />I even went online and checked out the reviews that said to move the rubber seal down on the needle, it didn't work.<br /><br />Keurig is designed to brew with high pressure.  To do that, you need an airtight seal.  This doesn't provide that.  That is why Keurig is not selling these in the store next to their machines.
