I purchased the Hugs and Kisses arrangement for my friend from her 3yr old son for Valentine's Day.  The flowers were nothing but a total disappointment.  They looked nothing like the picture, infact, they looked like they had been sitting a grocery store for two weeks with no water.  From now on - I order local delivery.  Proflower customer service is less than desirable.  Not only did the individual not speak English very well, he was rude and laughed in my face.  I am not ordering from them again.
