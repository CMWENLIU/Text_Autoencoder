First off, this is a BLEND, and NOT pure Ethiopian coffee, which is not at all clear.  And when you open the bag, you can definitely see that it's a blend with beans of all different sizes and color.  Basically this is the dregs of the coffee beans that are harvested and roasted.  Generally, I love Ethiopian coffee.  But this barely passes for coffee, let alone good coffee.  If I could give it no stars, that would be my review.  Don't waste your money. Skip it....
