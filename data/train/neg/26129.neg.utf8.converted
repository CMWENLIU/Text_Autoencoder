I ordered this marzipan last Christmas, amazed by the great deal that I had found.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the old addage is true:  you get what you pay for.<br /><br />This marzipan is made with corn syrup instead of sugar, has a low almond content, and is flavored with a hint of citrus that masks any almond flavor whatsoever.  I may as well have been eating lemon-scented glue sticks.<br /><br />Even more interesting is that I froze the unused marzipan in the same bag with a 'better' variety.  Within three months this marzipan had taken on a freezer taste, whereas the higher grade marzipan still tastes great even one year later.  They were both in the same bag together, so it can only be the ingredients themselves that didn't hold up.<br /><br />I will never buy cheap marzipan again, and I have thrown out the bulk marzipan that I purchased from this company.
