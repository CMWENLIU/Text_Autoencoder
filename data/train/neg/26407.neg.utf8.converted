My first disappointment with Amazon.  Instead of Amber Sugar Cyrstals, these were mahogany, coco brown, and old. The product had been sitting on the self for some time. I thought I would take advantage of the good price on this item as I had been paying considerably more. How do you return an open box of sugar crystals with a third of the contents missing from poor packaging?<br /><br />Apparently, when the notation for a perishable product says "2 or 3 left, more on the way".  The product is old.
