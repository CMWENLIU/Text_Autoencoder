I have been buying this coffee for a couple years and love it.  Recently I started buying from amazon for convenience.  One thing that I have noticed is one week I will get a package that was roasted January 30.  The next order will be January 30.  And then the next order (received March 30) was roasted on January 16th.  Since this is ground coffee some people would say we have crossed the line on freshness.<br /><br />The coffee is still great but shipping first-in, first-out is something to strive for on items that have shelf lives.<br /><br />Adding to my review:<br /><br />I just received my April 30th shipment of two bags of Black Cat.  One bag has a roast date of 2/23/12 and the other was roasted on 1/16/12.  Based on this new information it is clear that amazon has no system to ship based on first-in, first-out or they are buying spot market unsold coffee to sell at full retail price in a venue they call Grocery & Gourmet Food.<br /><br />I love amazon, so it concerns me that they cannot manage something as simple as Grocery & Gourmet Food.  My next stop is Intelligentsia to see what they think about ground coffee that is roasted in January and sold to become a cup of coffee in May.<br /><br />One more addition:<br /><br />I finally got the answer - the coffee is roasted for espresso - when it passes the acceptable date to be ground for a good espresso they grind it for drip and sell it via amazon.
