I ordered this and had it shipped to a friend. She said that the box arrived crushed but she didn't think it mattered. When she opened the box up, she noticed that had very little adhesive on it, making her think the box may have been opened before or that an old box had been used. She looked at the candy and it was white all over and indented and looked very weathered and old. She is a big fan of Whoppers candy and I sent these to her to brighten up her day but because of bad management on the part of one company, she ended up with candy that she could not even eat.
