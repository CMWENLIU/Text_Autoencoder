UNBELEIVABLE! People are so gullible, no these treats aren't toxic to your dogs, but they certainley aren't healthy either.  Just because sugar and fat taste good doesn't mean you should feed it to your dog! Get a clue and check out the ingredients in the treats and food you feed your dog, and even though some things are healthy for humans doesn't mean they are for dogs (e.g. SOY AND CORN) try thinking for yourself and doing your own research.
