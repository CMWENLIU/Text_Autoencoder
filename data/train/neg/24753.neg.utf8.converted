I got this Vanilla flavor to use instead of the Wilton Vanilla, thinking it would be a better quality. I opened the bottle when i received it took a sniff and about vomited. It smelt soooo strong. I can imagine using it for candle making or something but in food, my word NO! Maybe I got a bad bottle but it definitely put me off.
