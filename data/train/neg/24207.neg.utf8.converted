I'm embarrassed to admit that I fell for the advertising and made an impulsive purchase of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DM1Z3Q">Crystal Light Mocktails Drink Mixes - Three Flavors</a><br /><br />It sounded like a good idea since I live in Tex-Mex food land to be able to have a Margarita without all of the calories.  Unfortunately, the product description doesn't give the ingredient list and, since it was an impulse purchase, I didn't take the time to research it.  I really wanted to like it and had high hopes for the product.<br /><br />For those who may find it helpful here are the ingredients for each.  You will notice that they are all remarkably similar and the sweetener is Aspartame :(<br /><br />APPLETINI:  Citric Acid, Maltodextrin, Aspartame, Natural Flavor, Modified Cornstarch, Acesulfame Potassium, Contains less than 2% of Magnesium Oxide, Yellow 5, Blue 1<br /><br />MARGARITA: Citric Acid, Maltodextrin, Salt, Aspartame, Natural Flavor, Contains less than 2% of Acesulfame Potassium,  Magnesium Oxide, Artificial Color Yellow 5, Blue 1<br /><br />MOJITO:  Citric Acid, Maltodextrin, Aspartame and Acesulfame Potassium, Sugar, Magnesium Oxide, Contains less than 2% of Natural Flavor, Yellow 5, Blue 1<br /><br />The taste is as one would expect from the ingredient list.  To me, it was not only vile tasting but also a headache trigger.
