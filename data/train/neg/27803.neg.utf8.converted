I purchased this tea honestly because I was looking for one more item to get up to the $25 so I could get free shipping.  I am a tea lover and I drink both loose teas and bag teas.  This looked almost too good to be true for the price, but I thought, "What the heck?"  I found that 1 bag will only steep one cup of tea.  You cannot get 2 cups like you can out of many other brands.  I also found that some bags did not want to steep at all.  Also, the string tends to come off easily.  The strings appear to be sealed into the bag and when they get into a boiling cup of water, they tend to come off and the top of the bag opens and the tea leaves come out.  Ok, but I wouldn't give it as a gift or anything.  I suggest sticking with a better brand for bagged teas like Lipton, Bigelow, or Celestial Seasonings.  For loose tea I recommend TeaSmith, Teavana, Davidson's, or Republic of Tea.  Also, check to see if your tea is Fair Trade Certified and/or Organic.
