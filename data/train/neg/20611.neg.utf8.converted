I was informed by multiple Target employees (I visited 6-7 Target stores in search of these cookies) that they were unable to keep these Limited Edition Oreos in stock because they were bought in bulk by people selling them on Amazon at a huge markup (a 400% markup, to be precise).<br /><br />I realize price gouging is only illegal when it involves natural disasters and life essentials -- neither of which is the case here -- but it is always an unfair practice that makes it impossible for the average shopper to find Limited Edition and/or "soon-to-be-discontinued" items on the shelf, forcing us to pay ridiculous prices online (if we're inclined to be moved to such extremes).<br /><br />It seems this practice is particularly popular with the hottest toys during Christmas time (if the Amazon forums are any indication). The only way to put a stop to this practice? Speak with your dollars; don't give into the temptation; and spend your money on something else.<br /><br />It's for that reason that I have no idea how these Candy Corn Oreos taste. As much as I'd like to try them, no Oreo is worth $15 a box.
