Really taste great...but i just called the company, Taste Nirvana, and they confirmed that their coconut water is indeed pasturized. What a shame, as the heat kills all the wonderful nutrients.<br />So far, the only coconut water that i have found, that isn't paturized, is made by Exotic Superfoods. So i'm looking to find where to purchase Exotic Superfoods coconut water.<br />I wish it were available here on Amazon.
