I got these dehydrated kefir grains two weeks ago. When re-hydrated there was a very tiny amount of actual grains. I put them in a jar with milk on a seedling mat to keep them the right temperature (our house is cool at night) and was very careful, and yet the milk kept curdling because there weren't enough grains, or just going yeasty. And they're growing very, very slowly. Two weeks later and I have a half teaspoon of grains. So far the milk has never smelled anything like kefir. In desperation I started adding some kefir powder and kefir, thinking that maybe they'd pick up some missing bacteria. Also, the instructions are misleading when they talk about it taking two weeks to "rehydrate". What you're doing is growing them to the point that you have enough to actually make kefir. I'm starting to think that dehydrated grains are a bad idea. But at the very least they ought to give you enough of them, instead of the tiny amount.<br /><br />Because it didn't seem like it was working very well, I ordered two tablespoons of live kefir grains from another vendor. They arrived yesterday, and I put them in milk. Today I think I have almost a quarter cup of grains. They seem to have already grown noticeably.<br /><br />Out of curiosity I'm still going to try to get these grains to work. I'm going to try a much smaller amount of milk so the kefir grains aren't overwhelmed. I'll update this review if it ever works.
