I was using the gelatinous maca by the same company, but after about two weeks, I started having AWFUL dreams every night. I was waking up scared to death bc my dreams were so real. So I stopped taking it for 2 days, and I had no bad dreams. i took it again and the dreams were back! I did read that this is a possible side effect! I am done with it. It also made me feel sort of breath (like i had been running for a few minutes, even though I had not been!) Maca is definitely NOT for me!
