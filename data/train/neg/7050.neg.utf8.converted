I just ordered a 3-pack of these maple sugar candies, and I am sorry to say, I am extremely disappointed.  They are as hard as rocks, nearly impossible to chew, and have strange coloring all over them.  Areas of pale white, dark, and light.  I would guess these are leftover from Chrismas '09, and have been sitting in a warehouse untli now.  While the taste is okay, I would not recommend a buy at all.  Steer clear of these.
