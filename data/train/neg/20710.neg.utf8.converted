I want to start  by saying that if I was reviewing the food alone, it would get 5 stars easily.  It's a quality product and my picky eater cat (as in, he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like) loves it.<br /><br />Having said that, I won't buy this (or any other canned product for that matter) from Amazon.com anymore, unless they were to significantly change their packaging method. Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer.<br /><br />The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.  Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top.  Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car.<br /><br />Amazon.com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition.  In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No.  And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism.<br /><br />I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Amazon, too.  I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem.  Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste.  If it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it, I'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto-order (and subsequent additional savings) really are nice.
