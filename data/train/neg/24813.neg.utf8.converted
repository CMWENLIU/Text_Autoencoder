I bought a case of Kashi GoLEAN cereal from Amazon in December 2007, and opened it only to find an expiration date of March 2008.  According to the manufacturer the cereal has a shelf life of one year and therefore has been sitting on the shelf for the past nine months.  Amazon offered only a partial refund for the stale product.
