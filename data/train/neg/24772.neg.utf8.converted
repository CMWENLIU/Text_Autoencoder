Pack of 8 Campell soup listed for $51.00 regular? Lol....What grocery store sells them for that price? They must be kidding right?  Now on sale for what? You can buy them in any store for a little over 1.00 each! On sale even less... ....Bogus Prices-Bogus-Prices... This grocery site is not for me...
