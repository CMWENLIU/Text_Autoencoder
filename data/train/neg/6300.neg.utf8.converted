Late July recently changed the recipe for their Dark Chocolate Sandwich Cookies without any direct notification on the packaging. They disappeared from the shelves in the Denver area and when they reappeared, they were different. The new recipe isn't nearly as good. There's less of the intense cocoa taste that we enjoyed. They're drier. The cookie is more like a dry, less tasty cracker now. Sure they're marginally healthier - a bit less fat, more whole grain and fiber, less sugar. That's fine, but the taste of the cookie has been compromised such that they're just less tasty, empty calories now at 50 calories a pop. We originally switched from Newman's chocolate creme filled chocolate sandwich cookies to Late July's because they were so much better. Now they're not as good. We live pretty far from the Denver area so we stock up occasionally. Since there was no obvious notification of the recipe change on the packaging, I bought our usual supply for a couple of months. Mistake! I'll be donating several boxes to the local food pantry. Hopefully, someone will enjoy them!
