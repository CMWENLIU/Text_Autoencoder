I have been trying to find a good sugar free Black licorice on Amazon, as I just love buying on Amazon for the variety and convience. Bought this as I thought it might be good. I did not see that it had a minty flavor. Yuck! not the licorice for me. Amazon gave me a refund. Still seeking for good sugar free black licorice on Amazon.
