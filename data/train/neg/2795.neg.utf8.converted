I was really looking forward to having this little snack arrive.  However, when I tried it for the first time, I tasted an unexpected flavor.  After trying it a few times and then disecting it, I realized that there were raisins in it.  Unfortunately, no one in my family likes raisins.  After checking the list of ingredients on the website and the product package, there is no mention of raisins. Putting all of that aside, I think this product would be tasty to those of you who like raisins.  I must warn you that I think the presence of the raisins make this Pecan Honey Crunch more like Pecan Honey Chewy.<br /><br />Amazon's cutomer service was quick to respond and helped me fix the problem.  Thanks, Amazon!
