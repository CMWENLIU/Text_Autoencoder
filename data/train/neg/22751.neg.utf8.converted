I tried this as a break from heavy lunches.  I found it really nasty. The flavor powder clumps up, no matter how vigorously you stir the mess, and the beans stay a bit too hard.  The final texture is like maple syrup with lumps.  The flavor is horrid -- dried something, but no resemblance to any food I've had (and homemade black bean soup is a favorite).  This seems to be a product devised by someone who considers food only a nutrient object, not a potential source of joy in life. I cannot recommend this to anyone who has taste buds.
