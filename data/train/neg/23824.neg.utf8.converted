Amazon has a good price on this product compare to other places. This tea set is allright, and the idea to have the flowering tea is kind of cool, (There are better tasting flowering tea in the market such as Harney & Sons.) however. the bamboo box that contain the tea set is poorly made. The orange paint on the box will come off on your fingers when you touch it, and you need to be careful not to get splinters when you are openning the box. If they can package it better it would have been a really cool gift. I originally bought it as Xmas gift to give to a friend, but the quality is not as good as my expectation so I decided to keep it. The flowering tea looks cool but don't expect too much on the taste. I wouldn't buy this product again.
