For what is, a variation on Hamburger Helper but more expensive, this is OK.  There was something about the flavor, possibly the spices, that I just didn't enjoy.  Moreover, it really didn't taste like Velveeta cheese, which I really enjoy cooking with.  This is not something I would actually buy and eat on a regular basis. If I really want a boxed meal I'll go with Hamburger Helper
