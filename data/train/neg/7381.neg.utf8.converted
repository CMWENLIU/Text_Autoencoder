This is not the first time I order Lavazza Supercrema, and usually I liked it for my everyday espresso.<br /><br />However this time item was out of stock for a long time and I canceled subscription but forgot to cancel that particular order that was lingering until the product became available. Anyway, I ordered Grand Tiera as I couldn't wait for Supercrema and I got my initial bag of Supercrema unexpectedly but it was still OK as I had guests and beans were going like crazy until I got a big surprise when I brewed the first cup with these beans.<br /><br />I thought it must be something wrong with my machine or the water filter, so I tried to brew the other Grand Tiera beans that were almost over and the espresso was OK. Now I don't know how to return this full bag of Supercrema that is completely useless as Amazon policy doesn't allow returns on these items.
