If they used a lot less sugar this might have been a good drink, however there is so much sugar in this drink that it tastes like ginger flavored  sugar syrup.<br />Totally horrible drinking experience.<br />46.5 grams of sugar!<br />Over a ounce and a half of sugar and not a gram of salt to balance it out.<br />This is not Ginger beer, it's sugar beer.<br />If you want real ginger beer flavor, avoid Barr's Ginger beer.<br />This will only disappoint you.<br />There are much better brands available.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB04N8">D & G, Soda Ginger Beer, 12-once (24 Pack)</a>
