I used to love Bosco. My mom used to buy it for all of us kids. I loved it so much, my mom used to say, "Let's go, Bosco!" when we were ready to leave somewhere. I was saddened when it was no longer available in my area.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2012...I discover to my utter delight that Bosco can still be purchased and is available online! I ordered some, it comes in the mail, I'm so excited to share this great tasting stuff with my kids and to my incredible disappointment, I find that they've begun using High Fructose Corn Syrup (for the record, I didn't purchase it at Amazon which does list the ingredients...I found it elsewhere accidentally before even thinking of checking here). That stuff is horrible for you. Among it's many crimes, it tells your brain you're still hungry after you've eaten and tells your pancreas to stop producing insulin (which of course would eventually lead to diabetes...hmmm, gee, seeing as how Coke & Pepsi have been using it for 25 years, I wonder why there's been a rise in cases in that length of time?). It also is clinically linked to the obesity problem in this country.<br /><br />To make matters worse, Bosco claims on their label that the product is "All Natural" which is completely false if the product contains HFCS since HFCS is made using two genetically modified enzymes, therefore NOT "all natural".<br /><br />I'll order Fox's U-Bet if I ever want chocolate syrup (delicious stuff with ZERO HFCS), but when it comes to chocolate milk, I'll stick to Ovaltine for me and the kids. Not only is it nice and light (not heavy syrupy), but it also contains vitamins (Bosco contains some B vitamins, but the use of HFCS, in my opinion, negates that).<br /><br />Be warned, it's not your daddy's Bosco!
