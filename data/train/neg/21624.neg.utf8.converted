1st, i really do like the BLACK licorice and rate it at a 5....<br /><br />but this red stuff just missed the mark for me. the texture is fine, but the flavor sure was not strawberry. what was it then? hard to pinpoint just what it was. there was a tartness for sure. and it seemed contrived at that. they say it is all natural, but just what doe that mean, for it did not taste natural to me.<br /><br />the black licorice needs replacing in the candy jar each day...in it's candy jar, the red is hardly ever even topped off
