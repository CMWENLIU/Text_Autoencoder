I love Colavita's Aged Sweet Balsamic Vinegar.  I ordered this and was so disappointed to find that although the box was for the sweet aged vinegar, what was inside was their plain vinegar that is not aged and is definitely not sweet.  I've had both and I know the difference.  They do still sell it, but the bottle is smaller and different than this one.  So beware when purchasing this item from anyone, and especially I know of this place.  This is false advertising and I can't believe after all the hastles I went through to be able to send it back and get a refund they are still showing this as the vinegar they are selling.  How do you make a company stop falsely advertising a product and sending you something different?  I'll never do business with them again.  Had they unknowingly sold me the wrong product and been quick to resolve it, I would have a different attitude, but then to find they even still advertise this, makes me very angry.  I am trying a different vender now through amazon and hope they are selling the correct product.
