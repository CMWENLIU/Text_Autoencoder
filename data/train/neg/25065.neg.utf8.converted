I bought a box of this tea a few months ago, and it was amazing, best Earl Grey I have ever had.<br /><br />I decided to order a package of 6 boxes, and the tea I got was completely different. Different packaging, different baggies, shorter string, and most importantly of all TERRIBLE TEA. I cannot even drink it, it is so BAD. It doesn't even taste like earl grey, but cheap Lipton tea. There are no words to explain my utter disappointment. I would give it zero stars, if I could.<br /><br />UPDATE...<br />I called Two Leaves and a Bud to ask why this tea was so different, and they admitted that they have changed not only their tea source, but also their production/packaging facility. So the new tea is indeed a completely different product (these changes span all packaging types: single boxes, bags, 100 count, and 6-box count).<br /><br />Their customer service however, is SUPERB. They offered to replace the 6 boxes with any of their other products. I chose loose-leaf Decaf Earl Grey (which is almost as delicious as the pre-change Earl Grey). I didn't even need to ship the 6 boxes back - they told me to keep it, give it away, whatever. What an outstanding company!
