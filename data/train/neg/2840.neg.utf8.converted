If you enjoy making cappuccino's with your Dolce Gusto, I would suggest just buying the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FHZA">Nescafe Dolce Gusto Espresso, 16-Servings (Pack of 3)</a> and heating/frothing your own milk. The milk pod just didn't have a nice flavor in my opinion. Perhaps my pod was heat damaged, but it tasted sour. Unfortunately, I had to dump it down the sink because it really was that terrible and couldn't be saved.<br /><br />Since Nescafe states that the dark pod is espresso, I would be confident ordering a box of the espresso pods and frothing 1% milk with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G9N94E">BonJour Primo Latte Frother, Rechargeable Includes Electric Base</a>. I use this all the time to make cappuccino's at home and they are far better in flavor than this product.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because the milk pods are supposed to be identical between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FI36">Nescafe Dolce Gusto Chococino, 8-Servings (Pack of 3)</a>, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FI0O">Nescafe Dolce Gusto Latte Macchiato, 8-Servings (Pack of 3)</a>, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FI22">Nescafe Dolce Gusto Cappuccino, 8-Servings (Pack of 3)</a>. Unfortunately for me, the Cappuccino milk pods were awful tasting compared to the milk pods for the other products. I just assume that my box was heat damaged, resulting in an undesirable flavor. Your experience might be different.
