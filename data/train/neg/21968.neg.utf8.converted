Only marginally better than the Cafe Escapes line, which isn't saying much. This still tastes like salty a** juice and contains artificial sweetener, along with a myriad of other chemicals. But it contains real non-fat dry milk, ooh!<br /><br />This product tastes very little like a prepared packet of Swiss Miss. Hot chocolate from a packet is not my favorite, but it is way better than this... and cheaper per cup, last time I checked. Save your money and take the extra two seconds to stir one into a hot water cycle from your Keurig. Your tastebuds will thank you.
