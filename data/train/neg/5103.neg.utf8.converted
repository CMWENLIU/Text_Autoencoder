I picked up a can of this soup because it sounded interesting, but I was very disappointed. The base was really bland, I was thinking it would be sweet because of the corn, but it wasn't. The chicken was okay but the carrots were mushy and the celery was cut too big and was bitter. I didn't even finish it and definitely won't be buying it again.
