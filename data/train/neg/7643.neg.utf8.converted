I received this plant as a gift from a dear friend.  It was almost dead (leaves dropping as I unpacked it) on arrival and in spite of not having any instruction re bonsai with the plant, all our research on what to do to save it failed!!  A complete waste of my friend's money!!  Very disappointed in this Amazon product.
