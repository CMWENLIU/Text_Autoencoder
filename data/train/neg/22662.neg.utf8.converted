I keep coming back to this brand because it is "almost" healthy.  I just can't get past the 2 questionable ingredients: yeast extract & natural flavors. These are 2 ingredients that almost always contain MSG.  If they didn't, why would they be in there with such odd names. Why wouldn't it just say flour or carrots?  When I make soup at home I never add anything called natural flavors, and wouldn't know where to get yeast extract.  These are unnecessary ingredients that I am guessing are not so natural and are probably flavor enhancers.  I wouldn't care so much, but MSG in any form gives me a headache. If the ingredients read "MSG" or "Monosodium Glutamate" many customers would avoid the product. Hence the need to be covert.  Google MSG and read how many ingredients (additives) actually contain MSG. Very frustrating.
