For reference, I've had several Kona coffees before and loved them all.  I had high expectations for this coffee after reading the reviews and then after smelling the beans.  The smell of the beans is the only good thing about this coffee though.  I was skeptical when I saw how very dry the beans were as if they'd been sitting on a shelf for quite a while.  I decided to go ahead and make a pot of french pressed coffee regardless.  Based on how bad it was (couldn't even finish the cup), I'm guessing that everyone giving this good reviews must be dripping this coffee.  Still, I can't imagine that it's very good either way and I have to wonder what kind of coffee is normally drunk by the people who rated this as good.  This is nothing like any of the Kona coffees I've had in the past.  It's not even close to being on par with the Sumatra I've been drinking lately.  If you normally drink pretty good coffee, especially if you grind your own beans that have a nice oily appearance, I'd recommend avoiding this one.  I'll probably be throwing the rest of mine out.
