104 once tin at local store $18.99.I thought I'm getting better deal at Amazon for two  this size and not 34 ounce.My bad ........... I should've pay more attention.If you have only seen my face when I opened the package ;-)I didn't know they make tiny tins like that.Funny! Too bad I cannot return it ;-(....The highest price I've seen so far in other stores is $27.99 for 3 L (104 fl oz)........still cheaper than here!!!!!!!!Check your local store!
