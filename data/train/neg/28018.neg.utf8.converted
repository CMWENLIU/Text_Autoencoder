Because I am Hungarian, I've used this product all my life as I am a gormet Hungarian cook.  This particular product is very hard to find on grocery store shelves.  Typically, Hungarian Paprika should appear bright, deep orange.  This is an indication of freshness.  The paprika that I received was a brownish-bronze color.  I tasted it and it was very bitter.  I'll still use the product, but probably order from somewhere else.
