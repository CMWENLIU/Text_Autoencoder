As per the product listing, this version of Lea & Perrins' iconic Worcestershire sauce contains high fructose corn syrup. Heinz has actually listened to customer concerns/opinions and, as of this year, started using sugar in the recipe instead of HFCS in the US version again (see the product info on the L&P website - the ingredients are listed there) but unless and until the product information is updated I'd assume what's being sold here is still old inventory containing HFCS. If in doubt, you can sometimes find the bottles with the orange label for sale in stores. That is the L&P imported from Britain and will definitely NOT contain any HFCS.<br /><br />Kudos to Heinz for listening to its customers, though. There is absolutely no need for Worcestershire sauce to contain high fructose corn syrup!
