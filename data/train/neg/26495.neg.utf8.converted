Really dumb to show a photo of the package saying 2 for a dollar and then the title says 2 for 2 dollars is the original price..?  Then call it a manager's special when it's obviously marked up?  Good grief people.  They sell these at my gas station.  Cheap and dryer/harder than normal gummy worms and not many in the package.  This package looks generous compared to what I'm used to.  They are literally 2 for a dollar regular price so don't pay this silly, pretend "discounted manager's special" price.
