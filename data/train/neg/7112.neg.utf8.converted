I ordered this expecting at least a good sized piece of antler as it is close to $20 with shipping and given the title "XL" When I received it it is just a hair under 4 1/2 inches long and about a inch in diameter. I was ordering this for my great dane and I am afraid even to let her play with it. Really should put length and diameter in the description. Very disappointed and wouldn't waste your money on this thing unless your "XL" dog is about 50 pounds
