I started using Amazon groceries to order various healthy snacks directly sent to me in the office.  It has paid off enormously as I am in great shape eating lots of high energy food (low/ no sugar) throughout the day and this lets me a very light lunch.<br /><br />That being said I guess I was expecting more from these when I ordered them off of Amazon groceries.  The price was right but the biggest problem for these is that they are kind of tasteless.  You really need to eat them with something else.  The other major problem is that they come all broken and at best 20% of the crackers are intact.  You really end up eating the box as a "cracker chips".  Also the box has no clasps or folds so there is no way to actually close the thing which isn't exactly a bastion for freshness...<br /><br />Bottom Line:  They are alright and if your expectations are prepared before getting these you might be surprised.
