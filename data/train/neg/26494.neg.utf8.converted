My 10 year old husky doesn't go crazy when he smells it like he did with the Blue Buffalo food...<br /><br />The only reason I tried to switch him to do is because its a really great value, you basically get double the amount of cans for the same price, but I think I'll be going back to Blue Buffalo or maybe Wellness and just stick with them.<br /><br />On another note, I found the food filled with maggots one day, I havent had that issue with any other food, but I'm guessing it was just because it was a hot day and the food was left out.<br /><br />Also, i got the dry food with it, and I noticed when the food gets wet a bit from water or if the food gets a bit old, it has a really strong and bad odor...again I never noticed that with the other brands...
