Although I always make my own guacamole, I was in a hurry one time and saw this in the produce section so I thought I'd try it because I really like Chef Bayless and I thought it would save me some time.  I read the ingredients and everything looked great.  Although i don't normally add tomatillos, I thought why not because I generally like tomatillos in other things.  I mixed this with the avocados as instructed, tasted, and it just wasn't very good.  It lacked flavor; especially the flavors one normally tastes in traditional guacamole:  garlic, tomatoes, onion, and lime, to name a few.  It should be noted that some of these are listed in the ingredients list on this bottle.<br /><br />I ended up chopping up my own tomatoes, garlic, and onion, and basically everything else I normally do when making guacamole to "fix" the guac.  It actually took longer than if I had just made the guac like I normally do.
