My aussie mix acted like I was hurting her no matter how gentle I was applying this stuff for general cleaning of her healthy ears.  Noticing cinnamon leaf oil in the ingedients, I wondered if that might not be an uncomfortable thing to squirt on tender membranes. I tried a little on a q-tip in my own ear and YOW!!!!!<br /><br />It took copious rinsing with saline solution to stop the burn, which indeed felt just like I'd stuck one of those kid-treat cinnamon oil toothpicks in my ear.  I felt terrible for having inflicted it on my dog, and especially on the ears of my recently-deceased 21 year old cat, who didn't seem to enjoy the experience either.<br /><br />I wrote a detailed letter to Ark Naturals immediately, worried that this formula is out there being put in other animals' ears.  It has been over a month with no response whatsoever.  No matter what their response is, I think this is disgraceful and suspect.<br /><br />The ingredients claim to be human-quality -- I recommend testing it on yourself to see if you may be inadvertently hurting your pet. Mine is Lot #61180, FYI.
