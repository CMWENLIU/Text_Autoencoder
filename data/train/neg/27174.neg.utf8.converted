After reading the reviews you would have thought this was a great tasting product! Right? It's a step above a plain rice cake with a few mini chocolate chips! That's it! I read all the review and thought this was a no brainer and I purchased 4 boxes. I gave a few to my office associates and got their opinion too! When you open of package it smells like dark mocha. When you bite into it we thought it had no flavor and at best was like a plain rice cake!  One person thought it tasted like "dirt". And after thinking about it a while I agree! Dry texture and dry mocha flavor. Well, you be the judge. I think all the positive reviews were from those who have been locked up for a while and recently released or those who think rice cakes are delicious!!
