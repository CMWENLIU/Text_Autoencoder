I did get it for my baby girl announcement. Thinking I'll try it and will get 10 more boxes, if I like it. Good thing I ordered only one. The idea is great, but very ordinary milk chocolate taste. What i was even more surprised about - it was hallow inside!!! So I am giving 2 stars just for the idea of chocolate cigars instead of real cigars for your friends who don't smoke. But not 5 stars, because it is too expensive!!! I think the fair price would be at least $1 per 1 cigar in the box, but $12 per box of 4 or 5 plus shipping charge - sorry, I think it is too high, specially that it does not even have some kind of filling inside.
