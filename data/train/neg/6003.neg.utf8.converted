I didn't buy this expecting it to taste anything like peanut butter. All I wanted was peanut flavor. That's all. What I got was the single most awful thing I've ever eaten. I bought my jar from Sprouts, but they sell it in a lot of places. My local Albertson's stocks it. If you are hell-bent on trying it, at least don't pay for shipping. That way it hurts less when you throw it out.
