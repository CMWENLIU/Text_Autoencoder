So...the peanut butter chips are small flakes and virtually non-existent. If you didn't read the wrapper you wouldn't know it was peanut butter flavored AT ALL.<br /><br />The texture and size are both EXCELLENT but there is an after taste of chemically, diet food.<br /><br />I would recommend the pb vitamuffins/vitatops over this any day. Plus this is 1.5oz and the vitamuffins are a full 2oz...so bigger, better, and comparable in price.<br /><br />If you are a committed vitamuffin lover don't even think about branching out...not worth your money.
