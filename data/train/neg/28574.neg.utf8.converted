First of all, I normally go out of my way to write positive reviews and avoid negative ones, but this was SO bad I just had to check in. Imagine the BLANDEST chicken flavored Gerber's baby food and then add some water to it and call it soup. That's what this is. On the bright side though (being stuck with a case), I do have a great opportunity to experiment with some of those free Penzey's spice samples and use up some of the overabundance of summer veggies to make this stuff edible.
