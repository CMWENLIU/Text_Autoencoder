Just purchased it for my automatic espresso machine based on reviews on Amazon. First of all not a good bean for automatic machine too oily. Most importantly was absolutely horrid taste and would never buy the brand again. One thing it will do is jolt you if you want to stay up all night which might be the only reason i would drink it
