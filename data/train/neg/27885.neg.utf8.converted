I bought this in an attempt to replace high sugar organic juices with something naturally sweetened with Stevia.  My daughter and I both had one and were severely ill with diarrhea for two days.  She is 11 and was doubled over in pain.  I do not recommend this product for anyone.  I've talked to two other mothers who've tried this product and had similar issues.  Sobe should be ashamed promoting this product with a KNOWN side affect.
