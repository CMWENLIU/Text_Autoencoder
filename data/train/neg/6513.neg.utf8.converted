I downed a bottle of this in about two minutes, and man was I glad that I tried this at home. It gave me a feeling within minutes like I was in the Twilight Zone or some horrible nightmare. Like the walls were moving farther and farther away. This only lasted for about ten minutes then I actually started to feel stoned. It was like I smoked some illegal green herb and did a few shots of espresso on top of it. It was very nice for about an hour. Then the terrible part happened, the crash! It felt like I had a few glasses of wine and then took a short nap like a mild hangover. If you want to try it, try it at home! I am not messing with this stuff again.
