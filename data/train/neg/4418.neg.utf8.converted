I tried this spaghetti with the hopes that it would in some way resemble the wheat pasta I used to love to eat, but it doesn't even come close.  The taste is ricey and bland, and it falls apart despite following the cooking directions.  There are many good wf/gf pasta products out there these days, but this isn't one of them.
