Strongly horrible tasting.  I've been enjoying smoothies that are more than half greens (kale, chard, etc.) with chia and ground flaxseed thrown in - so it's not as if I demand 100% sweet - but this stuff, even at a quarter of the recommended dosage, takes "must be good for you" to a new level.  Or should I say "to a new low."
