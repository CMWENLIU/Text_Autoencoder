I obtained this product because we have cats and chipmunks that invade an area between our house and our shrubbery.<br /><br />The product is nicely packaged and easy to use.  I was concerned a bit about the warning label that suggested you contact a poison control center in case of contact with skin.  It was hard to believe it was that dangerous.  The coverage was also less than I would have thought for five pounds, but adequate for the job at hand.<br /><br />The material is granular with a not-unpleasant smell.  The smell was completely gone within a few hours of application.<br /><br />As a test, I set up a motion activated wildlife camera and recorded the area in question for about a week.  I saw cats every night (two different ones), chipmunks during the day and a few birds.  I then applied the product.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have photos of the same cats and chipmunks in the same area after the product was applied.  There did seem to be fewer chipmunk visits- but the cats continued apparently unaffected.  The birds were gone, but I wasn't worried about them.<br /><br />Could be I did something wrong (or that we have strange neighborhood cats) but the product did not work for me.
