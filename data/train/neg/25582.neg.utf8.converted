I don't usually write reviews, but I do read them... So I feel it necessary that you know that this taste nasty!  I chocked one down thinking I had to get use to it.  It does fill you up because it takes so long to chock down and you are drinking water to make it go down faster.  The reviews helped me make this purchase.  PLEASE NOTE that you CAN NOT return this item, so make sure you are ready for the not so wonderful taste....<br /><br />Best of luck.
