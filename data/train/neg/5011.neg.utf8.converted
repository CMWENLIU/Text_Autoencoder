I bought this because I'm grasping at straws. I was diagnosed with CLL (leukemia) in the latter half of 2010. Everyone that cares had all sorts of remedies to recommend. This was one of them. It, along with the other homeopathic remedies has done nothing to arrest the condition. My counts continue to rise (into abnormal range). Will it work for you? Some swear by this product as helpful. My suggestion: Buy three bottles. Take the recommended dosage "religiously" on a daily basis until you have completely depleted the supply. Have monthly blood tests. If you notice an improvement, bravo. If you don't, then you are only out about $20. Is your life worth that? I hope so.<br /><br />Update October 20, 2011: I finished all the product I had purchased and reordered 3 more boxes. I still have not realized any improvement, in fact, my last blood test came back the highest (worst) it has ever been, by a considerable leap. Still it is the ONLY thing I am doing with any consistency and it gives my wife a sense that I am not giving up on myself. However, personally, my results cannot testify in favor of this product.
