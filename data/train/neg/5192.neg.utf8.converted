I didn't like the Amish Red Popcorn at all.  98% of it did not pop in a hot air popper. What little that popped was too tough and almost tasteless.  I dumped it and bought Orville Redenbacher White Corn Gourmet. It was the kind of popcorn I love, and over 98% of it popped in the hot air popper.  I'll stick with Orville.
