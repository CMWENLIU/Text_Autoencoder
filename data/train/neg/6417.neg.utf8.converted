Other reviewers have already said that the Lindt-70% new recipe is terrible. I would like to add, that after reading the labels carefully, one can clearly see that the new Lindt is manufactured by an American company in New Hampshire, while the old one was manufactured in France and then distributed by that American company. What's pity! -- another great product has been ruined. The change of the recipe and of the production place must be related to the dollar weakness relative to the euro.
