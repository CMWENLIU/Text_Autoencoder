The this looks like a nice gift basket for the price.  It really isn't.<br /><br />The 4 food items are very small - 2oz of smoked salmon might be enough for one.  Fine.<br />But why is the cardboard wrap around it 4 times bigger than the foil packet inside?<br /><br />And the fish jerky - I kinda expected to be a free joke with our nice smoked salmon - but it is so fishy smelling I couldn't even take a bite.  He did and didn't go for another.<br /><br />The basket is nice but so full of hot-glued stuffing I cannot reuse it.  Twice as much trash as product.  Oh and all the products are hot-glued into place so trying to get anything out or off the stuffing took scissors.
