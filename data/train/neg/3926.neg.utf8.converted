I am used to ordering the nibs and grinding them myself.  The result is the richest chocolate flavore one can imagine!  This on the other hand left a gritty texture in the pudding I made and has a bitter flavor that could not be masked by even major amounts of sugar and very mild hint of chocolate.  First time ever my daughter said she didn't want her 'chocolate' pudding.
