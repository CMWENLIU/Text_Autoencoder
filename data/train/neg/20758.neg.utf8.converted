I took a chance on this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews that I read.  The package arrived within three days of ordering, and the coffee was sealed in a standard vacuum-sealed bag.  I opened the bag and noticed that the coffee smelled stale.  Normally fresh-roasted coffee has a certain "life" to the scent, but these beans smelled as if they had been on a shelf for a while.  I brewed the coffee and the flavor was similarly uninspiring.  The coffee was mellow, as expected, but the flavor was flat.  I have had high quality Kona in the past, and this sample is clearly inferior to my previous experience.<br /><br />This is the first time I have troubled to review a product sold by Amazon.  I have no previous experience with this coffee roaster, and since others found their coffee to be to their liking, it is possible that something went wrong with this particular batch.  I am pleased to report that Amazon has refunded me for this purchase.
