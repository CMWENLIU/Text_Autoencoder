We are really disappointed. We tried different ways to get the food done..at first smaller pieces then more time steaming but none of them worked out. Even when you cut the food in very small pieces it takes forever to get  it done. Now we are back to the old way and it takes even less time than baby brezza. Too bad we spent a good amount of money in something that it does work.
