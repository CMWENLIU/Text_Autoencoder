Do the maths: they advertise it as being $0.79/oz but it really is $0.985/oz (not including the price of shipping)...so you can get a better price about anywhere else.<br />Here's my math: 4-pack of 35oz formula / pack = 140oz formula total<br />The asking price: $137.96<br />So price per oz is: $137.96 / 140 = $0.985/oz.<br /><br />No need to mention I did not buy this product but I felt I should write a review because I was horrified by their "mistake".
