Picked the Rainforest blend up at a local big box wholesale club because price was almost $10 cheaper (for an 80-count box) than my favorite Green Mountain brand, Colombian Fair Trade. I have been drinking the Green Mountain Colombian for several years, love the smooth, yet full bodied flavor. These San Fransisco Coffee Company pods were bitter and strong tasting and left me with an acidic stomach condition which I hadn't experienced in years. I will be returning these and continue to use my Green Mountain Colombian Fair Trade k-cups. I had high hopes for these less expensive pods, but to me it is all about the taste and I don't like the taste, period!
