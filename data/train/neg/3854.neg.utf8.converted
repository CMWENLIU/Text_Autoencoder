<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CEX7DA">Spry Green Tea Xylitol Gum</a><br /><br />I purchased thie Spry Green Tea Xylitol Gum tub based on the 4+ start reviews, but I would not give it more than two stars because of the very weak flavor. Even when chewing two pieces at the same time, the flavor does not last more than 5 minutes. This is another example of an expensive Xylitol product that is not worth buying. I do not recommend this one.
