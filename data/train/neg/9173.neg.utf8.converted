I read all the POSITIVE reviews on this Miso soup before buying, and hoped it would somewhat compare with the soup I had gotten at the Japanese restaurant we frequented.  But, alas, I'm afraid it didn't come close.  I did like the sea weed and onion and would like to have had more onion in it.  The actual soup base itself is missing something; maybe fish sauce, soya, or SOMETHING, though it was salty enough. I am sorry to be a bum note in the feedback circle, but I AM a perfectionist when it comes to "taste".
