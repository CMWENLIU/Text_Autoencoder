Having already ordered directly from Cafe Britt, I jumped at the chance to order Cafe Britt product from Amazon thus saving shipping costs and even getting a break on the price. My experience dealing with Cafe Britt was great. I ordered the 2lb bag of whole bean Costa Rica Dark Roast coffee and loved it.  Wanting to try something different, I ordered 2 1lb bags of Tres Rios valdivia whole bean coffee THRU AMAZOM.COM. Upon opening the first bag I noticed a difference in quality that was quite apparent. I assumed it was probably because of the different type of coffee, and only after opening the second bag did I think of looking for a freshness date on the packaging. Now I ordered this coffee on July 30 and received it on August 3rd but the package has a freshness date of JUN 12(lot # 11173407).  So it appears as if AMAZON shipped me coffee that was way out of date. I know my local grocery store is not going to sell food that is out of date so why is AMAZON doing it?<br /><br />Second Entry(8/25/11)<br />Having spoken to a customer service rep at Amazon, I have been told my out-of-date product will be replaced at no cost. I appreciate this and must commend Amazon for their responsiveness to my complaint.
