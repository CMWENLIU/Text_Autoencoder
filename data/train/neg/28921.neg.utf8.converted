I should have saved my money, but curiosity got the best of me. I did not have great expectations for this product, but when it arrived, I was surprised to see how small the gumballs were,that when chewed became pretty small in the mouth. The flavor left something to be desired, as it had a smokey chemical taste to them which to me was not enjoyable. Perhaps it would be enjoyed by someone else. By the way I love bacon, but this was not bacon.
