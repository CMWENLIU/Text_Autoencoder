We were big fans of Midel graham crackers before we moved to Canada.  We couldn't find them here and so we were thrilled to find them on Amazon.  The ones we received from Amazon are quite different from what we were used to buying off the shelf in the States.  They are small squares, not regular graham cracker sizes, and as has been noted, they're all broken up, even the flimsy trays that hold the crackers are broken up.  Finally, down to our last 4 boxes, they've gone rancid from lack of being used and we can throw them out guilt-free.  Even though we're huge fans of Midel Graham Crackers we'll never buy these again.  Too bad.
