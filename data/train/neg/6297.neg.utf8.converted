We have an aussie-german shepherd mix and he does NOT tolerate this product at all.  He loved it, but it gave him a very bad case of diarrhea and he needed medical treatment several days after eating the<br /><br />"dingo" brand product.  I don't recommend this product or any "Dingo" product to anyone who has a dog with a senstive stomach AND it should state this on the label.
