I got the case of beans in the mail yesterday.  Today when I got a chance to open the box, every single can was dented.  The shrink wrapped case was placed in a bigger box and the shrink wrap had opened during shipment, but I don't think that all of the dents were because of this. The cans in the middle of the case were dented and had not come out of the shrink wrap.  I am going to write Amazon and Eden to see what they can do for me.
