I bought this item for use on an electronet type of fence.  When I turned it on (after charging it for three days like the instructions said) and my chicken stuck her head through the fence to peck at the other side, I knew it was not delivering the juice.<br />It may work well on a single wire type of fence, but it did not do the job on my elecronet fence.
