I have never cared for sweetened cereal as I was not raised on it. When I found Purely O's a few years ago I was happy to have found a cereal that did not contain sugar or corn products which I need to avoid because of a corn allergy.  I had intended to buy another box today. I took the time to read the label to make sure that nothing had changed. I could not believe that the ingredient list now lists CORN!  I am so angry!  Purely O's were my go-to breakfast when I needed a something quick or was in the mood for cereal.  There is nothing that this  company makes that I can now eat.  When will these people learn humans aren't pigs! Everything in a supermarket should not contain corn!  If I had wanted corny oat cereal I would have bought Cheerios.
