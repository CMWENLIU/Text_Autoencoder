We buy a lot of chocolate milk for our daughters and prefer organic, but switch between different brands to save money. I got a case of Organic Valley Lowfat Chocolate Milk with a 15% "Subscribe and Save" discount, which made the price reasonable. These cartons looked convenient to include in the girls' school lunches.<br /><br />So I did. Today.<br />Both our girls came home with one request: NEVER EVER pack this HORRIBLE milk again!<br /><br />I asked what was wrong, and the younger one (5 years old) said "it was just not yummy", while the nine year old proclaimed it "the worst chocolate milk she had ever tasted".<br /><br />So I tried one myself and, sadly, have to agree: it looks and tastes like dirty water, NOT milk and definitely NOT chocolate! In fact it was so bad, that I had to rinse my mouth thoroughly after taking one sip :(<br /><br />I'm not asking Amazon for a refund, since the product was delivered as advertized and the expiration date is 6 months from now. But I know for sure that I will never ever buy this again and will strongly recommend against it if you like the taste of REAL milk and REAL chocolate.
