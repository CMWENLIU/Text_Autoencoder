hey guess what! REAL peanut butter has only 200 calories per serving (2 tbsp) AND it doesn't have fake stuff in it. Do yourself a favor and get some natural peanut butter with no weird chemicals or dyes or fillers and just eat that. Then you don't have to worry about what all that weird stuff is doing inside your colon.
