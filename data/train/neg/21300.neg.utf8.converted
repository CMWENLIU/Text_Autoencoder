I looked at these at a different website where they showed the nutritional value ... it is pretty high carbs for a small drink.  I'll just keep using the packets I get from the store that come sugar-free.  I love the ease of kcups but just can't afford all those carbs ... crossing fingers they make SF apple cider kcups!
