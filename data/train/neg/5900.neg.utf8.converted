I have used stevia for a few years without ill effects. I was surprised when trying this product recently that I started to get this extremely restless sort of insomnia a few days after I started drinking this product daily. I have had this symptom before from other diet sodas, but I was surprised that Zevia, presumably just stevia, would also cause this.<br />Finally I scrutinized the ingredients and discovered Erythritol, a sweetener with a less than a good reputation. Another neurotoxin to add to my do not consume list.<br />My annoyance with Zevia is the way the packaging touts the stevia, and fails to mention the use of another artificial sweetener. I do read ingredient lists but didn't recognize the chemical name, thinking it may have been a colorant. I am not a chemist obviously, and the manufacturer's marketing of this product borders on deception.<br />It is also interesting to note that this is the same combo of chemicals used by Truvia, again with the emphasis on the more natural compound (Reb A derived from plant stevia). I am suspicious of the fact that "official" sites for these resultant products, and many medical sites, won't discuss some of the symptoms that many people are reporting through less official channels. However, almost every site specifically about insomnia that interacts with the public does list all the artificial sweeteners as a likely hidden cause of insomnia. There are other adverse side effects as well, and I wouldn't presume to know which are more common. I hope someone is studying this. The manufacturers appear to be content in ignoring these symptoms, as long as a significant number of folks don't experience it in there short term trials. We need a stronger FDA, undoubtedly.<br />Buyer Beware!<br />(btw, liquid stevia extracts that are available in different flavors, are really delicious in sparkling waters.)
