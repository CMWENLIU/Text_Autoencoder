Don't buy this food if you are looking for the primary ingredient to be meat.  The ingredients list on the product page on Amazon says "Chicken, Turkey, Chicken Meal, Ocean Fish Meal" before any grains are listed.  This is wrong.  The package as well as Chicken Soup website list it this way "Whole Grain Brown Rice, Chicken, Turkey, Chicken Meal, Turkey Meal"  While it's possible that it may still contain enough meat, I still don't trust that it does.  Any dog food you buy should contain 1 or 2 (Meat)meal ingredients before any grains are listed.  If it doesn't say "meal" after the meat, it means the meat weight was measured before the meat was dehydrated.  If it says "meal" after the meat, the weight was measured after the meat was dehydrated.  Therefore, "meals" constitute more meat in the product composition than meats listed without meal after them.<br /><br />From the ingredients list on Amazon for this product, I expected the meats included were less fatty, hence the "light" description.  This is not entirely the case.  They have reduced the meat and upped the grain in this formula.  Either get the regular version of the Chicken Soup food or consider another food.  For more info on dog foods, google "Dog Food Analysis".  Some good budget friendly alternatives that are better and cheaper than this product are the Diamond Naturals dog foods.  Amazon carries these foods as well.  Search for "Diamond Naturals (meat here) and Rice"  They have chicken, lamb, and beef varieties.  Also, Diamond Naturals makes the Chicken Soup line of foods, but they are typically cheaper.  Just some food for thought.
