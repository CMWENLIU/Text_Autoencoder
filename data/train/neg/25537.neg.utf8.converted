I am a subscribe and save Orville Redenbacher Ultimate butter customer which is fabulous. BUT- amazon sent me this instead this month. Why? Who knows?  I guess it must be defective, because it does not pop very much corn and you ate left with a greasy mess. It is inedible! It is being returned Do not buy!
