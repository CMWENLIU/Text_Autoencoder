Disappointed in the receipt of this product. This box was so damaged it lost the box it was mailed in and was leaking from several cans of the product. This was the worst I have ever received a product over the 10 plus years I have been ordering on line. I lost 3 cans of monster because of the damage and will never order this product through the mail again. The product is heavy so sending it back was more expensive then just keeping the damaged product.only had a picture (no video)or would show damaged product.
