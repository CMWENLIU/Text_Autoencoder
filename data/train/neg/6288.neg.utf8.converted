Locorice even in small amounts raises my blood pressure to dangerous levels. My doctor began to have problems regulating my high blood pressure soon after beginning to drink Stash teas, which (almost all) I discovered contain licorice.<br /><br />I recommend either that Stash remove licorice from their teas or they carry a warning label for persons with high blood pressure be aware.
