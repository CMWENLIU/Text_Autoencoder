the product is fine, but whomever tries to ship this must be also milking the cows then putting the milk out in the sun waiting for the milk to become powder...(and it must be raining)...the stuff just never seems to come.  don't order here.  you'll waste tons of money buying it by the can at the coop and your drug store while you wait forever for it to come... but all the waiting might be a good thing... you might realize like I have that is really quite a nice and a good thing to shop local.
