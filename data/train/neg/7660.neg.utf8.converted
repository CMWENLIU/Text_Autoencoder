I bought these because I love Haribo gummy products.  However, I was disappointed to see that they are made by Haribo France, i.e. not really German Haribo.  And believe me, there is a HUGE difference.  These ones are very, very greasy, not soft and have almost no strawberry flavor.  Don't waste your money!
