This is my first experience ordering kefir grains and growing them.  It seemed to me that<br />the shipping and handling charge were rather high for such a small amount (size of a<br />walnut or less.)  Also the directions should have come with the grains - not 6 days later<br />via email. Why so much later?  By then I had already handled them following directions<br />from my son who had recommended a source for them.  So, I was not pleased.<br />Carolyn Hocker, Newville, PA.
