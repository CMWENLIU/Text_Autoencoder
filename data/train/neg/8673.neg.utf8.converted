My local Italian restaurant knows I'm low carb, so the chef was excited to tell me they found a great low carb pasta. I was quite excited too - he had purchased this brand, it was very good.<br /><br />BUT ... I went online to order it for myself, and actually read the nutritional count. It's NOT low carb. In fact, it's HIGHER carbs than many mainstream whole grain pastas!<br /><br />I checked the supermarket shelf - you don't even have to go to the health food isle to find lower carbs than this. The General Mills, Kraft, Barilla, even Trader Joe's whole grain pastas (starting at $0.99 cents per box) have on average 17.5 carbs (less 1.5 fiber = 16 net carbs).<br /><br />To be fair, the "CarbNada" brand has a generous portion size - 1.5 cups. I would probably not eat more than 1 cup at a time, so my serving size would be 12 net carbs. But still, the Atkins brand has half the carbs compared to this! (usually 4-8 net carbs per serving).<br /><br />My suggested alternatives:<br /><br />* Atkins has a few pastas that start at 4 net carbs. I will not eat a packaged pasta that's higher than 5 or 6 net carbs.<br /><br />* Use julienned zucchini or squash instead of pasta - use it raw (soaked in olive oil for a few minutes), cook it (like mac & cheese), or lightly steam it in the microwave or in a steamer. It's much much healthier than packaged/processed pasta anyway, and almost zero net carbs. (You might want to skin it first)<br /><br />* The best veggie to use for pasta is cucazza. You must always skin cucazza, then run it through a mandolin slicer on the julienne setting. Seriously, this takes 20 seconds.<br /><br />* And, the BEST low carb pasta I've ever had is made from kelp - dehydrated kelp noodles. This one is not found in most stores, but you can find it online. Kelp is one of the best foods you should be eating, low carb or not. High in protein, high in minerals/vitamins/nutrients, and very low carbs (about 1 net carb), and nearly zero glycemic index. Plus, the noodles don't have to be boiled - just put in warm water for about 60 seconds. And they work with everything.<br /><br />* Keep looking for other brands. They're out there. The best low carb breads and pastas are made from flax seeds. If you like the refined flour, light & fluffy breads & pastas, the best brands use a combination of soy isolate + almond flour &/or flax.<br /><br />Bottom line: I believe this company's product labeling is opportunistic & slightly disingenuous. There are much better alternatives.
