There is nothing special about this side dish. There is a  hint of tomato, a hint of some other spices and a very vague ting of heat.<br /><br />The dish is VERY easy to prepare but there is nothing special about it nor anything terribly wrong either. There are no "off-tastes" - really there is not much taste - period.<br /><br />I'm afraid bland says it all. To call this dish "Mexican" seems terribly wrong. Rather customers should think of it as a fast cooking rice with a hint of tomato and a hint of red pepper.<br /><br />At the right price I'd recommend these Lipton/Knorr side dishes. They are extremely easy to prepare, have no off tastes -- yet they are not stellar.<br /><br />My favorites in the Lipton/Knorr family are the Teriyaki Rice and the Stroganoff and Alfredo noodles.
