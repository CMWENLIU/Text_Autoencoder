My now 6 year old Chihuahua ate Cesar dog food for quite a while and seemed to really like it. But I got so tired of picking out BIG blood vessels that I couldn't stand to feed it to her anymore. The listed ingredients didn't help either so I switched to a healthier brand of dog food. I just couldn't get over those blood vessels and it is quite pricey for such a little can, especially not having better ingredients.
