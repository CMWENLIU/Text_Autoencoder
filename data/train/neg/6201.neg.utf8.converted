I bought six pasty meat pies for $34.94. It took a really long time for them to fill the order and when they did I was charged $40.00 for shipping. I can't beleive that shipping was more than the item. The instructions said to keep frozen until ready to eat, but the pies arrived thawed. I don't know if it is safe or not, but after paying $75.00 for six little pies I'm going to refreeze them and risk eating them. This is my first dissapointment with something I bought on Amazon. Thumbs down.
