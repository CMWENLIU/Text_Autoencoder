I went into the grocery store (Sobeys - in Canada) looking for McCann's 5 minute Steel Cut Oats (which I absolutely LOVE). Unfortunately the store didn't carry this variety, so I opted for this type. I was SO disappointed. I put it in the microwave covered in cold skim milk for about a minute, and when I took it out, it was MUSH! I can still eat Quaker Oats when they're mushy, but this just had an awful taste. Even though the cooking instructions said to cook them longer, even the 1 minute made them sooo mushy! I for one love the chewy bite of steel cut oats, and am able to achieve a close enough mouth-feel with Quaker 5 minute oats (I microwave the oats with half water/half skim milk for about 2 minutes). I advise fellow steel-cut oat lovers to stay away from this one! Trust me! I eat oatmeal everyday for breakfast, and sometimes before my workout in the evening, and as a bedtime snack at night.... so needless to say, I know my oats! Lol<br /><br />Verdict: Go for the 5 minute Steel Cut oats by McCanns - its AMAZING... Steer cleer of this quick cooking variety, and opt for Quaker 5 minute Oats instead!
