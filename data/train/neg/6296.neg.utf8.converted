I tried this blend for the value. It wasn't rank, but it wasn't great...nor did it taste like Kona. My biggest concern is their labeling this as "Kona," when it's really not. Apparently it has some Kona beans in there, but nowhere do they state how much. Online they say their blend is "private." I get the notion that we have a sort of Cracker Jack situation here, with a package full 'o cheap beans and a single little Kona bean waaaaaaaaayyyyyyy down in the bottom like a toy prize.<br /><br />I would give this coffee 2.5 stars based solely on taste and dollar value (compared to plain coffee). I drop it to one star because I don't like companies scamming me. If they want to use a luxury name like Kona, they absolutely need to disclose how much is in there. Ask yourself...does a corporation use a name like Kona and mix it with inferior beans because they want to offer Kona taste at a fair price to you, or is it more likely they're using the Kona name to get more money per pound for the 95%+ other, cheaper beans in the mix? I'm no cynic, but...<br /><br />I would not pay $60,000 for a Ford Taurus with 2% BMW parts...I would not pay $1,000 for a Senseo just because it has a Rancilio drip tray...I would not pay $30 per lb for prosciutto that was mostly Safeway deli ham. Why would I pay anything for a coffee that is some unknown percent Kona and the rest beans they got from a pickup on the side of the road?
