Product says "duck wraps rawhide treats", sounds great, right? well this is the sorriest dog treat I have ever purchased, and I have purchased a lot of them.  First, there is no duck, the item is coated with some brown crusty dyed-on stuff, looks like it is painted on.  Then the so-called rawhide is more like a 3 by 4 inch piece of cardboard, folded into thirds.  I know cardboard when I see it!  My dog likes to lick the brown stuff off, but then nothing.  And he even likes cardboard!! don't waste your money.
