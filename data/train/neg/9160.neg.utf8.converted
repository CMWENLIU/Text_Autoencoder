Warning - do not buy these for your cat. They are a major choking hazard. I narrowly averted disaster when my cat chewed off an eraser sized piece about 30 seconds into gnawing on this stick. The piece was hard and not easily chewed or ground up. In other words, it's not like food, but more like the consistency of a hard piece of wax. He would have choked on it if I hadn't quickly taken it out of his mouth. I threw the rest of the package away.<br /><br />I thought these were chew toys and they dissolved like rawhide (or not at all). I did not expect them to break off into pieces that could be choked on. I am horrified that these are being marketed and sold for pets. Amazon shame on you for carrying this product.
