I bought these in hopes that my kids would like to eat them on their way out the door.  So dissapointing!  These are so gross!  I can barely even tolerate them.  We eat so healthy so it is not that we aren't used to healthy good food.  WE always eat whole wheat and we are always eating fruits and Vegi's.  You all can't say that it is because we aren't used to healthy eating.  Now, back to the cookies...they just are gross. I don't know what else to say, they are dry and tasteless discs comparable to cardboard.  So very bummed out that they aren't what we were hoping for.  Back to granola bars I guess.  :( O and just cause it says cookies does not mean it is good.
