My issue with this product is that not all the jars have the same texture and consistency, what makes me wonder, some are fresh, and some are not... some jars had the spinach smooth, some other jars had it dry and "stiff". I want to make sure that what I give to my baby is good and fresh. This product did not convinced me 100%. I have to say I am happy with the squash, peas, among others.
