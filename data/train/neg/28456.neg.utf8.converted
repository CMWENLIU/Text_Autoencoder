After receiving my order of 4 boxes (trying to quit smoking), I am sad to report that I am greatly disappoipnted.  These toothppicks ahve no cinnamon flavor at all.  I can remember eating these as a kid and they would burn your mouth.  Don't have to worry about that with these.  Went on line and ordered some cinnamon oil to soak these in so that there will be some taste to them!
