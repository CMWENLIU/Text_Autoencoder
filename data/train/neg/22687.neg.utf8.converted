I've been a consumer of natural peanut butters "forever" & am familiar with its ingredients. That's why I felt confident ordering JIF, a name brand online. HOWEVER, the ingredients really need to be listed on Amazon. This natural peanut butter has molasses & palm oil in it. Palm oil I'd seen before & do limit intake of it but for a bulk "emergency" type food, I was willing to allow it. This JIF is listed as "no stir" so I figured palm oil was an ingredient.<br />The molasses was a new 'trick" to me. Several of my family are allergic to calcium & can't tolerate JIF's 2%Ca , a result of the molasses. So now I'm making a donation to the local homeless shelter instead of to my family's emergency stock. Even though we're "Prime " Amazoners ,I'm not returning it because I have a feeling Amazon will say the return's not their fault & the shipping would be ginormous due to the weight. Since the ingredients are listed on the individual jars, the shelter can make informed use of it.
