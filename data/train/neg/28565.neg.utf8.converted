I *love* goji berries and planned to use these for smoothies. I've eaten goji berries frequently in oatmeal, muffins, etc, as I used to purchase them from a bulk bin at my local health food store in CA. I moved, though, and needed to find a new source. I thought these would be a good deal b/c of the awesome price, but they are TERRIBLE tasting--for one, they're so hard (they're sundried) that it hurt my teeth to try to chew them. Then, when I did eat a few, they had such a bizarre, chemical-ish  taste (they tasted kind of like the way melting plastic smells), that I became concerned and decided to throw them away rather than eat them. Amazon does not allow returns for this item (grocery). They were nice enough to give me a refund (unexpected!). Sadly, these are in the trash, and I will not be purchasing them again.<br /><br />Added on Jan 30, 2011: If you read the reviews on this product carefully, you'll notice that many of the 4 and 5 star reviews sound like they were written by people responding to a Mechanical Turk assignment asking them to review the product. Most of the 4 and 5 star reviews don't say that the reviewer has actually purchased the product--they just contain general, positive info about goji berries.
