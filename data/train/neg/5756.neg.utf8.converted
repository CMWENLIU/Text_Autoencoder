The culture I received was apparently dead.  Followed the directions to the letter and never got any activation of the starter at all.  It stayed silent in the bottom of the container for almost 2 weeks - no bubbles, nothing.  I finally threw it out after wasting a significant amount of flour feeding it every day per the instructions.<br /><br />Others have had better luck, so I may have simply got a bad packet.
