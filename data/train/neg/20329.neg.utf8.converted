I love the taste of Bulls-Eye!  I found out that I was on my last bottle of the 'original'  - I like the other flavors as well - so I went by my local grocery, and I don't know why I looked on the ingredient list, but there at the top of the list, the main ingredient was High Fructose Corn Syrup!  I was shocked.  Didn't buy it of course, because besides the taste, I also love that I don't have to eat HFCS. I then checked the bottle I had at home.  Unbelievably, my older bottle had no HFCS in it at all.  So I'm savoring it for as long as I can until I can find a suitable replacement.  What genius at the company took a ridiculously fantastic product and decided to ruin it?!  Almost every BBQ sauce out there has HFCS in it, which is why I was so happy when I found Bull's-Eye.  If you love Bull's-Eye as much as I do, please let the company know how much you enjoyed their original non-HFCS formula.<br /><br />Bullseye originally didn't use HFCS so....<br /><br />I wrote a note to Kraft extolling the virtues of their great decision to keep HFCS out of their sauce.<br />Well, I got a note back saying this:<br /><br />Thank you for visiting [...]<br /><br />The formulation of BULL'S-EYE Original Barbecue Sauce has indeed changed and I'm sorry you were disappointed with your most recent purchase.

That will give me time to find a new bbq sauce.  You'd think Kraft would be smart enough to charge more for the HFCS-free sauce for the folks who really want it, instead of loosing us as customers altogether.
