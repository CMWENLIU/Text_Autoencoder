after you get used to the texture and smell, conceptually the product is great but- FOR ME- the burdens outweigh any benefits when you can't move because digestion (bathroom, bloating, gas, and paiiinnnn in the stomach all over) is such an issue. 300Lb gorilla sitting a top your chest and stomach....It seemed to be this brand in particular for me but all of them seem to have the same ingredients except the Tofu Shirataki which has tofu in it and I seemed to be able to stomach better.<br /><br />It may just be me, but boy- I just cannot eat these
