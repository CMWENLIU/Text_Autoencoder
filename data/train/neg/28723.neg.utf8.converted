This product was a horrible experience. First of all it taste terrible, but I could over look that if it worked. It may wake some people up but it also makes you feel absolutely sick.  I became horribly ill after. I was very very tired, but couldn't sleep. I had horrible hot flashes until I wanted to crawl outside and lay in the snow. I was so dizzy I could barely walk.  I tossed and turned in bed for  12 hours! Then when I woke up the next day it was like I'd been drugged.  I was too out of it to even drive my daughter to school.  If my mom hadn't been there I don't know what I would have done because I could not function the night before. In the morning I was irritable beyond belief and horribly sick to my stomach.  I am not a person who is sensitive to medications or vitamins.  I called a friend of mine who I knew had taken it and he told me that he took for for a while and then one day the exact same thing happened to him.  He was so hot he took a cold shower but was so dizzy he fell!  This stuff has not been looked over by the fda (not that they do such a great job) and they do not have potential side effects listed. So just beware!
