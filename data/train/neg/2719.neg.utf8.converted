I've been purchasing Sunbutter for several years for my son who has peanut and tree-nut allergies.  I purchased the organic Sunbutter the other day and did not realize it DOES NOT contain sugar, so it is bitter.  It is probably fine for a Sunbutter and Jelly sandwich, but any other uses ( with crackers) the bitterness makes in unedible.  I already ordered the Creamy Sunbutter again.
