This is one of the WORST k-cup coffee varieties I have tried. I have been enjoying Tully's Italian Roast, but something is messsed up with the pricing on Amazon (like: it is twice the price I paid for it last time!) So, I figured I would try the Timothy's instead. What a mistake!!!  It is bitter, weak and truly disgusting. I wouldn't subject my worst enemy to this one.
