My husband & I have been on a tight budget & miss our "good" coffee(Starbucks.)  We've been drinking Folgers.  When I saw this deal I figured how bad could it be?  Honestly, I would rather drink our Folgers.  This coffee was so weak that we had to add an extra scoop of grinds.  I can't believe this stuff has good reviews.
