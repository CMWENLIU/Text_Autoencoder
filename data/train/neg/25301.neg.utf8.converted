Was so excited to see Cappuccino Cups offered by Amazon....after one sip of this stuff I knew that something was wrong.  It would have been very helpful for there to have been a warning on the box that it contained sucrolose...which is a substance that I do not wish to put into my body.  Very disappointed in this product.
