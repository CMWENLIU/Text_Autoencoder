I bought these and the private reserve diamond expecting superior coffee because of the price. That wasn't the case. I believe there are better pods at much much lower cost. Other pod makers have kona blends that seem to have more flavor. Obviously it is very subjective to rate a coffee but I would not buy Aloha Island pods again. I have bought other pods from other companies and have enjoyed them much more.
