Be warned:  Shipping is very expensive (at least $18).  This is not indicated anywhere.  You will be much better off trying to find a store that carries them.<br /><br />As to the noodles, they were OK.  I tried them in a dish with a pesto-based sauce and shrimp.  They don't taste too bad, but they didn't hold the sauce like pasta would.  All the sauce slid down to the plate.  They might work better in a different dish.
