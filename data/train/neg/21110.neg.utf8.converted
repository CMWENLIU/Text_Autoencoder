I love Guayaki's original, but I'm not a huge fan of the chai spice mate.  I bought it, because I love chai and I love mate...not a great combination.  Something about the sweeter kick with this one doesn't work for me.  I usually drink two cups per tea bag, and the second one goes down a lot smoother.  Maybe I just need to dilute the first a bit mote.
