Please note that Sweet 'n Low sugar free frostings are "sugar free." However, if you're diabetic, you are going to ingest something that has a higher impact on raising your blood glucose than does a regular sugared frosting! Maltodextrin is the first ingredient listed on Sweet 'n Low frostings. Athletes use maltodextrin in energy drinks and foods to give them a *BURST* of glucose. My diabetic family members' postprandial glucometer readings were incredibly high after eating this. I've written the company about the impact of their product & to stop touting it as a "must for diabetics," but they never responded. PLEASE, please, please realize that if you're a diabetic, eating maltodextrin is worse than eating sugar as it has a quick, rising impact on blood sugar--unhealthy for diabetics. It's your job as a consumer to be informed. I hope this helps diabetics out there who are enjoying this product not testing afterwards to see their blood glucose skyrocket.
