The dried figs arrived today packed in a box within a box arrangement and still some of the bags were broken open and the figs were loose in the box.  All the packages were marked with a 11/23/11 date and notice this order was placed in March of 2012!! All the loose figs in the box were inedible.<br /><br />Only one bag in the shipment appears to have decent looking dried figs but most have  tiny, dry, disgusting, dark brown blobs that don't look like anything anyone would think of eating!!  Many of the packages should have been thrown out rather than marketed to a customer.<br /><br />This is an unbelievably bad product.  Shame on this company for wasting all of our time and money!!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F498UY">Melissa's Dried Calimyrna Figs, 3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>
