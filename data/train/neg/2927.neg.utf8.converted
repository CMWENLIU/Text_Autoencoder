I read the positive reviews and I really liked the price so I ordered these rawhide chips. My yellow Labrador Retriever weighs 80 lbs and daily gets a rawhide chip (primarily Walmart generic brand) as a treat in the evening for years.  My Lab will eat everything in sight (including socks) and never has stomach problems. After giving him only four rawhide chips in two days, my Lab developed a severe case of diarrhea and he's still sick after four days.  He is an inside dog which makes it a real problem since he needs to go out hourly to do his business. Plus he's not feeling well and just lies around. I called the vet right away, and he recommended some immodium-type medication short term only. Since his appetite is fine and he isn't throwing up and he isn't getting any worse, his vet and I think he will be fine.  The vet advised me to throw away the rest of the rawhide which I have done.  I called Amazon.com and my money was cheerfully refunded which I greatly appreciate since I used the refund to buy the immodium medication.<br /><br />This is just a warning to make sure you only give your dog one bone chip at a time and wait a day or so to make sure he can tolerate it.  I don't know why these rawhides made my dog so sick but it could have been just a problem with this batch. I won't be buying this product again but I will definitely continue to buy from Amazon.com
