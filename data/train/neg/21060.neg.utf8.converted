Oh my goodness, this was bought for us as a housewarming present for our new Kuerig machine.. I ended up having to stab open the K-cups and put half a teaspoon into the bottom of a regular coffee for it to seem anything like a cappucino and for it to be even remotely drinkable.. I feel like energy drinks would give me less of a sugar high than one of these!!
