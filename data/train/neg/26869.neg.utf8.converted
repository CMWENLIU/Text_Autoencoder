Received a flat of this product on a subscription. I was hoping to save money by buying in bulk and was looking forward to the  convenience of having the product shipped on a scheduled basis.<br /><br />The very first carton I opened contained a thick and lumpy fluid. It did not smell bad or have a distinct taste - it just was not what I expected to come out of a carton that should have contained soy milk. Yes I did shake the carton well before opening it.<br /><br />The second carton was fine.<br /><br />The bottom line is that the loss of one carton from the flat eliminates the whole value proposition of buying in bulk and on-line. I would avoid this brand.<br /><br />Update: Score so far for the pack of 12: 3 bad 8 good. One more to go!
