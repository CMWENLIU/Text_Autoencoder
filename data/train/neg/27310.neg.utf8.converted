I feel like I have a pretty good palette for Indian food, especially curry. While I'm no means an expert, I lived in London for awhile and sampled some of the best curry while also knowing you can find great flavors in local spots in metropolitan cities.<br /><br />As such and now that I'm back in a suburb, I really just wanted something that would satisfy my craving for a Tikka Masala-type curry that I can throw veggies and chicken into.<br /><br />This isn't it. While it's not horrible, there just isn't much flavor. There seems to be a lack of cocunut milk to give it a hint of sweetness and the cloves that are usually added to balance out the colors seems watered down. I say skip.
