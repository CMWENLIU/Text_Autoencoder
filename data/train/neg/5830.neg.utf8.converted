The gumballs are fine.  Not a lot you can do to a gumball.  However, the customer service and shipping process for the Candy Depot is totally inept.  First, I received an email that my orders had been cancelled.  No explanation, just cancelled.  When I emailed to inquire what was going on, I got an email back saying that the items were being shipped by a quicker service, so I could receive the gumballs in time for Christmas (to go with the gumball machine that I purchased as a gift).  Great!  Then, two days later, I get an email from Amazon stating that my gumballs had shipped on that day, the 22nd, and not on the 18th, the date the Candy Depot stated they had shipped the item.  So, on Christmas day, there will be a gumball machine, but no gumballs.  Of course, if the Candy Depot had been honest, or at least not totally incompetitent, I could have gone out locally and gotten some.  But, alas, too late.  By the way, when I got the Amazon shipment notification, I again emailed The Candy Depot to ask what was going on, forwarding to them their email stating they had shipped on the 18th and asking what was going on.  Surprise, no response.  I suggest you get your gumballs locally or from someone other than the Candy Depot, unless you don't care when you get them (a week or so).
