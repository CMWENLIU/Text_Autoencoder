I bought it since it's the only organic green I found. But when I read the label, it says: "produced in a facility that processes milk, soy and wheat". My son is allergic to milk and I thought I got something nice for. NO. Have to throw them instead. So be ware, if your kids is allergic to milk or soy or wheat, don't buy this product.
