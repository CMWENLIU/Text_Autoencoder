I bought these to try out based on good Amazon reviews which made them sound like some kind of wonder bars that were healthy and would make you happy for eternity (or something). I bought two flavors of these kind bars to try out. One was borderline gross the other decent. Here's the thing though: these are overpriced and not healthy. Let me explain:<br /><br />These are marketed for people are paranoid about what they eat. It's marketed to the same people who buy organic milk, produce and always look for things like "gluten free" etc. Most of this product is marketing and selling an image. I'm sure this is free of whatever they think at the moment might harm you. You might get the impression then from their advertisements that these are healthy. They're not. They may be gluten free but they're high in sugar and calories. Despite having so much sugar and carbs you can't even taste it. One of these bars is ~200 calories and is almost completely carbs (and some fat).<br /><br />In addition, if you calculate it out, it's more than a dollar per bar. You could buy the ingredients for these bars and put them together without the sugar and it would be much more tasty and healthy. Just save yourself the money and buy the ingredients.<br /><br />Bottom line: These are just overpriced, unhealthy (but not tasty) snack bars whose strongest selling point is the attractive packaging and feel good marketing. It's amazing how much they cost too. I'm guessing it's mostly in the packaging and marketing.
