Sorry, but it does not pass my taste test. I've always liked the Haribo brand gummies, but the Albanese brand just does not cut it. The peach flavor of these gummies is the wrong type, in addition it is not sour enough (not sour at all for my taste). I wish the company can send me some citric acid to add to these gummies.
