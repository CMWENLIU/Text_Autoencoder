At the risk of sounding repetitive I too bought this under the assumption that it was blanched almond meal. I read the  product description before buying this product and it did not contain any information about other ingredients besides almond or I would not have ordered it. I am sure if you are looking for something that is simply gluten free that this is a lovely product, but if you like me are trying to avoid all grains this is not for you. Also I am a little annoyed that now I can not return it because it is a  grocery item.
