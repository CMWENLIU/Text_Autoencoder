I was lucky to stock up on the canisters last summer.  Now I have just three left.  I've written and called the company several times.  They don't listen well.  What a pity, this is wonderful coffee, but the sticks are too small and wasteful.<br /><br />I started a Facebook group for fans of the canisters who want to show their numbers, and hopefully get the company's attention.<br /><br />Amazon disallowed my first review with a link to the group.  If you're interested, just Search for "Nescafe" in Facebook.  You'll see it: "Please Bring Back Nescafe 6.1oz Canisters."
