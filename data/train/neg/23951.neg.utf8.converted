I have been round and round a bit on this.  This item and UPC are for the CLASSIC Caramel flavor from Torani.  It is terrible.  Don't get this confused with the regular/plain Caramel flavor from Torani, which is fabulous.  Make sure you note they are DIFFERENT products.<br /><br />Amazon created this Classic Caramel page based on the Caramel page, then renamed the old page to Classic Caramel as well, which is a confusing mess.  You need to ignore the reviews on the other page as they are for a different product.  The UPC 089036241397 is for Classic Caramel.  The UPC 089036241434 is for regular Caramel.  Amazon, incorrectly, kept references to Caramel on this page.  It is not!<br /><br />The taste difference between the two is shocking.  This one tastes like turpentine-soaked shoe leather.  In fact, I spit out my first cafe lattes based on this thinking it was spoiled/rotten.<br /><br />Finally, note that Amazon does not allow returns of grocery items, so be sure you like CLASSIC Caramel before you are stuck with 3 bottles of the stuff.
