I had powered matcha tea at my local coffee shop and this was nothing like what I expected.  It tasted quite a bit like seaweed. I managed to drink a little of this but it needed much doctoring.  It became tolerable if I added sugar, ginger and milk. It also did not dissolve well even when I used my hand held blender.  I would not recommend it unless you are creative with adapting seaweed for other uses.
