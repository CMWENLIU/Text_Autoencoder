We bought this cereal along with several others by Nature's Path, a company that makes some pretty good cereals.  The taste this one however seems to be quite bland.  That in itself would not be an issue, however it contains 210 calories for the standard serving size of 55g (3.8 calories per gram), which is a lot.  Especially when Cinnamon Toast Crunch contains 4.2 calories per gram (only 10% more) and tastes like candy.  If you mix those two together it's alright, and the result is good taste plus fiber.
