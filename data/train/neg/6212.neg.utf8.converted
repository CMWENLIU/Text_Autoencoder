I bought this based on the reviews and I gotta tell you that I was extremely disappointed in the results of this product based on the reviews.  We did not notice little if any change in the taste of things.  I bought "Extremely Sour Candies" from an other vendor to this these with and noticed nothing sweet abou them.  I order 3 packs to give to all my family.  I was so excited to finally get them and the candy.  It was the biggest let down I have experienced in a long time.  So much so that I have ordered from Amazon quite a bit over the years and this is the first review I have written.  The product was that bad.  It left a coating of this candy taste nn my mouth.  The taste turned putrid after about an hour and I had to brush my tongue to get rid of the taste.  This product is not at all what it was advertised to be.  Just a poor gimmick.
