Candy Express sent me cheap no-name knock-offs of the actual Joyva brand which is the brand I wanted. This no-name (no logo on package) stuff they sent doesn't taste as good either. I'm VERY disappointed, I will be reporting them to Amazon for ripping me off as this is false advertising. BEWARE do NOT deal with Candy Express. I will have to buy them locally I guess.
