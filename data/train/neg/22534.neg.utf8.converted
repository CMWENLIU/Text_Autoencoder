I waited with baited breath for the larger packs of the Pumpkin Spice to come and I preordered the minute I saw it... But this; this is NOT the same Pumpkin Spice coffee that I am used to drinking from Green Mountain. This is a WEAK WATERED DOWN Pumpkin Spice and I AM NOT HAPPY... I will NOT order this again. I will NOT recommend this purchasing option.
