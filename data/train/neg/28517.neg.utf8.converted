After reading the reviews, I thought I would give this a try.  I cannot tolerate aspartame, gives me horrible headaches, Splenda too and I can't stand the taste of saccharin.  I had such high hopes.<br /><br />This stuff is very difficult to dissolve, even in warm liquid and stirring.  The only way I can describe the taste is - chemical causing my taste buds to think it is sweet. Yes, it is very sweet - for the initial taste, then all I get is a chemical aftertaste.  I used one dot, and have given away the rest.<br /><br />I have only used it as a sweetener in iced tea, haven't tried using it any other way.  I will just revert to unsweetened tea.  I would rather go without than deal with this very artificial sweetener.
