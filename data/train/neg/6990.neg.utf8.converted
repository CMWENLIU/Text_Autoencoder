this company has some nerve!!! their discription is full of no chemicals or pesticides...all organic...vegan...blah, blah, blah....i have used this product for months!!! only to realize after a google search, that "yeast extract" is indeed a flavor enhancer, aka, MSG!!! this company made false promises to consumers that believe that they are buying a "healthy" product....how disgusting!!
