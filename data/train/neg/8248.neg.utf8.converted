I bought a case of this mushroom broth based on the 2 positive reviews, but I do believe now that those aren't real reviews. They were probably written by someone hired by the seller to induce people to buy. First of all, the broth has a smell of mushroom gone bad. Second, it has a bland and flat salty taste to it, and NO other flavors. I love mushroom and the sweetness of mushroom. When I cook mushroom in water, the water become very flavorful. Not this broth. It tastes like water mixed with salt and rotten mushroom. I used some of it to make soup, but the smell was so bad that I ended having to throw out the whole thing. I would have been better off buying fresh mushroom to cook and make broth. It would have tasted 100% better AND cheaper, too. I wished I had gone to the market and just buy one container to try out before buying a whole case from Amazon. Wasted my money because Amazon won't accept returns of grocery items.<br />If you want to try out for yourself, do yourself a favor, buy one small carton at the market (like Whole Food) and try it out, so you won't waste $35-$40 like I did.
