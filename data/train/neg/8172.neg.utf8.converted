4 stars for Coconut Oil.  1 star for seller. Just go to your local Whole Foods Market and you'll find there better product for less $. Week ago 32-ounce tub at amazon was for $14, now is $20.38 I was just about to order one more jar, but I'm going to Whole Foods. Btw, on amazons Natures Way Organic Coconut Oil is no "USDA ORGANIC" mark, simple word "organic" mean nothing (google it).
