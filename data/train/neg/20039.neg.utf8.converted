I've been trying to find "uncrystalized" candied ginger for ages. Thought I'd give this brand a try.  Was hoping the ginger wouldn't be heavily sugared.  To my dismay, the ginger was drowning in sugar and the ginger itself is not powerful at all.  So, it's just too sweet with not enough ginger to balance it out.  One of those, 'you live and you learn' experiences.
