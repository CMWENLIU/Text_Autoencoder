I bought a box for wholefoods and was so excited to make tapioca pudding last night!  What a disappointment.<br /><br />Who ever created the back of the box is a total dimwit.  And shame on me for following them blindly.<br /><br />First of all, they claim that one teaspoon = one serving and that there are 17 servings in the box.<br /><br />Second, the recipe never mentions the temperature you should cook the pudding, whether you should cover the pot, etc.  It simply says to boil water, add tapioca, cook for 17 minutes.  But if you do this on high, you will burn your pot dry.<br /><br />Third, the recipe calls for 3 teaspoons of tapioca.  Given what I wrote above, you might think this would be three servings.  Instead, this makes, as expected, maybe an 1/8 of a serving.<br /><br />Finally, the pudding was inedible.  It called for 3 T sugar, 3 T tapioca and coconut milk (which boiled down to nothing).  Ugh!  It came out to be a sugar syrup with hard tapioca balls.  Terrible!<br /><br />If you want a decent recipe for tapioca pudding, try soaking the tapioca overnight, and following the recipe on the website Simply Recipes.  I made the pudding the day after and it was truly excellent.
