(this review was written by our dog,<br />who isn't 13, (she's only two)<br />so she really isn't old enough to be allowed<br />to write a review, but don't tell Amazon!)<br /><br />They looked so darn good.<br />and were really fun to chew on-<br />I ate about a third of mine<br />over a couple hrs, in different "chewing appointments"<br />I thought... this is GREAT!<br />Then I felt kinda funny...<br />and before I knew it - I threw up<br />all over mom's rug in her office<br />three times. wow! big gobs of it!<br />I didn't even EAT that much!<br />It musta really swolled up in my doggie belly!<br />and later... that same afternoon...<br /> my sisterpup  threw hers up<br />all over the van.<br />Mom said no more Zukes.<br />dang.<br />We kinda liked those Pukes.<br />at least til we got to the<br />puking part.<br />Mom was not amused.
