My review below is very detailed, but if you are having issues with your hair because of this shampoo your FIRST step is to get it out of your hair.  Wash your hair with a moisturizing shampoo, follow with a moisturizing conditioner, and then use Apple Cider Vinegar or another vinegar to strip this shampoo and reminents out of your hair.  THEN do a hot oil treatment.  After the hot oil treatment wash and condition again and your hair should stop shedding.<br />=============================<br /><br />My review:<br /><br />I don't know if this shampoo is damaging my hair, but I noticed that I can just touch my hair after using this shampoo and it sheds. My hair sheds a lot anyway so I definitely would not use a shampoo that causes it to shed even more. The shampoo smells good and is creamy.<br /><br />From reading the other reviews, apparently YOU HAVE TO USE the conditioner or you will mess up your hair.  I would NEVER use a shampoo that strips the hair just so you can use a special conditioner to re-soften it.<br /><br />UPdate: I am downgrading to a ONE (1*).  I have NEVER had a bald spot in my life.  It has been 3 weeks now and my hair feels like straw (in spite of several deep conditionings at home and the salon).  Today, I look in the mirror and I now have a bald spot (IN THE FRONT OF MY HEAD) from all the breakage and shedding.  It is CLEAR this shampoo has a protein in it which is a NO-NO for damaged hair UNLESS you use a certain type of conditioner to bring back the softness.<br /><br />Once I discovered the bald spot, I began to panic and I went and bought the CLEAR conditioner trying to get the dryness to leave and it still didn't leave.  I am sitting here now with my regular conditioner trying to get the softness back.  I am afraid it will not come back and I will have to wait for my hair to grow out.  This shampoo is HORRIBLE.<br /><br />Update #2: This is all I had to do to stop my hair from falling out.  I had to do a clarifier.  First, I used a mixture of baking soda and water.  This soften the hair immediately, but the shedding didn't stop so I slept in a plastic cap with an oil [I used mustard oil, but any oil likely will do]).  I woke up this morning and the hair was definitely in better condition.  I then went to my refrigerator and used Apple Cidar Vinegar, more oil, and my Creme of Nature Shampoo and Conditioner.  The hair is FINALLY back to its original condition (except for the bald spot).
