I have bought the old Spearmint Altoids and they had a wonderful flavor. The new Spearmint Altoids are terrible. You cannot tell the difference between the new spearmint, peppermint and wintergreen mints.<br /><br />Altoids needs to investigate why the New Spearmint does not come close to tasting like Spearmint. I would have been better off just buying Spearmint Tic Tacks.
