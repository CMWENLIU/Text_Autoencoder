Oh boy, what can I say? When I paid $16 for this I should have know. They look like truffles and smell like them but man they are no where near the flavor of truffles. Summer truffles are light and melow in flavor but this has NO flavor. On the bright side the truffle juice did have flavor. Like one reviewer said maybe it's they way they are stored... Would not buy them again. Ever!!
