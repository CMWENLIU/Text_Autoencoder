I bought this after a fellow tea snob suggested it.  I wish I hadn't!  This is the first product made by Republic of Tea I have not loved.  The flavor is far weaker than their other teas.  I recommend getting your chocolate fix elsewhere.  If you are simply looking for the buzz that mate can bring, there are cheaper options out there.
