My impression of Irish Breakfast has always been mostly Assam, sometimes blended with Ceylon, but never Keemum. English breakfast usually has that smokey leaf, but not Irish. This tea was smokey. If you are like me, and you don't like that smokey flavor, you won't like this one. I really didn't like it and would not recommend it to anyone who's serious about tea. Go for Harney & Sons...it's worth the extra cost.
