Item is being returned.  Nuts arrived in a clear plastic bag with tie-wrap type closure.  There is no label, no country of origin, no weight/measure data, no nutrition information, no warning that it contains nuts, etc.  Literally, someone scooped the nuts out of a bulk bin somewhere, put them in a bag, tied it off and put the bag in a US Postal envelope and shipped it.  The nuts, of course, were crushed with this shipping method.  No matter, because they are going back.  I do not recommend purchasing these nuts.
