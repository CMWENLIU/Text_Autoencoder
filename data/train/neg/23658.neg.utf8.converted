I love jelly belly, but admit there is regret in purchasing this product. It states right on the bag: doesn't meet all of our demanding standards for size, color, shape, AND FLAVOR. Flavor is the main reason for the purchase of jelly belly. So I was disappointed only because you seem to get a weird mix instead of variety, and YES, the tastes are a little off. :-(
