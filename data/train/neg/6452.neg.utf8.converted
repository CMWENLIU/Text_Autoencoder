This green tea is the worst I have purchased. I don't understand the good reviews. This has a smoke taste. It is not smooth or light at all. Lipton original green tea tastes better than this. This does not taste organic. At first I thought it was Lipton in a different package, but that would be insulting Lipton. Don't waste your money on this product, I have 5 boxes that will be tossed out.<br /><br />Best Green teas I have had:<br />1. Bigelow Organic<br />2. Celestial Seasonings Organic<br />3. Lipton Organic
