WARNING!! DO NOT PURCHASE!! This is a mixture of any flavors that cannot be sold. It comes in a flimsy, torn paper bag that is stapled at the top. Mine were mostly eggnog, a flavor I hate, and that was never even mentioned in the list of possible flavors. There were no coffee house K-cups and no Van Houten, two brands that I wanted to try. There's no way this was random either. I got six hazelnut which I buy in bulk every month, six blueberry, eight egg nog and then an assortment, one each, of four "random" flavors. The K-cups are flat and ragged looking, which means they are probably old or damaged. This is simply a way to get rid of damaged merchandise--open boxes or undesirable flavors. I expect better of Amazon!
