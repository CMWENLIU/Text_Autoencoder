I love Mexican Hot Chocolate, and Abuelita is no exception.  In fact I LOVE the syrup variety of the Abuelita.<br /><br />Unfortunately these powder packets are sweetened with Sucralose - aka SPLENDA.<br /><br />Splenda isn't bad, but why?  Why not use sugar?  The difference IS noticable, and I have had a 10-pack of these packets sitting in my drawer at work for WAY too long.  They actually give me a headache when I drink them.  I made up 3 of the packets (with about 2-3 weeks in between to allow the disgust to fade between each attempt).  None of them turned out to come even close to comparing with the real stuff.<br /><br />So if you can't taste Splenda then go for it.  On the other hand if you can't handle the disgusting aftertaste left by artificial sweeteners, then leave this behind and either get the syrup or the tablets.
