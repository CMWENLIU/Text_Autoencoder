I am a big sucker for coffee; especially Kona and I try to to taste every brand I get. Hawaii Roasters is absolutely the worst I have tasted so far (Just in case you are wondering my favorite is Koa Peaberry). This one doesn't have even the slightest characteristics of Kona Coffee. If you don't want to spend a small fortune on good coffee; just go with blended Kona. You will save some money over this brand yet still will get a better taste.
