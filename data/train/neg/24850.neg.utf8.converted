I ordered these noodles online. They cost $1.99 a bag and the shipping was approximately $25.00. When I saw the huge cost of shipping I tried to back out of the sale but I had apparently already confirmed the order. I was furious and the bags are small. I advise you to go to a local Asian market. This shipper is a major rip off!! The noodles are great though!
