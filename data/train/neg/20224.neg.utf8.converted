They charged me $10.00 for shipping and handling.  I figured, okay, it is in a temperature secure package and they rush it because it is perishable, but no, it came in a regular box, and it was sent out before a holiday weekend, so it spent extra time floating around.  Once it arrived it was not 'individualy wrapped', but two large bags in one box.  The main ingredient if vegetable shortening and the flavor and texture is about the same as frosting off the baking shelves at my grocery store.  Waste of time and money, but if you aren't picky the flavor is okay.
