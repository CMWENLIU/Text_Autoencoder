I bought this product once before and took for about a week. I did not notice it helping with sleep. I continued to wake every night. I also don't notice that it calms me down. I just had a screaming match after taking 1 teaspoon in hot water and hour before. Maybe it takes a longer time to notice? I didn't notice anything the last time either but I will continue to take it as I need magnesium.
