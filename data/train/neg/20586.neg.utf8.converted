This tea is advertised as premium tea and it possesses a modest price tag, however it is the absolute lowest quality tea you can purchase.  These are not tea leaf fragments and I'd hesitate to even call them tea shavings...it's flavorless dust with a musty dirty odor.  $19.99 has resulted in 198 tea bags in the garbage can.  Cheaper supermarket tea far surpasses the quality you will find here.  Beware.
