Go to Brenda Frank's excellent and compelling review and it is what I agree with completely.  Very good job Brenda and cannot think of anything you have left out.<br /><br />I found this from the University of Pennsylvania on the issue of feeding soy to animals:<br /><br />Soy has been linked to gas and deadly bloat in dogs. It is high in purines and is therefore a completely inappropriate protein source for urate-forming dogs. It is also high in silicates and promotes the formation of silica stones.<br /><br />This is just a small sample of the harm soy can cause your dog.<br /><br />When the world was touting the advantages of soy I jumped on that bandwagon and within time I became very sick.  I will not do that to my dog.<br />Kidney stones? Have you ever had kidney stones? well I have and it is extremely painful and I do not wish for my dog to endure it.<br /><br />I am a reviewer for Amazon and love doing this and I always try to give my best review being fair and objective.  This time I was thrown a curve, this is the first 1 star rating I am giving to one of the products that Amazon has offered to me for review.  My dog means the world to me and to even consider giving him something that is this harmful is not going to happen.<br /><br />Sure beef is the first ingredient but the following ingredients are so against anything I will feed my dog.<br />My dog has been fed raw meat, ground and frozen to kill harmful pathogens, for the past few years. My vet does not like this practice but admits my dog is one of his healthiest patients.<br />I was wondering if I was not being fair to my dog and felt he may like to try some kibble for a change.  But when this came and I read that it contained so much soy and soy byproducts I decided that my dog is getting a much better diet than this food can offer.<br />I am sorry I cannot recommend this product in all good conscience.
