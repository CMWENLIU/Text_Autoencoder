I purchased a combination package including this item via a Kindle Special Offer a couple of months ago.  The food was packaged well and tastes fine.  If you make a purchase from this company, though, be prepared for a BARRAGE of followup solicitation calls.  Once you've had a transaction with a company, they are "allowed" to contact you via phone (incessantly) for a period of 2 years after the last transaction, even if you are on the National No Call Registry.  Any apparent "deal" comes at the cost of providing them a foot in the door to hound you.
