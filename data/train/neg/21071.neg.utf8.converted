I purchased this product without reading the reviews beforehand.  However, had I read the reviews I might have been clued in that this product is not what the name claims!  It claims to be Chai Green Tea, but the pictures on the side of the box show that it is in fact 3 different types of teas (i.e.Grey,orange,etc.), not the one actual flavor of 'chai' tea like I had wanted.<br /><br />I bought this product as a holiday gift and if I had the option to send it back I would as I made this discovery while opening the shipment box. I would gladly send it back shrink-wrap intact and all for something else.<br /><br />IMO, 'chai tea' is a specific flavor produced from a blend of spices and based on that I was looking for the 'chai' in this product but didn't find it.<br /><br />I have nothing to add about the actual taste or quality since it is a gift for someone else, but I just thought I would put it out there in case someone else reads this first before buying.
