While my pup loved this food (especially  wet), she had lots of tummy upsets including 2 separate days of vomiting, and diarrhea (at the same time). I tried to feed her this for 2 weeks, and her poo was still really weird and soft. I asked our vet for her opinion about raw food and she felt that they are considered unsafe because of possible e.coli and salmonella poisoning.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to switch from my dogs tummy trouble and our vet recommending that we not feed her a raw food diet.
