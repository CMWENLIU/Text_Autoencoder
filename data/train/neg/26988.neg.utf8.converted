Check the ingredients. It's basically non-dairy creamer. Vanilla is the third to last ingredient, sugar and partially hydrogenated soybean oil comprise the bulk of the product.<br /><br />You would think a product advertised as "Madagascar Vanilla Bean Powder" would be...well, vanilla bean powder. Not the case, unfortunately.
