I saw the chocolate chip cookies on the image, and I wanted gluten-free dairy-free chocolate chip cookies.<br /><br />The problem, is that these "mini chips" are miniature chocolate chips. Not small cookies.<br /><br />I realize that this is my fault for not reading closely but I also wish the manufacturer didn't put a misleading image on the package.
