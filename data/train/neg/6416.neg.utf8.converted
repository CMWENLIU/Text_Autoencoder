As another reviewer has noted, Lindt has changed their previously great recipe as of Autumn 2010, and this chocolate now has the texture and taste of bottom-shelf waxy, cheap American dark chocolate.  Not even mediocre American dark chocolate, but BAD American dark chocolate.  It reminded me of the candy you got behind the windows of an Advent Calendar when you were a kid.<br /><br />This is unfortunate, and apparently, this new recipe has been incorporated into all of their dark chocolate with the possible exception of the 85% version.<br /><br />Avoid this, as this is now one of the worst chocolate bars on the market at any cost.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />As of 11/10/2010, I've started to see the regular recipe bars re-appear on shelves.  Hopefully this isn't just old stock, but instead a sign that Lindt got the hint and has reverted to the excellent old recipe.
