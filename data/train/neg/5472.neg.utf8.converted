I had chosen this gift for my wifes birthday.<br />I chose this mainly because of the assortment of chocolates displayed in the picture<br />However when the gift reached my wife, I was extremely disappointed.<br />The Boxes had one layer of chocolate,while the rest of the box is filled with thrash. Its a complete mockery of a gift.<br /><br />Complete Waste of Money
