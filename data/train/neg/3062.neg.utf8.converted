As a general rule, I hesitate to order food products for my kids that are made in China.  This, after the recent melamine-laced baby formula scandal in China.<br /><br />When I received my two boxes of this item, I was surprised and dismayed to see "Product of China" printed on the box. When I tried to return, Amazon refused because according to Amazon policy, grocery items cannot be returned.  The Amazon site for this item does not specify country of origin as China, or I would not have ordered it in the first place.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I am not generally against products of China. These banana chips may end up being a very fine product (I did not open the box and even try it yet), and I will probably end up eating it myself.<br /><br />But I cannot recommend it if you, like me, are concerned about Product of China food products for your kids, because it is from China, according to the box.
