I don't know why you are asking for a review.  I sent an email regarding the shipment and included a photo of the box a few weeks ago after the shipment arrived. No one has responded.  The shipment came and all eight of the jars were not sealed and leaked out in the box.  I did not refuse the box because I didn't want to wait for another shippment.  Now I wish I had returned it.
