Do not buy!! I did some research on brown rice syrup (#1 ingredient in this formula) and studies show that dangerous amounts of arsenic were found in organic powdered baby formula, intended for toddlers, whose top ingredient was brown rice syrup. These formulas contained six times more arsenic than the Environmental Protection Agency considers safe for the water supply. It seems there are no safe toddler formulas anymore.. Enfagrow used to be my choice, but they changed to high fructose corn syrup and almost doubled the amount of sugar in their formula... I am a firm believer that everything is okay in moderation, even high fructose corn syrup, but this is not needed in a toddler formula that they will be consuming many ounces of each day....I think I will just stick with Horizon Organic Milk with DHA and OMEGA 3... I will just have to get my daughter some iron in her foods that she is fed though out the day... I breastfed all of my children until they were 1, but liked to give them the toddler formula after they turned 1 in order to get the iron that they needed. Just think twice before purchasing any of these toddler formulas!!
