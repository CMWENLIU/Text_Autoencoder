I ordered 3 boxes of Bob's candy canes because I could not find them in stores near me and I wanted the real thing, Bob's,not Spanglers,  to help in the celebration of my father's last Christmas.  We wanted an old fashioned, basic heart of America Christmas with him.  We were willing to pay almost any price to get original Bob's candy canes for this purpose, hence ordering them at such an inflated price on-line from Amazon.  More than half came smashed to smithereens.  I sent a note to customer service alerting them to this and heard nothing back.
