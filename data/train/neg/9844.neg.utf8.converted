I adore the Christmastime Peppermint Mocha drinks from Starbucks. While I never assumed this would be anywhere near AS good, I figured it would at least be GOOD. Mixed with hot water, all this tastes like is peppermint. There is a faint mocha taste, and no discernable coffee taste at all. This is better used as a flavoring for real coffee or mixed in milk to make a peppermint hot chocolate drink.
