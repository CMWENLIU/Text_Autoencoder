Retracted my ringing endorsement of the product from 6 months ago.  Like other reviewers, I just now experienced Beefeaters (the manufacturers) switch from an excellent product to one that is subpar at best. Even more insulting is the dramatic increase in price $5.99 to $8.99-$10.99 per pack) for this terrible product. My pug will no longer touch these "duck wraps", the product name is false advertising at best. Previously these rawhides were wrapped with dried duck.  Now they are spray painted orange and smell funny.  I have nothing against the online sellers of this product.  However these sellers should contact Beefeaters and voice concern about losing so many loyal buyers.  And the buyers?  Well all of us should contact Beefeaters customer service and voice your disappointment regarding the duck wrap product change. Fingers crossed we can get back to the excellent duck wraps of the past for our beloved dogs!
