I am extremely disappointed in Amazon for mailing me a 64 count box of Cheetos in October, that are due to expire in December.  I bought them to give as a special treat for my kids during snack time.  Even if I give them one bag per day (which I am not keen to do for obvious health reasons), they will expire before we can finish them. Now I am forced to finish them quickly, before we reach the expiration date!  What a disappointment.
