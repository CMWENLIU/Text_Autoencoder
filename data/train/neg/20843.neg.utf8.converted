No doubt this is a poor product.  When you are done draining out the water to make your sandwich, the chicken amounts to about half this small can.  Also, it is a very milky white in color, even for white meat, which makes me wonder if it is not processed.  There is nothing on the can that states it is not processed, or all natural, which allows Hormel, if this is the case, to use processed parts of the chicken.  Just the mush and too much water is enough to say goodbye to this rip-off.
