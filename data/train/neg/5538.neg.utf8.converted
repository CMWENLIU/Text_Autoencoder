I'd like to give the manuafacturers the benefit of the doubt, but this stuff is hard to swallow (no pun intended).  I love strong coffee, from the Sumatras to the other dark roasts.  That's why I purchased the Jet Fuel.  I also purchased the Kona coffee from the same coffee co. - that is a great roast and I would recommend to anyone.  But this coffee actually has the aroma of old cigarettes...not too appetizing.  I could have just received a bad batch and I'll look to return what I have left (I did give it a few tries).
