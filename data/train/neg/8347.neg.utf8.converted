If you can trick yourself into thinking that Arctic Zero is a real treat, then more power to you. I can't. The texture is like ice cream that melted and was then refrozen. I usually take those back for a refund. But the worst offence is that there is very little taste. It's like eating a pint of ice with one drop of flavor on it. I took about 10 bites and couldn't go on. It's been sitting in my freezer ever since. I think the problem is that there is ZERO fat in the product. Fat is critical to taste. The manufacturers would be better off trying for a 250 calorie per pint mixture that includes a little bit of fat to help boost the flavor. If you're looking for a lo-cal treat, I'd suggest a couple of organic apples, which have about the same number of calories and the same volume.
