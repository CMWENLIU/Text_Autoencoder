I have been cooking with the Babycook for 6 weeks now, it works fine but not great.<br />CONS:<br />- You can only make small amounts at the time.<br />- The blender is weak.<br />- The steamer-basket can only be filled half for most vegetables for proper steaming-result.<br />PROS:<br />- Heats, steams, blends all in one handy tool.<br />- Easy to use.<br />- Takes up little space.<br />- Can easily be taken on a trip.<br /><br />On some of the issues people wrote.<br />"MOLD": Water is never completely pure so there will be buildup in the water compartment. SOLUTION: Always open the lid as soon as the cycle is done and store without the lid on. Once buildup occurs, which will happen eventually, put 2-3 teaspoons of baking powder into the water compartment, fill up with water, and let stand for a few minutes. Poor out. Put an other 2-3 teaspoons of baking powder into the water compartment, fill up with water, and let stand over night. In the morning rinse out well until the water is clear.<br />If you have hard water you will have lime buildup. Poor some vinegar into the compartment, shake around and let stand for a few minutes, repeat until clean, then rinse well with hot water.<br />"Steamer-light going on and off": When you steam the water will evaporate, when the compartment is empty the light will go off indicating that the steam-cycle is done. If you leave the lid on the water compartment on, condense water will gather on the bottom starting a new cycle, the light will go on again, this water will evaporate, the light goes off, and so on and on. SOLUTION: Open the lid on the water compartment as soon as the light goes of the first time. This will also help to dry up the compartment better, creating less buildup.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />It is a nice tool to have if you cook fresh on a daily basis or have limited counter space. It is easy to use and does a good job on small amounts.<br />If you have a large kitchen or prefer to cook in larger batches and then freeze, buy separate machines (steamer, blender), the babycook can't handle larger amounts.<br /><br />I can recommend for people who have a small kitchen, for people who are planning a trip with baby.<br />I can't recommend for people who cook larger amounts or for more than one baby.
