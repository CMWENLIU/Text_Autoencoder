My husband and I bought this tea, from Nob Hill, with the purpose of gaining a health benefit. We thought that this would be a great product but for us, it was the opposite.<br />Both my husband and I got sick after trying this product for a few days. We had to see the doctor whom told us to stop using this immediately. We seem to be allergic or  have an adverse reaction. My throat hurt for about 5 days to the point where I had to sip water every 10 minutes to feel relief. My husband described his symptoms as feeling as if he had strep throat and I would describe my symptoms as burning throat and muscle spasms in my throat. I have discarded this product and will never use again. I wish that the outcome would have been different but for us, this was not our  "cup of tea".
