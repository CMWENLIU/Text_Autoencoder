Recently purchased a bag of Dogswell Chicken jerky Treats from PetCareRX. When received at home a friend informed us to make sure that the product was not made in China as the FDA had issued a warning in November 2011 of a foodborne illness that was traced back to jerky treats made in China. Apparently this is the second such warning has been issued. Dogs were getting sick and even dying. No where on PetCareRX's site did they present the warning nor indicate the product was made in China. The package is unopened. Asked for RA to return product for refund. REFUSED!  PetCareRX says to pay for return shipping ourselves and they will not refund the outgoing shipping. They continue to sell the Chinese made jerky treats to their customers regardless of the FDA warning still in effect. After putting our pet at risk to ask us to incur further costs just to get back to even is ridiculous. SHAMEFUL.
