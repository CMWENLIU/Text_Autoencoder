I made a mistake ordering this (Thought i ordered Thai tea) but wanted to give it a try since i had it.  I made the first batch and threw out the rest.  My wife and i agree - very bad for our taste.  If you gave it to me and did not tell me what kind of drink it was - i am not sure i would guess it was coffee.
