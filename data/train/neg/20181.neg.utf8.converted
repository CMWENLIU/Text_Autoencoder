I was excited to get these syrups, as I have tried other brands in the past and was disappointed with the strength of the flavor. I like a strong flavor without having to add too much syrup, as too much makes the drink too sweet.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these are the most watery syrups I have tried to date. They are only marginally thicker than water. Also, all the syrups have a strange banana-like smell. The pumpkin pie syrup specifically smells like artificial banana candies, while the other two, even the peppermint, have a distinct if secondary banana smell.<br /><br />They don't taste any different from their stated flavors, but the smell is somewhat overwhelming. Also, in order to achieve the desired flavor, I had to add so much syrup that the drink was way too sweet to drink. I was really hoping to be able to make my own coffee shop lattes, but these syrups simply do not have the strength or flavor to do the job. A dash of cinnamon adds more flavor than a few pumps of these.
