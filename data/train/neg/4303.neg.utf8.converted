I wanted to try this in my K-cup brewer because of the positive reviews and the lower price; however, I did not like the flavor of the fog chaser coffee.  I've since tried the rainforest blend, which is better, but still not as good as the Donut House k-cups from Coffee People,which I chose when the Kona blend was no longer available.  I'm debating whether to try the breakfast blend; too bad I have to purchase 36 of them just to try them, though.
