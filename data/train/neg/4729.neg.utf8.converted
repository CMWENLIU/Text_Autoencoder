I hate writing a bad review just because I don't like the taste of something, because everyone has different tastes.  But this rice, in addition to tasting awful, is just soaked in grease.  The flavors are all there, but there is a strange, almost soapy aftertaste that overpowers everything else.  I don't know what I'm going to do with the other 5 pouches--they will probably go to a food bank.<br /><br />I give it 2 stars, rather than 1, only because of ease of preparation.
