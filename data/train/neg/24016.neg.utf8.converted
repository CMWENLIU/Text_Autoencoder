I have researched and used Manuka honey since 2004, including UMF 12+, UMF 16+, UMF 17+, and UMF 20+, and write to warn against this product and this seller. This product does NOT have a "UMF 16+" level of MANUKA FACTOR and is NOT CERTIFIED "UMF 16+."<br /><br />WARNING: If you seek a Manuka honey able to provide the medical benefits of a UMF 16+ manuka honey, THIS PRODUCT IS A FRAUD. It is merely a basic table honey.<br /><br />The label is intentionally deceptive.  It seeks to confuse consumers by including "active" and "16+" but this is meaningless. STAKICH HONEY IS NOT CERTIFIED by the Active Manuka Honey Associaion to have methylglyoxal (MGO).  MGO is the factor present in SOME -- not all -- manuka honeys.  MGO is responsible for the medical benefits shown in scientific research.  (A side note: be sure to check the research itself, not the claims on sellers' websites, to distinguish the real from the illusory medical benefits of CERTIFIED manuka honeys.)<br /><br />Having consumed several different UMF 16+ and UMF 20+ honeys (the two strengths that I use for different purposes, in addition to manuka essential oil) across the years, I immediately could taste the LACK of MGO in Stakich's honey.  (I'd not been able to see the label detail in the small photo here.)  But rather than presume, I contacted Stakich for some validation of MGO in the honey.  In reply, Stakich sent a dodge rather than a substantive answer.<br /><br />I wrote a second time, indicating that mine was not an idle inquiry because I use the honey for medical purposes; I depend on an accurate UMF label to be assured I am using an appropriate product for the several purposes to which I put these honeys.  Stakich's second reply delivered an insult in lieu of a responsive answer.  Thus, in addition to warning you about the product, I'll also say that I am disgusted with the evasive and condescending "service" Stakich provided when confronted with their deception.<br /><br />Before you buy a manuka honey for other than regular table honey use, check the AMHA's website to see whether it is sold by a member of the Association and has been certified to have an MGO level accurately represented on the label. If all you want is a table honey, you can get one many times cheaper from a truthful seller who clearly lables both its higher UMF and its low UMF honeys.
