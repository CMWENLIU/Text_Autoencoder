Do not buy this soup!  I bought their lentil and vegetable at a county fair.  Bad decision!  The "vegetable" contains nothing but desiccated potatoes - no other vegetables!  The lentil taste is horrible. The soup is expensive so  money wasted.  I complained to this company and they could care less.
