The smell was fabulous--a scent of ginger and lemon that was very appealing. But then I tasted it. Bitter with an overpowering ginger flavor. I'll admit it--I have a serious sweet tooth and generally have to add additional honey to my drink to make it palatable. However, I'm not sure there's enough honey in my cabinet for this drink.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this as an alternative for my tea-drinking self but, unfortunately, this drink was not for me.<br /><br />On the plus side, it did dissolve quickly and completely with no graininess.
