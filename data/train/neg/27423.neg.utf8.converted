I would never buy these from this distributor at this price. I wanted to ship some to my girlfriend in Florida because we have not found it here yet and I live in Ohio. The price in our stores is only about $2.29 for a large can. This price is half more..... Unless they lower there price I would not ever buy it from them. Not only is this not discounted for quantity.. it is no bargain to begin with and then shipping will make it even more. I would report them for ruining the awesome Chips brands reputation.... find em.. buy em.. eat em up.. they are the best... I even lost a lot of weigh eating them to curve hunger believe it or not. My cholesterol is just fine too btw.  Love PIK NIK the best.. reminds me of being a kid again.
