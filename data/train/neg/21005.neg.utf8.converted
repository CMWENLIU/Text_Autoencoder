Ask a Chinese friend about "forbidden rice" (&#31105;&#31859;), unless they are history buff like myself, they will give you a puzzled look.  The term refers to an obscure trade policy during Manchurian dynasty, not an exotic rice.  I will not going to bore you  with history here.<br /><br />The story about emperor depriving commoners of red rice is a hoax made in America, like the legion of fortune cookies. Most fortune cookies are made in a wholesome factory near Atlanta.  We trust that fortune cookies are safe to eat.  "Forbidden rice?"<br /><br />There is a red rice in China, dark red, close to red bean.  The color varies from gran to gran. Its thick bran provides a pleasant nutty flavor and al dente texture.  The color does not come off easily.  You can get them from Chinese grocery store.<br /><br />What is sold as "forbidden rice" at Amazon and Costco has a uniformed black to deep purple color.  It appears to be rice over-milled, dyed, and polished.  Drop a few grains in water, you can see color coming off.  And the color tent to sink to the bottom. That is a easy tell tail.  When cooked, the favor and texture of bran are absent.  If they use red rice, they have milled away its bran to make the rice easy to dye.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with using food coloring.  But is the ink FDA approved?  We do not know.  The label does not say.<br /><br />I am returning mine to Costco.  I will ask Costco to pull it off the shelf.
