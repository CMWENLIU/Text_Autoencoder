Unless you're some sort of raw food eating hippie, you'd be better off getting your protein elsewhere.  This stuff tastes like and has the consistency of grass / dirt.  It's pretty hard to stomach, unless you try mixing it with several things.  Definitely not worth the trouble or inconvenience.<br /><br />I bought some based on the good reviews posted here and boy do I regret it.
