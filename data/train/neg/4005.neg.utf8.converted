I wanted to love this because of all its positive aspects. Very low mercury. Sustainably caught. Responsible company and packaging. And - I THOUGHT it was fully caught AND packed in the USA* (*It is packed in Vietnam.)  See their web site, and click on the FAQ page - it tells that info there.<br /><br />I love Genovo Tonno - so I thought this tuna would be even better. Wrong. You open the can and find a relatively dry hunk of tuna that smells a little cat-foodish, with some limited liquid around the lump. Dumping it out, it doesn't break up very easily, but I persisted and succeeded in making it ready for a sandwich. Taste was uninspiring. There wasn't much taste - and what was there was just ever so slightly unappealing. I couldn't finish the sandwich. I normally LOVE tuna - but not this.<br /><br />Thinking it was just me not liking it, I gave the rest to a person who will eat ANY brand of tuna and love it. In fact, he's one of those cast-iron stomach people who will and can eat anything. He didn't finish his sample either, because he said it was dryish and tasted unappetizing. So, it isn't just "me".<br /><br />I REALLY wanted to love this. But I can't stomach it. I'll just buy either the can of Genovo Tonno or Starkist's Yellowfin tuna in foil packets from now on. Those taste like tuna and make me want more. Granted, they're  higher in mercury - full grown yellow-fin is almost as high as albacore in mercury, but I'll keep my consumption down to one packet (2.6 ounce) or can (3 ounce) a week which is below the danger limit for a very small woman. I'd rather eat less tuna that I simply LOVE, than eat a whole bunch of tuna that I can't choke down.<br /><br />This excerpt is quoted from the Wild Planet FAQ:<br /><br />"Why are Wild Planet tuna and sardines caught in the US but packed in Vietnam?<br />We have elected to process our 5oz cans of albacore and skipjack tuna as well as our sardines in a highly respected partner facility in Vietnam. This facility offers state-of-the-art canning expertise in an immaculately clean, accredited environment that produces higher quality finished products than any cannery we have seen in the US."<br /><br />I realize there are no more canneries in the US, but I"m just not comfortable with my food moving from California to Vietnam and then back to California - and then out to the middle of the US to the consumer.
