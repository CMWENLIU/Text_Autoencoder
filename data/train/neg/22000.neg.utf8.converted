I used to have this as on the road snack during my gestational diebetes. Continue to have it for snack during breast feeding. Unfortunately, it has brown rice syrup that could contain  arsenic a compound that may increase the risk of cancer, a new study says. I also feed my baby the "baby's Only" organic formula. My husband says that we had double dosed our baby with the arsenic so we decided not to use either products. However, this item is not returnable. :(<br /><br />Without the arsenic doubt, I will give it 5 stars.
