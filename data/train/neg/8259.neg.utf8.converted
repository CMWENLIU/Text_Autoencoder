I've been a Hershey's kisses fan for years (I even adore their commercials) and although a purist, occasionally try some of the new flavors.  Sure, I understand why they want to expand their market and I appreciate that, but these new aerated kisses?  Don't WASTE your money.  When I saw them in the store I read the description and thought they sounded intriguing, but the first one I put in my mouth tasted like extremely sub-par chocolate (yeah, I know Godiva and other brands but I still like Hershey's-this wasn't even Hershey's typical quality) and for sure-was aerated-and I thought "oh great, now Hershey's has joined the current bandwagon of figuring out how to give the consumer less quantity, less quality, and simultaneously make them think they're getting something special".  They're awful.
