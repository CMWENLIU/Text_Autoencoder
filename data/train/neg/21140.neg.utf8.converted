I had used this litter on and off for a couple years without any real problems, like a lot of other reviewers. But - like several others - I have had insects come out of a box I have purchased. They are very small, white, and look like dust. But when you look closely, you see that the dust is moving and is actually alive! I first noticed them on the edges of one of the litter pans, so I dumped the litter and bleached the pan. I didn't suspect the insects were coming from the litter itself, so I refilled the pan with the Swheat Scoop. After a day or so, the bugs had spread to the other litter pans, and then I saw that they had spread to the floor because they were on the litter that the cats had kicked out onto the ground. They even spread to detergent bottles that had been set on the floor and were on the trash can and in the vacuum! Bleach, insecticide spray, soap...nothing worked! I had to hire a professional exterminator. He discovered that the source was indeed the Swheat Scoop because he checked the box that I had been using and found eggs and insects inside. He said they were a type of pantry pest that was feeding on the wheat.<br /><br />So - bottom line: even though this litter was good and I liked it, all the stress and money I had to spend because of one insect-infested box (and the GROSS factor) is, for me, not worth taking the chance on this product again!!!
