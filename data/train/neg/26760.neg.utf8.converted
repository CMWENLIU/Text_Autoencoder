I am owned by 5 cats and I foster another 17 cats for my local humane society, so I can give the reaction of 22 individual cats to this Kong Catnip Spray product. Most of these cats respond very positively to anything catnip - those who don't respond positively just don't respond to catnip much at all. I sprayed some of the Kong stuff on a couple of their favorite toys. I did notice a peculiar very unpleasant odor, but held the two toys out for the cats to sniff - they all took one sniff and bolted. This happened with all 22 of the cats, even those who don't normally have a reaction to catnip. I waited a couple of days just in case the scent was too strong, but got the same reaction. Really wish it did work as well as the reviews I read on the website......
