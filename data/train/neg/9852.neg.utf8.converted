I often buy these singly from my grocery store, and I really love them as a meal replacement, so I was excited to see that I could order them for such a good price per bar on Amazon.  After I opened the first one, however, I wasn't quite so happy.  The chocolate coating was white and waxy looking, and the bar itself tasted dried out (definately not fresh-tasting).  They are within the sell-by date, so something must have happened to them in storage.  I had 2 day shipping and the days during that time were very cool -- not warm enough to melt anything. :(  I would have ordered these on a regular basis if they had been like the ones in the grocery store.  I guess you get what you pay for!
