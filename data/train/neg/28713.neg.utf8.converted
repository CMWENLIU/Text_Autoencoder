We were given this product as a gift. OK, I can forgive the fact that I'm a pastry chef and I was given a MIX for a gift :-0 but I have always made my own frosting from scratch and have for years. It's one of the EASIEST things to make!!! Make your cake from a mix if you want but....I looked at the back of this box to see what was in it and...SERIOUSLY it's just powdered sugar (.80 cents worth), salt (.05 cents worth) and vanilla (maybe 20 cents worth). I mean, I 'm glad that this small company is making themselves some money but really you should spend your money on other more difficult to make items. (Or all the medical bills that come along with the issues of gluten allergy.)<br /><br />  Honestly folks here is all you do for AWESOME frosting:<br /> 1 box (16 oz) of powdered sugar (put it in a bowl)<br /> 1 pinch salt (put it in the bowl<br /> 1 teaspoon vanilla (in the bowl)<br /> 1 Cup margarine  (at room  temp,in the bowl)<br /> 4 TBL soy milk or other milk (in the bowl)<br />Mix it all up with a mixer till it is light and fluffy (about 5 minutes)<br />  ...if you want chocolate add 4 tbl of cocoa powder and another tbl of milk
