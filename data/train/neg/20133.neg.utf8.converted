I spent several hours reading reviews for deer repellents before settling on the Havahart Deer Off product. I gulped at the price, but reasoned that it was a concentrate and I would get my money's worth. First, let's start with the fact that the product is filled with little mushy granules that immediately clogged my garden sprayer. I had read the directions. I had shaken the product vigorously as recommended. It still clogged not only my standard gallon garden sprayer, but every other sprayer I tried to use to dispense the product. I wound up "painting" it on the plants I wanted to protect. And now comes the second part..... it did absolutely nothing to protect my plants. The deer ate three quarters of everything to which I had applied the product within a week of application. Flowers, vegetables, shrubs. It was as if I had used nothing.<br /><br />My opinion? This product is a complete waste of money.
