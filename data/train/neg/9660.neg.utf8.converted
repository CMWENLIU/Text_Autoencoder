This item is very cute.  HOWEVER, the contents of the box is weak.  The box included some candy and cookies.  However, the items did not look appealing or  worth the money.  Although it makes a cute wine gift box, I was a bit embarrassed by what was included in the box (which I did not realize until after I gave out several of these as gifts).
