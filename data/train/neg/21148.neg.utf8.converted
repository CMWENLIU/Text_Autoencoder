One of my rabbits found the swheat scoop irresistable to eat and an impacted stomach has resulted with my rabbit now being in the hospital for the last few days, with this litter impaction located in her stomach. Subsequently I found out on a quick web search that there is information on this product and its detriment to rabbits, on the HRS, house rabbit society website, as well as several other online locations. I'm certain this product is great for cats however, and I would continue to use it for my cat if I didn't have rabbits.
