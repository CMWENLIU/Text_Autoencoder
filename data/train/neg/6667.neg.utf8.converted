This product did not meet our expectations.  The pieces were not light and crisp as I expected but were somewhat chewy and odd shaped.  The flavor of the fruit was ok, but I have had other brands of freeze dried mango that are much better.  Overall it was very poor quality and we would not order this brand again.
