This product is portrayed as healthy and natural, but I was shocked and dismayed to see that it's shipped from halfway across the world. I understand buying electronics, shoes, etc. from China, but my FOOD? I doubt the safety of this food product, and don't see how they can guarantee that  it's vegan, non-GMO, dairy free, wheat-free, gluten-free, etc. Plus I don't see the point in purchasing something that has obviously left such a hefty carbon footprint. But beyond that, how hard is it to make a delicious snack like this in the USA, from USA-grown ingredients? Seriously?
