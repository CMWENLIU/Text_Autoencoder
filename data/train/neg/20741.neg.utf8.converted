So my cat loves these things. She practically hisses at me at random times and jumps on the counter throws the bag on the floor and starts swatting the bag all over the house. I then put them in the cubbard and I found her in the cubbard one day crying to get out. Its insane. She acts like someone on crack. Im starting to question what they put in these. Is there really a lot of regulation regarding cat snacks. I doubt it. Ive tried to stop giving them to her but she then turns her back to me and pouts for days to weeks on end. It has taken me a while to figure out what was going on with her and I have narrowed it down to these Temptation snacks. Im concerned about what drugs they put in these.
