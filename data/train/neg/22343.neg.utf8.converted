I am compelled to warn you coffee lovers out there.  I read the reviews of so-called coffee aficianados regarding this particular brand.  I believed that organic coffee has to be better than the others I've tried just because of how its grown.  Not so, buyer beware.  This is the absolute worse coffee I have ever had the displeasure of polluting my palate.  I now believe that the first reviewer must have some personal stake in this brand, or some of your taste buds have been dulled.  I tried to return this product [[ASIN:B000GAO9WO Caffe Appassionato Organic Shade Grown Espresso Roast, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)to Amazon, but was told that food items are non-refundable. My spouse and I tried to drink this coffee and after having 3 bags of this sludge in our cabinets, we finally decided to throw it away.  I thought of re-gifting to friends, but I like and want to keep my friends.  The only thing this coffee can possibly compliment is the garbage.  It's just so wrong that it sucks so bad.
