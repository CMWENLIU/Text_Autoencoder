I must admit, these taste very good and info on the box says "Indulgence you can feel good about". Don't believe that for one minute.<br /><br />The second ingredient in this product is sugar. It's a tiny, thin 2.5 inch square (approx 17g or slightly over half an ounce). Look how this product compares to a fun size snickers bar (15g)<br /><br />  Granola Thin  /  Fun Size Snickers<br />Calories:  80 /  72<br />Cal from fat: 35  /  33<br />Total Fat  4g  /  3.7g<br />Saturated fat  1.5g  /  1.3g<br />Cholesterol  0  /  2mg<br />Sodium  75mg  /  39.9mg<br />Total Carb  11gm  /  8.9gm<br />Sugars  6gm  /  7.4gm<br />Protein  1gm  1.2gm<br /><br />These actually compare somewhat UN-favorably with the candy bar, at least in terms of fat, sodium and carbs. Granted, the difference is not huge. What bugs me is it's essentially candy masquerading as "healthy". Also, with both the fiber is fairly negligible. I'm not saying they come right out and say it's "healthy" but they certainly do imply it.<br /><br />Lets talk about cost. There are 10 packages in a box. Each package is .6oz. I paid about 3.40 for my box. I paid that for about 6-7 ounces of product. So if I were buying them by the pound, I guess that would be over 8.00 for 1 pound. For that price, I can buy myself a nice steak.<br /><br />As I said before, these do taste good but I find the cost is prohibitive and they aren't really any better for you than candy and are very small. I doubt I'll be buying them again and for sure they are not an "indulgence" I would feel good about giving to kids.
