Absolute rip off - I was NOT sent the item as stated and pictured.  I was sent the Creme Latte; which you can purchase at your local supermarket for $6.50.<br /><br />I did not want the Maxwell House Creme Latte; I wanted the original Maxwell House Latte.<br /><br />They are now arguing via email with me; even though my order quite clearly states the product shown for sale here.<br /><br />Be warned - do not buy!
