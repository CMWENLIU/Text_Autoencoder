I recently received my second subscription delivery.  First of all, all the cans were horribly dented, as many reviewers have commented.  The cans from my first delivery were all okay.  This tells me the product handling is irratic.  Still, it would not have bothered me, until I opened one.  To my surprise, the taste was different than the first batch I received.  The product is 3 months old based on the date on the can, but it tasted like it was off.<br /><br />I really liked the idea that Blue Monkey is not from concentrate and slightly cheaper than Zico, but with such quality control problems, I have gone back to drinking Zico.
