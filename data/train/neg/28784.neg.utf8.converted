I have seen bags and bags of the "flops" you can get at the factory so I ordered a bag thinking that I would be getting close to the smaething. NO, mostly all one color not the varity I expected. I feel they ship out the ones that won't visually sell at the factory in their gift shop. I was very disappointed as I had to through the bag out because they were inedible. I won't buy again through the mail.
