I usually do not bother to write any reviews as I think there are enough reviews already that one more makes little difference. Not in this case. I do not know what the people who wrote about this tea before me drunk or smoked (e.g. Kasia S., et al). I wasted hard earned $16 on something that even does not taste like a regular cheap washed out tea bags one can buy at any no-frills grocery store. If you never had a real Oolong Tea (like Pete's Phoenix Mountain Oolong) you may be fooled into believing that Oolong Tea tastes like this product. I think it sucks big time and I think potential victims should know the truth about it. This is how I use reviews for other products on Amazon to get an honest assessment of something I am thinking of buying. I am giving away all 5 boxes of this tea to people I do not know as shipping it back would waste additional time I do not want to donate.
