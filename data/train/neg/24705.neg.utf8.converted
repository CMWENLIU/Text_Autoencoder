Kellogg's Pop Tarts hit the GMO home run! This product contains GMO Bt corn and GMO Bt Cottonseed, which are both EPA registered pesticides (when the insects bite into the crops, their stomachs explode - should kids be eating these chemicals? Not in my opinion) and RoundUp Ready GMO soy, corn and sugar which have been genetically engineered in a lab by inserting foreign genes, to withstand heavy doses of a chemical called glyphosate that is linked to birth defects and cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases and more. Yes, Kellogg's hit a HOME RUN with 4 GMOs in these Pop Tarts. The only thing missing for a grand slam is GMO Canola. JUST LABEL IT, Kellog! Stop the deceptive lack of labeling. Vote Yes on Prop. 37! I don't feed these toxins to my family. Wouldn't feed them to any living thing on the planet.
