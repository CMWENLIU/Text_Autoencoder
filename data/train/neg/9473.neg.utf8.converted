This item arrived in an inedible condition.  I chilled it, and open opening the jar I found the top layer had dried and congealed to the point where it was like a sort of low viscosity gummy candy substance.  I couldn't dig anything out with a spoon.  It was horrible.  Both jars were like this.<br /><br />Amazon provided a refund with no return immediately, so you're protected if you want to give it a shot.  Maybe it was a bad batch for me.
