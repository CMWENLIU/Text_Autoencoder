I ordered this product expecting it to to look like the picture shown.  When I received the antler it was about 4inches long and extremely thin (in width).  I have bought antlers for my puppy in the past who is an aggressive chewer and they have lasted for months.  This one is almost gone and it has only been a few days!  Definitely not worth the price and not as pictured!
