I just attempted to use this product for baking a couple of days ago and was so very dissappointed.  I have used a few different brands of Date Sugar and have never had a clumping problem.  I believe most of the companies who produce date sugar have to cut some oat flour into it so it doesn't just form one sticky lump.  This is how Bob's Red Mill Date Sugar is...one big 24-oz block of sticky lump.  I had to pound and pound on the mound of date sugar and attempt to whittle away at it with a knife.  I thought I had pulverized it enough to bake with it and boy was I wrong.  When I poured the batter into loaf pans, it had big red clumps of date sugar poking out of the batter.  I picked out what lumps were visible but when I cut into the finished product, it had patches throughout that were sticky and felt like the bread was not done.  I could tell these patches were from the clumps of date sugar.  I was so very sad I bought this product.
