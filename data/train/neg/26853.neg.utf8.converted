Health Valley cream of mushroom soup is listed as gluten-free on Amazon, but I contacted the source ([..]) and rec'd the message below:<br />"Unfortunately we are unable to guarantee our Health Valley Organic Cream Of Mushroom Soup is gluten free. Consumer health and safety is our number one concern. We do not have lists of products that are specifically considered to be gluten free. Reading the label is the best way to check for the presence of ingredients which contain gluten. If gluten is a major ingredient, it will be specified in the ingredient list. For consumers concerned about the presence of trace amounts of gluten, we suggest avoiding products that include natural flavors or spices."<br /><br />In addition, the soup is incredibly fat-laden. A lot of  "Natural cream" will clog up one's arteries as well as non-specific cream.  It's unnecessary to load the product up with so much animal fat in my opinion.
