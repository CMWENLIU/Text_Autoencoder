I have tried several coffee k-cups. From Starbucks to Moonlight coffee...virtually every kcup<br />This coffee tastes more like chemicals. No wonder the price is so low.<br /><br />Do not buy this Coffee -- sorry to say !!!  The worst coffee i ever bought and the biggest mistake i did that I bought several ones.... If anyone needs the chemical coffee , i am willing to sell it out for 50% less price
