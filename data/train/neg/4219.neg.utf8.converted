I LOVE coconut water.  I drink it every day.  This is the worst kind.  It just doesn't taste right at all.  Amy and Brians or ONE are much better.  Even the cheap Tasco brand is better than this.  Do not buy this... please Amazon start carrying Amy and Brians or try to keep ONE in stock.  They keep putting this on sale because its NOT GOOD!
