I don't normally write bad reviews, but this item is not returnable, so I thought I'd save some of you the trouble.  I have been drinking herbal teas for many years, and especially love the smooth, clean, non-bitter taste of oolong.  I am used to steeping some herbal teas for 30 minutes for medicinal purposes, but never oolong, which should be ready in 3-5 minutes.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Each tea bag is wrapped in plastic vs. standard paper (what toxic chemicals are leaching in?)<br />The tab was glued to 50% of the tea bags I opened, and ripped the tea bag open when trying to remove it.<br />Quality of tea itself is not good...<br />After steeping for 15 minutes, my cup of tea had no color and tasted like water<br />2 tea bags steeped for 30 minutes gave a very light color and very mild flavor...too mild<br />Tea bags should be quick and convenient...this is not<br />Some drink oolong to rev up metabolism...this tea is way too mild to reap any of those benefits, even w/2 tea bags<br /><br />I have tried the Pier mall varieties and they are decent, but Prince of Peace is by far my favorite Organic oolong in a tea bag, and is less than 5 bucks per one hundred bags online.  You can have a nice mild cup in 2 minutes, or a darker oolong in 5.
