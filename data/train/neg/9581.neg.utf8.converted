This is not the same Adams Flea and Tick Dip of days gone by.  The old formula was quite effective and got rid of ticks after 2 dippings on my dog Maggie.  My grandson's dog King is plagued with ticks because of the surrounding area that we live in. He's taken for walks along the street with woods and a lake and gets re-infested quite quickly.  It has helped, but is not 100% effective. Now he scratches all the time and I have ordered some Stop Itch shampoo and conditioner to see if this helps. We even tried AdvanTix that did not help get rid of the ticks either. We shall go back to the Preventic collar. Maybe a bubble suit or space suit would be the solution.  "White American Eskimo Dog in a Bubble/space suit walks the outer perimeter of Miami Florida along the lake and woods to keep out ticks".  We use Advantage for fleas and he is flea free 100%.
