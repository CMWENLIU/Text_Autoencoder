If you want coffee grounds floating in every cup of coffee, and K-cups that explode open in your Keurig, then this product is for you. I have used about a dozen of these K-cups so far, and about half have come open inside my Keurig, with the top foil seal coming off and the water and grounds going everywhere. The other half stayed sealed, but I still get a lot of coffee grounds floating in my coffee.The inner constuction and filter must be defective as well. The manufacture of these K-cups is somehow inferior to Green Mountain and others. The taste of the coffee is irrelevant when the K-cups don't work. I have used many other different K-cups, Tully's, Donut Shop, Emeril's, Starbucks, Green Mountain,Timothy's, Caribou, etc. and never had any problems. I should have heeded the other reviews that stated the same problems, and not believed the company's claim that these problems were resolved. I now have a partial box of unusable K-cups.
