As an experienced Lavazza and Illy coffee consumer I can tell you that this thing tastes like a used cigarette filter.<br />Dark roast, very bitter, quite coarse grind all together make an ugly espresso. very similar to Starbucks and friends(excuse me Seattle but Italian blends are MUCH better)<br />Skip if you can. go with Lavazza Qualita Orro (light),Cafe Espresso (stronger) or Tierra (refined) blends, you won't be disappointed
