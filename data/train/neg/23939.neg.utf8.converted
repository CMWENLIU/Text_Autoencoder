Producers of BLK have recently changed their bottler (and water source), removing the "spring water" from the label.  If these people have mixed fulvic acid with any municipal source containing chlorine or fluoride, it could be carcinogenic.  Please do your homework on fulvic/humic acids mixing with chlorine and flouride before you ingest this.  And do not use it if you are undergoing any therapy (chemo, etc.) that compromises your immune system.
