My family insisted I throw these away, because they smelled so bad from such a distance.  I (somewhat reluctantly) did, and now we use another type that advertises itself as "odor free" and does seem to genuinely have a lot less smell than these.  These were a lot cheaper, and I hoped that they'd work for us, but they didn't.  The dog doesn't care which type I buy - it's just the people who are fussy.
