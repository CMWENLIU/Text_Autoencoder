I'm not a coffee snob, I usually drink starbucks coffee beans or i buy the 5 pound bags from coffee bean direct which are pretty good off of amazon.  I decided to try this due to consumer reports good reviews and the overall good reviews here on amazon.  The coffee tastes stale, and has a horrible aftertaste.  I mix these with starbucks french roast now which are a little too strong for my taste just so i dont have to have the aftertaste from these beans.  Don't buy them, even if they are on sale, like i did.
