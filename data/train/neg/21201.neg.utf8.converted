I've been eating Snows Clam Chowder for near 30 years. Since Bumblebee took over the brand it has become terrible! Less than half the clams, and half the potatos. Not near as thick, and the taste is completely different. I contacted Bumblebee, and all I got was a canned (no pun intended) response that the only thing changed was "it no longer has MSG". Anyone that is a fan of the original knows this to be an outright lie. To add insult, they sent me 6 coupons for......cans of Snows Clam Chowder. For all you fans of the original, call them, write to them, email them, do whatever you can. For for petes sake, dont buy this till they change it back. What a horrible soup it is now!
