This is the worst dried mango product. I tasted a few and threw away the whole bag. Ingredient doesn't read it used sugar and preservatives. I thought it was natural and no sugar. But when I saw it I think it used bunch of sugar and also used preservative. Well if they missed ingredients that's still ok only if it tastes good because other products also use sugar and preservative. However it was the worst dried mango I ever had. It is neither pleasing nor healthful. I already lost money spending on it and didn't want to bother my mouth nor my health with the worst. So, I threw away the whole bag decisively. No attachment. I recommend philipine imported dired mango products. 7D mango is fine. For your reference, I bought some organic or natural dried mangoes. They are quite different from philipine products. They are real dry and somewhat hard rather than soft and chewy like philipine products. But they use no sugar no preservative.
