I am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids.  4% Iron and no other vitamins??  With childhood obesity a t epidemic proportions, why would ANYONE feed their children all of these empty calories?? It is like giving them Coke or Pepsi for BREAKFAST!! OK ORGANIC Coke but still Coke!! I am sad because I have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species!! But they are not thinking about their target consumer CHILDREN!
