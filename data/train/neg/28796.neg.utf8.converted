Decent large sardines for cheap Morocan production, but totally unsatifactory because of the soy oil.  Sardines are amazingly healthy especially in olive oil.  But soy is an anti-nutrient which makes this product not very desirable.  Crown Prince has many other quality, tasty canned fish products.  Skip this one.
