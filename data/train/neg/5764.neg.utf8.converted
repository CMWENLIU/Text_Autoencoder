Please do not buy into this product being a pure back-to-nature good for you...good for the environment product.  IT IS NOT.  It contains palm fruit oil.  Cutting down of these forests could spell the complete demise of the orangutans as this is their habitat.  Palm fruit oil is used in soaps, cosmetics, and lots of other things - but who thought it was in this high-end peanut butter???  Amazon needs to put this information in the product listing so at least people will know what they're getting.
