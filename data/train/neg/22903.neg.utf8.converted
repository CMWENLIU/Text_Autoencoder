Really recommend that buyers beware - I too ate no more than a handful of this product - about 2.5 hours later, I had minor stomach pains - another hour after that, I was in umimaginable pain.  It took a good 3 hours of severe pain and bathroom trips to be able to walk upright or consider any other behavior.  Twenty-four hours later, I was still not 100%.  Buy the full sugar version in little bags and learn moderation - the sugar-free version is NOT a good answer
