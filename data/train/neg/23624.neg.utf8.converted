I think we've all experienced those gum balls that lose their flavor after about 10 seconds, then turn so hard that your jaw starts to get tired.  These are a step above that.  First of all, they are the smaller gum balls, which I didn't expect.  Second, they lose their flavor pretty quickly.  I would eat one, then pop another one in a few seconds later to try to elongate my chewing experience but after about 30 seconds, I had to spit it out.  They're not bad tasting, but I probably wouldn't order them again.
