I will have to respectfully disagree with some of the other reviewers here.  As someone who cannot have gluten or casein, I often have difficulty finding good cereals.  Unfortunately, Arrowhead Mills' Organic Maple Buckwheat Flakes continued that trend for me.<br /><br />Some of my complaints about this cereal are common to many -- it gets soggy quickly, it's very expensive for its size, its nutritional value could be better.  What really bothers me, however, is the almost metallic aftertaste it leaves.  Although the ingredients say that it is made with natural maple flavoring, my refined New England maple tastes do not find this flavor to be anything familiar.  It is very strong and very unpleasant.  I found that I have had to brush my teeth immediately after eating each bowl just to get the aftertaste out of my mouth.<br /><br />I usually like Arrowhead Mills products, but this one misses the mark for me.  I'll finish the box, but I won't be buying it again.
