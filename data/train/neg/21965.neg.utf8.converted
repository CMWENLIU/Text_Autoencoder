This was bought as a treat for the kids. You won't know it's a toxin until you receive the package and you read the ingredients. Amazon refunded my money and instructed me to dispose of the product.  I haven't found a single k cup that isn't coffee that has natural ingredients. I guess the Keurig is a coffee maker and nothing else.
