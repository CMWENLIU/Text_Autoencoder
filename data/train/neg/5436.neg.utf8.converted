I ordered these coins for a poker party.  I didn't realize they came in individual mesh bags, so I had to open all the bags before using.  No big deal, really.  Then during the party when people opened them, I was concerned to see the edges of the chocolate were a much lighter color, indicating the product was old and dried out.  Considering the price I paid...over $30 I was very disappointed.
