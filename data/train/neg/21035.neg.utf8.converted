I'm an avid K cup user - coffee, tea, cocoa - and have my favorites and not-so-favorites, but dang... This one started off tasting okay, but actually gave me indigestion (burp!). There's a disturbing metallic, cloyingly sweet aftertaste in my mouth too. Your mileage may vary, but this is one K cup flavor I won't be revisiting.
