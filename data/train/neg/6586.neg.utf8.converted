I have been buying Potato Buds for over 35 years and will never again! I am now cooking potatoes and mashing them. The new and improved are garbage, I threw out my open box and got a refund for all three boxes I bought from the Betty Crocker company.<br /><br />If they ever bring back the "ORIGINAL POTATO BUDS" I am back in, but until then bye bye!
