I really wanted to like this mix, but I simply can't.  Naming it "White Mocha" and even featuring a chunk of white chocolate on the package is simply preposterous, considering it neither contains nor tastes like chocolate.  Yes, I did know beforehand that it did not contain cocoa, but I still hoped for a tasty beverage mix that somehow would pull off a similar rich flavor.  But rich this stuff certainly is not; rather, it produces a bland drink that is anything but reminiscent of white hot chocolate, completely failing to produce the feel-good sensation of warm cocoa.  The mocha taste is somewhat present, but hardly enjoyable.  Overall very disappointing, especially for the price and coming from a brand like Ghirardelli.
