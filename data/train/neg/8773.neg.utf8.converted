The box is filled more than half-way with shredded paper and has only three very small bags of the nuts and fruit shown in the photo.  You receive 5 oz of pistachios, 6 oz. of almonds and 1 cup of mixed dried fruit.  I would be very disappointed if I had sent this to someone else as a gift. As is, I just feel that I overpaid by 200 - 400%.  The quality of the food is nice, but not exceptional and the packaging is a typical box that has dividers (to hold the shredded paper in place I am sure).
