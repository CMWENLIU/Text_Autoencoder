Bringing baby home from the hospital we thought we'd get a pack of these so we didn't have to make bottles right away.  The "nipples not included" is not obvious on the packaging.  The hospital had pre-sterilized nipples in packages.  I wrongly assumed it was the same as these.  What's the point???
