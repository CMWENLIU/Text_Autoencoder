I saw this at Target and pulled it up on Amazon to check the reviews. They were great! So I bought a jar (very expensive compared to other peanut butter) and brought it home. I opened it up immediately excited to try it based on the great reviews and couldn't even eat a spoonful of it. Disgusting is the only the word I can think of, it tastes like a combination of sea water (it is SOOO salty) and synthetic peanut butter. All I have to say is, don't order in bulk until you try it and know you like it. Yuck!
