Hopefully by the time you consider this product, the vendor will have changed their product description and picture so it is clearer than when I mistakenly purchased it.  I tried to work with the vendor but their mailbox was full and I got no response after 4 days.  Fortunately, Amazon's policy and my explanation earned me a refund.<br /><br />When I bought it, the product picture suggested the appearance of foil wrapped Easter eggs.  The description was that is was "Gala mix".  "Gala" means "festive", and the festival was Easter, so I assumed the tin would contain Easter candy.<br /><br />Sadly, "Gala mix" turned out to be a generic mix of sugar free hard candies. We're talking peppermints, root beer, cinnamon, butterscotches - stuff you could easily buy at any grocery or drug store, any day of the year, and for a lot less that what I paid for this tin plus exorbitant shipping.<br /><br />I was willing to pay up to get a nice mix of sugar free Easter candy so I wouldn't have to shop around to find enough sugar free components to make an Easter basket.  The night before Easter, I opened the tin to make my mom's Easter basket, and that's when I found out that the only thing vaguely Easter about this product was the painted tin it was in.  Thankfully between a 24 hour drugstore and a 24 hour supermarket, I was able to get together a small but decent mix to make a basket myself.<br /><br />Blessedly, the time has come and gone when diabetics and people on sugar restricted diets were grateful for ANY sugar free product.  Now there's lots of choices out there.  If you're going to someone's house for Easter and want to bring hard candy as a small thank you gift, this could work.  Still, most people don't associate everyday hard candies with Easter.  More familiar Easter goodies like chocolate eggs, jelly beans, etc are available in sugar free varieties so why not choose those?  It may be a bit more effort, but it will be a lot more thoughtful.
