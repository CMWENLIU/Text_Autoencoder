i love biobags, and use the doggie bags religiously. however, the kitchen bags don't hold up to being stuffed or overstuffed. they stick, rip, leak, and have only worked for me (i use a simplehuman butterfly step can) when i double-bag. like the other reviewed said, they would work great if you are just putting compost in, or in my case i use it to line my bedroom trash and that works great. they can't be filled to the max with heavy trash.
