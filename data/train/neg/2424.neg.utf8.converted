I love Celestial Seasoning's Madagascar Vanilla Red tea, which is sadly becoming harder and harder to find in stores.  But don't order this item.  I placed an order for it, and had the order randomly canceled by the company.  The seller was listed as ABC Wholesale, and it is now listed as RED TAG sale, even though it's the exact same item.  Buy it from another source, it's a great tea.  I personally think it works great in combination with other teas, my favorite is a combination of four bags of this tea and one bag of plum black tea to make a gallon pitcher, which tastes great both hot or cold.
