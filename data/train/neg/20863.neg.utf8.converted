I was kind of excited about this product before it came in.  I found them in a little Atkins carb counter brochure, and thought I'd give it a shot.  I was very disappointed to find out that they do NOT taste like cheese crust. They taste like salted cardboard, but being I am sticking to this low carb thing, I do find myself eating them just for the crunch and the fact that I have already wasted $17 bucks on them.
