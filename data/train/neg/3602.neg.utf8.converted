I have been eating dried blueberries for years.  I mostly buy them from the grocer in smaller portion bags.  I thought I was getting a deal buying these.<br /><br />The blue berries in this pack are very small, yes blue berries are small berries but the berries used by Traverse are extremely small compared to other brands.  The size of the berries was not my main issue with the content of the package I bought.  All berries come with a small amount of oil added to prevent caking.  Traverse uses way to much oil to the point where the flavor of the berries is effected by it.<br /><br />These berries did not taste like the blue berries I had purchased before, all I could taste was the oil.  The berries resembled and tatsed like dried and oiled olives except much smaller.  I did not enjoy them and if I did not toss out the packaging I would of returned them.<br /><br />I would recommend going with a different brand, if not then buy the smaller package first as so you can make sure you like them before spending $50+ dollars on the larger package such as this one.
