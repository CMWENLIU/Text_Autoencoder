I was injured early this summer so I've had to turn to the internet and the mail to get the vegetables I used to be able to buy fresh.  I was amazed to find these at such a great price, but I should have remembered, that you get what you pay for.<br /><br />I've used two of the cans of the 12 I bought and both cans had the same problea. The bottoms are from old, woody artichokes and are very poorly cleaned.  Once you scrape off all the inedible woody tissue, you only have about 40% usable artichoke meat.  I won't be purchasing these again.
