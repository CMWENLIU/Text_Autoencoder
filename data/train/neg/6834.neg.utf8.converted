First, let me say that my husband likes this just fine.  I think it's awful.  We bought it for a recipe.  The aroma of cheap pine incense overwhelms the tea aroma when you open the can, and the same is true of the made tea.  One word:  yuck.  I do not want to use it in the recipe.  I'm sure it would overwhelm all of the other flavors.
