I was very disappointed with my order. The first thing, I did not receive the complete order. When I called , they said they could not help me. I only received only one Barrel of Pretzels. Second the one Barrel i did received looked just awful.<br />I do not even want to open it. I am a Pretzel Lover, and Utz is one of my Favorites. I do not know what happened, but I will never buy this item again through Amazon. I am even concerned about ordering any Food item through Amazon.<br />I have ordered many items through Amazon and I never had a problem until now. It was just disappointed that Amazon did not help me...
