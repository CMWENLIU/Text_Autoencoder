Chocolate Juniors appear to be an average tastykake comprised of cake and chocolate icing. Beware. They aren't as pleasing to your mouth as they are to your eyes (not that theres anything special with presentation of this snack). The sheer smell of the snack will make you question taking the first bite. The reason you choose these over krumpets was probably because they were half off (they're always half off)or they simply ran out of what you wanted. When I was the victim of this snack, I was hungry it was late and I had no alternatives.<br /><br />As you munch into the unholiness of the awful sponge of a once preservative soaked cake your eyes may glisten with regret, sorrow, and dismay. Yes you paid for this. The aftertaste is fortunately easier to deal with than blocking the memory of this horrid cake in the future. Please beware of purchasing this snack. It was one of the most unpleasant encounters with food if had in a while.<br /><br />The next day I shared the snack with some friends and even they too agreed on the terrible taste, and those cakes were from a box purchased in a separate store. The cake I ate was actually fresh and from a nearby factory from where it was purchased. Tastykake has no excuse to sell this product to people. Do they hate us?
