I had a ginger ale from a health food store and was hooked! I have been trying to get away from diet coke, a battle that has been going on for years. I use stevia in the raw in pretty much everything now and was really excited to find a line of sodas that used it. I, or course, was carried away and ordered a case on auto delivery. Mistake. The sodas really are all SOOO sweet, it's nauseating. The makers need to lighten up on the stevia. I still enjoy the ginger ale but am forcing myself to try and get through the remaining case. I can take 2-3 sips of the others before I am turned off. So just get the ginger ale or skip in general. Blah. too bad:(
