I received a small, 1.5 oz brick package of this as part of a gift this Christmas and just made my first, and possibly last, cups in a french press. The grounds do smell delicious, however, the flavor did not make it into the brew itself. It's very acidic/bitter tasting without any significant sweetness to indicate it came from the wonderful smelling grounds. The package recommends 2 rounded tablespoons of coffee for each 6oz cup, which seems high to me. I may try another round using only one tablespoon and see what that generates, but the manufacturer's directions leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.
