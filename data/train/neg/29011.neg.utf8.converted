This is the first time I would be using powdered Kelp and there is no information about this product on the packaging or on this website.  Ingredients--I expected to see 100% sea kelp, but it is not there.  I would like to know how to store this powder--refrigerate or not--not there.  Suggestions of how to use this product--not there.  I will continue to search elsewhere for this information, but this is not right for the company to not provide this information.
