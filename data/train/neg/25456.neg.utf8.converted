Well, I wanted to get these for our cats. I am always looking for things without a lot<br />of grain in them, since we have one cat who gets hot spots if he eats corn or wheat products.<br />As you can imagine, that limits things a lot.<br /><br />I thought this was interesting, because it had rabbit in it. Now, the listing here offers VERY little<br />information, being really vague about the ingredients, etc etc. I wasn't sure if they actually had<br />rabbit in them, or was another reference. So, did some research and wanted to share the list.<br /><br />Here's what is in these "healthy" treats:<br /><br />Rabbit, Rice Flour, Barley Flour, Whole Ground Potato, Maple Syrup, Chicken Meal, Natural Flavor, Tapioca Starch, Glycerine, Cane Molasses, Brewer's Yeast, Canola Oil, Salt, Phosphoric Acid, Sorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Mixed Tocopherols, Rosemary Extract.<br /><br />CALORIE CONTENT (calculated):<br />This treat contains 2,800 kcal/kg or<br />1 kcal/piece ME (metabolized energy)<br />on an as fed basis (calculated).<br /><br />You know, I just don't see cats needing maple syrup or cane molasses. It has to be bad for their teeth.<br />There's also a LOT of starch/carbohydrates in these treats, and cats don't really need a lot of carbs<br />in their diet either - they are MEAT eaters. For something that touts itself as uber healthy, these don't<br />seem to meet the mark. I'm not sure if they call themselves "healthier" because there isn't any corn meal<br />in them, or what yardstick they really used.<br /><br />Decide for yourselves, but be very cautious. We changed our minds about letting<br />the cats have them after reading the ingredients.
