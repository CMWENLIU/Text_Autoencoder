I have been buying Australian Crystalized Ginger from Sweet Energy company for a long time.  Very tasty product but ridiculously expensive.  I therefore decided to give the current item a try.  It is a haphazard mix of good and bad pieces.  But what is very curious is the texture and substance of each piece.  If I could take a wild guess I would say that these pieces seem to be mashed ginger blended with sugar then compacted and molded into solid feeling coins.  On the outside too there is entirely too much sugar.<br />All in all this product is not up to par.
