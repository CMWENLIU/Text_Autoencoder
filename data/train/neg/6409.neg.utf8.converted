This is the first time I tried Octavia White Tea.  After I opened the can, it looked O.K.  The whole leaves looked fairly fresh.  However, as I consumed about one third of the can, I started to see significant amount of yellowish chips and tiny flowers.  In addition, more broken tea leaves were found deeper in the can.<br /><br />I then poured out the entire can of white tea leaves to examine.  I was surprised to see how much impurities were buried in the tea leaves.<br /><br />To be honest, I have not seen that much impurities in a whole leaf tea of any kind (white, green, or black). To me, the tea farm did not do a good job in handling the tea leaves.  I would strongly question the claim of USDA Organic rating of this tea.<br /><br />If you never tried white teas before, please do not assume that the yellowish flowers and chips are part of the white tea.  They are not since this tea is Silver Needle.<br /><br />I had to remove all the impurities by hand-picking all the whole tea leaves and discarding the broken ones and the yellow flowers and chips.  I still question how this tea could be so badly handled by the tea farmer or the tea exporter/importer.<br /><br />I am sure there are better white teas out there.  Tea lovers should share more information on their findings on the many different brands.
