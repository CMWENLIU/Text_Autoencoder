What I thought I was buying was a different a case of the single serve bowls.  3 emails and still no response when i requested an RMA.  Here's what we got.  6 1 oz bowls which sell for 1.09 ea at Target or Walmart add the shipping and the cost of 2.00 for ea total came out to be 3.99 for ea 1 and I repeat 1 ounce container (a large box of cheerios in the supermarket doesn't cost 3.99) We will never do business with these folks again.  No customer service at all.  We have given up not worth the aggravation anymore.
