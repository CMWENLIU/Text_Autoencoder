I have drank many different types of coffee from all over the world. I have been to Hawaii five times, and love Kona coffee. It has a very distinctive taste, which is totally missing from this product. This product tastes no better or worse that a generic brand from wal mart such as Folgers or Maxwell House. It is not as good as Cains. It tastes nothing like Kona coffee. Perhaps I got a bad batch. The web site forced me to give it one star, it does not deserve that.
