This product is OK, but truthfully I've had much more fragrant and tastier oolong teas elsewhere. If you're not an oolong connoisseur I'm sure this brand would be fine...it's price point is decent and it comes in an especially pretty sliver and gold box. However if you really want a treat try a Formosa oolong in a fancy grade.
