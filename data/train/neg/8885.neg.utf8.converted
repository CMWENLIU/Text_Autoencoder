I guess I should have looked around more, I was expecting them in a tub. Instead they were in 3 baggies with sticky ties and it made me feel a bit uneasy.... I was thinking:  who packaged these, where were these packaged and why don't I have any product information included?<br />I don't believe the price was any better than what I could of found in a local candy store or drugstore.  I've purchased more product for less money before.  The Christmas tree shop in Wiliston, VT sells a 4 lb. tub for $5.99  but since I just moved to FL... my local knowledge of stores is limited.<br /><br />I bought these for a specific reason, I am attending a memorial service for a dear relative (who loved these) and I was planning on bringing them and putting them in dishes for those attending the service, instead because of the small size of them (I've seen larger ones) and because they have too much sugar on them, I will be keeping them at home and buying others somewhere else.
