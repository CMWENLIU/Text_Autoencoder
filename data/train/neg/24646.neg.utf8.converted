Everyone's tastes are different. With that said, I would definitely recommend trying these first. I tried Nescafe Latte Machiatto pods (along with some other flavors) in the machine I bought that uses these pods. Really wanted to like them but they were AWFUL. Bitter, synthetic--like something from a vending machine. The Dolce Gusto espresso/cappuccino/latte maker has been returned to Amazon; unfortunately, the pods are a grocery item so not eligible for return. I have two boxes--50 dollars' worth--of the cappuccino pods sitting in the box they arrived in--feel like I put fifty bucks into my office shredder. Bottom line is, should have tried them before ordering any equipment/pods off the internet. Save your cash--try them first!
