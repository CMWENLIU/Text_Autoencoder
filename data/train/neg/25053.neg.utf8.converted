I love the Honest Teas and the lightly sweetened 1/2 Tea 1/2 lemonade so I picked up some zero calorie Honest Ade Classic Lemonade.  It tastes like lemon-scented soap smells.  It is so over-sweet I gagged on my first sip.  Do not make the same mistake I did.  Just go with the regular lower calorie versions of this brand's offerings.  Skip the stevia-sweetened disgusting zero calorie versions.  I can't get the taste out of my mouth an hour later.  So nasty.
