I was VERY disappointed in the Chai Tea Latte.  I was very excited to try it and after brewing my first cup the smell was of a wonderful creamy pumpkin pie.  But after my first sip I knew there was something horribly wrong.  Sure enough I realized I should have looked at the ingredients before spending $9.  The chai tea disk contains Splenda (sucralose) which to those of us who can't stand the stuff, and can detect it in any food no matter how subtle the metallic aftertaste, was a HUGE disappointment.  It makes no sense to me why the makers would use Splenda to sweeten the chai tea when the latte creamer includes sugar already.  So if you like or don't mind Splenda you will probably really enjoy this.  On the other hand if you are sensitive to it your first cup may also be your last, as mine was.  :(
