While the product seems O.K. the expiration date is in code.  After 5 days of calling the customer service 800 number to find out the expiration date and getting a full voice mail that was unable to to take messages.  I looked up and called the main number at my expense.  When I explained what I had been encountering the woman said "just a minute" and promptly transferred me to the same full (now for 6 days)voice mail.  When I called back and explain again the situation the woman got very rude and and asked me "what the heck I needed to know the expiration date for anyway".  I simply ended the call and decided this was a "consumer food company" I would never deal with again.
