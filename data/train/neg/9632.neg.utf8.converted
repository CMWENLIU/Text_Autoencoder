I received the Aerogarden as a gift. I have a green thumb and can grow anything. I looked forward to having fresh herbs to cook with. There are several things that make this product quite bad.<br /><br />1.) The light is a beacon! The grow light has to be on 14-15 hours a day and is incredibly bright. This won't be a problem if you have a kitchen far away from your bedroom but if you have an apartment it will present a problem.<br /><br />2.)It does not work. I tried once to grow the herbs exactly as instructed. It didn't work. The plants grew only a little bit and then died after a few weeks. I ordered more seed pods to try again, trouble shooted using the FAQ's on the Aerogarden website and again the plants grew a little bit and died. I am a gardener the product does not work.<br /><br />3.)Complete lack of customer service. I called and emailed trying to get ahold of the company to tell them the product does not work and try to get some support. I got an auto reply from Aerogarden that said "we are experiencing a high volume of emails and are currently 3 weeks behind in replying" Well it has now been 2 months and I still have not heard a thing.<br /><br />SAVE YOUR MONEY! This product does not work.
