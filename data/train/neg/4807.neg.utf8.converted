Macaroni and cheese is a number 1 comfort food for me.  I've enjoyed both the Velveeta and Kraft brands before.  However, this cheesy skillet dinner kit falls very short of my expectations for the following reasons:<br /><br />- Chicken is not included in the kit even though the box label says chicken and brocolli.  I figured there would be canned chicken supplied but there wasn't.  So you need to add 1 pound of skinless chicken breast to this recipe as per the instructions on the back of the box.<br />- The pasta looks like Risotto (grains of rice).<br />- The dish is very salty.<br />- There was no broccoli taste to the dish even though there were the dried broccoli florets that were added at the end.<br />- Except for the chicken, the meal has the consistency of porridge so I had to eat it with a spoon.<br /><br />There are two calorie and nutrition counts on the box--as packaged and as prepared.  As packaged it's 270 calories per serving at 5 servings per box with 80 fat calories or 390 calories with 100 fat calories if you add the chicken. There's 620mg of sodium per serving but it tasted much more salty to me.<br /><br />I ate it, it was okay, but I would never purchase this dinner kit because I did not find it satisfying.  The only thing I liked a little was the cheesy flavor.
