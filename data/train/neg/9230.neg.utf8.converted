Mother's milk tastes not bad. I am not sure whether it increased my milk since my production did not reduce after I stopped using it. However, be careful of the side effects! My baby showed diarrea, colic sympton, and stomach upset during my use of herb. All symptons went away after I got rid of Mother's milk. If you read PARENTING magazine of October 2011 issue(page 32), you'll know that ANISE, which is one of the main indegrients of Mother's Milk, might cause dangerous neurological problems of children. So, again, be careful of the side effects!
