People who have experience making Kefir tell me that what<br />I received may never develop into true Kefir grains. What I<br />received is a business sized envelope with a badly copied<br />letter telling me: 1. feed them milk daily - it will take 4<br />to 6 weeks to get Grains. 2. A fraction of an ounce of some<br />milky looking substance that  was squashed flat by the mail<br />canceling machine.  3. I can send questions by email, but he<br />only answers questions from those who can prove that they also<br />bought his video about Kefir and can prove it by sending the<br />electronic receipt. In my opinion, this product should receive<br />a NEGATIVE 6 stars.
