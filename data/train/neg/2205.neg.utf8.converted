My wife and I independently taste-tested this product. My wife is a regular consumer of dark chocolates while I tend to prefer milk chocolate, and/or chocolates with fillings. After trying it out, we both decided that we would not purchase this product in the future, though for different reasons. Here are our independent reviews:<br /><br />My wife: I am confused by the labeling of this product. It is called a 'dark chocolate' but has a 54% cacao content. Most dark chocolates that I buy have upwards of 65% - 75% cacao. When I first opened the package, I noticed a smoky aroma. I eat a lot of dark chocolate, including raw chocolate, but I never noticed such a smoky aroma before and found it pleasant. My first bite was disappointing. It is a bit too sweet for me, and is certainly significantly sweeter than the dark chocolates that I buy. It is smooth, which I like. While I appreciate the fact that Newman's own is producing an organic, minimally processed, chocolate I will not purchase this again.<br /><br />Me: From my first bite I knew that this chocolate was not for me. It had a distinctly waxy feel that I usually associate with inferior chocolates - this was an immediate turnoff. There was absolutely nothing distinctive about this chocolate - no fruity notes, no particular bitterness, nothing that sticks out. While this chocolate is better than a lot of what constitutes the mass market, I cannot recommend it.
