This product did not work at all for me for deer in Texas, (where the deer population is 6 million or so). Most of the rave reviews are concerning squirrels or rabbits, but my problem was deer. The squirrels and rabbits don't eat that much and I always plant a little extra anyway.<br />The product is called "Deer Off", and has a picture of a deer running on it. Toward my pea patch, I suppose.<br />I noticed the deer had visited my 60 foot row of purple hull and zipper peas(about 18" high and blooming), the previous night, and had nibbled a little on one end. I went back to the house and got the miracle bottle that my wife had bought a few months earlier just for this occasion.<br />I sprayed about half a bottle of Deer Off (ready to use) till everything was wet, and the next morning it looked like you ran over it with a lawn mower, and deer tracks were everywhere. The deer absolutely ate the stems and all right to the ground.<br />They ought to sell this stuff to hunters for a lure.<br />So it's off to the grocery store to buy peas.<br />No satisfaction from Woodstream customer service either. They have a 30 day limit on refunds.<br />Live and learn.<br />Terry
