I tried this in hot water and it tasted and felt like greasy water (and I mean spit it out into the sink greasy). It did have a nice aroma. I added some unsweetened hot chocolate and it was awful so I put in some saccharin. It tasted like greasy hot chocolate. I fail to see the charm.<br /><br />I've also tried melting it onto warm pancakes. It doesn't spread well. Butter or margarine makes the pancakes taste a lot better than this does. They are much cheaper and they spread easier.<br /><br />Also there is some confusion here. Some say coconut is bad for you. Others, mostly new age types, say it cures everything. It's a panacea. Very suspicious. One thing for sure it's high in calories. If you're eating it out of the jar, you're taking in a lot of calories. Of course maybe you don't believe in calories. I do. I've heard some claims that eating this stuff will cause you to lose weight. I seriously doubt that.<br /><br />I like coconut, but I haven't found a use for this stuff and my lips are still greasy.
