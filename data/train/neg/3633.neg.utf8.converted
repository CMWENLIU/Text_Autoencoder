"Alaska Smokehouse Alaska Smokehouse Salmon Sampler Gift Basket, 2-Pound Packages" led me to believe this is a 2 pound salmon package.<br /><br />It turned out what they meant is that  total package is 2 pound, including basket and stuffing materials.<br /><br />I weighted the 3 piece salmon they shipped: total weight is 300gm, or 0.66 pound. so this salmon costs is $34/lb?
