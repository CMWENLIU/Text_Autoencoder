I should of realized that that concentrated of pill would not work in cold water but I didn't. I bought these for putting in my ice tea and I did and they didn't dissolve. I waited and waited and they didn't dissolve. So next I thought I would put them in a small bowl and put hot tap water in to melt them, I did and it took around 4 minutes to dissolve completely. That's just too long for me.<br />If you're not using them in piping hot coffee I would suggest getting Stevia in either liquid or granulated. This I would pass on.
