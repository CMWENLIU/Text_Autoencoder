This product is falsely advertised as white tea.  On the Amazon website under Important Information it says:  "Ingredients: Organic White Tea."  I opened 1 bag and it did not look or smell like white tea.  I looked on the side of the box and in very small print is says: "Slightly fermented green tea blended with silver buds and silver tea leaves"  This product is listed as non returnable item.  If you want white tea do not get sucked into ordering this by false advertising.  I wanted white tea as it has less caffeine and I do not like the taste of green tea.  This is probably not even organic either.  On this date 8/6/11 this product description says Ingredients: Organic White Tea."  If you see the above green tea anywhere under this product...the 100 count box pack of 4, you'll know they changed the description as I found the green tea ingredients listed for the 24 count box pack of 6 of the same tea.  Someone screwed up.
