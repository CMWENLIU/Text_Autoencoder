Waaaayyyyyyy too expensive but I needed to fill my kids gumball machine for her birthday.  I figured since it's Double Bubble they would at least have great, lasting flavor.  First part yes, second no!  Looks great in the machine but very disappointed with the short lived flavor, especially at this price.
