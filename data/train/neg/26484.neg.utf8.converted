My children and I have had the Strawberry Banana Crisps and have loved them.  But after a while they started to pick out just the strawberry pieces.  So when I saw they had a plain strawberry option here I was thrilled.  When they arrived I was shocked to find out that unlike the strawberry banana variety, which are nicely sliced pieces, the strawberries were WHOLE strawberries.  And also unlike the strawberries in strawberry banana combination these strawberries were BITTER.  I mean inedible bitter.  Just a word of caution that Amazon does not take returns on grocery items.  I am now out $20.
