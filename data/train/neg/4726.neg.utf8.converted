We have been eating this cereal for some time now, buying it at Whole Foods.  We could go through a couple boxes a week.  I'm giving one star because when it arrived it tasted terrible, like it had been stored in a warehouse with a lot of fumes for a couple years.  I will be buying the cereal for more at whole foods but at least I know it will taste good!
