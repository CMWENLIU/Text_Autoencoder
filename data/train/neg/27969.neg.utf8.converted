I have always enjoyed Pacific Chai Latte. Liking my Keurig, I decided to try Cafe Escapes Chai Latte when I saw it. To begin with, I found the Pacific Chai was much creamier than the more watery Cafe Escapes Chai. The amount of spice in the CE Chai was overwhelming in taste, whereas the Pacific Chai spices lent a nice balance to the flavor of the drink. Lastly, I like the granularized honey in the Pacific Chai much more than the Sucralose in the CE Chai, which left a bad aftertaste in my mouth after each sip and required food or brushing teeth to get rid of.<br /><br />Personally, I wouldn't buy or recommend the CE Chai.
