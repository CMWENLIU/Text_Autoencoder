TwinLab super rich yeast had RAVING fan reviews; and looked to me like it would be the right choice.<br />I am on a totally vegan diet for personal health reasons, and "nutritional yeast" is a frequent ingredient in vegan recipe books.<br />...Imagine my disappointment when i received the product (Amazon really is Amazin' at fast shipping), pulled out the product, and tried a taste.<br />Something didn't seem right.  A closer look at the ingredients told me why.<br />The third ingredient is "whey (from milk)".<br />Egad, boys and girls! THAT's NOT VEGAN!<br /><br />Well, I'm not blaming anyone but myself.<br />I lapsed my habit of reading the label before buying, and did so at the wrong time.<br />And I will find the "nutritional yeast" of my dreams; oh, yes I will.<br />I know you are out there somewhere; and I shall not rest until I have found you.
