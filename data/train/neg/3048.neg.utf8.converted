I ordered this 5 pound bag of Gummi Bears and ate them while watching basketball games one weekend. Yep, ate the whole bag. I then blew chunks all over the carpet. Yep, I woofed, I puked. Some of my vomit even got onto Eric's shoes, the guy who was sitting next to me, as well as my own shoes. I could see tiny chunks of chewed up gummy bears in my barf. So, I don't recommend that you buy this 5 pound bag unless you want to heave all over your own carpet and shoes. Its not worth it, unless you do want to regurgitate on Eric's shoes.
