I saw this on the shelf at my local grocery store and thought, "What a brilliant idea!" I love peanut butter, and the thought of consuming more than a few spoonfuls of the stuff was enough to make me purchase it. Upon opening the jar, I was met by a wobbling mass of glutinous, jelly-like stuff. I dipped a spoon in, stirred it up, and introduced a generous dollop into my mouth. My reaction: BLECHHHHH! The "peanut spread" did not make it down my throat, but the aftertaste stuck with me for hours. I use Splenda frequently in my tea and cereal, but oh lord, this stuff is DISGUSTING. It went straight into the trash can. What a waste of $4.
