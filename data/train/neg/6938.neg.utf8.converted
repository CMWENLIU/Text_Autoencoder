This mix only makes one round cake and the flavor and texture are not as good as you would expect - even for gluten free. I have even added more vanilla and sugar on one attempt. I added a packet of vanilla pudding mix to make up for the poor flavor on another try, but it didn't work either. The chocolate version is much better. The flavor is not good enough to buy again and it doesn't even make a whole 2 layer cake.
