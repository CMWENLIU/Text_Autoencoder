I've been buying other brands of coconut oil from Amazon such as Nature's Way and Nutiva. Those are good brands. I ran out and I saw this brand at my grocery store so I bought it. First of all, the packaging... it comes in bottle that is just like a shampoo bottle, cheap plastic and not at all appetizing... and then the most ridiculous thing of all is the teeny tiny spout for dispensing the product--coconut oil is a SOLID at room temperature! How are you supposed to dispense a SOLID out of this teeny spout!?!<br /><br />I had to do as others did, I warmed the bottle until the oil melted and I poured it all into another more practical container, a jar. But immediately the oil smells BAD, it has a burnt smell. And unlike the pure white virgin coconut oils from the other suppliers I mentioned, this has a brown tint and some brown gunk that settles to the bottom of the jar. Yuck! This oil is NOT extra virgin, or even virgin coconut oil like the others. It seems very cheap and impure. For all I know they used solvents to extract it. It's very suspect.<br /><br />I used it for cooking until I could buy a better brand. It's OK for on your skin, but that's about it. I will never buy this again.
