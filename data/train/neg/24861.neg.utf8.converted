This small package of noodles came to me in a huge box, which I thought was a huge waste and completely unnessecary.  And, when I opened the box, a small melted ice pack failed to keep the noodles cold, so they were hot and smelled terrible.  I had to throw them in the trash outside right away because of the smell, and called Gristedes and left an upset, yet polite message.  It has been almost a week and I have not heard from them.  Don't waste your money on this supposedly "great deal."  It's not worth it.
