After ordering the gummies, they arrived hard tasting and stale.  The date indicated freshness until Jan 2008.  After calling customer service and receiving a replacement bag, the result was almost the same.  They were a little bit gummier but no where near the taste and softness it should have.  I recommend buying the smaller bags (5 oz) from Walmart.  At least you can select a bag that feels soft and fresh.
