I recently purchased a 50 X pack of Butter Toffee K Cups. I'm experiencing an alarming number of K cups bursting during the brewing process. It seems as though some of the K Cups aren't as pressurized as other and the ones with less pressure seem to be the ones that burst. I'd estimate that I've had about 30% of the 50 cups blow coffee grounds out all over my brewer. Purchased through and sold by Amazon.com
