I bought this salt after seeing it had mostly favorable reviews. This one has a strange chemical smell as someone else had commented, and didnt think it had that much "truffleness" out of the box, even though there are very visible chunks floating around.  I had gotten another truffle salt from a friend as a gift, Fusion Truffle Salt.  It was great at first but faded fast but no chemical smell.  Best one I've tried so far is O & Co and its not sold on Amazon.  :0(
