I love pumpkin and pumpkin spice products, so I was very excited to order this tea when I saw it available on Amazon.  Unfortunately, it has fallen very short of my expectations.  I cannot detect any pumpkin flavor.  It simply tastes like a basic chai.  I don't dislike chai, but that's not what I thought I was buying based on all the glowing reviews here.  I cannot recommend this product.
