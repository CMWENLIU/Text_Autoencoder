I just love my Keurig and I've enjoyed tasting all of the different coffees in the sampler pack so when I ordered this hot cocoa I thought it would be as good as the coffee. I was wrong, dead wrong. This cocoa is terrible and tastes like sugary hot water. You honestly get no chocolate taste at all. I had such high hopes for this hot chocolate and all I have now is the hot cocoa blahs.
