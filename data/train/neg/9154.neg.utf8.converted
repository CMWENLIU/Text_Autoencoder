My mom made this brownie mix for me during a visit.  The taste and texture are great and it's wonderful that they stuck to pretty natural ingredients.  However, I have my doubts as to how "GF" it really is, because it gave me my usual gluten stomachache.  I ate the brownies a couple of times over the next few days and each time I got that characteristic stomachache.  Hate to post a negative review because I'm so supportive of mainstream efforts to make GF foods available, but the truly gluten intolerant and celiac crowd should watch their reactions to this product carefully.
