I bought this product after reading so many positive reviews, and unfortunately, I am not a big fan like everyone else.  We have tried it twice, following the recipe exactly as it states and we found the waffles to be bland at best.  We prefer the Bisquick version which is much cheaper than buying this.  Oh well, we tried.  You can buy waffle mixes at your local grocery stores better than what this taste.<br /><br />UPDATE: Because the order is a pack of 3, we decided to give one to our neighbors to try and see if we were being picky.  They also did not care for this product at all. They said they were dry and had no taste.  They even wondered if the other reviews on here were authentic since they could not understand what was all the fuss about.<br /><br />Now what shall I do with the third can?
