First, let me say that this product is high quality--once you get it, it is great.  Getting it, however, is a hassle.<br /><br />When I ordered this item, I was sent only a single box of barley, instead of the case (12 boxes) I had ordered and paid for.  Trying to get this problem resolved involved frequent interactions with customer service.  Amazon attempted to fix the problem by resending the order, but made the same mistake again, sending only 5 BOXES instead of the 5 CASES I had requested (and paid for).  Ultimately, I was told that Amazon was unable to fix this glitch, and my order was cancelled.  Until the problem is rectified, it doesn't make sense, in my opinion, to purchase this item.
