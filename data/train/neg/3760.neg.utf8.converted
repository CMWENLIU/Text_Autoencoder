I did not find Ultra Shea conditioner to be any better than my regular regimen.  If anything it may have been more drying.<br /><br />I tried the product as directed with very poor results.  Immediately after drying my hair, it felt even drier than before I shampooed and conditioned. Within two days I had to wash my hair again, as it was bone dry.<br /><br />I decided to give the conditioner another try, this time as a deep conditioner along with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9G0">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil, 3 Fluid Ounce</a>.  There was some improvement in the overall moisture levels of my hair, but not enough to warrant changing from my routine of cholesterol and coconut oil conditioners.  Within days my hair was dry and brittle.  (Other than the hair dryer, I do not use any heated appliances on my hair.)<br /><br />I tried the conditioner once more as directed with the same results as before.<br /><br />Because of the increased need to shampoo, condition, and dry my hair, I feel like I experienced more breakage than I normally would have under my normal routine.
