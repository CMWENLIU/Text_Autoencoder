I'm an experienced gardener but thought I would extend my grow season.  Long story short....<br />paid a LOT for this system, herb plants were so wimpy and weak after two months.  called them and was told they had a problem with their nutrient tablets, sent out new ones.  One month later, string thin plants, no progress.  I purchased new lights $20 per set and a new flower kit for $25 and continued using distilled water and....nothing.  The new flower kit sent up a few very wimpy flowers, but mainly looked rangy and unhealthy.  ONe last try, bought new nutrients and still nothing much.<br />I am trying not to add up the kit, lights, nutrients, distilled water and time that went into a few flowers and a handful of herbs.  I grow 100 times that much in pots on my deck.<br />Also, its very important to note that I tried twice to post my reviews on their website and guess what? Disappeared.<br />They only post top rated reviews, no complaints welcome.  Kudos to Amazon, amazing that you can get the true scoop from others instead of a bunch of fake positive reviews, right?<br />Save your money, this is a gimmick,
