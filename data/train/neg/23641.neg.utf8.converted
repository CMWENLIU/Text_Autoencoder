Let me first say that I am a foodie.  I smoke my own ribs, chicken, etc and when I make brisket it smokes slow and low for at least 14 hours.  I have fresh herbs in my kitchen all year and I like to cook foods with robust flavor in styles from around the word.  I am an avid reader of Cook's Illustrated, Saveur, Bon Appetit, etc.<br /><br />While an interesting novelty, this seasoning takes more like a standard smoke flavored BBQ seasoning than actual bacon in my opinion.  What is worse is that all the flavors but the natural one contain MSG.  MSG is something I try to avoid if at all possible because isn't healthy and often gives me headaches.  The natural version of this seasoning has less flavor than the rest unfortunately, as other reviewers have noted, as that is the only one I'm willing to use.  If you love the taste of bacon I would recommend doing what professional chefs have done for years: reserve your bacon fat after cooking it and add a little as seasoning when you want the REAL taste of bacon.
