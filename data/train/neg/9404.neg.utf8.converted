I rarely complain about things but something is up with these K-Cups.  My wife and I got a few sample mudslide k-cups from a water distributor and really liked it.  We went looking around and found this great deal on amazon for the 50 k-cups.  Now they say mudslide on them, and I even checked the label against some other Gloria Jean coffee K-Cups we have and they appear to be the same.  However, they definitely do not taste like mudslide.  I tried cleaning my machine, running clear water cycles before brewing, etc and it doesn't help.  Not sure if it's just a bad box or something more but I definitely will not be purchasing them here again.
