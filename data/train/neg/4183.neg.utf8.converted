I have tried several of the premix bases for dog food. My dog is on a raw diet. When this bag of premix arrived, I was terribly disappointed. It was like receiving a bag of mulched grass. There was very little fruits or vegetables as claimed on the label. It smells like a bag of fresh cut hay. From the look and smell, it's almost all alfalfa. There are other premixed bases available that are much better. I am mixing it with other mixes to make it more appealing to my dog.
