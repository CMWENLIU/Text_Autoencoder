My family lovees to eat pho and since we are on a gluten free diet, we decided to try Happy Pho since it got rave reviews. We were so excited when the box came on our front porch but our excitement was short-lived. The spice packet was awful. It tasted old and bitter (alot of cardamon). I don't mind cardamon, but it tasted off. On the plus side, the noodles were good, but it is awfully expensive to buy it just for the noodles. We bought fresh ingredients as suggested and squeezed alot of lime, but it didn't help any. We ended up throwing away the spice packets and used the noodles to make other things.
