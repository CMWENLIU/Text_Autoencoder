I was about to order this when I discovered that despite it being listed prominantly as a Prime-eligible item, the reality is that a) you will be charged $25.95 for shipping (!) and b) they will e-mail you AFTER you order with an "estimated delivery date".<br /><br />I don't pay for a prime membership to get ripped-off in this fashion. This is the second time I've placed a Prime order with Amazon and had them pull a bait-and-switch on me. The last time I didn't catch it until after the order was delivered. Thankfully I noticed before completing the order this time!<br /><br />I can not comment on the product itself but I certainly can't recommend enough that you DO NOT purchase it from Amazon!
