Why would a pet food that calls itself "organics" have NON organic "chicken meal" as the 2nd ingredient? I'm disappointed by this and most of the organic pet foods that include non-organic chicken meal, like this one, Newman's Own, and the "Organix" brand, or the other one that seems to be rarely organic is the chicken fat.<br /><br />So far the only really organic dry cat food I've found (all the main ingredients are organic) is PetGuard, and wow is it expensive. Best price I could find it was about 1/3 more than Nature Organics.<br /><br />I hope Nature Organics will revise this product to only include organic chicken products.
