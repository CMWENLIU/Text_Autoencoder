My colleagues and I were anxiously awaiting the arrival of this coffee. We are "Coffee People" and all of us have wondered how good Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee would be. None of us have tried it because it is cost prohibitive.<br />The coffee received was stale and bitter. We were expecting to pay a premium for this coffee, however, we were not expecting the Sanka style flavor. Because we were not able to return of exchange this coffee, we were essentially ripped off. Enjoy the forty dollars Hawaii Roasters, it is the last you will receive from any of us.
