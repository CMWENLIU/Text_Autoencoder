I can't believe an organic company like Earth's Best would produce a product that has BPA in it. The lids of all their jars have BPA in them. I contacted their customer service department and was told that it doesn't come in contact with the food as long as the lid isn't heated. But how do we control how hot the jars get while in transit to the store? So disappointing.
