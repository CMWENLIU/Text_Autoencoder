ANGRY AT VERY MISLEADING NUTRITIONAL LABELLING  Jan 1, 2011<br /><br />The packages presented, online, or on the shelves at the market, appear about the size of a large cup (not bowl) of soup. If you got a smaller portion in a restaurant, you would complain.<br /><br />However the misleading nutritional info says the "serving size" is 1 cup. However, 1 CUP BARELY COVERS THE BOTTOM OF THE SOUP DISH YOU USE AT HOME!!!! Try it for yourself with a cup (8oz) of milk, and decide whether that represents a "normal" serving.<br /><br />If the REAL LIFE FOR REAL PEOPLE serving size is 1 container of their product=2 cups(=16 oz)),then the sodium is a whopping 960 Mg, 40% of the suggested Daily Value, and FAR, FAR, FAR FROM A "HEALTHY CHOICE"...And that's assumiung you have nothing else with the soup; not bread, not anything at all.<br /><br />This is NOT a little thing, if you, like so many of us, are trying to be mindful of your salt consumption, just as a matter of general health.<br /><br />THE MANUFACTURES REALIZE THOSE AT ALL CONCIOUS THEIR SALT, WOULD BUY LESS OF THEIR PRODUCT, AND HENCE IN TINY PRINT, SMALLER THAN MY MICROSOFT WORD CAN EVEN REPRODUCE, AND "COINCIDENTALLY" ON THE BUMPY, CURVED PORTION OF THE CONTAINER, (MAKING IT EVEN LESS LIKELY TO BE READ), THEY LIST THE FACT THAT THE CONTAINER IS 2 "SERVINGS", AND ALLOW US TO HAPPILY POISON OURSELVES OVERDOSING WITH SALT, this WHILE BEING SO INCREDIBLY CYNICAL AND SLEAZY AS TO LABEL THEIR PRODUCT AS "HEALTHY". HEALTHY INDEED, THE SAME WAY AS A HOT FUDGE SUNDAY AND FRIED ONION RINGS WOULD BE.<br /><br />GOD HELP US ALL IF YOU, LIKE I, MAKE THE MISTAKE*** OF EATING 2 CANS FOR DINNER WITH SOME SALAD TWICE A WEEK, THINKING WE ARE EATING HEALTHIER AND LOWER CALORIE FOOD, ONLY TO LEARN YOU(AND YOUR KIDS?) HAVE BEEN OVERDOSING ON SALT (ASSUMING YOU EAT ANYTHING ELSE DURING YOUR DAY!), SINCE 2 CANS, ABOUT THE SIZE OF ONE "REAL" SERVING OF SOUP, CONTAINS 80% OF THE RECOMMENDED MAXIMUM SALT INTAKE- JUST BY ITSELF... Ans many cardiologists and other internists say even that level is far too high.<br /><br />I AM NOT SUGGESTING THESE (Con Agra) ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE TO CREATE SUCH MISLEADING ADVERTISING & LABELLING, BUT NEITHER ARE THEY EXEMPT FROM RESPONSIBLE LABELLING to permit consumers to make informed choices.<br /><br />BTW, IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THEY USE SIMILAR MISLEADING PRACTICES ON THERI OTHER "HEALTHY CHOICE" PRODUCTS. CAVEAT EMPTOR, AND GOD BLESS THE FDA, FOR "PROTECTING US" FROM SUCH DECEPTIONS.<br /><br />***I only learned of this by reading other reviews which alerted me to the deception. I am an MBA from a top university with 30 years work experience, and do not think os myself as either inatentive or uncomprehending. This labelling, you can be sure, has been tested through many consumer test panels-they know exactly what they are doing.
