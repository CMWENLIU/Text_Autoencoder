I hate to write a bad review, but it was so bad, we had to throw them away, or just let them sit in my cupboard.  No one in my family would eat them.  I tried to eat them because I did not want to waste the money, but they were so strong and salty they made me sick to my stomach.  I was very disappointed, I was looking forward to something lighter, maybe crunchy?  These were very heavy little cheese bricks dipped in a very strong cheesy salty flavor...  Nasty... 8 out of 8 of us agreed...
