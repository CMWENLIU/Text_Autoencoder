We LOVE the peanut butter puffins, but the chocolate peanut butter puffins are just not as good.  It's not that the chocolate parts are not chocolately enough, they are for a natural cereal.  It's just that they are small and kind of stale-tasting.  I don't know if it's because it's bulk packaging or what.  It doesn't take the family long to burn through a box so I know they haven't been sitting around my house...either way, I think I'll stick to the peanut butter puffins.  They are delicious!
