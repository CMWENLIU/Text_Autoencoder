Our baby really loves to eat these and they come in glass, Great! But we discontinued using them after I found a web posting that the manufacturer uses lids that contain BPA! I emailed their customer service department (10/2010) and the company confirmed that BPA is used in the lids. This smacks of the worst kind of marketing, taking advantage of the organic label and the potential health benefits but selling it in inferior packaging, legal yes, but not really in the spirit of the organic movement. For Pete's sake the lid itself has the word "organic" written on it 6 times! We stopped using all the companies products including the dry oatmeal and rice because we personally found it such a dishonest practice (he loved those too unfortunately) so in summary good food, bad implementation.
