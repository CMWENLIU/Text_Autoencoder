The bag describes these as "Dark Chocolate Acai with Blueberry".  So, I bought these thinking I was getting a dried acai berry or blueberry covered with dark chocolate.  After a closer reading of the front of the bag as well as the ingredient list, the thing that is covered with chocolate is described as a "fruit juice piece".  The ingredient list names several fruit juice concentrates in addition to acai and blueberry.  I've heard of "dried fruit pieces" and I've heard of "fruit juice", but what is a "fruit juice piece"?  I didn't know you could have a piece of juice!  It seems like all of Brookside's products contain the mystery "fruit juice pieces".  What exactly is covered with dark chocolate?
