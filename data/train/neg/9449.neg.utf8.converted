I've bee subscribing to this coffee for months now and have had multiple shipments, all quality until this last shipment.  I opened the new box today, made a cup, and wondered why it was so watery. Made a second thinking it was a fluke. It was not.  Seems now 3 kcups into the box, the whole box is full of kcups with about half the coffee in them there should be.  Instead of it being strong and bold like dark magic is supposed to be (I've drank this coffee daily for two years now so I should know)... It's weak and watery even on making a smaller cup of it.  Amazon won't let me return it.  I'm a dedicated amazon customer and use subscribe and save for many items.  If they won't treat me like a dedicated customer I might be stopping my membership.  Hoping they'll make it right.
