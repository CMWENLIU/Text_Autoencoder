This product is a disappointment. There was more of a candy coating than sunflower seed and the candy was not tasty at all. It had a stale and smoky quality to it that I did not expect and I could not find one person that tried them who liked the taste at all. The best part of these, unfortunately, is their look and vibrant colors - that's about it.
