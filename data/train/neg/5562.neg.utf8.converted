I bought this product thinking I could use it to make chicken salad, not possible.  It was a can of jellied, mushy tiny pieces of chicken with only a few pieces large enough to use in chicken salad.  It might be okay to use to make chicken and noodles for the flavor, if you added several cans of Swanson canned chicken.  I will not buy it again.
