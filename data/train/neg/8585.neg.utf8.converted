It tastes allright, but that's not why we use it.  Acai berries are famous for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect.  I was used to Acai and its effects--I started with MonaVie Active Juice, and it changed my and my husband's lives.  The recession hit and we started looking around for a substitute.  The supermarket liquid brands were worthless and tasted awful.  Then we found Vitamin World Acai powder, which tasted fine, and amazingly we felt even better than we had on MonaVie!  But Vitamin World discontinued it and we were crushed.  We tried the Sambazon, which has been hyped tremendously, figuring it should be at least as good as the VW version.  But no--it doesn't mix well, the flavor isn't quite as good, and worst of all, my pain was back!  I have found a supply of the VW type, but it appears to be limited.  I don't know how I'll get by after that.  Homeopathic Arnica <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00020HTTS">Hyland's - Arnica Montana 30x, 250 tablets</a> helps.
