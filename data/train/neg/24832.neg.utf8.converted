I tried truvia in my coffee for a week.  After I had it, I felt very queasy.  So much that I took a pregnancy test(it felt exactly like morning queasiness during pregnancy).  I know some people who use it and feel fine, but I guess some people have bad reactions to the sugar alcohol.  I read online that it gives some people diarrhea and gas too. I think I am going to stick with agave nectar...
