<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141OWXU">Dogswell Veggie Life Vitality Sweet Potato Chew Treats for All Dogs, 5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>A year ago these treats were perfect and my pooch loved them, "just what the doctor ordered". HOWEVER, the recent shipments have been of inferior quality, poor quality. The product is dried-up and as far as my dog is concerned, unacceptable. She refuses to eat the treats and walks away from them. While the expiration date is in 2012 the product has to be tossed, it is anything but fresh.<br /><br />What illuminates this even more is that the local pet store is now stocking these treats. At the pet store, the products look and are soft and well managed and loved by the pooch. Clearly the treats from the AMAZON vendor is without quality and may have been rejects.<br /><br />While the cost in the pet store is much higher, it is well worth it.  Proves that you get what you pay for. If  it is 'Happy Hips' that your dog likes go the pet store or perhaps AMAZON will find a quality supplier.
