It is so faint &  subtle the flavor & taste, that I was disappointed. I loved the taste of the Simply Organic brand, stronger  flavor of Cinnamon even if it is the type to be careful how much you eat in one day. Darn.<br /><br />I used 1 tsp for tea & it irritated my stomach, I added liquid stevia then really enjoyed flavor as a tea.<br />I really enjoyed the stronger bite of the other non-ceylon types & did not get any irritation in my stomach. Seems my experience is opposite most others. I have thick blood & needed the blood thinner properties of the other types of Cinnamon....hm..<br />I needed to order toxin free so I went for this Ceylon Cinnamon powder.<br />Maybe it will grow on me now that I have 16 oz of it.
