MADE IN CHINA, MADE IN CHINA, MADE IN CHINA.  Buyers beware if your concerned where your dog treats are made.<br /><br />Reading the smokehouse home page the following statement says nothing about duck treats so I figured they are safe and made in the USA.<br /><br />"Smokehouse makes the vast majority of our treats at our plant in Sun Valley, Ca. but we do import some of our chicken treats from China. All imported chicken treats are extensively tested here in the United States by an independent laboratory. No product is shipped out until all lab test are back. In the many years we have been importing and testing these products nothing has ever been found that could be harmful to our pets."<br /><br />I received my package of duck treats, opened them up to feed my dog while telling my friends I ordered these from amazon because they were not made in china and looked at the back of the package and saw the three dreaded words  MADE IN CHINA.  Gasp.  Return, return, return.
