I set my account up for this item with Amazon.com to ship two cases of pink ALASKAN salmon every month. I received my first two cases and lo and behold, one case says " made in Alaska" and the other case says made in THIALAND. The Alaskan salmon I would buy again and again but unless someone in Amazon.com can guarantee me that the salmon I receive is made and packaged in Alaska, I will definitely cancel my order immediately. I believe firmly in buying American for a number of reasons and none of them are political ( will most of them anyway)l. More of us, I believe, should think this way in order to produce more jobs in our country and not depend on other countries, and whatever their sanitary conditions dictate which could be very much unlike the FDA standards in America. I also believe that Amazon.com should stipulate where each product is made and not the double talk about " packaged in Canada" which could mean purchased in China and then packed in Canada. The only way to improve our country is to rely on Americans to produce products, receive the rewards of their labors and stabilize the economy-now that may be political but it's the damn truth.
