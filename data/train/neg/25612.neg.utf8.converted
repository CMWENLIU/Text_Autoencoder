This used to be one of the relatively few "urinary tract" formulas out there that my cat could stomach AND was readily available at most super markets but since the recent formula change, he has been throwing up nearly every day and has started turning his nose to it. It's pretty awful and kind of scary to see him lose half of his "nourishment" every day of late. This was something he had been eating every year for the last decade (half mixed with a high-end catfood that is only meat and poultry and none of the grains and corn crap that is so bad for humans and completely counter to what cats naturally eat!).  So now I am at a loss.  I wish there was a grocer's catfood out there on the store shelves that is all meat and poultry, no sugars, no grains and no corn and has the urinary tract ingredients for these little creatures that have this problem.  I wonder if just feeding him the food he would be eating in the wild would change things around--even for the urinary tract complications...anyway, the Purina Urinary Tract Formula is no longer any good.
