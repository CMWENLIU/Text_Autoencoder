Best to check out your local Asian food market or Japanse anime store. The price will usually be better, considering S&H, and you won't be stuck with 6x of something you end up hating. Also there are a lot of other varieties of pocky than what's being sold here. There's even "giant" pocky, "custard" pocky, "green tea" etc... Always more new ones coming out.<br /><br />But, if there are no market or if other internet stores are comparable in price, than maybe a wise choice for the curious snacker. Beware though, even I didn't like the sesame. And FYI, Men's pocky is just "bitter" instead of "milk" chocolate. Best flavors in my opinion (and most novice Pocky snackers like): Men's, Strawberry with/without extra bits, almond crush.
