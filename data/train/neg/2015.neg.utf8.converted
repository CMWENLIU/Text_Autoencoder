Do not buy this product. It is a huge disappointment. Not as good as the Supermarket brands like Quaker and Albers, not even close to Bob's Red Mill. Gummy and mushy with an odd/off flavor regardless of the cooking method. Roughly equivalent to the tubes of pre-cooked polenta but more trouble to prepare. The 3 unopened boxes are going to the Food Bank, if you're homeless they might be acceptable.
