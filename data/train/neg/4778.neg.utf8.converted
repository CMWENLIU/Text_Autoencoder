I was so excited to find this product. After much debate with myself, I finally ordered it paying exhorbitant price for shipping. Delivery was efficient, and I eagerly tore into it. IT'S NOT THE SAME! The only thing they did to it was not an improvement. They added oregano. It overpowers the taste. Expensive lesson. I guess I was supposed to go on a diet anyway. This won't be a temptation.
