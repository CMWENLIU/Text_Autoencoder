Got these on a whim hoping to find a lower fat alternative to the regular brand of salt & vinegar kettle chips I buy.  The brand that arrived was Michael Season's (not Herr's as shown) & they were very bland & a little bitter tasting.  If you did a blindfold taste-test on these, you would not be able to tell they have vinegar.  They are 40% less fat though, so a better alternative for lunches.  Price was okay, but going forward I will stick to buying the variety boxes of Mrs. Vickie's kettle chips at Sam's.
