Bought this at a great price and Amazon did a fine job of getting it to me. I guess I wasn't a very informed consumer (my fault) because I was surprised when the ingredients on the bag had a sticker over it that just says "100% Chicory". So, there is absolutely NO COFFEE in it. I hate to be Mr. Precision here, but it really shouldn't be called coffee if there is none it. However, I suppose the same argument could be made for Soy "Milk". Anyhow, it is called Medium Dark Roast, and we were game since we did like the coffee at Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans and do like dark, rich coffees. We made our first batch mixing 50% Chicory/ 50% Starbucks Bold Roast (our regular). We both could only make it through about 1.5 cups because, while smooth, it was way, WAY too sweet....like drinking Molasses. Today, we made 1/3 Chicory, 1/3 Bold Decaf Coffe, and 1/3 Bold Regular. Still way too sweet, and I have the chicory aftertaste still in my mouth. Unfortunately, using it at this rate (or less probably), it is going to take forever to get through all these bags.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing again and recommend you try a little first.
