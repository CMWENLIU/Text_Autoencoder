I was hopeful that the Xylitol products would be good for teeth which is true.  However you ingest the stuff.  It has anti-bacterial properties.<br />Your digestive system depends on bacteria to function properly.  Ingesting more than 1 or 2 pieces of gum or mint, starts interfering with this process. Result is gas, diarrhea, etc.  It's not nice. I ended up starting with Yogurt again so I could recover.<br />Xylitol cannot be used in making bread either it starves yeast as well as bacteria.<br />Sorry, but it sounded too good to be true, didn't it???
