I've been buying this formula for 3 months and my daughter likes it more than the other brands we tried before. But today opening one of the cans from the latest delivery by amazon I found three brown hairs in the powder! This makes me very concerned about the quality control of this product. And I wonder whether I should continue using it.<br />If it were not for this incident I would have rated this formula as 5*.
