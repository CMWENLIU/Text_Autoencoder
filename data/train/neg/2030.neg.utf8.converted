I bought a bunch of these from Walgreens just to find that none of the cans had chunks of tuna in them. They should probably re-label this product to "tuna soup" since this is really what this is. The pieces are so tiny that they literally ooze out of the can as you drain the water out of it. Plus who in their right mind would name a brand of canned tuna 'Chicken of the Sea'?
