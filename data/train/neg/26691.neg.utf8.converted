Before buying this product, I read some of the other reviews and felt pretty assured that this product would give me the energy boost that I wanted. I bought the 12 pack to have a decent amount to try.<br /><br />I am a relatively well built six foot 215 lb guy and decided to drink one bottle before working out. I felt absolutely none of the energizing effects promised by the manufacturer. I tried this a couple of times, and each time I expreienced the same result. I then decided to drink 2 bottles to see whether the dosage might be to blame. After drinking two bottles I noticed that my heart beat increased and that I had difficulty in trying to catch my breath, but again none of the energy benefits promised.<br /><br />I still have a few more bottles which I will probably finish, but I do not think the results will be any better. I guess you need to try it for yourself in order to see whether this formula complements your bodies chemistry. It certainly didn't complement mine.
