I have been looking for a replacement for Carmien rooibos that is no longer available through Amazon and decided to give this one a try. It tasted awful! I brewed several cups, but each one tasted as though the tea wasn't dried correctly - it wasn't precisely moldy tasting, but it certainly did not resemble my favorite beverage!<br />That may have been a one-off, but I'm not giving it another try.
