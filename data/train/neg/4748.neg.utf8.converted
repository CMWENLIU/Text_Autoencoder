I have been making bread for 20 years both by machine and by conventional methods.  I saw this mix at Safeway in the baking section, near the whole wheat flour and thought it looked promising.  According to directions, I just needed a cup full of warm water.<br /><br />The bread rose slowly and sank as soon as I moved it, like a deflated air mattress.<br /><br />After the second rise, I placed the shaped dough into the oven which soon filled the entire house with that warm pleasant smell that only comes from baking bread.<br /><br />The loaf appeared fine, smelled fine and I served it with the clam chowder I had prepared for dinner.  It only took one bite...this stuff was horrid.  I tried to saturate the bread in my well seasoned, super hot soup.  It still tasted rotten.<br /><br />The previous poster is so correct when she describes the stuff as tasting rancid!  I don't know what chemical compounds they have hidden in their "natural flavors".  My head was spinning, I suddenly felt nauseated, and my ears were ringing moments after I had eaten just a bite!<br /><br />My companion, who eats everything, like airplane food, potluck leftovers and my occasional bothced experiments, wouldn't eat this stuff!<br /><br />Unless you want to poison someone, or torture them I would steer clear of this box of MSG, chemical waste mislabeled as a sourdough bread.<br /><br />It was hideous tasting beyond anything I have ever eaten in bread.  No man, child or beast would eat this stuff!
