The first time I ordered this coffee, it was great.  But the second time, it was undrinkable.  A couple months later I ordered again thinking it was just a bad batch.  But no, it was still undrinkable.  These pods produce something that has no similarity to coffee.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon for making good on both bad orders with a refund.
