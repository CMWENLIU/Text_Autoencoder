Let me start by saying we have 2 kids under the age of 5yrs.  Myself, and the kids love the standard (non-chocolate) Lucky Charms.<br />I only assumed that the chocolate version would be even better.  I love Cocoa Krispies, Cocoa Puffs, Cocoa Pebbles, Count Chocula etc. and was expecting the best of the best with this product, but sadly, we were all disapointed.  The kids won't even eat it!<br /><br />The marshmallows are fine, but the chocolate cereal just doesn't taste good.  I don't know why, but it's just plain bad.  Now I know why these aren't available in stores, at least in my part of the states (So. Cal)<br /><br />After finishing one box, I find myself trying to find friends who might want a box just so we can get rid of them.<br />I wish this item wasn't sold in a 6 pack, I've got buyers remorse!
