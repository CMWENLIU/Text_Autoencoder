Like one reviewer, I am also a health nut and have adjusted my palate to very natural, sometimes bland food.  Agreeing with the same reviewer, I could not stomach this stuff.  It is utterly gross in taste and smell.  I've tried mixing it with smoothies, brownie mix, even ice-cream.  You cannot mask it.  Spend your money on the real stuff.  The extra calories will be far better than gulping down this ridiculous concoction!
