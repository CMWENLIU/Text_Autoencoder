Thinking I'd be wickedly clever and get a fun treat -- one that's vegan and also contains fiber, hee hee -- into my kids and the rest of the unsuspecting Trick-or-Treaters this year, I ordered a bunch of these bulk boxes of Cracker Jack bags for distribution last Halloween.<br /><br />What a disappointment, in two ways.<br /><br />1. My suspicion is that, unlike the 1970s and 80s when I was a kid and enjoyed these, modern food science has now created a popcorn scanner that sees inside each popped kernel to find out whether it has popped fully or incompletely-- incompletely meaning a hard stone part lurks inside.  If the latter is ascertained, it gets routed onto the Cracker Jack bag-filling line.  I'd say a good half or more of the popped corns in the bags we received contained an unchewable hard part.<br /><br />2. I strongly suspect attorneys seeking to limit settlements by Cracker Jack, Inc. to parents whose children found a way to harm themselves with yesterday's prizes like plastic spinners and "moving" pictures have mandated that all Cracker Jack prize designers limit their creations to "paper only" models.  They were undoubtedly encouraged to do so by some MBA whiz (most likely a Harvard Business School graduate) who also realized how cheap and lightweight paper is to manufacture, thereby saving on both production and shipping costs, in addition to settlement fees.<br /><br />The unfortunate result is that, unlike the actually fun prizes I remember (a few of which, I am embarrassed to say, I still have packed away somewhere), today's children can look forward to Cracker Jack prizes like paper pencil toppers (two slits and put on the end of that pencil -- wow!) and -- I kid you not -- "arrange the face of Abe Lincoln" or "turn the young face into the elderly Susan B. Anthony" activities.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; I love the Abolitionists and Suffragettes, and Susan B. Anthony, having the honor of being among both camps, is my favorite among them. I will also add that my self-righteous pride expanded as I realized I was distributing to neighborhood children lessons about American historical figures along with a vegan, fiber-containing snack, all masquerading as a Halloween treat.<br /><br />But the Cracker Jacks that children love are gone.  Mine, who are in 1st and 4th grade, won't even eat the leftover bags, and so I started eating them myself-- except I couldn't force myself to chew through all those hard kernels. And when I tossed my kids the prizes, they said, "no, thanks."<br /><br />I write this not to deride a classic treat but to beseech the powers-that-be at Cracker Jack to restore their product to the quality of its glory days, when hard kernels weren't plentiful and the prizes were worth finishing your bag or box for.  Arise, Crack Jack, to this challenge, and reclaim your rightful place in American childhood!
