Once upon a time this was such a wonderful product.<br /><br />The old Chocolate Twizzlers were much stronger in many ways. Taste yes and also in product 'behavior'.... The old product was 'tough' to pull apart... it actually had a 'snap' to it... This new 'stuff' behaves more like play-dough -- really 'squishy' and not in a good way. :)<br /><br />All I want to know is who is responsible for such a blunder and have they been fired yet? (kidding / well sorta)<br /><br />Dave<br /><br />Okay... I can't believe they (may have) actually listened!  I got a letter from Nestle back in Dec 2011 that they've reversed their changes to this great product and to look for new packages that have the tag line NOW WITH THE CLASSIC TWIST...  Well being in the middle of a home sale / purchase and all that goes along with that ... Chocolate Twizzlers weren't at the top of my priority... However now I'm going out to find a bag with the new tag line and I'll report back ASAP.  With any luck this 1 star review will be reissued as a 5 star. ... Fingers crossed.
