I seldom give a one star review, usually trying to find something positive about any product, but with this one, I found it lousy.  As a ginger fan, I was eager to receive the packet and conduct a side by side tasting with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SWB73C">Instant Ginger Honey Crystals Pack of 30 Bags - 18 g Sachets</a> and asked a friend from Jamaica to join me.  First of all, this product is tiny granules that are much darker than the Prince of Peace product.  When mixed with hot water, rather than being a lovely gold, it is a brown.  The first taste was awful and I mean really awful.  My friend added some sweetener to hers thinking it would be an improvement, but it was an unsuccessful attempt.  I felt the lemon flavor overwhelmed the ginger flavor, yet there was some heat from the ginger that tried to come forward.  The flavor was extremely unbalanced and tasted more like the taste of a lemon which has been cut and stored in the refrigerator, turning brown and developing a rancid flavor that creeps into the nose.  My friend held her nose and drank her half cup but I could not force mine down.  Instead, I gladly drank the other beverage.
