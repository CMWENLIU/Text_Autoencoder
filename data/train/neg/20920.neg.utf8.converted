Just a quick note if you are looking to make a Pumpkin Spice Latte at home to feed your Starbucks PSL addiction:  This is NOT the cure.  Since you can't buy the original syrup, I searched until deciding that this looked like a good option.  I ordered two bottles (mistake) and then it arrived so on this cold March morning I fired up the Capresso and then... WHAM !!!  Had to dump the cup.  That bad!<br /><br />In all fairness, some people may find this flavoring to be good, but I'd bet anything that none of those people are ones who "discovered" PSLs from Starbucks.  Now I have two more bottles to go out for recycling, and learned a $22 lesson - I could have had 5 PSLs at Starbucks!  Ouch!!!
