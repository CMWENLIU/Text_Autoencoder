I purchased these when I started the HGC diet.  They were a great choice as far as taste goes.  They satisfied my need for a crunch and they had a very pleasant taste to them.  They didn't just have that "stale bread" taste that a lot of breadsticks have. Also, while you do get a few burned breadsticks, you don't get to many.  For the most part they are pretty evenly cooked.<br /><br />On the down side, the quality is not that great.  Every package I opened have had broken breadsticks.  Now I know that breadsticks are fragile and I should expect a few broken ones, but for the most part, almost all of them in a package are broken, and some are broken so bad that they are just dust at the bottom.<br /><br />My biggest issue with the quality is this...so far, we've gone through 8 boxes of these breadsticks and I've come across 15 SEALED packages that contain NO breadsticks.  They are just empty wrappers, AND these empty wrappers aren't just in the box as that weird bonus wrapper you receive on occasion, they COUNT towards the number of packages of breadsticks you get in a box.<br /><br />These breadsticks are by no means cheap, and I honestly do not mind paying for something that is not only part of my diet, but something I enjoy.  I do take issue with the fact that I'm paying a premium price for a product with sub-par quality.
