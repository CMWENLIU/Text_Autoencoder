I stumble upon this product at Walmart and bought it without looking at the ingredients, thinking that it uses sugar. I was surprised to find out later on that this product lists high fructose corn syrup on the third in the ingredients list. If you don't care consuming HFCS, then disregard this feedback. For me, HFCS is totally out of consideration.
