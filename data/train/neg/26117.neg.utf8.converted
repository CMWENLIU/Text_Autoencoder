I have to love all the reviews and comments to those reviews debating the meaning of the word "natural," and whether or not this qualifies as a "natural" product. Folks, it doesn't matter if it's natural or not, it's not even peanut butter. Peanut butter is ground-up peanuts, with or without salt. This is a "peanut butter spread" -- just like it says **right on the front of the container** -- and contains sugar and palm oil.<br /><br />That being said, this is probably one of the least offensive-tasting peanut butter spreads on the market. There's a decent peanut flavor, although the sugar makes it too sweet for me. But my dog likes it, so it's what we buy for her. I'll stick with the REAL (a.k.a old fashioned) stuff; I've found Trader Joe's to have some of the best out there. Seemingly unlike most people, I actually have the two minutes of time it takes to stir a jar of peanut butter (not spread!).
