I did not like Truvia at all. I tried baking with it and adding it into my coffee and multiple other ways.  No matter what you put it in it's going to have a horrible taste to it and a worse after taste.  Plus it's from a major corporation and it doesn't have ALL the ingredients in it.  Seems kinda fishy to me.  I would stick with the Stevia smaller companies who truly stand by their product and produce something that tastes good and is also natural.
