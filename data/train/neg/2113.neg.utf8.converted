I have to wonder what the other reviewers are talking about. The tea I received was packaged as described but consisted of tea dustings -- the dust left over after everything else is gone. I use FINE mesh teaballs and this tea dust just goes right through. The bottom of the cup is covered with it and you get to drink the dust as well.<br /><br />Even then, it is possible to get a decent tea from dustings (from The Book of Tea) but not with this stuff. It makes a weak, thin tea, no mater how long you steep it.<br /><br />There was not a single tea leaf in the first package I opened and spread out to look at after I got over the shock of having a bag of dust, just a couple small pieces and a lot of dustings.<br /><br />Hence, I really wonder about the other reviews, meaning what I got is NOT what they got, but it is what Amazon shipped to me. This stuff is junk.<br /><br />By the way, I have 12 different loose teas in the house at any time, with Keemun generally my favorite and Kenilworth my favorite Ceylon. There are other single source teas from Sri Lanka and there are other pure Ceylon teas. Tea of Life is one such. I've bought a lot of loose tea from tea shops and Amazon but never got anything this bad before. I threw it out.
