The Mrs. Mays "Deal of the Day" bars are made in China.. look for  disclosure regarding this very important detail. this is the very reason I will not purchase them and am confident there are many who feel as I.<br /> And as well, the nutritional content is not available on many of the offered variations. Not what I have come to expect  from my allthetime online shopping source Amazon, beloved quite equally to  Google.
