This is the biggest waste of money and scam I have seen in a long time. Raw, organic coconut oil is definitely one of the healthiest additions you can make to your diet. (Ignore the claims that because it has saturated fat it must be bad for your heart - WRONG! Not all saturated fats are bad and coconut oil has medium chain fatty acids which means the fat gets converted in your liver into energy and is not stored by the body nor will it clog your arteries.) Anyway, in order to reap the benefits of this wonderful oil you need to eat about 2 -3 tablespoons a day, starting with 1 and working your way up.  Guess how many of these pill you need to take in order to accomplish that feat? Something like 40!!  Have fun swallowing that many pills and just think about all the yucky gelatin you will be consuming that comprises the coating of these things!  You are much better off purchasing raw, organic coconut oil and mixing it your oatmeal or drinks.  Use it for cooking and throw away every other oil you have in your kitchen, except olive oil, and you will be on your way to better health.  Research the benefits of raw organic coconut oil online and you will see that I am right about this.
