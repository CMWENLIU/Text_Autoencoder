If you like dark, bold and strong coffee, you will not like Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee.  The product is packaged in convenient one cup serving packets, but it's very weak and almost tasteless.  It took at least two packets to make one half way decent cup of coffee.  Therefore, unless you like watery coffee, I would not recommend that you purchase this product.
