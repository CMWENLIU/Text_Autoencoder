The packaging was very musty smelling! After through out the shredded paper and airing it out for weeks, the smell has come out of the boxes to the point that I may consider using them for something. The tea itself had a terrible taste! I bought another box of the same tea somewhere else and it's not so bad as what arrived in this set. Still, I'm not very impressed with the taste of the tea. Also, the flowers in the set did not have good color and were very drab. Also, the teapot holds a very small amount, as others have said. I would not recommend this at all.
