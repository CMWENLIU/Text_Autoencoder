The first can I opened contained one (yes one!) jumbo whole oyster (about 1.5") and the remainder were chunks of oysters. These weren't whole and then broke into pieces during the canning process, these were chunks that were packed along with the only large oyster in the can! No way you can fit many jumbo oysters in these tuna-sized cans. It would have been better to put these jumbo oysters in one big square can and arrange them like your typical canned smoked oysters and charge $26/can.  For now the consumers would have to settle with the chunks, not whole giant oysters as one would expect for about $7 a pop. Not worth it at all.
