I have made purchases from you in the past. However, it is disconcerting to learn that a company selling flowers, the target market for which is women, (I would imagine), would give their advertizing dollars to such an individual as Rush Limbaugh.<br /><br />This creature has spent much of his time actively promoting an anti-female agenda. This week he stepped over the line, even for him. I refuse to dignify his commentary by repeating it.<br /><br />Neither I or my friends will be using your company for purchases as long as you continue to advertise on his program. It is unfortunate that you have chosen to associate yourselves with such an enemy of women.
