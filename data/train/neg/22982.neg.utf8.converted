This is very runny. I used it in my coffee and it doesn't add the creaminess that Thai Kitchen's coconut milk did. It also doesn't have that coconut milk flavor. It just tastes bland. I'm quite disappointed. Now I have 11 cans I have to figure out how to use.<br /><br />I wanted to update. The can has a money-back guarantee printed on the label. I emailed them and they sent me a refund. While I'm still unhappy with the product, the customer service was fantastic.
