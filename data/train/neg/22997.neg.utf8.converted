Made the mistake of ordering this product. This coffee is WAY too coarse to use. The result is that the coffee tastes weak and bland. You have to use a TON of coffee to get any taste whatsoever and even then it doesn't taste very good. Now I'm stuck with 4 cans. I may try running the grounds through a coffee grinder to see if I can get a finer grind. Very disappointed.<br /><br />May try the black can (espresso grind) in the future as that one has excellent reviews.
