Moving from a coffee press to these coffee pods was a culture shock.  I don't know if it's the medium roast, or possibly needing more than one pod per cup of coffee, to me it tasted like the coffee in a cheap diner. I would highly recommend buying a single bag before you invest in a case to make sure it suits your palate.
