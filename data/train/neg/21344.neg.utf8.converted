This was a gift from a friend that used and liked it.  I, however, found the spoon part of this too large (too deep) for my daughter.  Now that she's older, it might work, but we feed her thicker foods, and I don't know that they'd squeeze through the dispenser well.  I also found it awkward to hold.
