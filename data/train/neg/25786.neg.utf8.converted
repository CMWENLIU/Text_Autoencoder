I have tried this two years in a row and have the same problems as some of the others.  It does not seem like the product is dispensing with the water.  It is frustrating b/c I don't need to water my back yard due to the swamp in the back.  Not sure why the product will not dispense as it should not be that complicated.  Is there a trick to it...am I doing something wrong?  If anyone can add a comment to help..it would be great. My next step to is call cutter directly.  Maybe the bottles that the product came in are not good.  Anyone?  Thanks!  Tami
