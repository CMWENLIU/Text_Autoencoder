As a dog lover, I'm compelled to write a objective review regarding this product.<br />I fed my dogs one stick each of this product which caused both of my dogs to have symptoms of diarrhea.<br />I immediately stopped feeding them this product and symptoms subsided.<br />Also, one other concern that I think it's worth mentioning is the fact that the "Made in China" printed on the package was concealed with another UPC code.<br />Weary from bad and harmful products from China, I looked all over the packaging only to see it hidden beneath the new label without info on the country of origin.<br /><br />Perhaps this is an isolated incident and I hope it is, but I hope better QC is implemented, even if it raises the cost of the product which any dog lover would prefer over having a sick dog!
