This product came to me and the packaging was ok on the outside.... although when i opened it up it, the product had clearly been openeded before asking the question can you really trust this product... anything could be in there!!! When you recieve a product you expect to be the first one to open since it was produced. Would recommend not to buy, you can buy similar ones at places like sainsburys for cheaper than on this site. mine is now in the bin.. what a waste of money!
