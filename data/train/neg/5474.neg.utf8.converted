Avoid this seller unless you are seeking terrible, non-responsive customer service and unacceptable product quality.  Many seeds I ordered never sprouted.  One plant arrived near death, another was omitted from the order altogether.<br /><br />In spite of over half a dozen emails to customer service, no one has ever responded.  I have yet to receive the Scarlet Belle Pitcher Plant.
