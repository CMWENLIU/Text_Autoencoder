My vegetarian 4 year old reported that she felt really strange after she took these vitamins. I honestly think they gave her too much energy because she was very moody on these vitamins. I stopped the vitamins and she felt better again. She usually takes Rainbow Light Kids One Multistars and does not have any issues whatsoever. These vitamins seem like a great option for others out there.
