When I saw that the new Newtons Fruit Thins were available for review, I was excited. I've been eyeballing this product whenever I go to the grocery store but hadn't had the nerve to buy them. Now I know why. It was my "sixth sense" telling me that I wasn't going to like it.<br /><br />Biting into the fruit thin, I expected it to be soft like the Original Fig Newton. Nope. It's crispy, kinda like a cracker. Because of the thinness and crispiness, there's hardly any gooey fruit goodness in the cookie. I missed the soft, chewy center of the Original Fig Newton. And the Fruit thin barely had any taste. It was bland and dry. I think Nabisco needs to go back to the drawing board on this one.
