I'm really pleased that Korean food is beginning to ebb into the mainstream, but anyone who's interested in cooking Korean food should still make the trip down to their local Korean market and buy the genuine article.<br /><br />Annie Chun has altered the taste profile of gochujang significantly, as well as consistency.  It has the consistency of sauce that's already mixed with sesame oil, but not the richness, and it's far too sweet.  The spicy is not full bodied, but flat, and there's a slightly weird aftertaste in the bibimbap I made with this sauce.<br /><br />I've never had any of these problems with gochujang from any of the major Korean brands (all you'll find in the vast majority of Korean/Asian markets).  Ugh.
