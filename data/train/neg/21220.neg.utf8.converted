This item has a allergen disclaimer on the box - May contain Almonds and coconut.<br />Even though the name says Very Vanilla Soymilk, the package looks different from the other ones on the site and when it was delivered I saw the allergy disclaimer on the box. This made it useless for me cos my child has nut allergy.<br />Amazon was kind enough to refund me for the order.<br />Please do not buy this if you have nut allergy.
