Purchased this soda as it was sugar free and made from a renewable natural resource, stevia.  Very disappointed in the taste of the soda.  It was not sweet at all, the the ginger taste was weak to my taste buds.  The price is also very high compared to store purchased soda such as Seagrams or Canada Dry diet ginger ale.  I actually prefer the taste of the Canada Dry diet ginger ale to this product, and thus I will not be purchasing this again.
