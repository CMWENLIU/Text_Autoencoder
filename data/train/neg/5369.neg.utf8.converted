When I received this product it was poorly packed in a thin plastic package and included in a box with a couple of other products. As a result I got a bag of peanut butter and coconut crumbs that were smashed together and inedible. I ended up throwing the entire $10.00 package away. This is the first bad product I have received from Amazon, normally everything is packed and sent with much consideration. Why this was not packaged in a cardboard container when I receive other items double (and sometimes triple) packed I will never know.
