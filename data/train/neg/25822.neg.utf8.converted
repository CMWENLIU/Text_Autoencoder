My vet has my dog on a very limited source of low fat treats due to her impaired fat metabolism.  She suggested chicken jerky, but specifically said to avoid those made in China due to all the contimination problems they've had.<br /><br />I searched here on Amazon for "chicken jerky" and one of the suggested searches that popped up was "chicken jerky dog treats made in usa." Great! I used that search and this was listed at #8 on the list. Nowhere in the product description did it say it wasn't made here.  I ordered it and was unpleasantly surprised to find "made in China" on the label, when it arrived.<br /><br />The FDA has several warnings out on dog chicken jerky treats made in China.  The latest ones were Nov. and Dec., so it's an ongoing  problem.  I never even opened the jar, as I didn't want to harm my dog.<br /><br />Had the country of origen been in the product description, I never would have ordered these.
