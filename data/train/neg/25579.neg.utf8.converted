...because it tastes like I raked up my leaves, wet them, pressed them flat, allowed a bit of funk to start growing on them, and let them dry for a year.<br /><br />I eat a lot of healthy food and a lot of low carb and high fiber products and these are the first thing I just couldn't eat.  I didn't even make it through one of them, and they measure just 2.5x3 inches.  There's just something horrible going on in that little package.<br /><br />I'm feeding these to my chickens.  (But they eat bugs and stones.)<br /><br />Update: Tried feeding it to the chickens and they won't touch it.  I conclude this is not a food.
