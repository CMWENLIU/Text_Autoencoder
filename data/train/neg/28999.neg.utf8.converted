We just purchased these because it seemed like a good deal and we love Jelly Belly candies. Both DH and I couldn't stand these. For whatever reason, they taste nothing like regular Jelly Belly brand candies. I'm wondering if there is some cheap imitation thrown in with the regular ones to create a product for Kirkland. Has an off-taste and chemical after-taste we just can't deal with. Regardless, we are turning this back into the store for a full refund.
