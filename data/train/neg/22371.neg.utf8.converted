WARNING:  I use to feed my dogs Orijen 75% protein but the last few months my dogs have had really bad diarrhea.  We thought one would need IV fluids because he was getting dehydrated.  I looked at the bag and saw they now changed to 80% protein and now use sodium selenite which I would never buy a food with this ingredient.  Instead of getting better they are getting worse.  80% protein is a lot for a non working dog. And now with the recall, I have to look for another brand of dog food with selenium yeast, no ethoxyquin, no BHT etc. Also, the company that once was great in customer service now refuses to answer e-mail questions.  What are they hiding.  This use to be a good quality dog food that I use to recommend to everyone.  When I returned the 80% protein bag back the girl said a lot of people have been complaining and they aren't recommending this brand anymore.
