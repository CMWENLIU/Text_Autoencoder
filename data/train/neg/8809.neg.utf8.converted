I have purchased Godiva chocolates a few times and have always found them to be old and dried out.  I think the company has a problem with keeping stock fresh.  I have never had this problem with other chocolate brands.  For as much as Godiva charges for a premium product at least the product could be fresh and tasty instead of dry and tasteless.
