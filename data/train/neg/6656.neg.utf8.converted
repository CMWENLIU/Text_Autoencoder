$125 for 72 K-Kups.  That is absolutely laughable!!  Come on!!  I hope no one falls for this highway robbery.  There are many many online stores that offer K-Kups from Green Mountain (and other companies) for less than 50cents per cup.  Amazon, and their partner in crime here, are trying to charge close to $2 per cup.  Thanks for giving me a good laugh today.
