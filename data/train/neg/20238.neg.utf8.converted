I bought based on all the positive reviews.  The first couple of truffles I thought tasted pretty good but after the 3rd or 4th, I rapidly lost my appetite for it.  The rest of my family lost interest after one or two as well and no wants to eat anymore so I chucked the rest in the trash.  Was anyone actually able to finish an entire box???  Yuck.
