When I received my order for this item (Bulgur Wheat, Light, 1 lb., from Barry Farm), it wasn't the light bulgur wheat with the hulls removed as illustrated, but the dark version with the hulls not removed. I rated it one star because the product was not as represented and because Barry Farms did not respond to my request to return it. It's OK if you want the brown bulgur wheat.
