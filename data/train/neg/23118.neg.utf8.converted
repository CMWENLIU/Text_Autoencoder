I have previously had inexpensive Oolongs served at Chinese resturants and the Bigelow brand tea.  This tee is much different, and in my opinion, much worse.  The teas I've had previously carried a much stronger and longer flavor.  The Twinings tea has a very weak taste with a short, lackluster aftertaste, regardless of the steeping time.  It should also be noted that the contents of the tea bag may only be described as "dust", even more so than the average inexpensive, grocery-store teas.  In fact, it tastes almost exactly as Bigelow brand teas do upon their second steeping.  I wouldn't dare attempt to twice steep this Twinings tea.  This latter point and the "weak" taste give me the suspicion that this tea contains primarily green elements, rather than black elements -- those new to Oolong with a taste for black teas or whom already enjoy a strong Oolong should avoid this tea.
