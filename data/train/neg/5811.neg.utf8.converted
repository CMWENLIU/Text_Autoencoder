Olive oil is a slippery subject....<br /><br />There are LOTS of different types of olive oil, usually differentiated by:<br />Extraction method<br />  Pressing (1st, 2nd, 3rd...)<br />  Cold pressed<br />  Hot pressed<br />  Solvent extraction<br /><br />Pomace is what's left of the pressed olives after the final pressing.<br />Pomace is the lowest grade of oil which is edible (and some pomace is inedible.)<br /><br />Edible doesn't mean tasty. The vast majority of knowledgeable olive oil consumers wouldn't consider eating pomace grade. Generally the worst of the plain olive oils has considerably more flavor than pomace.<br /><br />Where you aren't looking for flavor, then pomace is possibly appropriate, but it should be much cheaper than plain olive oil. It is appropriately used as you would sunflower, corn or other neutral flavored cooking oils.<br /><br />Many in the USA like extra-virgin oil, but most Europeans prefer virgin, as it has more of the olive bitterness. Most in the USA have palates which are trained to dislike anything bitter. Most in the USA have been raised on vegetable oils which have little or no flavor (the advertising  boasts about this fact.)<br /><br />If you want an oil which won't affect the flavor of your food much, then this is an o.k. product.
