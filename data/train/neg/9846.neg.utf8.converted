I tried this product and it really didn't taste much like latte or even any kind of coffee.  I had to look up latte on the Internet to make sure I wasn't missing something.  The generally accepted definition of latte seems to be strong coffee with steamed milk.  When I checked the ingredients on this package the first ingredient was sugar, followed by nondairy creamer.  The first ingredient in the non dairy creamer was corn syrup solids.  The third ingredient was partially hydrogenated coconut oil. Coffee was actually the ninth ingredient, listed behind dipotassium phosphate, artificial flavor, and maloxdextrin, which explains why it didn't taste much like coffee.  I do think it is a misnomer to have latte on the front of this package.  I guess in smaller print they have the words "naturally and artificially flavored cafe-style beverage" so technically that is how they are defining their product. But in larger letters are the words Maxwell House and International Latte so I was really expecting something coffee tasting. Anyway the product doesn't really taste like latte or coffee at all.  It really just mainly tasted like hot sugar water with a few other kind of odd flavors thrown in.<br /><br />I think for the money I would stick with something more healthy and natural like black or green tea or even just real coffee with real milk added in.
