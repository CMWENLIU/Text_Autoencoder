Online Stores, which is listed under the merchants selling this tea as NEW, sent me a box of tea that expired in April of 2010!! I just ordered it October 25, 2010! Why they would still have items shelved that expired that long ago is beyond me! And, if you think about it, it's quite disturbing. Stocking, and selling, an organic tea that expired six months ago all the while marking it as new! To add insult to injury, Online stores does NOT provide a return shipping label, so I had to pay additional fees to send it back. This was AFTER I went to the website they mentioned on the order packing form to try to process the return that way only to find that the website is down. Suppose I shouldn't have been surprised. Buy from this company only at your own risk!!
