I received the box, which contained--to my surprise--three spots with the rest spacers for the tomatoes. At a price of $19.95 (and I'm not that price sensitive), I thought this was seriously over priced. Worse, while two of the plants are well on their way, the third never sprouted. Did some investigation, and there were no seeds in the third. So, I basically paid $10 a tomato seed. As much as I love cherry tomatoes, and have loved other aero garden kits very much, I would not recommend this one.
