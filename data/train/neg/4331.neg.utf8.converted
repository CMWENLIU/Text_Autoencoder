Admittedly, I had a fever.<br /><br />And I must say I am a devotee of the Corn Flake (though I only eat Trader Joe's Brand--Kellogg's flakes, though tasty, have too much crap in them).<br /><br />But Cereal City--the true target of this review--and a place that now has GREAT bearing on my thoughts about this product--was CREEPY.<br /><br />From the bald lady with two teeth who took our ticket and felt that this gave her liscense to engage us in a too-long conversation, to the Pennywise-looking clown that reeked of smoke--our first two minutes set the tone.<br /><br />Throw in a weird new-agey film with floating balls of light that became speaking versions of dead historic figures who never got along in life and pick up their arguments right where they left off on the screen.<br /><br />Add to that a poorly-lit animatronic Snap, Crackle, and Pop who end up either looking like they are rising from the grave or falling in worship at the feet of Tony the Tiger (depending on whether they are coming up or going back down).<br /><br />Our (hopefully) unique experience involved not being able to find a lady crucial to our scavanger hunt for 45 minutes (did she go in back and take a nap?) I want a shirt that says "I waited 45 minutes to complete the Cereal City scavanger hunt and all I got was this crappy sippy cup."<br /><br />Sadly there is much, much more...I could go on at length. But I won't.<br /><br />The main point is that I get the sense that Kellogg's, as a company, is just as creepy as its tourist trap. Avoid both.
