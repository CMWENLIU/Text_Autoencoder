When we received the gumballs the container they were in had opened and the gumballs were spread all over the box and something else must have happened to them because they were all stuck together and to the box.... a big mess and we couldn't eat any of them nor would we want to in the condition they were in.  I filled out the return form online but amazon.com gave no address to return them to and there was no address on the gumball coated shipping label so I went to a UPS store to send them back to the amazon address but there were so many different addresses we couldn't figure out which one to send it back to .  In the mean time it was going to cost me 17 dollars to send it back so I said forget it and took the loss.  Very bad amazon experience for this customer.  Dont order the gumballs or anything perishable from amazon.
