Five-color pepper is one of my culinary secrets.  I've been partial to the Morton & Bassett Rainbow Peppercorns but it's a bit dear.  So I ordered this Roland product in bulk-- a two-pack of nice big keep-fresh bottles amounting to two pounds altogether, for a somewhat more attractive price than the M&B.<br /><br />It arrived in totally unacceptable form: moldy peppercorns, broken empty husks, withered ancient former peppercorns from a bygone era, gargantuan mutant peppercorns incompatible with any grinder I've ever seen, stems (!)...<br /><br />Two pounds of utter garbage.<br /><br />Avoid.
