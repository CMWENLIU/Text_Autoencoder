My kids have been eating these as a "healthy" snack for a couple of years.  We are on a special diet that restricts food dyes, artificial colors, and preservatives, and we thought we were safe eating this until I recently looked at the box and it said that it contained BHT or one of the preservatives, and I was not happy at all.  This is an organic company, and I don't understand how they could do this.  This is the only brand on the market that is affordable and supposedly healthy.
