I want to like this, but alas, it is awful.<br /><br />I love the concept, and I appreciate the sentiment that this small company has. "Everything should taste like bacon" is indeed a fine concept. Do you know what is a good way to make everything taste like bacon? PUT EFFING BACON IN IT. This hell-spawned abomination has no bacon in it at all.Not even hateful turkey bacon. No bacon. Only chemicals. It would be a fair approximation for bacon, I suppose, if I had never had bacon, but had merely had it described to me by a severely brain-damaged transient who had also never had bacon, but had read about it on wikipedia. Suitable only for the filthiest of hippies, and haters of bacon.
