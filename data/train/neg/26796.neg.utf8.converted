It's weak and has very little flavor.  It's a little better than typical hotel coffee.  You know it's going to be bad as soon as you brew it as you can see the bottom of the cup.  Who's ever heard of transparent French roast?  Go to McDonald's, theirs is better - no kidding.  The aftertaste is awful - has a hint of decaf.  Now I have 39 left to get through - the trash may be a better place for these.  I'll never buy a Brooklyn brand of coffee again.
