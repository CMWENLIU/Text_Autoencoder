I thought these cookies were awful - I couldn't even eat them, they went to the squirrels. After reading all the other reviews I was very disappointed. It seems like they were overbaked, but even if not they weren't even close to some other healthy cc cookies I buy, such as  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YHLS8W">Kashi TLC Cookies, Oatmeal Dark Chocolate, 8.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a>
