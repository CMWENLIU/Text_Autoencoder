The packaging is convenient.  Single paper/foil tube for one cup of coffee.<br />I followed the simple instructions carefully and produced a 6 oz cup of hot brown liquid with almost no aroma. It did not smell like real coffee or anything else.  The "beverage" was not cloudy and looked like a typical cup of good coffee--no murkiness, no powder floating on the top.  I drank it straight--no cream, no sugar.  The flavor was lousy.  About what Nescafe powder produced 40 years ago.  It is as if they have abandoned all they once new about instant coffee.  The taste was bitter, with a hint of solvent and very little real coffee complexity.  At least there was almost no 'caffeine' after taste.  I would recommend this as a last resort when nothing else with any kind of coffee label could be found.
