I have been drinking Lipton's tea since I was a child but as an adult I have expanded my horizons and have been drinking many other brands.  I'm not sure if this fact has influenced my palate or not but I found this tea unpalatable.  First of all I love the idea of the Pyramid.  Teas that have this shape of tea bag always release their essence much faster and more fully.  So, I really enjoy the shape because of this function and the shape is also esthetically pleasing.<br />The color of the tea in the cup is beautiful.  It is a rich purple color and the aroma of the tea is quite nice.  You can smell the fruit and that hint of vanilla.  However, I had about 3 or 4 swallows and that was enough for me.  I found the tea harsh, astringent, and really on the sour side.  If you have ever gotten berries that are sour (just not ripe enough), that is the taste of this tea.  For that reason I just could not drink it.  It is a great idea but when I have tea I am looking for something mellow and smooth.  While I do love my full caffeine teas (I often drink Tazo Chi), I do like a nice caffeine free herbal especially at night.  One of my favorites is Twinnings Honeybush, Mandarin, and Orange.  Now that is one smooth and flavorful herbal tea.<br /><br />I really like the idea of mixing blackberry with vanilla but this tea just do not sit well on my palate.
