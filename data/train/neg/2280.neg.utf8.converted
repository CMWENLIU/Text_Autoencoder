These nuts taste alright. My main problem with it is that label makes no mention that is uses sucralose (aka Splenda) and modified food starch (aka MSG). These junk ingredients do not make the nuts taste awesome, so it's not worth it putting this garbage into your body. I guess Emerald doesn't realize that the whole point of buying nuts instead of junk food is so that people have a healthier diet.<br /><br />This is the only brand of nuts that has this garbage, all the other brands I've seen have more natural ingredients. Stay away from Emerald brand.
