Ordered the Acana Ranchlands because of the reviews that I saw on various websites.  The dog (Miniature Poodle) liked it so-so, and then the worst part was his stool became really, really (!!) HARD on this food.  Tried other Acana varities (e.g., Grasslands) - and had the same result.  He was nearly constipated on the Acana and had a very tough time trying to pass a stool.  Then the stool itself had a very hard consistency - not at all normal.<br /><br />So, for the money, I would say pass this up and go for something else!!  We've switched to Taste of the Wild (which is also grain free) and are finding that the dog loves it as much - if not more - and aren't having any of the stool issues that we did with Acana.
