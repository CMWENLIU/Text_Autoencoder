As a previous reviewer stated - I used to buy this product and it was very good - very spicy.  I have purchased several jars over the last several months, at different locations, and this product no longer is any good - at all.  The jar I just opened was supposed to be good until 2011 - it was totally bland, and looked old.  I don't know what Thai Kitchen is doing - but - their curry pastes are bland.  It seems like the curry is very old.  Or, the jars are not sealed properly.  I have even sent emails to Thai Kitchen about this.  This vendor has a problem.  Go to an Asian market and get a real curry paste.  It makes a WORLD of difference.  (I'm sorry Thai Kitchen - but you need to get it together !!)
