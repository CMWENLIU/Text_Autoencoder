Beware.  The picture is deceptive.  What you get is 1 pipe (not a package) that retails for $3.59 elsewhere.  400% above retail.  Furthermore, while it's not labeled when it arrives, it appears to Missouri Meerschaum's cheapest model, the Missouri Pride. It's basically a disposable pipe which is why a package of them makes some sense.  Save your money.  Go elsewhere and get one of Missouri Meerschaum's better pipes for half of what you'll spend here. Or, for that matter, go elsewhere and buy 4 of these for the same money.
