I've been searching for a natural sugar replacement and was thrilled when I discovered Ideal. I've used both the brown sugar and regular granulated. It bakes well and there is no aftertaste. But there are a few major downfalls : it's definitely not natural, it contains SPLENDA, not only xylitol. Also, it is not calorie free as advertised. Very disappointed.
