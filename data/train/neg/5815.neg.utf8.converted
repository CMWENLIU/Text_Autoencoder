Since I was looking for a truly safe sweetener I read some articles about products labeled raw agave nectar. It is actually just chemically refined fructose and no better for your system than any other sweetener natural or refined and worse than some. This was a blow to me since I found the taste really pleasing and thought, because it came from a plant and the label said it was heated below 118 degrees, that it was a cut above sugar. So far Stevia seems to be the safest but who can stand that strong taste or the expense.
