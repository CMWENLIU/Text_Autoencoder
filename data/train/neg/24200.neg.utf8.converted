I have a brutally aggressive chewer (35 lb springer spaniel mix) that pulled the fabric off the top of the octoupus's head in less than 30 seconds.  She used her incisors to grab hold of and rip off the fabric.  Within a few minutes she had removed all of the stuffing from the octopus head.  She then ripped into the legs and removed two squeakers in less than an hour.<br /><br />Note my dog has done damage to all toys except the classic kong and bounzer ball.  She rips pieces off the kong dental jack and kong stuff-a-ball.  So my rating is aimed at owners of extreme chewers.
