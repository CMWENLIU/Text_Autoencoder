I have been a regular consumer of Lindt Excellence 70% cocoa Dark Chocolate bar for years and have recommended it to many people, not only for the wonderful taste and texture, but b/c of the purity of this product (only four ingredients, including natural bourbon vanilla beans that gave it a most delicious flavor). My most recent purchase ... their "new recipe," as stated on the label, was quite a shock to my taste buds. By adding soy lecithin to the recipe, they are now producing a bar that is not only tasteless but has a waxy texture that I find disgusting. I can only conclude that the soy has replaced some of the more costly ingredients, thereby becoming cheaper for Lindt to produce. Apparently, this has happened only since Lindt started producing the bar in the U.S. and the original formula is still in use in France and Canada but they will not ship it to the U.S. I am extremely disappointed in Lindt for this change and will never buy this product again, unless they go back to the original recipe. What a shame that lovers of dark chocolate have lost the opportunity to enjoy this formerly great product. And let me add that you didn't have to be a connoisseur of dark chocolate to know just how great this product was...all it took was one bite!
