I grew up in Britain, where kippers - smoked herrings - were a common breakfast food.  Wishing to make kedgeree, a anglo-indian dish featuring smoked fish, including kippers, I shopped around and, based on the Amazon reviews, bought this product.  The fish that I received may have been smoked but they were then packed in oil to reverse the effect of smoking.  The result is an overly-priced version of sardines in oil.  This product is a travesty of the art of producing smoked fish, particularly kippers. That said, please buy this product if you like relatively tasteless, oily cans of dubious fish.
