This is the brand of mission figs that are at my grocery store (HEB in Texas).  I have probably bought at least 40 packages in the last 8 years (occassionally I would get a craving for them).  I always worry when I get them though, because they are often too dry.  So I started looking online for something better.  I tried the missing figs from nutsonline.  I was not dissapointed from those.  They are delicious - very moist.  I would say that the four one-pound bags of nutsonline figs I have bought so far were 98% moist, compared to the sunmaid figs at HEB being 30% moist (a lot of inedible ones). The figs from nutsonline don't have preservatives, so you have to refrigerate them as soon as you get them - but I think that's better for me.<br /><br />Note: The turkish figs are highly touted at nutsonline, but I didn't like them.<br /><br />Note 2: Another reviewer here said these sunmaid figs were moist when ordered from Amazon.  Maybe there is a difference in stock rotation / freshness when ordered here.  But they still have preservatives (I guess that might be an acceptable trade-off for some people if you don't want to refrigerate them for some reason.
