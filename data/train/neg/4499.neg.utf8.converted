I'm not a huge soda drinker because of the carbs and calories. I don't ever drink traditional diet drinks because I do not like the diet soda taste. I use stevia in the raw at home daily and I have enjoyed the lack of calorie sweetness that it gives me, which lead me to try these sodas.<br /><br />To wrap it up, they have a very strong diet drink taste which is what I was trying to avoid to begin with. If you don't like artificial sweeteners as a concept but don't mind the taste, these drinks may be a more natural alternative for you. Dont expect any of the flavors to taste like anything but a diet soda.
