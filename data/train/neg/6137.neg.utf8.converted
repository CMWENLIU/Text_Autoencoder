This candy is my daughter's favorite.  Unfortunately, all of the bags had excess moisture in the bags.  Most of the sugar was melted off the gummy candies; the candy is sticky and very messy in the bag and on the fingers.  The only place she could find this candy was at the college store, but it wasn't messy like these bags.
