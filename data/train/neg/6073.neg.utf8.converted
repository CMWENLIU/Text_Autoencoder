I bought this product due to all the good reviews.  I bbq using a weber smokey mountain often.  I usually make my own rubs.  I thought this might be a good product to keep on hand in case I didn't feel like making a rub.<br /><br />Most good bbq rubs have a base of salt and brown sugar.  This rub does not contain any sugar.  It is however very heavy on the salt.  I am used to using a large amount of rub when bbq to get a nice bark.  I made some ribs using this rub and they were so salty they were almost inedible.  I tasted the rub before hand and cut it with some brown sugar but clearly not enough.<br /><br />I have used this rub on other foods and had better results.  A little is very delicious on french fries or corn on the cob where I use this in place of salt.<br /><br />If you intend on using this rub heavily for low and slow cooking plan on cutting it heavily with brown sugar.  I prefer a salty spicy rub over an overly sweet rub but this is too much on its own.  I just wish they used more of the other ingrediantes and less salt as the spice is very tasty.<br /><br />If you plan on using this to spice up other foods in place of salt you may be very happy with this.
