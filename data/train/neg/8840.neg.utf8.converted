Emeril's coffees have a burnt flavor.  It is good strong coffee and would have been very good but the burnt flavor ruins any enjoyment.  The bold roast gives it the burnt flavor.  Don't confuse bold roast with strong coffee.  My husband loves very strong coffee and even he could not drink this.  Disappointed.
