This tea looks great. That made the disappointment worse when I tasted it.<br />There is almost no aroma, the tea is very weak and pretty tasteless.<br />The reason I bought it is because my wife and I really loved <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DRJ6">Dilmah Earl Grey Loose Leaf</a>, so we decided to try other Dilmah prodicts.<br />This one has disappointed us. I'd given it 3 stars if it was not sold at Premium price, but taken price/value into account, I only give it 2.
