We bought this product because we were testing out formulas for my newborn. My wife has to attend school and we wanted some formula on hand in case our baby wouldn't take to a bottle with her breast milk in it. One morning our baby woke up and since my wife hadn't gotten much sleep that night I decided to try it out and see how our little girl liked it. What a big mistake. I prepared the bottle EXACTLY how the instructions on the label say, but as soon as I put the bottle to her mouth and started tipping it, it squirted her in the eye and made a big mess all over her clothes. The same result happened when we tried a couple more bottles. Just goes to show you how much effort they actually put into their product. We will never buy from this company again and we highly recommend everyone to stay far away from Enfamil due to the poor quality and bad experiences we have had with their products.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/08/2011: It turns out that the bottles were defective and had to be recalled due to the rubber part of the nipple not being made thick enough. The company contacted us to apologize and even gave us some coupons for free products. They were a little slow to respond to us, but they treated us with respect and were very helpful. We now use the Enfamil Gentlease and are very pleased with the results
