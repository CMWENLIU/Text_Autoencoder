I used to love these when they were still available in the U.S.  I ordered them from this seller and they tasted like axle grease.  I'm not even kidding.  I was skeptical from the moment I opened the package considering they had used musty old newspaper for padding.  They refused to refund my money on the grounds that they hadn't heard complaints from any other customers, which seems like a blatant lie considering there are other reviews on here complaining about the exact same thing.  Order only if you like playing Russian roulette with candy from a dishonest seller.
