<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M59RZQ">Mom Made Foods Cheese Pizza Munchie, 5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)</a><br /><br />Amazon service is top notch.<br />Occasionally, a Seller slips in a pathetic excuse for a product.<br />The advertised pictures of the product have no resemblence to the product delivered.<br />The taste and texture of this expensive snack size frozen pizza is much like pulverized cardboard.<br />I splurged financially on this item hoping for an exceptional eating experience, to treat myself.<br />It was and is HORRIBLE.<br />I cannot return the 7 unopened boxes as it is too difficult to safely package and deliver frozen foods.<br />Even the ingredients listing are false.<br />Try this product at Amazon.<br />You will find every statement I have said is True.<br />I have found every other product so far acceptable and fair for the price.<br />I just didn't want other good Amazon customers to be ripped off by MOM MADE PIZZA.
