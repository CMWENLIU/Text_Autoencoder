I just had a bowl of this stuff.  It tasted all tomato with no meat of any kind.  In fact, the soup itself is pretty much like brown gravy with tomato paste or tomato sauce added.  There is no meat at all.  You could eat a bowl of it with a sturdy straw.  It was gross.  I will not even have it again.
