If you have loved Potato Buds for years, stay away from the "new & improved" version.  Horrible, truly disgusting, and what's even worse...the company doesn't care and intends to keep turning out this tripe.  They even blame the poor reception of the "improved" version on the customers, saying they are just fine if prepared according to the box.  Um, no.  It tastes awful.  It's so sad, because this used to be a great product.
