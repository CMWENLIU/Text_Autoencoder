I recently purchased a nut milk bag for $11.95.  It was advertsed as "NEW & IMPROVED".  Now I'm a seamstress and what I received was about &lt;$1.00 in materials and didn't look like much of anything, I might add.  Don't know how you can justify charging $12 for the thing.  Furthermore,  I couldn't figure out what was new and improved about it--it wasn't even tapered at the bottom or have a friction clasp on it.  I would have seamed the sides and not the bottom where the milk comes out. Just found a slightly larger one online for $7.75.  That's like a 120% markup.  Granted it's only a $12 item + shipping and I'm sure it works fine, but I can go to Home Depot and get paint strainig bags for a lot less that work just as well.
