Although the Seller was notified at least twice that there had been considerable breakage in the shipment; he never so much as even wrote me a note. Too many bottles were jammed into a large carton at origin, causing the breakage problem (16 - 32-bottles total, as I recall). As far as I can tell, this Seller could care less about standing behind his product; or, even half-way trying to keep his customer(s) happy. Evidently his business is so good that it just does not matter what his Buyers think! Very, very poor treatment can be expected if you buy here. Given the way they package the orders, expect lots of broken glass. Grade: DDD---
