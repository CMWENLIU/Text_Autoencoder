Do you enjoy the taste of a well-brewed cup of coffee, made from high-quality, freshly ground Arabica beans? If your answer is "Yes", then do not, for any reason, be persuaded to purchase any single cup brewing system nor any brand of pre-packaged coffees, teas, etc. If you enjoy the taste of instant coffee, then you might be satisfied with the mediocre results obtained from these unbelievably popular and overpriced brewing systems.<br /><br />I have tried them all: Keurig, Tassimo, Illy, along with pre-packaged coffees from Timothy's, Green Mountain, Tully's, etc. I have even used my own freshly ground high-grade coffees in these machines. The results are always the same: insipid, dull drinks. How these systems continue to sell is a mystery to me. All the "high-tech" design that goes into making these systems easy to use and convenient cannot overcome their one common fatal flaw - they all rely on vacuum-packed coffee which has lost all of it's aromatic oils and is essentially stale when it is brewed. And the brief time that these machines allow heated water to contact the coffee simply does not constitute "brewing".<br /><br />Einstein once said, "Perfection of means and confusion of ends characterize this age." He could have been talking about these brewing systems. They're great in concept, and well-designed and fabricated... But they can't produce a decent cup of coffee. Isn't that the point? (It reminds one of the futility of creating life-like stereo sound equipment, so that people can play "Rap" on it.)<br /><br />If you really love good coffee, forget the convenience temptation of these systems, and brew your cup the old-fashioned way. You'll save money, and you won't regret having wasted it on something that will wind up in your next garage sale.
