I suppose if you like this or not just depends on your taste buds... I am vegan, and I haven't had chicken in a long time... and this was still terrible! I couldn't stand the smell, and I couldn't stomach swollowing the few bites I tried. My tip would be, try ONE can of this first and see if you like it. Don't make the same mistake I did in buying a whole case, just to find out that it doesn't agree with you!!
