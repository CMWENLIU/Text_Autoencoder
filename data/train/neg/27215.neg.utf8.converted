To me, these are some of the worst teas I've ever had.  I can only guess that most of the people who love PG Tips have never had real Asian/Chinese teas.  PG Tips are way too strong (in a bad way) and leave a "scratchy" feeling in the mouth, which is THE one thing that should NOT happen after drinking tea.  The aftertaste is pretty much non-existent.  I thought maybe these were meant for adding milk and sugar so I gave it a try - it didn't improve the taste at all.<br /><br />I can understand that people have different preferences and such but I didn't think they would be THIS different!<br /><br />Anyway, I won't be buying these teas ever again.
