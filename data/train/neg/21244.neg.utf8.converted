This stuff tastes about as bland as salted rice cakes, so it tastes healthy, but really I don't consider 8g fat (0.5g saturated) or 12% (4% saturated) of RDA to be all that great. Packs 28g (9% RDA) in carbs and 400mg (17% RDA) in sodium.<br /><br />It's not a bad chip but for health matters it's just a normal bag of chips as far as Nutrition Facts are concerned.<br /><br />On the other hand, it *is* baked, has zero cholesterol, and contains all-natural ingredients (mainly flour, sunflower oil, and sea salt).
