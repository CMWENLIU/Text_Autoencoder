I was excited to find these on Amazon after trying them on a recent flight.  When we had them on the airplane, they were creamy and delicious, just like the name!  So I ordered them from Amazon and was sorely disappointed.  When I opened the crackers, they tasted dry and stale, but were still edible so I thought perhaps they were just a different cracker than what I had originally had.  I looked all over the packages for an expiration date and couldn't find anything printed.  Finally, when I examined the cardboard shipping box they came in, I realized that the crackers had expired TWO YEARS AGO!  Amazon was good about refunding my money immediately, but the seller should be ashamed!
