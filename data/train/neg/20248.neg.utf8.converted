We have enjoyed the 60% as an after dinner snack too for several years.  And I think they do well in baking.  BUT - as of a month ago,they started to taste different!  More like the cheaper store brands made with chocolate liqueur.  I noticed a different packaging in some of the stores as well.  The look is the same but the packaging material is slightly different.  Has Ghiradelli changed its formula?  Yuck.  Anyone have any insight?
