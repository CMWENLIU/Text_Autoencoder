BASED ON an Amazon customer's valid comment today, I'm AMENDING THIS REVIEW to encourage readers to consider that it has been a long time since I wrote the review and that it could have merely been a bad batch for that month.  I'll place an order with every confidence that the tomatoes will be of high quality.  Indeed, it was never my intention to be unfair to the manufacturer.<br />____________________<br /><br />Briefly put, the tomatoes that should have a sweet, mellow taste instead have a "tin-can" taste.  Was mine an isolated case? The company alone will have to answer that question.  I'm only advising potential buyers to exercise caution.  The product is produced in Italy, by the way, with home-grown tomatoes, so they should have tasted wonderful.
