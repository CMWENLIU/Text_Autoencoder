I found the same box of Dove dark chocolate bars at a local bulk warehouse store for 35% less and didn't have to pay the extraordinarily high shipping to boot which put this box at 100% more than what it costs to buy it locally.  Go figure why this seller doesn't offer it thru Prime.  The box of chocolate we bought from this seller arrived melted which caused everything to separate once it cooled.  Do what I did and shop around... unless you live somewhere you have to buy it over the internet.
