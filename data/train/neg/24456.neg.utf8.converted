In my quest for a lobster bisque that carries a genunine taste of lobster, this one (so far) would sit at the very bottom of the list. The label says that it includes minced lobster. As there did not appear to be any discernible chunks in the gelatinous contents (minced or otherwise); it would seem that the minced lobster meat must have also been pureed. There was nothing in the flavor of the bisque that suggested lobster was any part the ingredients. In addition, this is not an item that I would consider using as a base for some other recipe. If you are looking for the taste of lobster, this isn't it.
