I received the product promptly.  The problem is that there was something wrong with the hot chocolate mix.  It had a horrible taste.  I purchased the exact same one a couple of months ago from a dealer from Amazon and it was wonderful.  This purchase was a disappointment.  The delivery and all was wonderful but the product seemed stale and just terrible.
