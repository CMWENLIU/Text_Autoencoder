I ordered this candy with the expectation that it would be sour and tart. It was not sour at all, the candy looked stale and tasted very bland.  I will never order from this seller again, I feel I have wasted my money. After searching other candy sellers, I wish I would have done it before buying this candy.  I actually found it much cheaper at gumballmachines.com. I feel like I've been ripped off! Lesson learned.
