I loved the idea of receiving Biscotti by mail at it is sort of a main stay for me.  I have it for my breakfast and at 4pm each evening, I may have another piece with my tea. I was so disappointed when it came as many of the biscotti were nothing more then crumbs. Whoops back to Cost Co.  Thanks.  BB
