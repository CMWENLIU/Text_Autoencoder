i'm still a fan of science diet, but why doesn't petco include a description of these cans?  i wanted the 2.9 oz cans and specifically did NOT want the 5.5 oz cans.  yet nowhere in the product description does it say whether it's 2.9 or 5.5 oz.  i guessed by the weight that it was 2.9 oz (the picture looks like the small can too), but it's 5.5 oz.  i already paid shipping once, no way am i paying to ship it back.  this mix up isn't the biggest deal in the world, just very annoying that such basic information is not included in the product description.
