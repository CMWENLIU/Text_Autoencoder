For those of you who love the Jack Daniels steak sauce at TGI Fridays, your going to be very disappointed if you buy this and expect it to taste like that. Its simply does not taste the same as the TGIF sauce. It tastes totally different, like A1 sauce.<br /><br />Not sure why TGI Fridays doesn't get the licensing and bottle the stuff.
