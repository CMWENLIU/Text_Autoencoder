Here is another company, that charges outlandish shipping & handling fees for their products.  I guess the old saying "Buyer Beware" applies to companies offering products cheaper than their competition.  When you add in the S&H fees, those cheaper prices suddenly become more expensive.  Hopefully, I've saved you from the same fate as yours truly!
