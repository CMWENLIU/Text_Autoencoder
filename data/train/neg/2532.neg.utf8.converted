I have always loved hearts of palm, but not these ones. The taste is good, but these Roland hearts of palm are hard as rocks. It may appear unbelievable, but only one stem out of ten were eatable. I would need special dog-like teeth to eat these. Will look for another brand of softer and more teeth-friendly ones.
