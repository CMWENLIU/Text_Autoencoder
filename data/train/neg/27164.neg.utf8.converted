The product is good, a little watery but to get broccoli to a puree you need a lot of water. The packaging clearly states on the conatiner net 4oz but when I weighed the product WITH the packaging it was only around 3.1-3.5. Net means what is inside the package (the actual food) so I believe they are falsely advertising. I contacted the company and I got an "I'm sorry you feel this way" response. I ordered 2 different kinds thinking maybe it was just that one box. . . nope the other box was exactly the same. I would go with Jack's Havest brand. They truely are 1oz or 3oz cubes of food, less watery and do not waste plastic containers. They also throw in a free bag of foos sometimes. I will not be ordering from this company again:(
