so, I love the other dried fruit organic products that Newmans makes so I thought I would love these.  The first order was ROTTEN it was so gross.  So I figured order it again Amazon was very nice and agreed to ship it to me for free and replace the first box - The second box is ROTTEN too and now I have to drive to purchase organic dried apricots-Amazon refunded my order amount but they were so gross to begin with...
