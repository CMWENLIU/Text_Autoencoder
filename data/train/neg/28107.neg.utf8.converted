The item name says "Frontier Poppy Seed Whole, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)".  I've ordered from Frontier before via our organic food co-op, so I know Frontier's packaging.  The packages I received don't have the word FRONTIER *ANYWHERE* on their label.  It does say Otto's European Import Store.  So is this a Frontier product or not?  I don't like buying  a product expecting one thing and then getting something else.  If you're connected with Frontier somehow, at least offer an explanation why the label/packaging would be different.  If this isn't from Frontier I don't think it's right for you to use that label/name. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNGJU0">Frontier Poppy Seed Whole, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a>
