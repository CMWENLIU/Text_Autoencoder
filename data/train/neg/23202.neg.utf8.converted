I have received this Satsuki Azalea as a gift. The person who gave it to me was very excited ... until the box was opened.  Wat we have found in the box was just a small bush, not cut, not trained at all, nothing that was even close to the picture. And I do not mean flowers. Well, I thought that it was my job to train it, which I will do.  By no means however it was the intent of the gift giver.
