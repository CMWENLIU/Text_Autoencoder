I was very excited when i saw this product, i'm one of those people eager to try anything, and I've had exotic meats before in a number of ways, through friends that hunt I've enjoyed home made dishes made from a wide variety of game animals, and i've had less common animals like ostrich, kangaroo, and aligator that i ordered on like and cooked myself, and i've even had a few of these meats as jerky by other companies. I like the meats of the animals they made these jerkies from, i need to stress that point, because otherwise you may think that is what my problem is. it's not, this product was AWFUL!! these were some of the worst cured meat snacks I've ever had.  Is it possible to rate something and give it no stars? because that is what this product deserves. the meat managed somehow to be both bland and surprisingly foul, and coated with enough grease to lubricate an engine. I have tried several of the strips and sticks and found that to be a universal condition. I can only think that the people who wrote the rave reviews for this product did so without tasting it. this is dreadful stuff, suited only for those who simply want the novelty of claiming they ate strange animals and don't care what it tasted like. this meat was not fit for human consumption, in fact, i wouldn't even give it to my dog. I won't be buying anything else from buffalo bob.
