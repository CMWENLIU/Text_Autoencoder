I thought this would be the best idea for an energy snack yet.  It tastes great, for that I may have given it four stars; but the packaging is terrible.  How do you get the almond butter clump stuck in the bottom third of the packet?  It will not roll-up from the bottom and whose mouth is big enough to eat it using your teeth like eating an "artichoke" leaf?  The point is to be able to eat this on the run which you cannot do with this package unless you have your dissecting kit with you.  Someone needs to post a video on how to eat this.
