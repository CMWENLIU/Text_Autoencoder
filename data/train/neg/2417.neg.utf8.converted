I thought I'd give these Planters cashews a try, after buying from a nut specialty site for years. Planters are much cheaper (about $7/lb base price, compared to about $8.75/lb from my usual site). They were also smaller. Since they were only advertised as "whole" I guess the size would not be a mischaracterization. However, many of the nuts were broken, so the description of "whole" was certainly  a mischaracterization.  They are more lightly salted than most nuts we are used to in the US.  Lower sodium intake is a worthy health goal, but not my personal taste preference, whether or not the salt is "sea". All-in-all  the  "deluxe"  description seems quite a stretch<br /><br />Bottom line, a good buy if price is the overriding goal.
