These cookies are a little strange. They are a bit chewy. They are a little dry. But the grains do appear to be healthy and much better than other cookies. They need to be bigger / MORE and cost less. There is only 8 small ones in the box and most of the box is packaging. Which makes it look like there could be more, but isn't. I hate it when manufactures do this, its the old "packaging con." They should be taxed for excessive use of packaging, especially plastic.. erhmmm erhmmm.. Cos*co. Each of the cookies is a bit small, some in the box are smaller than others. You could easily eat 3-4, then that would be almost half the box consuming more than a dollar. I would give then 4/5 stars if they put 16-20 in a box for the same price, and I bet the same size (volume) box would be possible too!
