I considered buying these in bulk here on Amazon, then realized that i would be over paying! The very same bars are $3 for a box of 8... to get 48 bars, would would be spending $18, instead of $22+ (shipping, tax, etc). Plus, then i can choose the variety of flavors we want, not what is pre-boxed. While some of the bulk items here are a deal, many are not!
