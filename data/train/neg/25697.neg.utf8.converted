I regularly drink herbal iced teas at home, but I also bring powdered flavor packets and bottled water to drink at work.  I much prefer the flavor of real iced tea, but flavored water can be a good convenient and cost effective drink while away from home.  The MIO flavoring is a good concept for flavoring water easily since you don't have to deal with messy powders  (which often seem to spill and go everywhere), but it has some flaws that keep it from being a great product.<br /><br />I have tried two different flavors of MIO, and those were the Mango Peach and the Peach Tea.  The Peach Tea is much better than this one.  The mango peach flavor has an unbearable acidic aftertaste that is like a really unpleasant citrus kool-aid.  Ugh, I can feel my heartburn forming even now.  However, I could probably make myself drink it if it were a great value...<br /><br />So, let's talk price.  These things are not cheap.  They are about $5 a piece and even though they flavor multiple drinks, I ended up having to use two whole squirts to get it to an acceptable flavor level.  This is more than their recommended amount of one squirt.  So, really, the value is not that great here.  Honestly, though, the acidity is so high and unpleasant here that I'd recommend just staying away from this flavor.  If you are interested in MIO despite its price, just try the Peach Tea one because it has much less acidity.
