If there had been more information about these olives I could have chosen better. I love the Ionian green olives so I tried another Peloponnese product. I think this is an excellent company, the olives are meaty and attractive, but I don't like olives with a bunch of dried herbs flavoring them. To their credit, that flavor is not as heavy handed as some. Oregano just seems to get stronger and stronger, and to me, very objectionable. I'm going to get some more Ionian Greens - unflavored, straight up olives. I'm sure there's room in the refrigerator for 10 pounds of olives....
