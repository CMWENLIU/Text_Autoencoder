I had just recently ran out of green tea and the tea I usually get on amazon was no longer available, so I decided to give this one a try since it was 15% off with the gevalia discount + 15% off with subscribe and save. I made the tea and couldn't swallow more than one sip. It smelled horrible and had a really bad fake lemon-like taste. I forced myself to try it again, just in case it was just a one time thing, nope, still bad. I recommend you don't buy this tea, instead get yogi green tea. This green tea is bad quality and tastes atrocious. Plus, I can't return it to amazon since it is a grocery item...
