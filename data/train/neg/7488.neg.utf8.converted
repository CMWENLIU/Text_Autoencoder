I love smoked canned fish.<br /><br />I eat kippered snacks and sardines quite regularly. I was pretty excited when I saw these kippers for sale. I promptly ordered a dozen cans because I was attracted to the high quality packaging and the eco friendly lingo on the cover.<br /><br />The interior of the can leaves much to be desired. The fish seams to be over cooked and falling apart. The flavor is pleasant but was greatly aided by a couple of turns of my sea salt mill. The smoke flavor is very mild and not at all what I expect from a kippered snack. The smoke flavor is there but not nearly as strong as I would desire.<br /><br />In all honesty I prefer the $1.00 cans of Brunswick kippered seafood snack I pick up at my local Big Lots. They are firm, smokey and correctly seasoned.  For a truly divine kipper experience I would recommend trying the Appel brand of kippers available here on Amazon.
