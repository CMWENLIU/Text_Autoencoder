This is just one of two types of canned fruit from Roland that I do NOT like.  It's like they picked totally unripened  pineapples and just sliced and packed them in the unripened fruit juices.  They are really quite awful!  The one and only can I opened... I ended up throwing out 75 % of it.  The remaining 11 cans I plan to use in making smoothies or on top of hams being cooked or anywhere that pineapples are just a secondary article in the cooked product.  When I bought other company's products, I use to love just opening a can and eating several slices for a sweet, delicious desert.  You can not do that with these tasteless, hard, bitter, totally unsweet cans of fruit.  I will not be buying this particular canned fruit from Roland ever again but they do make many other canned fruits that are scrumptious so, along with the awful Kiwi, I will add this to my 'DO NOT BUY' list!!!  Maybe they were having an "OFF" production cycle but it does not justify selling this crap to us consumers.
