I love cashews and I've loved other Emerald cashews I've tried....but these are just too darned salty (and I love salt). The pepper further adds to the problem. There's just not a lot of cashew taste, because the sea salt and the pepper overpower the taste of the nuts.<br /><br />I would not purchase these in the store - especially since our local Kroger sells other similar Emerald brands for $6.99 for the 10 oz cannister. That's just too much money for a mouthful of salt.
