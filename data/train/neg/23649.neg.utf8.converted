When BC first released the GF mixes this cake mix was Gluten Free and Soy Free.  They listed possible CC from Soy so I tried it with reservations the first time, but it didn't bother me.  I was thrilled!  I loved the convenience of actually buying a GF cake mix in the store instead of off the internet in bulk.  Those days are gone.  They reformulated and dumped a load of soy flour into this cake mix.  Why?  Who knows, but in doing so they lost this customer and quite a few other Celiacs who also cannot tolerate soy.  Way to win customers and make money.<br /><br />On the up side Amazon is thrilled; they've got this GF cake mix customer back.
