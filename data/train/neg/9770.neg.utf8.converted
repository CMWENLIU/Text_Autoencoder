YOU CAN'T CALL THIS PRODUCT LICORICE...HAS AN AMMONIA TASTE AND GAVE ME GAS.  IN RETURNS IT SAYS THERE ARE NO RETURNS, YOU WILL BE STUCK WITH THE MOST HORRIBLE TASTING BLACK BEARS.  ANY ONE THAT GAVE THIS PRODUCT A FAVORABLE REVIEW IS LACKING THE SENSE OF TASTE.  I HAVE BEEN BUYING THE VINE BRAND LICORICE WHICH IS GREAT, AND WILL THROW GUSTAF'S SUGAR FREE BEARS IN THE TRASH BIN.
