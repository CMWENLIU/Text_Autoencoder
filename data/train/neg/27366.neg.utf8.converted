I like organic. We do organic milk and meat, and vegetables when we can afford the latter. My children like macaroni and cheese - not my homemade casserole, of course (lol), but out of a box. (Reasons for this preference are unknown.)<br /><br />In any case, you would think organic *Back to Nature Macaroni & Cheese* would be popular at our house but it's not. Simple put, my children won't eat it.<br /><br />Perhaps it is because of the lack of chemicals that the cheese sauce comes out a little grainy. Or maybe I just made it wrong, but my testy tikes won't gobble this down like non-organic, over-processed wheat Kraft Mac.<br /><br />Two Stars. Maybe I just had a bad box. Or maybe I just didn't make it right that day, but my two (boy and girl) would not eat this macaroni and cheese product. If you are going to try it (products do get IMPROVED every day) then my advice would be to buy ONE box and try it; and not a case.
