We bought this recently and was disappointed because Earth's best in general is a good at giving variety in their bulk packs. The main point for us purchasing jarred foods is for variety. Yet, 9 out of the 12 jars in the pack has banana. I'm not sure how that can be considered a variety.  I would not buy this again. Mainly because bananas are cheap and easy to feed your toddler. Why would you want to be gouged for the mark up?<br /><br />Also, I don't see how they can label them stage 2 when they have the consistency of stage 1 food.
