This stuff is soooooooooooooo good. I could eat it out of the jar all day! My only problem is how RIDICULOUSLY overpriced this is. Its currently ~$13 at my local Whole Foods. As a college student,I can't be spending that much on something like this!<br /><br />That said, I found a CHEAP, EASY alternative that tastes JUST like it. I went to my local indian food store and bought a few bags of powdered / coconut flakes for about $1.50 , threw it in the blender on pulse for a few min, then on high, then on medium, then when it started getting clumped and creamy I set it to low for about 5-6 minutes. Tastes JUST Like it, same consistency, taste, everything. No oil needed,no milk, no sugar, no heat, not even a food processor. The oils come out naturally from the dried coconut flakes/ powder. The butter came out a bit creamier than that in the can, which is a bonus for some considering consistency seemed to be the biggest complain against this product. Anyways, I just saved myself over $10 making this in 15min or less. Artisana is banking serious $$ on something so simple and inexpensive to make. Enjoy! Thank me later lol.
