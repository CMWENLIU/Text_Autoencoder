I got this toy because I wanted my cat to work a little for his food.  This toy was not the cat-torturing puzzle I was hoping for.  Unfortunately, my cat figured out how to get the food out efficiently in under 3 minutes.  It's not terribly tricky as the toy is essentially a hollow plastic ball with a hole in one side.  Food comes out almost every time my cat taps the ball.  It comes out so easily, more comes out than he sometimes wants to eat in one sitting.  I often find little trails of kibble all over the living room.  Still, I guess having to tap the ball a few times to get his food is more work than just eating it out of a bowl.  Also, you can pry the ball open so that you can clean it, which is a plus.
