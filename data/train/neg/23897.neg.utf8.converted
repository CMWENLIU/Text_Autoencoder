I was so excited to find my old favorite tea on amazon. I have been looking for it in supermarkets for months, but thought it had been discontinued. However I wish I had listened to the earlier review. This is not the same formula as it was, the peppermint overpowers all the other flavors in this tea. It used to have a citrusy flavor, tangy and lovely, now all you can smell or taste is peppermint and I don't like peppermint tea.
