This product has to be one of the most frustrating products that I have used in years.  The dispensing system doesn't work at all.  I bought two bottles and, with each, spent about 45 minutes spraying the lawn while getting eaten by mosquitoes before realizing that not a single drop of teh active ingredients were actually getting dispensed out the hose.  Fortunately I had an older bottle with a better dispenser and used that bottle to spray.  Unfortunately, that dispenser eventually fell apart, and when I needed a new bottle, I was back with the latest dispenser.  For this third bottle, the entire dispenser blew up in my face when I turned on the nozzle, so I got the chemical in my eyes, my mouth, my hair, everywhere.  Absolute POS.  The people at Cutter should be mortified that they sell a product that is this crappy.
