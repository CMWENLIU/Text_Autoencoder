First of all it was mailed in a soft carton envelope which was broken through when I got it.  It should be mailed in a box. The product is a powdered mix, not a ready to drink liquid, label says 14.1 oz. not 18 oz.  I happen to be having a problem with my hands so opening/closing the envelope and mixing the powder is a problem. Description should say powdered mix.
