Well, I though I can buy this from amazon instead of going to an Asian market, since I now live in a small town.<br /><br />I should have just bought one to try it out first.<br /><br />I am Chinese, and this is not mapo tofu, Its not num, its not spicy, its a mild kongpao chicken-ish sauce. You want real taste of famous Sichuan dish? Not gonna get it from this thing.
