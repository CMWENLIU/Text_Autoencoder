I've tried about 6 batches using this starter, and it's just not working for me.  After 10, 14, 18 hours (!) still just slightly thickened milk!  I've followed the instructions to a T, and I have an electric yogurt maker, so I know (assume) the temperature is correct, as I've had great success using store-bought yogurt as starter (which I felt kind of canceled out the benefits of homemade), but I just can't get a batch of thick, rich, yummy yogurt from this product.  Must be me, since everyone else thinks it's great, but I'm at a loss as to understand my lack of success.
