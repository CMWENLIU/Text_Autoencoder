"Green Tea with Pomegranate and Acai" seems more like an attempt to cash in on a health fad instead of creating a balanced and delicious tea.  Here you have three products that have recently been hailed as miracle foods all bundled into one cuppa together.<br /><br />Although the health benefits and drawbacks of both green tea and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932657746">pomegranate juice</a> have been well-documented, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QZWTDS">Acai berry's</a> claims are more tenuous.  Acai berries have fewer antioxidants than grapes or blueberries, and no credible evidence exists supporting the other miraculous claims.  Even so, with this tea listing "pomegranate and acai flavors" as the final ingredient on the package, the amount of each fruit is so minimal as to be inconsequential.  There is far more "organic hibiscus" and "organic rose hips" in this tea than either pomegranate or acai "flavors."<br /><br />But the real bottom line on any tea is the "Green Tea with Pomegranate and Acai" just doesn't taste very nice.  It tastes like none of the listed ingredients, and comes off as more of an attempt at making <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5DG0">Kool-Aid</a>-flavored  tea than anything else.
