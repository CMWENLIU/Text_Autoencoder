If you like your mangoes very ripe and mushy, bathed in mango puree, this is for you.<br /><br />Clearly, I do not find this product appealing.<br /><br />However, if I were to make mango mousse, mango jello, or anything else where I might need pureed mangoes these would be perfect. (They do have chunks in the can, but since they're so soft pulverizing them in a blender seems a natural thing to do.)<br /><br />This would probably also make great smoothies, mango gelato, mango bread pudding...you get the idea.
