This product is not the Oi Ocha product that is sold in Japan. This product appears to be the Koi Ocha product repackaged as Oi Ocha for the USA. I have uploaded the picture to compare this product with the original Oi Ocha. Though I don't have Koi Ocha with me at the moment to verify that this is in fact the repackaged Koi Ocha.<br /><br />Koi Ocha (this product) is not a bad product, but it's not the normal green tea that is "Japan's #1 Green Tea" as claimed on package of this product. It has taste that seem to be cross between oolong tea and green tea. It's less mild and more bitter than the original Oi Ocha, and it has less depth with cheap taste.<br /><br />I'm very dissapointed with how Ito-en is misrepresenting their own product and won't be buying these again.
