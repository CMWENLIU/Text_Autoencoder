I rated this product a 2 because this game is designed to be played be a husband and wife but the questions are questionable.<br /><br />If you are looking for a romantic evening you don't want questions like, "have you ever had sex with a co-worker, at work?"  Many of the questions do nothing for building relationships.  For some of you, it might lead to a fight.<br /><br />The folks who developed questions for this game seem like a bunch of juveniles who don't understand the context of the game.  This game would be much better if it had positive relationship building questions instead of Beeves and Butt-head humor.
