The sardines are excellent in every way. Delivery is unreliable.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EEWZF0">Crown Prince Natural Skinless & Boneless Sardines in Pure Olive Oil, 3.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />I had signed up for Subscribe & Save for this product - one case (12 count) every 3 months. The initial shipment went without a hitch.<br /><br />When the time came for my second shipment, I was notified by email that "This item is not currently eligible for Subscribe & Save." No other information was offered, and Customer Service was unable to explain the problem or offer any solution.<br /><br />I expect that if Amazon and the manufacturer offer a product, that they would fulfill the agreement, or at the very least offer an alternative.
