This should be called mush in a can. Why is the low sodium version so unrecognizable, grainy and mushy without the chunk qualities you expect when opening canned chicken.  I need low sodium fast lunch solutions and was hoping this would help. What a rip off, it looks like they canned the leftover dredges from their premium breast of chicken and slapped a low sodium label on it. Shame on you Hormel!!
