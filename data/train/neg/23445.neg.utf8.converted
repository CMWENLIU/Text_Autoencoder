If you like rice, quinoa or garlic then don't buy this product. I love quinoa and quinoa/rice blends. I love garlic and lots of it. Raw, baked, paste, confit in oil...you name it. This, sadly, wasn't rice/quinoa/garlic as I know it.<br /><br />-First off, the blend doesn't quite look like it shows on the package, of course.The colours are more drab and khaki-hued. Yummy! There's also not nearly as much quinoa in the package as there appears to be in the picture. In the picture it looks like roughly 60/40 or 50/50 rice:quinoa. In real life, it's more like 90/10...MAYBE 75/25 if you want to be generous.<br /><br />-Secondly, whatever Seeds of Change did to the 'garlic' in this stuff shouldn't happen to a hardened criminal! The smell is unbearable. Pungent, cloying and slightly sour. Very unappetising. Mixed with the drab colour of the final cooked product, it doesn't really put it's best foot forward if you know what I mean. Just by the smell and look alone, I was already losing my appetite, and I was *quite* hungry when we prepared this. Great if you're on a diet, I suppose...<br /><br />-It tastes as bad as it smells, but fortunately not as cloying. There is no depth of flavour, so the taste doesn't really linger long on the tongue. This is actually in the 'Pro' column since the taste is dreadful. Flat, cardboard-like, faintly acrid, and the only thing vaguely resembling garlic is the aftertaste and smell it leaves on your breath. When there's more aftertaste than initial taste, that's never a good sign. It's as if they took immature garlic, slightly burnt it, dehydrated it, pulverised it to a fine powder and threw it in the package as an afterthought. VERY disappointing as I've had other Seeds of Change products and liked them quite a bit!<br /><br />-I *will* say that they did a great job on the texture. The texture was very nice, just the right kind of 'al dente' that I like. This, regrettably, put all the other defects of the product into sharper relief. If only it didn't taste terrible!<br /><br />-You might be able to doctor this product up with some sort of sauce or extra seasonings but 1)that could be risking making it worse and 2)why would you waste the time and effort. Simply buy something else.<br /><br />But, please, do yourself a favour and don't buy this.
