Skip eating questionable food from China and demand USA grown food. You can get garlic grown in the USA at your farmer's market. You can also get it from farmers online and distributors such as: spicesinc.com. Or you can search under "garlic not grown in China" like I did. It does exist.<br /><br />Please join me in encouraging Amazon to get an organic source of garlic that is not from China; they currently have none. Let's help our own economy and not buy food from communist China.
