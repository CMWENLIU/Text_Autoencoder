I am so disappointed in this product. It broke the fourth time I used it and the warranty still requires me to pay $10 to have it fixed or replaced (which especially stinks given that this was a gift). It purees food okay, but not as finely as my food processor, and I think that is really sad considering it's the primary job of this machine. Also, it leaves too much liquid in the chamber after steaming, and made my puree too thin.  I had to start draining water before pureeing my food, which is a pain.<br /><br />And to add insult to injury, the metallic chamber where the water reserve lives, it somehow affected the taste of the water and made my fruits taste metallic. The steamer feature would be nice if it didn't make the food taste funny.  No sense in making organic baby food yourself if your child won't eat it due to the aftertaste.<br /><br />I'm so bummed as I had high hopes for this machine.  I recommend you get a food processor instead- it will work better for baby foods, and you'll get more mileage out of it.
