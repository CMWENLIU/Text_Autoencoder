I bought a package with 2 or 3.  I had a hard time finding my girl a chew that she enjoyed that wasn't edible or would at least last longer than 10 minutes.  Although my girl is a medium size dog, she is one powerful chewer, she can devour the largest Buzy Bone in under 30 minutes. So, I thought she might enjoy these, she did have minimal interest and would chew on it maybe a couple of minutes after she saw the cat licking it once in awhile, but then would leave it.<br />  I started fostering a chihuahua pup, he found them and fell in love with them. So, of course now that my girl saw he liked them she had decided after all this time she needed just to go a head and eat one.  Now she has thrown up twice so far and what was in the vomit was the pieces of the chew.<br />  After all the searching I did to find something, it was a 3 dollar hollow white bone, that doesn't seem to splinter, at Petsmart.  I put a spoon full of a wet food in there for a treat, she will grab that bone quite frequently and stay occupied for up to 30 minutes just chewing, she still has the original bone, plus a new one.  That's what I wanted, just something she enjoyed chewing without feeling like she was getting too much junk food.
