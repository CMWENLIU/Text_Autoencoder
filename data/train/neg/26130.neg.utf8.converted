I don't consider myself a food snob by any means, but this isn't the best.<br /><br />The good stuff is a pure almond-sugar paste. This has a slight almond-lemony flavor that's loaded with corn syrup, definitely isn't the real deal. I would imagine if you grew up with this, you may have a nostalgic connection to it; you may like it if you like very sugary-tasting sweets.<br /><br />Personally I'll keep looking. I thought when I found it at T.J. Maxx it was a good deal but it was disappointing. Also, the fruits look dimensional through the box lid, but really they're cut in half. I'd love to be able to find someplace in the U.S. that offers the real fruit-shaped marzipan instead of these expensive substitutes. Bummer.
