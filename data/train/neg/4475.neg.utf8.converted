These are just like any other noodles... the only difference is that it takes twice as much to cook.  The sauce that comes with it is EXTREMELY HORRIBLE.  It tastes so bad that I had to use my own spaghetti sauce.<br /><br />1.  Would I eat the rest I have left?  Only if I'm really hungry.<br /><br />2.  Would I buy it again? No<br /><br />3.  Would I recommend it? No
