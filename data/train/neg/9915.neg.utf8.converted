I bought this because I wanted to use it in my emergency food rotation and I have not found it in my local area. I am sure I could train a chimp to ship this product w/ more care. Out of the 24 cans, only 8 are usable. It appears to me, whoever shipped this product, dropped it, was to lazy to pick it up, kicked it to the spot where the shipping box was, picked it up and said hey Frank catch, Frank missed so he ran over it w/ a forklift, the janitor then picked it up and said, this should not be left on the floor and set it in the shipping box, but the janitor didn't know where to find shipping tape, so he put it on the delivery truck as is, completely opened. Wow that was a long poorly constructed sentance, only to say from now on I'll stick to local grocery stores.
