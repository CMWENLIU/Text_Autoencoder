Denial...this product has the same amount of sugar as regular soda.  Cane, beet, corn, or fruit...it's all sugar and the human body doesn't see any difference.<br /><br />So enjoy your carbonated sugar water (with the cutsie name), but don't lie to yourself and pretend it's good for you (or your children).
