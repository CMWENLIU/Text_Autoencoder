THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCT LEAVES ALOT TO BE DESIRED. THE NOODLES WERE DISGUSTING. IF I HAD KNOWN THEY WERE SHIPPED IN LIQUID AND NEEDED TO BE REFRIGERATED, I WOULD NEVER HAVE PURCHASED THEM. THEY HAVE NO FLAVOR AND THE TEXTURE IS DISGUSTING. I NOW HAVE THREE PACKS OF NOODLES SITTING IN MY REFRIGERATOR THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH. CONSIDERING HOW EXPENSIVE THE SHIPPING COST WAS, I WILL BE THROWING MY MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. MY HUSBAND AND I LOVE THE VEGAN WAY OF LIFE. THIS PRODUCT IS GARBAGE.
