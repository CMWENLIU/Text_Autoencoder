Did you notice the price difference between this and competors?? Well my fiver year old grandson did not need to- he refused TO  drink it= said there wer caterpillars in it- well I raised five of my own and said please quit messing around and drink it- this after a cold hike- he kept saying he saw caterpillars- well My husband looked at it and told ME to look= I was HORRIFIEd at what I saw- I saw NO less then 6 creepy worm like bugs in his hot chocolate. I served a more reliable and expensive product and both HE and his sister were happy- AND the SWISS MISS product was NOT canister type-  it was sealed packet type- I probably after what I saw- never drink hot chocolate again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
