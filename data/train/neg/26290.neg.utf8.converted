After buying my 16 year old cat a bunch of different natural cat treats for Christmas for her to try, these were the only duds.  They sounded like they'd be great but, as another reviewer pointed out, some cats have issues figuring out how to eat these - that would be my cat.  She'd pick one up and it'd drop back out of her mouth onto the floor and then she'd leave it there and walk away or stare at the cabinet until I gave her something else, which is quite rare because normally she happily gobbles up most of the treats I give her right away.  She also wasn't enticed by the scent of these as with the other treats I got her, where she was licking the packaging or meowing to have some, and these she seemed like she could care less.  Hours later after she dropped the treats, she eventually went back and ate them but it seemed to be in a way that said, 'Meh, it's better than nothing.'  I don't know if she doesn't like them because she's not used to jerky treats and will be in due time or if she just simply doesn't like the taste, but if she continues to be this unenthusiastic as we go through the rest of the package I won't buy them again.<br /><br />Edited to add: After a couple more tries, my cat refuses to eat these at all.  Didn't even make a dent in the package!  Will give them away to another cat owner so they don't go to waste and hope they have better luck with them.
