I love Starbucks.  I love vanilla.  So why didn't this work for me?  Why didn't this become my go to coffee in the morning, the one I would want to brew on cold evenings at home, the one that would accompany after dinner desserts with friends and family?  I really couldn't tell you.  I found the taste to be off, in that I didn't even think of vanilla as I drank it.  It also had a very bitter after taste that stuck with me for awhile even after only one sip.  I even attempted to add more milk and more sugar to decrease the vial flavor but amazingly it was like the coffee fought back, denying all my attempts at actually making something drinkable.<br /><br />I am sorry Starbucks, but this was a fail for me.  Actually threw out the bag so I wouldn't even have it in my kitchen.  I'll try again with something else perhaps not "natually fused".
