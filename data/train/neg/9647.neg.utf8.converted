This thing is huge.  At full height it won't fit on the counter under the kitchen cabinets.  So definitely think about where you'll put this before you buy it.  Also, the output wasn't what I expected.  I've grown the herb kit and the tomato kit.  It's easier to grow tomatoes outside than in this thing.  I got a lot of dill from the herb kit, not much else.  I don't even use dill that much.  I'll definitely stick with an outdoor garden next year.
