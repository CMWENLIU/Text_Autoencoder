This Extra Strength product is much cheaper than even Regular Strength 5 Hour Power brand, but in my opinion tastes a lot more bitter and has a lot less caffeine. I gave it a try and went back to Regular Strength 5 Hour Power brand, because I didn't feel anything when I drank these.  The name brand costs more, but tastes better and has more caffeine.
