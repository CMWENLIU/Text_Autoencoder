I was in a hurry and looking to re-order the gallon bottle of O'Dells which was out of stock. I noticed this, which appears to be the same as O'Dells and didn't read closely that it was 16 ounces not 128 ounces due to the price being relatively close. Was shocked when it got here to discover it was only 16 ounces. Price comparison...O'Dells 128 ounces $17.99 (.14 per ounce) Paragon 16 ounce $12.63 (.78 per ounce). Run away from this item quickly. If O'Dells is unavailable, get the Wabash Valley Farms instead!
