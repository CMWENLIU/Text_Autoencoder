Having ordered pop rocks for a group of students over a year ago, it seemed like a good idea to order the 36 pack for a new group this fall. The order was placed in early August. It is currently September and although I have written Amazon for resolution and they responded nicely, the order of pop rocks has yet to arrive. The rocks were needed for a fun way to introduce science lab books to a group of fifth graders. Do be careful from whom you order.
