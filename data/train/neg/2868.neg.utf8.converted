I am normally a huge fan of all-natural, healthy, and organic snack foods such as this one.  However, the product is not what it says it is.  These strawberries are not crunchy, but rather chewy.  For me, they did not have a desirable texture.  It seems that one of two things may have happened here; either not all water was removed during the freeze-drying process or somehow air (and moisture) got into the package, taking away from the product's crunch.  Also buyer beware, because these packages are only 1 ounce, not 1.5 as the picture and product description state.
