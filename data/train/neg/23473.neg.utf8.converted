I'm not going to get into the quality of this product. I am going write about the deceptive selling practice. The Amazon title and description for the product indicates the product contains two 4-ounce packages. The picture shows a box with a content net weight of 4 oz. (112g). What I received is a 2-pack with each package containing 3-ounces. I would not have noticed this except that some one had hand-written a "3" over the 4 on the package. So I got 25% less product than clearly advertised. I would think that if some one knows and takes the time to correct the packaging, they would also correct the Amazon listing. I'm not a happy customer.
