I've bought this gum several times and it does have a good taste.  There is a little aftertaste to it, but nothing bad.  I only gave it two stars because I just didn't feel like I was on a coffee high.  Doesn't even come close to coffee.  Tastes good though and it can't hurt to try it.  Why am I doing a review on gum anyway?  Bored!
