I decided to try this product because it was cheap and I'm usually a vanilla person. I love vanilla everything and because I had already tried the chocolate version and wanted a change I thought this would be perfect. Turns out it wasn't. The taste is horrible. Even thought there's no aspartame it tastes like there's artificial sweeteners in it. The first time I tried it it made me gag. The only way I was able to finish the box was to put it in my shaker and just take very big gulps without breathing. That way it was over in less than 30sec. I've tried the chocolate and at fist didn't like it, but this stuff makes the chocolate taste like candy. The chocolate tastes just like chocolate (more like hot cocoa), but without  added sugar. This stuff does not resemble vanilla ice cream at all.<br />  I'm not gonna completely bash it however, because how many protein shakes actually taste good? Despite the taste, it did what it was supposed to do. I drank one of these and it kept me full for three hours which is great for only 180cal. These shakes have helped me control my eating and keep me on my 1200cal a day diet (200 cal every 3 hours). I never experienced gas, bloating or any kind of stomach cramps. If you can get over the taste which won't last too long if you just gulp them down then this product isn't too bad. I would recommend trying the chocolate flavor, however. It tastes more natural. I have yet to try the strawberry.
