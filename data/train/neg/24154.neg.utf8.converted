Apparently, Senseo has decided to abandoned the US market. It is nearly impossible to find Senseo at any of the traditional retailers, including Amazon, Walmart, or Target. Walmart is carrying Melitta brand pods that work in the Senseo, but the quality is not as good.<br /><br />It is interesting to note Amazon continues to list the Senseo brand in email blast, but the items are always out of stock. I wrote Senseo customer service about the issue, but they failed to respond.<br /><br />I'm going back to Costco brand ground coffee and the old reliable Mr. Coffee or Bunn for the morning jolt. I refuse to buy into another expensive pod or k-cup single serve system that changes as often as Gillette changes razor blade models.
