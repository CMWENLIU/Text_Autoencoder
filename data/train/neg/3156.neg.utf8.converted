After enjoying Passion Iced Tea at Starbucks brick and mortar stores, I was excited to make some at home with the filter bags. I would have never ordered it if I knew that it would cost me not only $27 but hours of dealing with customer service with no resolution, no filter bags, and no refund.<br /><br />In short:<br />At the end of the day, only purchase from companies you can trust. Starbucks is no longer in my list of go to trust-worthy companies. I now purchase Mighty Leaf Teas instead.<br /><br />The full story:<br />I purchased two starbucks products the Passion Iced Tea Filter bags (PITFB)and Earl Grey Tea Bags. I received the Tea Bags but not the Passion Iced Tea. I inquired with Starbucks to follow-up on the missing merchandise. Starbucks advised that the PITFB were mailed out in a separate box from the Earl Grey bags but in the same shipment. I advised that I only received one box with the shipment. At first Starbucks emailed me that the  me that I would receive a subsequent shipment.<br /><br />"Thank you for contacting Starbucks Online Ordering.<br />We apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced with your order.<br />After further research, all of the items shipped out but separately.<br />Please allow 5 to 10 business days to receive the remaining part of your<br />order."<br /><br />When no new order ID generated after 10 days, I called Starbucks and was told that they would not send out a new shipment. Starbucks advised that they checked their inventory and because their "counts matched", a replacement would not be sent and they could determine that the passion iced tea had been mailed.<br /><br />I asked for the tracking number that was associated with the PITFB so I could investigate further. Starbucks stated that they sent two separate boxes but with one tracking number. Starbucks insisted that I file a claim with the carrier. I spoke with the carrier who stated that each box should have a tracking number. The one tracking number that was given with the order was delivered (the earl grey tea bags)so UPS could not honor a claim on the second box because there was no second tracking number on the missing merchandise. Starbucks response was that because UPS would not honor their claim (because Starbucks didn't only used one tracking # for 2 boxes) that I was out of luck and nothing further could be done.<br /><br />Starbucks, a company that I have traditionally enjoyed doing business with, has discouraged me from purchasing their products again...on Amazon or otherwise. The customer service agent and his supervisor's inability to address the shipping department's error and take no responsibility for seeing the transaction through is incredibly disappointing. I expected more from a company that is praised for its customer-centric attitude when in reality Starbucks neither offered to replace the unreceived merchandise nor refund the cost of the PITFB.<br /><br />I have attempted to obtain a refund through Amazon's A-to-Z Guarantee Program on June 16. As of 09-02-11 and several inquiries to Amazon, I still have not received a credit to my Amazon account nor a refund to my credit card.<br /><br />This has been my worst Amazon experience to date.
