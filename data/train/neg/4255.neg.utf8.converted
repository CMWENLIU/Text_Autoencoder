The actual product is fine.  It's recommended by my vet and I gobble it up daily.  I prefer my owner's food but she's stingy with it so I have no choice.  I even enjoy it at times.  My human was thrilled to order it in Feb 2009 and have it show up on our doorstep (no hauling of heavy bag in and out of car) and it was actually slightly cheaper than if she'd bought it from our local pet megalomart chain store.  I don't like the megalomart all that much.  The floors are slippery and they make my nervous.  But then again, I do like to watch the ferrets.  Oh, little ferret, squeeze your squirmy body of of that glass case. I want to play with you soooooo badly......<br />Anyway... my human went to re-order and the price has jumped by $3 and the shipping and handling went from $6.49 to $19.01.  Her yelp of horror scared me out of sound sleep.  I was dreaming of open fields and frisky ferrets.  "Seriously?" she screeched? "The total price jumped from $41.62 to $57.50 in two months time?"  She's on a rant.  She's going back to the pet megalomart because she can haul her own bag of food for that price.  Oh, all you fine wee ferrets, get ready, I'm coming to seeeeee yooooouuuuuuu!!
