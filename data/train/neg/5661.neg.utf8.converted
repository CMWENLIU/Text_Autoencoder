I looked closley to see what the stars meant with one meaning "I hate it." I. personally, do not eat it, but none of my 6 kitties,including 2 ferals (last time I wrote, I had only one feral, but now have two and neither feral will eat this. They may be wild and not let a human close to them, but they know their cat food tastes. Two stars means "I don't like it, and since I am the one doing the buying, I figure it is OK if I state that that "I don'tlike it" because I do not like buying something that the 6 cats that I feed will not eat it. I feed the ferals outside the back door and I can watch them "eat or not eat" by watching through the window. My kitties always announce the arrival of the ferals by jumping up and down at the window when my regular "orange and white kitty" and my "sometimes I deign to eat here 'black and white Kitty'" arrive for dinner! My, My, What an exciting life I have!!!...The high point of my evening being watching the ferals eat and then writing a review of their eating habits up on Amazon!<br />Anyway, I have made it clear as to how I keep tabs of the ferals and their eating habits. The inside kitties are pretty easy to manage. When trying a new variety of food (new to us) I just put that bowl in the kitchen where "the special eating" bowls go. Dry food and water are in the kitchen and whatever "speciality of the evening" is also located there. No, they do not get a new flavor every night! But one bowl goes there so they always go "aLookin" in the kitchen area for their night's extra bowl of wet food! Spoiled???  Yes!!!! Then I know if it is eaten or not. The specialty bowl gets 3 nights of trial...not in a row...to avoid "nose sticker uppers." But kitties know a wet bowl is always placed alongside the water and the dry in the kitchen. Water and dry are also located elsewhere, but the kitchen ONLY gets the wet nightly special got trial/accuracy purposes. Nothing is TOO much for the trial and accuracy information for Amazon!<br />It has been 3 weeks now with the Newman Chicken and Brown Rice. There is no question. None of my cats eat it. Not even the birds seem to care for it...or any other animal...as the birds generally eat the dried out left overs and if the bowl is chewed to death, it means a coyote has been by, but I haven't had any coyotes all winter.(Somebody is putting out vittles more to their liking somewhere else, or they have gone further south this winter.<br />So, there, my friends, is how I ended up at this choice of stars for Chicken and Brown Rice Rice Formula Newman's Own. Oddly enough, everyone likes the beef and brown rice:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BXT278">Newman's Own Organics Adult Variety Pack Canned Cat Food</a>, but that is a whole "nother" story for a different time.<br />Sorry that we have a disappointing story to tell: Gabby, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, Orange and White Kitty and Black and White Kitty...as told to and documented by "Cindy O". Bye for now on the cat food trail tale until we "come upon" something else good ole mom thinks should be tried.
