I have been using KAL stevia powder for some time now, but thought I would try a lesser expensive brand. I have used NOW products, and had good experiences with them, and due to the reviews, I decided to give this a try. What a disappointment.<br /><br />Serving sizes and # of servings is exactly the same, weight for weight. However, I have to use 2 to 4 times the amount of NOW in order to get anywhere near the sweetness of KAL. So, I didn't save any money, and it is evidently not the same grade as the KAL. It has a larger particle, which may be one of the factors in the amount needed. The KAL is a very fine powder. Back to the KAL as soon as I can afford to buy more. This is too much money to waste, and non-returnable, so compare before you buy.
