I love buying stuff online: food, clothes, books, whatever--anything I need, I'd rather get it online than deal with driving to a store, finding out they don't have what I want, driving elsewhere, carrying around a lot of heavy stuff, and so on and so forth.<br /><br />That's why it makes me angry beyond all measure when a company abuses the partial anonymity of the online marketplace to sell two different products under the same label.<br /><br />In this case, I can look back at my Amazon purchase records and find that I have ordered this exact item twice.  But when I look in my kitchen, I see two different products: one is a can with a pull-top, while the other requires a can opener and appears to contain meat of a different quality.<br /><br />Generally, I recommend the pull-top cans.  But you have no way of knowing what you are getting: beware!
