I saw this in the store and was excited. It's very hard to find locally. When I picked up the jar to see the ingredients, I saw they used Aspertame instead of sugar. I don't use anything that has that poison. So, I put it back on the shelf and learned how to make my own. It's so simple and cheaper too
