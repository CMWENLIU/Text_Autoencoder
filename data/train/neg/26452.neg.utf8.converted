This cereal tastes good, nice and fruity, but, it has way too much sugar in it.  I am diabetic and if I ate this cereal first thing in the morning, my blood sugar would skyrocket.  I bought it for my three year old niece who comes to visit.  I let her eat it but I don't like the amount of sugar I am giving her.
