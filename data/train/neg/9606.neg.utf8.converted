Nutritionally speaking, these snacks are pretty good. At 130 calories, 4g fat, 16g carbs, 3g fiber, and 8g of protein, they seem like they live up to the claims on the product package. They "control hunger," and help you "avoid blood sugar highs and lows." Unfortunately, to me, it was like eating cardboard. They texture is like packing peanuts, and the taste isn't much better. They are rather bland, and I couldn't taste even a hint of white cheddar. Now, I've eaten many products of this type before, and I don't expect them to be gourmet or taste like regular snacks, but I cannot eat these crisps. They might be better in another flavor, but the white cheddar crisps are not edible, in my opinion.
