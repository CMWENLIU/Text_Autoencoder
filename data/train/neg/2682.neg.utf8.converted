I was very disappointed, when sending this to my sister as a gift, that three of the four cheeses she received were NOT the ones advertised.  Yes, the product description includes a disclaimer about substitution, but the cheeses she received were not, in my opinion, as "exotic" as the ones advertised, and were not even the same types of cheeses.
