This product didn't do a darn thing.  I had 4 setup in my little 1300 sq. ft. home and it caught nothing.<br /><br />I found a wool sweater in the basement which was the culprit.  Removed the sweater and that ended it.<br /><br />Find the source.  Destroy it.  Don't bother buying this  anti-solution.  It doesn't work.<br /><br />And yes they were clothes moths and not pantry moths or Indian meal moths.
