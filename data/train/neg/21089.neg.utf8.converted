Looks very similar to the image provided, but I expected better tasting chocolate.  It tasted stale and definitely not high quality.  What was very disappointing was there was no labeling included, and no ingredient list provided. With increasing awareness of food allergies, I can't believe that any company can sell a product without one. When I tried calling the phone number of the company listed as the seller, it was just a voice mail that was full.
