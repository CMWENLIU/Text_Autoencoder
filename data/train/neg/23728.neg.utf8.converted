I tried taking for a few weeks, 3 caps 3 x's per day as recommended to aide in nursing. I saw absolutely no difference in the amount of milk i was pumping or producing.  The way it makes you smell is horrible, too!  I swear, the stuff just comes out of your pores and smells like maple syrup.  It also made me extremely gassy and made my baby gassy as well. I wouldn't purchase again.
