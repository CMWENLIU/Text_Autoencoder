I made this cupcakes after biting the bullet because they are way too expensive for a mix, but I hoped for the best. They were rather dry and donuty and the frosting had an off unpleasant taste. I'm not sure but the vanilla in the frosting tasted artificial. I would not reccommend this mix because of the high price and rather low quality.
