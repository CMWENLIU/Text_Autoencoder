Well, Seeing that I received the first box of Olives broken, Olive juice all over the place I wouldn't give it good packing ethics.  I stayed on the phone for an hour with Amazon trying to get the problem resolved.  In the end they sent me another box, this time nothing was broken, but I don't see how when the glass bottles are not wrapped in any protection and just thrown in a box.  Will not order from them again.
