I generally like Newman's Own products and I like licorice a lot.  I am also a fan of Pomegranate so I figured these would be a home run. Though they are made with organic sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup, they still tasted almost sickly sweet, cloying to me.  The texture was very nice and these certainly appear to be high quality, but I simply did not like the way they came together.
