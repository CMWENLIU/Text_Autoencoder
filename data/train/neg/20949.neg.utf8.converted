I bought these expecting to fall in love with them because I love malt vinegar and potato chips.  On the outside of the original box packaging there was grease all over the place and when I opened up a bag to try them, there was a very foul, rancid oil type smell and also the same taste when I took a nibble off of the chips.  I opened more bags and every single one smelled and tasted the same.  I think the ones I got must be a bad batch but they are awful!  I got a sick stomach just from taking tiny tastes off of a couple chips.  I hope everyone else has better luck.
