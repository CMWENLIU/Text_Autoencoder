My elderly mom loves peanut brittle, so this was a little gift/treat for her.<br />Sorry, but the packing of this product was so poor that the<br />white bag with the cellophane window that the candy was in<br />arrived in a box with no protective packing - no styrofoam, no<br />newspaper, nothing...so the box was punctured, the cellophane<br />was torn out of the white bag, and there were little tiny ants<br />everywhere...inside, all over the candy.  It was gross!!
