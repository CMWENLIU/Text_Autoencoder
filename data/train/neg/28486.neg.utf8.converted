Everything in this ad leads you to believe that you are ordering the entire box of bully sticks. It pictures the entire box in the ad and the "list" price as being $240.09, so you think you are ordering the entire box. (I doubt anyone would pay $240.09 for ONE bully stick) However, ONE bully stick is ALL you get. Also, it is the smelliest bully stick I ever come across. I will say my dogs love it but I will NEVER order from PetFoodDirect again!!
