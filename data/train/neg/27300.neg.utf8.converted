This is without a doubt the best formula on the market and I wanted to be able to use it so badly but it just didn't work for us. On JUST this formula, no solids, we ended up in the ER with our 5 month old daughter who had screamed trying to pass a bm for so long she passed out. We thought she would surely even out but even with prune juice, pear juice and even trying Miralax - she still never could get over the terrible constipation. We went to Good Start Gentle and she's completely regular. If your baby can handle it, it's by far the healthiest available - but beware that it can cause serious constipation.
