I ended up tossing my entire case of cookies in the trash.  I've low-carb dieted for many years so I'm well acquainted with the "effects" of sugar substitutes, but what these little cookies do to your intestinal track just aint right. Even 1 cookie sent me over the edge.<br /><br />I gave some to two co-workers and they had the same reaction.  Probably the best tasting sugar-free cookie I've ever samples, but be forewarned, you might pay for it in more ways than one.
