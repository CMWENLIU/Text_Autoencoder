Anyone who owns a Keurig Coffeemaker obviously enjoys good, rich coffee.  Why anyone would market and sell this stuff is beyond me.  The first thing I noticed upon receiving my order was that the k-cups were extremely light; and when you shake them, you can hear the granular substance inside.  This is clearly, without a doubt, INSTANT COFFEE.<br />The amount charged per box for these is ridiculous.  Two boxes down the drain, which in any case is still way better than in my cup.
