For some reason I thought these were white chocolate - you know, the kind with cocoa butter.  Silly me for assuming that Ghiradelli would sell chocolate (or at the very least products containing ingredients from the cacao plant).  The only thing these have in common with the cacao plant is that they are produced by a company with chocolate in their name.  Disappointing flavor and funny texture.  Not at all what I thought I was buying.
