Out of 2 boxes (160) candy sticks, 105 were broken on arrival.  After an email I was told new boxes would be shipped.  They never came so I emailed again.  This was a monday, my wedding was on saturday.  I was assured I would have new ones before the wedding for my candy buffet.  The new box (60) arrived the Monday AFTER my wedding. This box only had 25 broken.  Customer service was nice for trying to help, however for the price I paid I thought it could have been better~!!
