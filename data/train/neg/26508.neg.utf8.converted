I was so disappointed in these - they taste nothing like a chai tea latte one would get at a coffee shop or a mix from the grocery store.  It has a bitter chemical taste from the sucralose and is incredibly sweet besides.  I actually could not drink it. My husband and I love the Starbuck's latte primo though!
