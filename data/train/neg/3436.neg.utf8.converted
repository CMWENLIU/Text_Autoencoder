Be Careful of this company. They advertised a Six pack of 12 oz Walden Farms Alfredo sauce , but only send ONE ! When I called they said , " Oh sorry" . I have demanded the other FIVE or a Full refund including shipping, They said they would get back to me on that.  I am not even going to try it now. It is a lot less at the grocery store.
