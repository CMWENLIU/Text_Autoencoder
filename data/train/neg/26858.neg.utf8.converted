I was thrilled to find Kona coffee in pods for my Senseo machine.  However, these pods do not really fit right.  Consequently, sometimes you get a full cup that is mostly water -- then you might get half a cup.  There is NO consistency in how much coffee will actually come out -- or how strong/weak the coffee will be.  I can't tell if it's manufacturing irregularities or whether the pods are just poorly designed.  In any event, only about one in five pods actually produces a drinkable full cup of coffee.  I emailed Aloha Island Coffee Company with my concerns and asking for advice, but have not yet received an answer after two weeks.<br /><br />I'm going back the the Douwe Egberts pods -- at least they are consistent and A LOT less expensive.
