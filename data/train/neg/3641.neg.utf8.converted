I don't understand all these reviews. I have tried two different batches of these cookies and they have a horrible aftertaste.  My five year old son says he wants me to put in the review that these cookies make "super horrible cookies and dough". I bake all the time and have made many gluten free desserts.  I like the Bob's Red Mill brownies but these cookies have a horrible aftertaste that does not go away after they are cooked as one reviewer stated. In fact, after making the first batch and reading the glowing reviews here I bought another bag and made them again because I figured I must have had a bad bag but the second bag was just as bad.  We threw the cookies and the rest of the dough away after tasting them. I made some other chocolate chip cookies with the Gluten Free Pantry all purpose flour (using a regular recipe)and they tasted much better.
