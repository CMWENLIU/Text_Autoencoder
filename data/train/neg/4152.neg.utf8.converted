We bought two of these machines. The first one was put into action without running the flushing cycle, so understandably it gave off the plastic taste. But you would think that after a few months, the taste would go away.<br /><br />A few months later, the second unit was bought. This time we meticulously ran it through the flushing cycle. The plastic taste was minimized, but still there. Now after about one month of usage, the coffee it makes still tastes bad.<br /><br />We use the Green Mountain Keurig cups, so I doubt it's the coffee itself. For comparison, I went out and bought McDonald's black coffee (they use Newman's Own), and added sugar and creamer myself. The McDonald's coffee tasted much better, just pure and clean.<br /><br />For another reference point, we used to have a different model of Keurig, and that machine definitely made better coffee than this one. I wouldn't say it made great coffee, but it did not impart plastic taste.<br /><br />I have since resorted to buying my own coffee whenever possible, so it's difficult for me to give this more than one star.
