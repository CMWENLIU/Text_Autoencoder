I am ninety years old and have been cooking longer than many of you have been around.<br />I have tried every brand of chicken base, salty square ones, liquid ones and this is the only one that is CHICKEN not carrots, etc, just plain chicken.  Makes a wonderful addition to stew, soup, believe it or not to beans and ham hocks,  corned beef for corned beef and cabbage, (better flavor than adding beef)<br />Being alone now, no big family I use a lot of chicken breasts, and when they are pan fried, this makes a nice touch to my gravy, no chicken fat needed, just the Minors<br />thank you,  B.
