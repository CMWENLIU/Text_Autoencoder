Up until recently, I had been using his food exclusively, but after several disturbing incidents I have switched brands.  In the last few months have found cardboard, hair, and a bug in three separate varieties of Merrick dog and cat food. When I found the cardboard, I contacted the company with my findings and they apologized and mailed me a coupon. Since then, I have found hair in two varieties of dog food and the final straw last week was opening a can of cat food to find a dead fly right on the top of the food. There is no way that this food is being produced in a human facility. The quality is appalling -- especially at these prices. I have spent thousands on Merrick pet foods, but they have lost my business forever.
