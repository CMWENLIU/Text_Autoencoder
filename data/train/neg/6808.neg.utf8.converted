This bag of salt came in a box from amazon.  When it arrived I opened the box and it was full of salt.  The bag had a slit in the side.  I will never use a product like that.  I contacted the company and they were no help. They told me to contact amazon.  I had been on vacation and it was passed the time limit to return the product to amazon.  I think it was very poor customer service from the company not to replace the bag for me.  I am a brand new customer with this product and was excited to find celtic sea salt because i had read it was good for your health.  I am a  business owner and i know to keep a new customer I would have gone out of my way to make them happy so they would remain a customer.  I will not order from this company again.  Customer Service is very important to me and this company dropped the ball.
