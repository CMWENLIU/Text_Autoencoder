I really liked the original recipe and couldn't find this stuff in any local stores.  Original label (as pictured here) reads "Cajun seasoning, great for chicken" and ingredients are: "Salt, Spices (Including Red Pepper), Paprika, Garlic, Onion, and Silicon Dioxide (Added to Make Free Flowing)".  Since that is what was listed on the Amazon page I placed an order.<br /><br />Well the label and the ingredients have changed.  The label now reads "Perfect Pinch Cajun, natural, no MSG" and ingredients are now: "Salt, spices (including black pepper, thyme, and red pepper), paprika, garlic, onion, and celery seed."  While I'm happy the ingredients are still all natural, the celery seed and black pepper really throw both the taste and smell off.<br /><br />The Amazon listing does include a legal disclaimer stating: "Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website", but I really wish the description matched the product sold.<br /><br />So before anyone else buys six jars of this stuff, beware, you are not going to get the product as described.
