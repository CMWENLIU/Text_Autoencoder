I ate a Berry SoyJoy bar the other night, and it wasn't that good.  It had an odd taste.  I have had other SoyJoy bars before, so the dense and dry texture wasn't an issue.<br /><br />The berries used aren't your typical strawberries or blueberries, but rather hawthorn berries and wolfberries (goji).  I don't think they carried that much flavor into the bar, though, because it didn't taste that fruity.  And despite the high sugar content (12g in a 30g bar) it didn't taste that sweet to me.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy a whole box unless you've tried it before and liked it.  Get a single first because it really is an odd taste and I disliked it.<br /><br />I can say the ingredients are good as far as nothing artificial, so that's always a plus.
