I bought Saf-Yeast Instant Yeast to be pets because I wanted to replace my daughter's hamster that had unfortunately passed away last Christmas when it crawled into the nativity scene and got stuck between the folds of a wiseman's tunic. Yeah. Holy Night indeed. Try calming down a seven year-old when her older brother mistook the hamster for a camel and started a play-fight between the "camel" and one of the sheep. Anyways, I misread the brand as Safe when it's Saf-Yeast. I thought the yeast would live longer than those annoying Sea Monkeys. Not. As another reviewer noted, my batch, too, tested DEAD! My daughter went into another tailspin while her brother mocked the baker on the package by pretending he was the baker killing the yeast as he put them in the mixing bowl. It took promising my little girl a bearded dragon for her birthday and grounding my son for a week before she finally quit crying. If you want household chaos and bread that won't rise, you'll take your chances on this yeast.
