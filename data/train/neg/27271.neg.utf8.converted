We have two large dogs and are always looking for high quality treats.  The dogs really liked these chews, but there are only four in a pack when you purchase the large size.  The chews were not long lasting (about five minutes).  I have purchased other high quality chews for a lower price so I can't really justify the high price of these treats.  We spend a lot of money on our pets but this is the first treat/chew that I felt like they might as well have been chewing on my wallet! (I think my wallet would have lasted longer)
