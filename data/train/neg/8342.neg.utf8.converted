Sometimes, Amazon.com reviews lie, and they lie big time, but that's just me.<br /><br />During a recent trip to Whole Foods, a product in the freezer case piqued my interest: Artic Zero Chocolate Peanut Butter All Natural Frozen Dessert. At 32 calories for a half-cup, I was jazzed. After all, you can't even find sorbet that is that low calorie and is gluten-free and natural. I mean, 150 calories for the entire pint? I might as well eat the entire thing, and maybe that's what my plan was in purchasing it.<br /><br />So, over Shabbat last week, Tuvia and I cracked the pint open, and scooped out larger-than-1/2-cup portions and dug in ... to disappointment. Tuvia originally said that it was "bland" and mostly flavorless. I said it tasted like nothing but creamy peanut butter, straight out of the jar, which is my least favorite thing on the planet (I'm a crunchy kind of girl). And the chocolate? Non-existent.<br /><br />Eighty-five Amazon.com reviewers gave the product 4 out of 5 stars, which, let's be honest, shocks me. This stuff isn't worth it. A few bites in, we were both disappointed and uninterested. We chucked the rest of the pint and probably won't venture down the Arctic Zero road again -- even for a quick sweet-tooth craving.<br /><br />Bummer.
