NOW pumpkin seeds look like a product that had been culled by Bob's Mill. Up until this purchase I have been totally satisfied with the quality of NOW products.<br />I was originally buying Bob's Mill seeds which were great in quality and taste but change brands because Amazon's price of Bob's Mill seeds increased to more then the retail price buying direct from Bob's Mill not including ship. I cannot understand all these price increases when the Consumer index has change very little this year. (GREED?)  I purchased 8 pounds in order to get the free shipping. The Seeds are nothing but busted up bits and pieces and the seeds are not dark green like Bob's Mill seeds. They are lite in color meaning that they have dried up due to being broken and crushed like they are. This indicates the nutritional value of the seeds have been lost. The outer shell must stay intact in order for the nutrients to be preserved thus this product is a terrible value and I strongly recommend a do not purchase. Shame on you NOW FOODS for distributing such a low quality product. Why does Amazon continue to sell inferior quality products when they have been told that certain products are of low quality?
