I was expecting this product to be small diced tomato squares (like the kind that you put on tacos).  Instead it was more like randomly chopped chunks of tomato.  Its packed with lots of water, and has a slightly off taste.  If you google "how to dice tomatoes" you will probably see various videos on how to properly dice a tomato - do not expect this product to be anything close to that.  I feel misled.<br /><br />I can see this being used for making tomato sauce or soups - basically for cooking.
