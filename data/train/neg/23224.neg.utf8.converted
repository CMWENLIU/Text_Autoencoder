As I write this, I am doubled over with pain and so nauseated I can barely keep from throwing up.  I am on my third cup of tea.  Yesterday I had four, and before that I had two, then two again on the day before that.  So I can say with absolute assurance that it does not work for me.  Please don't waste your money on this product if you have debilitating cramps each month, because this tea will not so much as "take off the edge."  It seems only those women who are lucky enough to have "minor aches and pains" each month will find relief from their symptoms with this tea.
