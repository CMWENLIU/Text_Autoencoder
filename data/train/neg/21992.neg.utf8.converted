The old packaging contained cinnamon applesauce with only two ingredients: apples and cinnamon.  The new packages now contain apple concentrate and apple juice concentrate.  This means more sugar in your product.  The flavor is blander and sweeter.  I liked the old cinnamon apple sauce a lot better.  It had a nice appley flavor and was healthier.
