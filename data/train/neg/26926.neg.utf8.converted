If you are pondering whether or not to purchase this product - first mostly, do your research. The reviews on this state some insects were caught - however, some say they weren't effective. Just take a moment and realize that yes, they cost cheap - however, did you know that they use pheromone technology? Did you know that pheromone's only work on certain types of insects? For instance, sure you can get a pheromone to attract women but however, only a few women will respond to the pheromone product for women. This concludes that pheromones that this product contains is less effective with certain insects.
