I could not believe the first time I bit into the new recipe (and did not notice the "new recipe" on the packaging) - what a shock! Lindt, by far, had the best dark chocolate on the market in their 70% bar - I try all dark chocolate I can find and have been buying Lindt for several years now (Green and Black's 70% now is my preference). Someone in Marketing should be removed - they even lied when I asked about responses, the first person answering the phone said it had been overwhelmingly negative, Marketing was my next stop where they said it was positive. I only hope someone wakes up at Lindt....
