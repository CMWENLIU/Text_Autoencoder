Puffin cereals used to be one of my favorites.  Cinnamon was my favorites among Puffin cereals.<br /><br />The new Puffin Cinnamon is not an improvement.  The size of each individual cereal was reduced.  But it appears they reduced not only the size but the formula of the cereal itself. I don't like the flavor as much, it appears to be sweeter and has less cinnamon.  The box size was reduced from 12 oz to 10 oz, thus becoming more expensive per oz.<br /><br />I am attaching two photos: The first photo shows the new packaging highlighting the reduced size.  The second photo show the ingredients and nutritional fact from the side of the box.  Puffin calories are shown using a serving size of 2/3 of cup, which is a pretty small portion. The box has 9 of those servings.  What I use as a serving is larger. For me each box has 4 servings. I noticed that cinnamon moved down on the ingredient list (when I compared it to the old box), which confirms my taste difference observation.<br /><br />With the new packaging you get something less tasty for more money per oz.  Barbara's Bakery - please bring back the old cereal!
