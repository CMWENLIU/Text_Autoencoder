I bought this same coffee at walmart.  I saw nowhere on the box that it was instant, but it had to be.  The actual k cup wasn't packaged like a normal one, after it was done, there was nothing left in the k cup, no grounds or anything and it didn't have the built in filter like most k cups do.  Was not good coffee regardless.
