I am a sucker for mac & cheese. It's a guilty pleasure. I sneak a bite at every buffet and Thanksgiving dinner, even though I know it's for "the kids" and it's bad for my health.<br /><br />When I saw this, the marketing seemed to be aimed at grown-ups, and I thought, "maybe my wife will let me get away with this."<br /><br />It tasted like chicken covered in ballpark nacho cheese sauce.<br /><br />Orzo is a terrible choice for mac & cheese. If you follow the instructions, the Orzo becomes overcooked and its texture is so similar to the sauce itself it effectively dissolves. The cheese/starch ratio is too high. It should have been elbow or penne.<br /><br />Green dust came out of the broccoli packet. Once rehydrated, it looked more like broccoli, but there wasn't enough. I could not taste the broccoli at all.<br /><br />There are few things I won't eat, but I will never eat this again.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: I have a recipe that's nearly as quick and much healthier. I designed it for convenience and speed. For better flavor, saute the chicken separately and add it last.<br /><br />1. Boil 1 gallon of water.<br />2. Add 1 box of pasta, 2 chopped raw chicken breasts, some chopped broccoli.<br />3. Cook until pasta and chicken are done.<br />4. Drain water from pot.<br />5. Slowly add 1 package of finely shredded cheese while stirring to melt.<br />6. Serve immediately.
