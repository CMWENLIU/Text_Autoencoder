This is the third Ghee I have tried off of Amazon. I have to say that this is my least favorite. Two things make me give it that evaluation: This Ghee was coarse not smooth and it tastes too much like artificial butter, like what you get on your popcorn at the movies. It almost makes you wonder if they didn't add a little phony oil to the pot, but I digress. This Ghee cooks well, I make eggs over easy using this product and the eggs don't stick to the pan. It also is good for adding to recipes that call for butter, but I warn you that the butter flavor is, to me, very strong. There are other Ghee products out there that you need to try before you settle on this product. But the fun part is that you'll enjoy them all!
