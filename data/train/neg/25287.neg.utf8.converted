I was really excited to get this product, as an alternative to straight coffee, for my keurig. Sadly, not only am I disappointed that it is not frothy, as the picture on the box shows, but 1/4 of the box are defective k-cups. The edges of the foil on top are not sealed, so the cups contents have leaked and the machine does not function properly if you still try to use them. I feel that I definitely wasted my money.
