The new Catalina dressing is awful. The 1st time I bought it I thought it was bad & took it back to the store for a refund. I no longer buy Kraft dressings on a regular basis like I used to. Now I buy other brands as they go on sale. So much for Kraft caring what the public thinks. They might as well take this product off the shelves as it appears by these posts that they are not selling to many.
