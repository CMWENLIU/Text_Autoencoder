We were at California Tortilla, and I saw this stuff.  So I got some and put a few drops on a pretty big burrito, and started to eat it.  Before I ate any, I got something around my eye and pushed it off, and my skin literally started to BURN.  It took a good 20 minutes of dabbing for it to stop burning, but that was my fault.<br />Then I started to eat my burrito, and was fine for a few bits.  Then it suddenly hit me.  My throat was actually CONSTRICTED if I stopped drinking.  It took about 6 rootbeers, a bag of chips, some queso, and a granola bar to stop it from making me choking.  It was awful, and it ruined a $ 6 . 50 burrito.
