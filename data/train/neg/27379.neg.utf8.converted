I loved cotton candy gum as a kid, so when I saw this deal it was hard to pass up. I was certain that Bubble Yum was the same brand I chewed as a kid, but I guess I was wrong. This gum will last literally 10 minutes at the most before completely losing its flavor and you start feeling like you're chewing sugary rubber. On top of that, one piece will have your tongue and teeth blue for hours and brushing will not make it go away. I was really disappointed in this gum as I was hoping it would taste of my childhood.
