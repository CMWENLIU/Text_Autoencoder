I love Hersey's Bliss, however, I will not be ordering it thru the mail again.  The order arrived on time, but was slightly melted and the flavor seemed a little different.  I'm attributing that to the extreme heat.  If you haven't tried this yet, do pick some up.  If you like chocolate, you will love Hersey's Bliss, but buy it a local store.
