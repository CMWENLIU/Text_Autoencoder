As the previous reviewer notes this stuff is vile.  Amazon wouldn't post my prior attempt at a review since (I assume) it was too bad - it was all true, mind you, but apparently you can't describe something so revolting and nasty as revolting and nasty.  Unlike the previous reviewer I have 10 CASES of this stuff taking up room in my kitchen.  You'll coil back in disgust when you crack it open and then gag with every mouthful.  Though it turns out that after four cases you start to lose the nastiness tastebud and it's at least drinkable.  On the plus side, the plain black isn't bad.  Strong, but not bad.
