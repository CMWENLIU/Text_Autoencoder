Bad, Bad, Bad INSTANT coffee.<br />Why waste the plastic.<br />Just run water in straight through the system into your cup.<br />Then dip month old cigarette butts into the water.<br />Stir gently.<br />Throw away.<br />The page representing this coffee has now been changed to tell you it is INSTANT coffee.<br />When I bought it there was no such description.<br />IT IS A NON_RETURNABLE PRODUCT !!<br />Amazon would only give me half my money back for some reason.
