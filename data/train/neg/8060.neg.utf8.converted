This is a very over priced natural ineffective product. Maybe people give it good reviews because of the natural ingredients and the coffee smell. But for me, this eye cream never lightened my dark circles, never diminished my lines and never changed my puffy eyes. I used it at night only and would either waste or put it on heavy because the bottle dispenses too much product for both eyes. On more than one occasion my eye duct would get clogged and my eye would ache like someone punched me. It would go away if I didn't use any cream for a few days. This is the only eye cream that ever did that to me. I will never buy or recommend this product. A waste of $20.
