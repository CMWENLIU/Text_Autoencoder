We are sooo disappointed in this product...every can contains potatoes that vary in color from white to black.  It is very hard to enjoy a bowl of New England Clam Chowder when you have to sift through old and bad tasting potatoes.  We thought it would only occur in one or two cans...however, every can contains black potatoes! I will never trust this type of product again.
