Hate to give a bad review but hopefully people who are at least sensitive to this brand will find benefit and avoid this item:<br /><br />I was raised with Seafood and used to eating caviar/roes and was very happy with some of the Romanoff purchases but I got sick off of this brand.<br />Almost like a bacteria attack on my body and really bad feeling and I'm a very fit guy.  I tried the Capelin because it was from the same Icelandic environment like Romanoff and similar brands and couldn't beat the pricing with what looks like a great "fancy" packaging and opted out of my Salmon choice to try a new type of fish.  Ultimately a Very Bad Idea especially if someone would have been older with a weaker immune system. Stick with the familiar fish over this one.<br /><br />Caveat Emptor on this Caviar!!!
