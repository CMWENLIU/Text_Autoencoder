I promise that this oil smells like bacon. I just received my order today and opened it to use, I put a small drop in my palm and began to rub them together to apply it to my face and NO WAY....NO HOW....it smelled like bacon. I buy coconut oil all the time and it NEVER smells like this! I am soooo very disappointed in the quality of this product....I WANT A REFUND!!!!
