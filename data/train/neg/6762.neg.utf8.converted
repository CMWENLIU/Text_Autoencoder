How I was looking forward to good Starbucks Vanilla Coffee at home!  When I got the box with this coffee inside, the vanilla aroma was coming through the box!  Even the UPS man said "something smells good in there."  Opened the box and saw the bag and, it had that good coffee smell with vanilla added.  So good I had to read the directions and make some of this Vanilla starbucks!  The coffee came already ground, not full beans.<br /><br />Oh, I was counting on this being so tasty!  Making it, the aroma it gave off was good.  Drinking it, YUCK, yuck, yuck!  It had one of the worse tastes I've ever tasted.  Like a rubbery, strong, sour vanilla taste. Yes, I know Starbucks coffee is strong, but this is a nasty strong vanilla taste.  Well I dumped it all out, washed everything and the next morning made it again.  Also I had to get rid of that taste in my mouth through a regular cup of coffee!<br /><br />So the next morning I made another batch of this Starbucks Vanilla.  Took extra close attention to the directions to make sure I was doing everything right (which I was).  Tried one cup black, another with cream and sugar.  The same all times!  A terrible taste!  I don't know it's a bad batch of beans, or too much Vanilla was added or bad vanilla was added or what, but it's bad.  Even other family members agree on the taste.<br /><br />A note here.  I went to a Starbucks coffee house and asked the girl at the counter working.  Before I got far she said "that has to be from a grocery store, Starbucks took it off the menu a while ago."  I looked and sure enough it's not on the menu!  I asked why and she shrugged her shoulders.<br /><br />Well I was disappointed on this. Actually I'm surprised as I do not think this Vanilla Coffee represents the Starbucks name well.  I've had many different types of their coffee before and never have I tasted something this bad.
