This tea is ok, but nothing special.  It's drinkable (I certainly won't throw it out) but I won't buy it again.  The flavor is a little bit harsh for white tea.  There is definitely better stuff out there.<br /><br />Bottom line: it's not worth the price (I paid $28.64 for 3 tins).  Overall, the packaging is nice, but the product is so-so.  I wish they spent more money on getting good-quality tea and less money on the fancy tins.  On the other hand, the tins are a convenient size, an have a good airtight seal, so if I buy some good tea in bulk packaging, I can store it in these tins.
