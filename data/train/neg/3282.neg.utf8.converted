$12.99 for ONE 10oz bag of peanut butter chips? That price is insane. There is absolutely no way I would pay that. ROBBERY. You can get it for around $2.50 in any grocery store. A similar incident happened with the Hershey's Cinnamon chips. They were hiked up in price the last few weeks from $15.43 for 6 10oz bags to $27.95. I called Amazon out on this in a review and then the price suddenly dropped back to where it was. Well now I'm calling them out on this. Price gouging isn't cool Amazon. Not at all. Once again, the 1 star is not a reflection of the product, but because of the terrible business practice going on here.
