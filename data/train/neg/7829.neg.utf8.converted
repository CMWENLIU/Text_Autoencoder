I've been trying to lose weight and eat a healthy diet, so I bought this along with some other products a couple of weeks ago because I was going to add this to things like popcorn and vegetables since the description said this had a cheesy flavor; plus I could use the extra fiber.  The day after I received this, I put some on my air popped popcorn and took it to work with me.  I ate a couple of pieces and ended up throwing the bag out.  I'm not really sure how to describe the taste, but it's definitely not a cheese like flavor.  I didn't like it at all.
