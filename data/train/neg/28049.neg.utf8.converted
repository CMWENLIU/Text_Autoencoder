I hope there are plenty of vitamins in this drink, because I found little else to like here. The seal under the spout is one of those adhesive twist seals. It doesn't work at all well for a large-mouth bottle.  As a matter of fact, when trying to open mine, it splattered out. And this product does stain, too! Sadly, the taste is nothing special. It tastes like Kool-aid. I cannot recommend this product.
