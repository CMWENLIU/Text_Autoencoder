I'm really disappointed in the decline in quality of this coffee. Camerons coffee remains inexpensive, but the flavor has continued to go downhill.  It's no longer mild and tasty.  They got the bitterness down (for those who missed it) and that is all.  It is bitter and weak. I add more and more coffee, but it has no nice flavor.  In addition, before I wrote that it didn't make me sick the way some non-organic French Roast coffee does. But I had horrible indigestion after one cup.  I buy Melita at the supermarket sometimes (non-organic) and this does not happen when I drink one cup.  The flavor of whatever this now is - is terrible unless you make it VERY strong PLUS add another kind of coffee to cut it. The package I just received is not very drinkable when brewed without another type of coffee added to it.  To illustrate this point - I once added Green Mountain (supermarket brand) Decaf to it and it tasted BETTER with decaf added to it. I have canceled my order. This was a bait and switch, I fear.<br /><br />Here is my previous review from when I first ordered this coffee a year ago:<br /><br />Great coffee for a very decent price!  I agree with several other reviewers that it is much milder than most French roast.  But I think it tastes better than almost all the coffee I've tried.  It's on a par with some $25 stuff my father bought in Italy! I have problems with digesting coffee sometimes, and haven't had any problems with this brand so far.  I recommend it.  However, I just got a new bag so I'm going to check out allegations that the quality is going downhill.
