When I bought my popcorn popper I figured I'd try this popcorn just to see how it was.  Please dont waste your money on this stuff.  The colonels were very very small and tough.  I thought maybe since it was my first time using it  wud try it again in case it was me with a new popper....and again it was awful.  Threw the popped popcorn out and even the birds wudnt eat it....
