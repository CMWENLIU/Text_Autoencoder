With the new scare on arsenic levels in rice, I did several hours of research and found that different parts of the US that grow rice had different levels of arsenic in the soil which the rice then soaked up. I am feeding my 6 month old son brown rice cereal and am very concerned about the arsenic levels I read about. I bought this brand and after learning the rice they use is grown in Texas, and that Texas is listed as one of the higher arsenic levels, I am returning this product and purchasing Bobs Red Mill organic Brown rice farina. This rice is grown in California which is listed as the least arsenic levels (almost undetectible). I tried Quinoa and my son didn't like it. He's a little too young for oatmeal but that will be our next adventure. Just thought you would all like to know this information. Good health to everyone
