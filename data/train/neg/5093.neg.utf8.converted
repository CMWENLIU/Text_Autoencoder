I ordered Philippine Brand dried mangoes from Eauction and they sent Royal brand dried mangoes instead. The photo and the brand and manufacturer list Philippine Brand. Only way down the page in the description does it actually mention "Royal Brand" mangoes from the Philippines. If I'd known these weren't the product being advertised, I'd never have paid $18 for the bag. The Philippine Brand dried mangoes are worth it. The Royal Brand mangoes are not.<br /><br />Buyer beware!!! This is a bait and switch.<br /><br />I can't speak to any dried mango products purchased through other sellers, only Eauction.
