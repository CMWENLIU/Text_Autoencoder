The amazon description read "coconut oil" but when I received the package it lists that "popcorn may contain one of the following oils: coconut, canola, vegetable (lightly hydrogenated)."  Also, I chose this popcorn over others who listed food dye on their descriptions, but again, when package was received it reads "FD&C Yellow #5 & 6."  If the amazon description would have disclosed either of these things, I would not have purchased.
