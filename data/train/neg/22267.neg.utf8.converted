I purchased this product from my local health food store.  It was still well within its sell-by date.  I tasted it both plain and in a raw food recipe (with dates and nuts), and in both cases it had a terrible taste.  It was very dry and tasted overwhelmingly of soap.  I will not purchase this product again.
