Talk about overpriced !True, these bones are liked by bow-wows far and wide. However, dogs like serloin steaks much better. Point being, would you feed your beloved doggy a serloin steak every day as a treat ?  If you're not feeling the effects of this recession, go ahead, indulge your dog. Otherwise, Red Barn is way too expensive..You can get away feeding yourself cheaper !..Simply not worth the price ...
