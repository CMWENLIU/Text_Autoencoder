In an ideal world, the samples you dispense for your business are the freshest and best version of your product.  After all, people get samples to see if they want to continue buying from you.  In the real world, often sample products are overlooked in favor of high-dollar purchases from repeat customers.<br /><br />Whether this is the case here I couldn't say, but I know for sure the sample pack was full of stale, dusty spices I would never use for cooking.  They were dry, lacking in smell and color, and due to the small sample size were often crushed up leftover bits no self-respecting cook would consider. (Who would use a quarter of a bay leaf?)<br /><br />After further shopping around I ended up finding 'Spices Inc.' and the difference was amazing.  The dill was a dark green instead of a putrid, dusty yellow-green color.  The scent from any one package of spice from there overpowered my entire sampler pack of 12 spices.  I am now pawning off my Spicely sampler pack on someone who just moved and doesn't have any spices.
