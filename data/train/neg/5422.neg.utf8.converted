The noodles came out gummy, and they stick together and clump.  I thought I just overcooked them at first, but the second time I cooked them, they still came out in clumps, but were too toothy.  You'll notice that the cooking water becomes very murky while cooking it too, and so maybe the noodles are just too starchy.<br /><br />I will never buy these noodles again, but they get 2 stars just because I love this company and their approach to food.
