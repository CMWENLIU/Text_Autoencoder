They sent me a smaller amount with an invoice for another person and have not even answered 1 of my 3 emails.<br />I ordered and paid for 1.8 lbs and received 14 ozs.<br />This is the first time I have had a problem with Amazon after many orders but amazon has not answered my email to them as well.<br /><br />I found I could buy this brand of cheese for less money in a local supermarket as well and have enjoyed it.<br />Great cheese but a poor company to do business with.
