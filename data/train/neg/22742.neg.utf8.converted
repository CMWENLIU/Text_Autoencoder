I ordered the vanilla and the capuccino.  The vanilla has a strong Stevia aftertaste, but is not horrible.  I will eventually finish the box... maybe.  The capuccino is heavy on the stevia and is so horribly sweet, my mouth sticks together.  My 4 year old, who will steal any protein shake, tea or iced coffee I leave unattended for 2 minutes, got a hold of the one I was attempting to drink.  He took one sip, then went and got a paper towel and wiped his tongue.  Then, he grabbed a glass of water and chugged it to get the taste out of his mouth. I have to say, I feel the same way about it.  I am going back to my Orgain protein shakes.  I am pre-diabetic, so I am no stranger to non-sugar sweeteners.  But holy cow, lay off on the sweetness.  No one needs their mouth glued shut while attempting to drink this.  It is vile.  Luckily, Amazon refunded me the cost.  I gave away the rest of the case on Freecycle.  Hopefully, the person who got it knew what they were doing.
