I received my order in a timely manner but when I tasted the lemon packets they didn't taste right.  Couldn't find a expiration date so I didn't feel comfortable using them.  I threw them away. Didn't mind wasting the cost of the lemon packets but the shipping had doubled the price. Lesson learned.
