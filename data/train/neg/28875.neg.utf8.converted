Had purchased this years ago and didn't care for it, but thought now w/Splenda and the good reviews, it had to be good.  Wrong.  They get you to bite  w/the Kahlua on the label, but there is no comparison to Kahlua, doesn't taste at all like Kahlua.  Actually it doesn't really even taste like coffee.  It has just a sweet artificial flavor, but not a coffee flavor.  Very disappointing.
