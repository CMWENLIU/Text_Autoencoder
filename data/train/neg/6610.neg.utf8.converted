My daughter LOVES these grammy sammys, so I thought I would take advantage of the awesome Prime shipping and avoid the zoo at the store to pick some more up.  Perhaps it is my fault for not reading correctly, but the title said a pack of 5 which I assumed meant five boxes.  At that price, this would have been a great deal.  But it means five measly sandwiches for almost $19 dollars.  Seriously?!  That is almost $4 bucks a pop.  The product itself is great, but save the money and find them at the store (Babies R Us is the only one that carries them down here in New Orleans).
