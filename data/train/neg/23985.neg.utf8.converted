This is pretty bland olive oil, I think that it is comparable to the common brands that you can buy in the regular grocery store.  I'm not an olive oil connoisseur and am surprised that this is as blah as it is.  It's not fruity or nutty or anything that I associate with extra virgin olive oil.  I wish that I didn't have two full tins of it.  It's fine to saute with, but I wouldn't recommend it for salad dressings and such.
