I bought this steak for my father in law for Christmas because he had always wanted to try Omaha Steaks, and I heard good things about it. I purchased the private reserve because it is a higher quality of meat than the regular cuts and wanted to get him something extra special, but was I in for a surprise. I should have stuck with the cheaper meat.<br /><br />The meat came with extremely large amounts of fat all around. We had cut off a significant amount of fat prior to cooking,and the steak was still fatty once it was cooked. I was very dissapointed and so was he. We were going to call Omaha Steaks to complain, will never buy this brand again. Very unhappy with it. The taste wasn't even something that was worth raving about either. I could have went to the supermarket and bought a prime rib on sale that tasted better than this was, which i have in the past, and didn't spend nearly as much as they charged.
