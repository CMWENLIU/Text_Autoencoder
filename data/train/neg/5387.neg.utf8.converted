After reading the fake 5 star review, I decided just to reiterate on what everyone else has said.  This is the worst coffee I have ever tasted in my life, I would give 0 stars if I could, unfortunately I was stuck with a 48 count package.  Considering I wouldn't wish this coffee on my worst enemy, I promptly threw the dehydrogenated s**t water away in the trash.  Can I have my money back amazon?
