To me, Mexican Coca-Cola with cane sugar tastes so much better than Coca-Cola made with high fructose corn syrup.  5 stars for the product.  You can purchase singles at your local Publix for $1.39.  I purchased a 24-pack today at Costco for $17.99 + $0.54 tax.  Almost $56 for a 24-pack from Amazon.com/TheLatinProducts is almost criminal.
