I just ordered this for my mother as one of her birthday's gift.  She has just informed me that the almonds on this group are not fresh, and she eats nuts every day.  While some of the stuffs here are probably edible, I expect the package to be fresh.  I am disappointed as this is a gift and I can't fix this myself.  The prices of these gifts are not the cheapest so I expect better.  Unless the company sends my mother another one, I will not order from this company again.
