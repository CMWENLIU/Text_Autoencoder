I have used the Cutter spay for several years and have been very pleased with the result. This year, I purchased two bottles and neither sprayer worked, water came out but the insect repellant stayed in the bottle. Next time at Menards, I purchased two more bottles, same result, even tried mixing different heads on the bottles, wasted an hour, the bugs win this time. I tried moving the lever into different positions and nothing worked, bottle still full.
