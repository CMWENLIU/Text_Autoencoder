I had ordered this tea and received one box of 16 teabags for $32.00.  Amazon issued a refund when I inquired as to when the rest of the order was going to be shipped.  The product is shipped from Tea Forte and they are shorting customers on their orders.  I am grateful Amazon refunded my money but Tea Forte needs to look at the agreement they have with Amazon and honor the terms.
