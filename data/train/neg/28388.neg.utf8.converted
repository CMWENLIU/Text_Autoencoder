I question whether this item was truly produced by the makers of Frosty...pkg. arrived with one bottle half frozen and only half full.  Although the bottles said Frosty, they all had generic gold caps and the 'root beer' was VERY light in color.  When opened the beverages were flat and had no carbonation.  I only purchased from Amazon because the local Rural King only sold individual bottles and they were to be a gift.  Will have to go back to Rural King and buy 12 to put in the shipping box these came in, as they are a 'non returnable' item.  Do not recommend and will not buy again.
