I received this as a Christmas gift. Initially, it was fun going through the box and reliving the childhood memories the candy evoked. Then I hit a stale candy. Then another. There is nothing worse than biting into stale candy, unless it is the knowledge that someone paid a premium for it. (There's less than $10 worth of candy in a $40+ box, very little of it "retro", most of it hard candy.) I wrote to the company, and their response was essentially, "gee, that's too bad." They advised me to put the candy in the microwave to freshen it up. No other solution, as it's "not their fault." To sum up, some of the candy is good, some is really bad, and you'll never know which is which until it's in your mouth. I wouldn't buy from this company because they don't stand behind their product.
