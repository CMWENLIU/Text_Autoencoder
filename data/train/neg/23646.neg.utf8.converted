Considering the extra that one pays for organic products, this product did not deliver.  For one thing it did not pass my smell or taste tests.  Thyme is a fantastic herb, and I expected the organic to be even more robust than non-organic.  I understand that it is dried for packaging, but even so, I did not expect to have to "struggle" so much to extract it's aroma or develop its flavor profile in my dishes.  Non-chef that I am , I have been around the kitchen long enough to know what I am working with when it comes to my favorite herbs and spices.  This brand does not measure up.
