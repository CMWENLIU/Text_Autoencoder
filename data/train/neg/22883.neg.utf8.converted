I must say I was excited to find sugarfree gummy bears, but these offer nothing less than a gastric frenzie and hangover to boot.  My head pounded for hours after eating these, not to mention the gas.  I did read the other reviews, but thought perhaps they consumed too much, or were just sensitive to the sugar substitute.  I must say there is no exageration in their claims.  The taste is ok (not great - there is an aftertaste), but having one handfull can make the rest of your day miserable.  I threw mine out and wished I had bought a smaller bag to try first.
