I just want to warn the buyers that the title "Utz Cheese Balls Barrels - 2 / 35 oz." does not mean that you will get 2 packs.  It's only one pack and -2 is misleading.  I would recommend seller to change the title of this product as "Utz Cheese Balls Barrels - 35 oz.".  You can get the single container for $11 as well.  I really thought I was getting 2 containers.<br /><br />Though we love cheeseballs.
