The spray does at least partially freeze the poop all canine owners need to responsibly pickup, but it falls well short of the product claims. My family has used it under varying weather conditions and had uneven results, though we have precisely followed the directions. It is most effective (provided the directions are followed exactly) on very solid stool and least effective on soft/running stool. The obvious problem is the latter is exactly why one would purchase the product. We bought it to do a more thorough job picking up after our dogs on a multi-use trail. We bike with our dogs (using Walky Dog) and like to leave the trail as clean as possible for others and to ensure dogs continue to be permitted to use the trail. The product did not help as much as we had hoped. When our multi-can supply runs out, I don't think we will purchase more.
