Sooo dissappointed!  We have used this cheesoning for years and absolutely love it.  However, the cheesoning pack we just recieved is very much a golden color as apposed to an orange color that picture shows and that we have always received.  Unfortunately it does not have the cheese taste and is nothing like what we have used for years.
