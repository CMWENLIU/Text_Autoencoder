I bought this product for my Yorkie and was so disappointed.  First of all, they completely stink.  Second, the sticks are so hard that you have to cut them for a smaller breed with a good quality steak knife (I used my high end stainless Henkles knives and it took some effort).  My puppy (7 1/2 months) has torn through extra durable Nyla bones and is a VERY TOUGH chewer, so I was looking for something he can "play with" and eat which wasn't synthetic.  He didn't know what to do with it even though he seemed to like it as a toy for a minute or two.  But, the smell was overwhelming to me.  I will donate them to a local rescue.  Interestingly enough, I also bought him other Get Naked treats and he didn't care for them either.  Perhaps he just doesn't like this brand.  He does love Blue Buffalo treats, Welness Puppy treats (they also stink, but in a bearable/pate kind of way!) and SoJo's too!
