I was very dissappointed in this product. First, it was solidified like a rock in the jar. I suspect it had been<br /><br />sitting on a shelf for a very long time.<br /><br />I was expecting white cheddar. What I got was mostly salt & the flavor not so pleasing. Barely cheeselike.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Just buy the white cheddar popcorn premade in a bag at the store.<br /><br />It's a hundred times better. I bought a box of six jars. Even the box looked ancient.<br /><br />I threw it all in the trash.<br /><br />If 0 stars was available, I would have picked that instead of 1.
