I just returned from Germany and bought a package of Knorr dressing with 5 packets and a bonus packet for a total of 6 packets for less than 50 cents!  I think it is absolutely outrageous that this is posted with a list price of $20.  The salad dressing 5-pack is worth no more than $2 max, and I think the mark-up on this item borders on criminal.  Shame on you, Amazon, for allowing this.
