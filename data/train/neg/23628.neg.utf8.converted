I hope you guys are joking with these 5 star reviews.  I bought this based on the reviews and it was the stalest, most bitter whole bean coffee I've ever used.  One of the canisters was open on arrival but there was literally no difference between the aromas of the sealed cans and the open can.  What does that say about the freshness of the sealed cans?  You can seal it tight as a drum but if the coffee sat around and got stale before it was canned then all the vacuum in the world won't help it.  Then I couldn't get that stale aroma/flavor out of my grinder without thoroughly cleaning it.  I don't know what you guys are used to drinking but this isn't worth 1/4 of the price regardless of how much it costs.  If you think this is 5 stars then check out RONA, which Amazon carries.  Their Jamaican Blue Mountain Peaberry is without peer.  Compare their Kenya AA Superior Peaberry to this swill and you will know what premium coffee is supposed to taste like.  This is a perfect example of gettting what you pay for.
