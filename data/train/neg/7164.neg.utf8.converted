I was excited to try a new brand of granola, but was not impressed with this product. Similar to a previous review, I found virtually no chocolate in the entire box. I also found very few almonds, and the product itself was too sugary. I would not buy this granola again, and would not recommend it to others if you are expecting "dark chocolate almond" granola.
