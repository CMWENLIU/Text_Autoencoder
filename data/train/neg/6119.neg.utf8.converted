I am continually amazed at how much pet stores and retailers selling pet supplies charge for basic stuff.  Feline Pine is no exception.  I switched my multiple cat household to pine pellets, and for the first time EVER, I don't smell cat urine.  However, I don't buy Feline Pine.  Go to your local feed store and buy the 44 pound equine bedding pellets for about $6-7 per bag.  HUGE savings and the same stuff!
