Our 6-year old Vizsla has been eating Canidae for 3 years. A month ago we switched flavors from Bison to Sea Salmon.  We gradually transitioned the change even though it was the same company.  Within four weeks on the new flavor he developed a set of distressing systems including soft, mucus covered stools, horrible gas,low energy, staggering walk, excessive drooling, licking and constant neck extending (difficulty swallowing).  A vet visit confirmed these as diet related.  We put him on a chicken/rice diet and his symptoms stopped after just two days.  Doing research to decide whether to switch back to bison or go with another company, I found a great deal of  information about other pet owners having issues with all flavors of food from Canidae. Consumer Affairs reports a pending class action suit.  We have decided to switch to another company.
