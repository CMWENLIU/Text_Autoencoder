I bought this for my mom as a gift.  It looked ok...at first just a little "over watered".  Instead of blooming it developed yellow spots and all of the leaves are dropping off.  It has a bacteria.  I would never buy this again.  Before I learned what the problem was she gave it back to me to try and fix.  I put it with my other gardenias and now I realize I may have contaminated my own plants.
