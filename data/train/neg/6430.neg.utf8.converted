I used to eat way too many of these things, but their new recipe has made it easy to kick the habit.  Kind of waxy and tasteless.  Maybe this is more to the liking of the average palate and they're going after the Snickers crowd.  Can't blame 'em but, as of now, I'm on the long, sad search for a replacement...
