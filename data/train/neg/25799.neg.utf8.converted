I received these thinking they would be delicious. I was disappointed. They are average. In my opinion, they are too sweet. And however they are processed, they do not resemble the actual mango. Once you've tried 7D Mangoes, everything else pails in comparison. 7D Mangoes are awesomely delicious!! These ones are just very so/so! and actually not very good when compared to 7D.
