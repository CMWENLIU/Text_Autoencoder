The tea's good, but there's no way there are 25 servings per tin. The tins are little. If you're brewing a tiny cup then maybe you could squeeze out 25 servings as advertised. I think 15 servings or so would be more accurate. The tea is good but due to the misleading number of servings it becomes a very expensive purchase.
