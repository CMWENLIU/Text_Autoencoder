I previously bought the 10 piece packs, and the packaging indicated "Spry is a product of XLEAR INC., Orem, UT, USA".  On the 600 count package it also says this but also says "Packaged in the USA/Raw materials from China & USA".  China is mentioned in much smaller print than "Packaged in USA".  It seems they are trying to hide the fact they use ingredients from China.
