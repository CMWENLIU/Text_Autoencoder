My husband is an energy drink addict on the weekends in his attempts to stay up all night. I thought maybe if these worked for him, he could cut down on his energy drink intake and therefore cut down on all the calories and sugar that comes with it. Unfortunately, these did absolutely nothing for him.<br /><br />I tried them as well, thinking that it might just be him. I don't really drink anything with caffeine besides a coffee every few days sometimes and do not ever drink energy drinks or anything of the sort. I tried drinking one of these an hour before I would normally start getting tired at night for four nights in a row. And all four nights, I was asleep before my usual bedtime. These might work great for some people (as shown by how many good reviews these have) but they didn't have any effect on either me or my husband. Looks like my husband will be making due with his energy drinks for a while longer.
