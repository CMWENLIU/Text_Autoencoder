We bought this assortment from Costco for $5.99 (they were clearing it out).  We were excited to try it, but quickly disappointed.  It is hard to describe the flavor, but it doesn't taste like the rich flavor I was expecting.  The toasted marshmallow was the biggest fail.  It just has dehydrated marshmallows added to the mix...nothing really special or "toasted" about it.  It seems like a lot of people like it with coffee, but if you just want delicious hot cocoa this would not be my choice.  My husband's comment was that even Carnation Brand tastes better than this hot cocoa!
