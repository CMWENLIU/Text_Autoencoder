I'm all for health food and low-calorie alternatives, but these were disgusting!  They smelled gross when the package was first opened, but that wasn't such a big deal.  I follwed the directions exactly: wash noodles, blanch in boiling water, and then cook (I sauteed with soy sauce and olive oil).  The flavor was ok (there really wasn't much flavor, but it soaked up the soy sauce nicely).  The texture, however, was along the lines of poorly cooked calamari.  It was rubbery and almost a little slimy - EW!<br /><br />Also - I didn't know that you can't return grocery items on Amazon, so you're pretty much stuck with what you buy here...
