I have loved Habitant Pea soup my whole life. When I moved to Philadelphia from Michigan in May I couldn't find it anywhere in the city--thereby increasing my desire for my "former" favorite.  Was delighted to find a way to order it through Amazon.When the box arrived I was struck by how light it was.  When I opened the first can I realized that there were no longer peas in this soup.  It used to be at least half liquid and half the most delectable peas.  You'll laugh at this, but I really feel betrayed.  Surely peas can't be that expensive that you have to eliminate them from your formerly fabulous product.  I would have given this a zero star rating, but I thought you'd think I might have forgotten to rate.Feel a little guilty donating this to the food drive at church.<br />Sincerely,<br />Pat Daniels
