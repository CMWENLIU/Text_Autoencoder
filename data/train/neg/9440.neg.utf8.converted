Not happy that I decided to try this formula because it did not contain added sugar (per ingredient listing on the company's website).  When I received it, the ingredient list listed "corn syrup" (i.e., SUGAR).  I wrote to the company and asked about it and their response was "the amount of carbohydrates is the same" and that it was an "improved formula".  Its unfortunate that you can't even trust a seemingly small, organic company to be forthcoming about ingredients that are unhealthy for infants!
