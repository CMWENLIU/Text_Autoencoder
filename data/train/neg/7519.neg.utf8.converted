I received this broken as well. The steam function worked well, but the blades would not spin. After reading another review i decided to try fixing it myself before contacting customer service. I took the 5-6 screws out of the bottom and simply slipped the belt back on its gears. It works great now! I love it and it makes making baby food so simple. I would give it 5 stars if i didn't get in broken. Don't they have QC?
