Another example of Amazon not providing Amazon Prime for products you might actually buy.  Every blueberry-choco-nutalicious flavored creamer can be purchased using Prime but not just normal creamer.  Nope they want to slam you for extra shipping on that.  I probably wont be renewing Prime for this reason.
