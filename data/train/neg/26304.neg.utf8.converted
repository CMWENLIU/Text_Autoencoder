I first had B&M beans in the 1960s. They were pretty decent for a canned bean. The current version tastes nothing like the 1960s version.<br /><br />I doubt they were using high fructose corn syrup when they began making beans in the 1920s either. I also suspect that the ingredients they are hiding by using the words "spice" and "natural flavor", were not used in the 1920s. And if "spice" and "natural flavor" are healthy ingredients, they should be proud to tell us what they are.
