I was a big fan of Natural Balance because of the grain free formula, small kibble pieces, and competetive price.  That was until my cat became sick for a week and a $350 vet bill to determine the problem was this bag of kibble.  It was easy for the vet to diagnose: I changed my cat's food out on Monday.  By Tuesday, she was showing signs of nausea (non-social, lethargy, eating sparingly, licking her lips a lot).  On Thursday, I took her to the vet.  The vet said she had a fever and was nauseated.  She recommended I swap out the food which I did that day.  By Friday, she was showing signs of improvement, and by Saturday, she was back to her energetic self.  If you are like me and are willing to buy quality food because you love your cat, please avoid this formula.
