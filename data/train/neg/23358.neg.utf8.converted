Followed instructions and gave it daily care, but the most I got was a few lost strands of grass.<br /><br />The small space makes the "soil" clump together really easy, so when you poor some drops on it, it just rolls off, making a mess and often taking seeds with it. You can't keep airating the soil because that would kill any grass growing.<br /><br />Feel ripped off.
