I was very excited to find this product after experiencing the common problem of the olive juice running out long before the olives. The many positive reviews made buying this a no-brainer. However, once I mixed my first drink it became very apparent  this was not the same brine you will get out of a jar of olives. This olive juice has a very odd taste and has almost a sweet twinge to it. I saw some similar reviews to mine and I wonder if we've all received bad batches. I may contact Dirty Sue directly and see if they'd be willing to send me a replacement. I've made a few drinks hoping I would get used to it but I haven't. I now have 3-1/2 bottle of this stuff that I'll never use.<br /><br />If anyone else is as disappointed as I am, I tried a couple of homemade brine recipes that are FAR superior to this product. Mix 4 cups water, 1/2 cup kosher salt, 1 tbs white vinegar and just refill the jar with this mixture.
