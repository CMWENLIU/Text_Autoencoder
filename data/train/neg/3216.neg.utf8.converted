I like Kashi products overalls and loved this cereal at first. However, the consistensy is too hard. It caused, not one, but TWO major dental problems for me (a young woman in her thirties). One morning, I broke a filling eating my morning breakfast. Dismissing the problem, I then later broke a cap snacking on the cereal. Overall, my dental bill amounted to almost $2,000.<br /><br />My advice is that if you have any dental work at all, like most of us in the world, avoid this particular Kashi product unless you want a very large dental bill.
