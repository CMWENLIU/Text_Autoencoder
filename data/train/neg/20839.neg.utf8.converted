These are not really tortillas, they are very flat circular pieces of bread. Which is fine if thats what you want, but I wanted tortillas.  I loved the Tumaro's tortillas when Amazon carried those, they were healthy, tasty and were tortillas.  These do not bend very well around burritos or "wraps" either as they are so dry.  Also, although these are whole grain, they aren't low calorie or anything.  One tortilla, and mind you these are the small size, has 110 calories and 2.5 grams fat and 330 mg of sodium. And yet, they taste dry and stale.<br /><br />Since the description leaves out the last of the ingredients, I will finish it for them.<br /><br />"Contains less than 2% of the following: Calcium Propionate, Fumaric acid, Aluminum free baking powder, refined odorless and tasteless fish oil, gelatin, tocopherols, natural flavor, citric acid, sodium ascorbate and potassium sorbate. Allergens: Contains wheat, gluten, soy, odorless and tasteless fish oil."<br /><br />I do not recommend these unless you are looking for dry, flat circular pieces of bread with plenty of calories and sodium.
