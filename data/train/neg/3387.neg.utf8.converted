I got these treats the other day hoping that it would help ease the teeth cleaning process for my dogs. My Husky and Yorkie both seemed to like the treats because they devoured them in less than 5min. However, later that night my Husky threw up 3 times with chunks of the treat in her vomit. It is now 2 days later and they are still very gassy and it smells really bad. My Husky seems to be the only one really reacting to the treat. She is having diarrhea now, which is rare for her.<br /><br />I only gave them one of these treats and unfortunately I regret it. There goes $15! :(
