Seriously????<br />I ordered the Oceanspay 10 count White Cran peach.... I was sent 6 boxes of the 10 count powdered drink tubes.  The advertisement featured larger product one could use to make a 2 gallon batch. I can buy boxes of powdered tubes at Kroger for 2.50... essentially, I paid $26 for what I would have paid either $21(not on sale) or $15(on sale).....NEITHER Of which is what I actually believed I was purchasing because I wanted the 2 gallon container mix.... not the product use for bottled water tubes.
