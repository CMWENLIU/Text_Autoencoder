Received the package and tried one out immediately. I don't know what the expected shelf life is on a coffe kcup but I think this one expired a long time ago. The coffee had a harsh smell, like when you left the can open and the coffee went stale. The taste was bitter and did not meet my expectations. Cross it off my list!!!!
