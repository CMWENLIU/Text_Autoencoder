My cats do not like pate style cat food.  Thus, they enjoy Fancy Feast in all varieties except "Classic".  They really enjoy little pieces, be they grilled or shredded, in gravy.<br /><br />This was promoted as:<br />Delicious melding of filet mignon and seafood flavors<br />Delicious and enchanting shapes made with real seafood<br />Enchanting shapes made with the delicious taste of real chicken and turkey<br /><br />However, there were no enchanting shapes, just the Classic can shaped pate. So it was disappointing.  No where does it say this is Classic.<br /><br />Also, it comes in three seafood varieties. I don't see where the filet mignon, chicken and turkey flavors come in.
