My cat has gone into RENAL FAILURE, possibly from this food, and Hill's company has hired people to REFUTE CLAIMS.  They won't even consider it after MY VETERINARIAN HAS CALLED them.  These people hired by the company will RUN YOU IN CIRCLES "standing by their food" yet REFUSES TO ANSWER a single question posed to them.  They have the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE to date.  They even LISTEN IN ON CONVERSATIONS while on hold.<br />I dare you to call them to get a list of TOXINS they test for in the food!<br />They will say they do not have access to the list in their department.<br />Good luck with this brand, I am up to $2500.00 in vet bills.  How much do you want to pay?  See here for more info from others
