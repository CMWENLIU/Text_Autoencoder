We found live black small insects crawling inside several of the unopened McCanns packs that I purchased from Amazon. I reported this to both Amazon and to McCanns customer service dept. Some called me from McCanns, apologized and sent an empty pre-paid carton to ship the item back to them for further analysis. She said that they would replace the item but never did. However, Amazon refunded my purchase amount. I threw away the packs that had live black insects in them. A total of four boxes. So, beware of live insects and look carefully before opening the packets if you buy these.
