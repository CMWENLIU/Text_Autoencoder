First to let you know where I am coming from:<br /> I am not a big drinker and currently not drinking at all as I am trying to get pregnant. It's not unusual for me to make nonalcoholic drinks just to be "festive" (i.e. mix soda water, OJ with lime) when my husband drinks. However, thought it may be nice to have a glass of nonalcoholic wine once in awhile. So coming from this point of view - my expectations aren't too high for a decent nonalcoholic drink.<br /><br />After reviewing Ariel's website - there was a pretty big sell on their Award winning wines, how they have actually beat alcoholic wines, how it is not grape juice but made for those who like fermented taste of grapes...with that information, I figured I may as well try it.<br /><br />What a mistake. While the Cabernet has a deep purple color, the taste is significantly watered down grape juice that leaves a bad taste in your mouth (in more ways then one). I tried to like it & even tried to chill the bottle. Whether you drink warm or chilled, this bottle is just not pleasant. You could create the same taste with 1/4 grape juice and 3/4 water. I wish there was a satisfaction guarantee do I could get my $7+ back!
