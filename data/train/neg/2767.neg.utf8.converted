Salmon isn't very good quality compared to fresh smoked salmon I have had in Alaska and Maine. And why is it necessary to have the box made in China?  I would much rather pay a few cents more for an American made product.  Reminds me of how Walmart closed down a rolling pin manufacturing facility near my town in Maine and moved production to china to save 4 cents per rolling pin.  Unbelievable.  Disgusting.
