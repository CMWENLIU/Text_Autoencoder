These candies had no cherries in them only the white cordials.  What a disappointment! Not what you would expect in a high end candy.  In fact the $3 christmass candies have a cherry in each.  I tried to contact the company through amazon  but  they don't have the correct email address registered.  Then I went to their website to complain they ignored me.  I have never given no stars but between the product and the customer service they deserve it. Amazon only let's you go down to one.
