I like kashi products but this was just plain terrible to me. The texture was like ground up and processed cardboard...i really feel bad giving this such a bad rating because i like this company but i have to be honest...this is the kind of product that turns people away from trying to eat healthier. I do think they could have done a better job with this ..mainly the texture ..its not the least bit crunchy dry and if you add milk it just turns to mush instantly. Having said that i'm glad some people like it ..i just dont happen to be one of them.
