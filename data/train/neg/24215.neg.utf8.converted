With all the recent news regarding harmful chemicals leaching from plastic containers into food, I was shocked to see the recycle number 7 on the bottom of these plastic containers.  Number 7 labeled plastic is the worst plastic you can possibly use.  It is being recommended by health officials to avoid products packaged with these containers.  This story was aired on Good Morning America.  I had just purchased about 20 packages of this baby food for my daughter and immediately threw every one away.  This makes me very concerned that Gerber is not fixing this problem.
