I avoid sugar like it's the plague. At first, I used Splenda, and it was to me the best tasting sugar substitude in the market. Then I read a couple of articles about it's side effects, then I switched to Equal... again I read about it's side effects, that are as scary as killing braincells and might be linked to cause alzheimer's. I already have a bad enough memory, which has gotten worse (and I'm only 36!!) so I obviously got spooked. Then I read that Stevis is the best 'natural' no calorie sweetner out there (I wonder how long it will take for some article to come out and tell you how bad it is for you?) Anyhow, I bought PureVia, and it had an awful after taste, it was truly as if this was some chemicaly fabricated substitute rather than 'natural' I though: " OK, maybe is the brand."<br /> Then I bought, Truvia, same thing, that after taste again. Finally I bought Sun Cryslals -- which is not quite sugar free, each packet has 2g of sugar-- I figure, "they know how bad this thing tastes that is why they are mixing it with actual sugar." It's just as bad.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say, but I rather have the Splenda and Equal anyday rather than this product. I tried to be positive about it and give it a little while to get used to, but I just can't, and I can't help but to think that somewhere along the line some study is going to claim that it will make you bald, so I rather not sacrifice. I'm still looking for an alternative to the 'big 3' sweetners, but for now, I'm having my coffee black.
