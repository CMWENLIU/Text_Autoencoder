I purchased the 54 oz jar and it was leaking when I received it.  It took about 2 weeks to receive with the free shipping. I just kept it and used it.  Then I ordered the 2-29oz jars and they were leaking and seal broke.  I called costumer service and they told me to discard and they would send me a new order.  Then I got an e-mail saying I needed to return the item.  So I called costumer service and they cleared up the issue.  When I received the new product, it was also leaking.  I just kept it and used it.  I have never received this product without it leaking.
