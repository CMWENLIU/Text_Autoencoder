Love the Riedel glasses and had ordered them in the past from Amazon. Unfortunately, the Amazon shipping department seems to have difficulty packing delicate items: The first shipment included a couple of heavy books which shifted during mailing and broke the glasses. The replacement box had the glasses jammed against one corner with air packing around three sides. Those arrived broken, also. Guess we'll purchase the glasses at a wine shop! Love Amazon and this is the first time we've had a shipping problem with you!
