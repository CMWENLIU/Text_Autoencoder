Ordered flowers to be delivered on the 11th arrived on the 8th in below 0 temperatures. Called and got a replacement delivered on the 11th and were in the house within 3 minutes. These replacement flowers look worse than the ones destroyed by the cold. Brown out of the box. Looked like grocery store trash. Very upset. My wife and daughter got brown flowers for Valentines day.
