Compared to other brands of instant soup cups, Annie Chun's Hot and Sour Soup Bowl is pretty darn good.  Compared to the other flavors of Annie Chun's Soup Bowls, this one is a major disappointment.<br /><br />The noodles are fabulous, and the veggies reconstitute very well, as with all Annie Chun's Soup Bowls, but unfortunately the flavor is really lacking.  I can't quite put my finger on what exactly is missing, but it basically tastes like extremely watered-down hot and sour soup.  I'm Annie Chun's biggest fan, so it pains me to leave a negative review, but the Hot and Sour is definitely out of my order rotation.
