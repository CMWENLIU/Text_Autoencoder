New edit:  This is really annoying.  I posted this review for the "Natural Light" variety, and it was originally on that page.  Now that the "Natural Light" was discontinued, they moved my review to this version where it doesn't apply.  However it is still true that the company which purchased Orville Redenbacher, ConAgra, no longer is making a less salty, 3.5oz/bag popcorn with unrefined palm oil.  This is a shame as no one else is either.  Despite what amazon.com has been doing, this is not an acceptable substitute for the other product and shouldn't be sent without permission to people who had the "Natural Light" on subscription delivery.  And after over a year of complaints, the bag size in the description should have been corrected.  Amazon.com, this is really shoddy behavior, and leads me to think it is a matter of mega-companies sticking together to scam customers out of our hard-earned cash.<br /><br />This review has been edited to reflect the mfr.'s change of the product.<br /><br />When I first reviewed this popcorn, I was describing the popcorn as it was in 2006.  It was made w/ very healthy unrefined palm oil containing nutritious beta-carotene and no trans fats.  It was also 3.5oz per bag.<br /><br />The mfr. has degraded the product.  It's now made w/ partially hydrogenated soy oil that has trans fat, and they've shrunk the bag to 2.9oz..  It's not any healthier or tastier than econo-brands now, but it is still much more expensive.  You also have to cook it for less time than is printed on the bag b/c of the smaller amount or it will burn.<br /><br />Whenever a good product is cheapened like this I always do an online search to see if the company was acquired, and sure enough, ConAgra bought Orville Redenbacher.  If you scan the reviews you'll see that almost all the 5-star reviews were written before 2007.  So don't bother complaining to the company about the decline in quality, b/c they don't care.
