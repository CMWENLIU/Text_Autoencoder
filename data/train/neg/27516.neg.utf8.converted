I've always loved Chick O Stick. It is not the product that rates low. It is the price. Don't buy this product from this vendor, unless you like paying twice the price for the product. At .25 per piece (price is on each piece) at box of 24 should have only cost $6. This product was twice that amount. There are others that sell it for the correct unit price. Fool me, you just got an additional 6 bucks. I'll pay better attention next time. Thanks for the education.
