I have a 6 1/2 month old, 47lb, pit bull mix. He has absolutely no allergies, and no sensitivities. He basically eats everything without an issue, however, we found the one thing that does not agree with him, "CHECKUPS." I just bought the product from Costco last night, and gave him one bone while I was home so that I could see how he reacted to it and how long it lasted. At first I was happy to see that he spent some time chewing on it. We all went to bed, and all was fine, until 4:00 am, when we were awoken by Rocco throwing up his dinner. An hour later, he proceeded to throw up blood, a large amount of blood. Soon after, he threw up blood again. We rushed him to the vet, and the vet said that this product was way too hard for a puppy that young. We were surprised to hear this because the package stated that the product was designed for puppies 6 months or older, and Rocco was double the suggested weight limit. He said this product should not be given to dogs until they are more than a year old. The product, when chewed, became sharp shards, that tore up his digestive tract. I feel terrible for putting Rocco through this. It is not worth the risk.
