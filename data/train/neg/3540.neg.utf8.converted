I love chocolate and I love sweets. My favorite of all donuts is the Chocolate Glazed donuts. When I seen this product I had to try it. I love coffee, how bad can it be? Answer: Gross! Don't waste your money. This doesn't taste like Chocolate or Glazed donut. This tastes like a really old burnt cup of stale coffee. It's so bad I may have to toss the unused portion, as it's really hard to drink.
