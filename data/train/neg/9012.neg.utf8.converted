I believe they wanted this cookie to taste like a brownie. I am so used to Chips Ahoy having that subtle choco flavor with a crisp bite that this cookie surprised me. It is gooey as stated on the package but the texture is awful. Enough for me and my daughter not to finish our cookies. We love cookies so you know that this was not a good one if we did not finish it! The taste is not a brownie taste. Can't even explain it. I am sure they are trying to branch out with more choices but how did this one pass their focus groups??
