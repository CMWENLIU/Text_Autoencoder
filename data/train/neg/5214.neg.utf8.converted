Like other customers, I was sorely disappointed to find out that there is indeed BPA-containing plastic in the lid of Earth's Best food products.  I feel that this company is taking advantage of customers and deceiving mothers & fathers who are trying to do the best by buying organic food for their babies.  The company will not answer questions directly online or on their FaceBook accounts.  They give you the runaround to call their customer service number.  However, when they do finally admit to BPA being in the lid of the products, they try to pass it off as being an "industry standard" and that the food is "Safe."  Well, for those of us who are concerned enough to purchase organic foods--I think we want to see NO BPA in the packaging or product.  I am not content to be told what is safe or acceptable for my baby by a company's marketing department.  So, I have decided that, even though my baby has enjoyed Earth's Best products, I will find other products that do not have BPA in their packaging or food items.  I am truly disappointed that this huge manufacturer of "organic" products is allowing a product that has been banned in baby bottles in Europe to be in the lids of food jars in the United States. Shame on them.  I hope this helps other moms & dads out there to be aware of what is in this "organic" food product.
