NASTY NASTY stuff taste like TIN there is woody chunks mixed in when heated it looks like strained baby food. will NEVER NEVER buy ASPARAGUS in a can again. shipping was fast and will buy libbys products again but not this nasty stuff. if I could I would have gave it -5 STARS sorry LIBBYS your products are always good but not this. that was a waste of $11.09 only problem is you can't return it. this stuff should be called (ASPARAGROSS)
