These are extremely thin, delicate cookies. They are delicious, but I will not order them from Amazon again. I sent them as a gift and my friend reported that only half the cookies weren't broken. Almost half of them were reduced to crumbs, and a few were broken into pieces large enough to handle. They were sent in a box with no padding, just a couple of air-filled bags, one of which was completely deflated. Such a disappointment!
