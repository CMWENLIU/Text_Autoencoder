Nature's One, the company that makes Baby's Only, has done nothing but lied, deceived, evaded and deflected blame since the arsenic finding was publicized. They're not even regulated by the FDA, though their reps will tell you they are if you call them! I wish I'd never heard of this company. Roll the dice with another brand. This one can't even be considered the best of the worst.
