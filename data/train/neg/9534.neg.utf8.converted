What a cute bottle! What a bad absinthe!<br /><br />Absinthette? Absinthe light? What ever it is, it tastes like the animal's eyes who are on the front of the bottle played an integral part in the manufacturing of such a drink. I like to imagine it involved the re-appropriation of it's bath water. But this is just conjecture.<br /><br />I used to have an ex who would joke about how all of his blackest nights could be found at the bottom of a bottle of Lucid, and after finally tasting the stuff I have to agree. Please save your pennies people and do not buy this. Who would want to taste misery in a bottle?
