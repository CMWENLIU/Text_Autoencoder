Needing an energy boost while we were shopping, my boyfriend and I gave these a try.  Neither of us felt the least bit energized, even after a few hours. The only thing we felt was rather worn out and sick later on in the day.  For the money we paid, we could have had Starbucks for a real burst of energy.
