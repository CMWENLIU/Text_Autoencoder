I have been on Autoship for the 5 Hour Energy drinks for a while here at Amazon, but this time they emailed me, on my TWO subscriptions that they couldn't fill them...and they suggested I try the Red Rain that customers buy this many times instead.  So I did.  I read some of the reviews...tastes better, lasts longer, etc.  So thought I'll give it a shot.<br /><br />I don't want to totally shoot them down ~ they're not awful, and they are cheaper than the 5 Hour Energy Drink...but you know they saying you get what you pay for?  Yup, in this case it holds true.  I didn't find them to taste any better, in fact I really liked the berry taste less, but regardless it's not a great tastes no matter how you look at it.  But what I really found lacking was the boost.  While it does give you that initial energy boost, it's not as fast or as great as that you get from the 5 Hour drink, and it does NOT last anywhere near 5 hours!  I have to drink 2 in the time I'd drink 1 5 Hour, and still find myself dragging.  I work the graveyard shift, so alertness is sometimes something I have to trick my body into...it really aint gonna happen w/ this<br />Red Rain Energy Shot.  In my opinion, it was a waste of my money.
