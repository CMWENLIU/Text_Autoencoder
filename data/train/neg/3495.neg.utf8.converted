So I have been on HCG and wanted something to eat as a filler to replace pasta. And while I knew these noodles weren't going to be exactly like pasta, I found out they don't even come close!  So to begin, they smell really nasty when you first open the bag but once you clean and blanch them they don't really have a smell or taste.  My problem was the texture.  Absolutely nasty and gross!  I wouldn't recommend these for the faint of heart!
