This tea has a lovely flavor--just what I'd like for an English breakfast tea--but to describe it as "leaf" tea is a complete misnomer. The tea "leaves" are crushed fragments, very nearly as small and dusty as the tea in many grocery-store bagged varieties. I purchased this loose leaf tea to use with standard tea strainers, and unless I use my finest kitchen strainer (that I normally use for powdered sugar dustings on baked goods), I have a cup full of leaf fragments. I don't mind a healthy smattering of tea leaves in the bottom of my cup, but my results with this particular tea were rather more like a stew of leaves. I have no interest in using disposable steeping bags, and I'd rather not have to purchase more apparatus simply to enjoy my tea. Some indication in the product description that this is not full leaf tea would be nice, particularly at its price.
