Go to [...].  Search for the video entitled:  WHOLE FOODS MARKET "ORGANIC" FOOD MADE IN CHINA!!!!<br /><br />According to my research, China is the major supplier of Goji berries.  There's been an unresolved growing concern about food, any food produced in China, even though it is labeled "organic" with the USDA and AIC labels.<br /><br />If you want to know about specific products, you can go to the WJLA website for a "do not purchase" list.<br /><br />Because I learned that China produces the vast majority of the world's supply of goji berries, I sent an inquiry to a US distributor-retailer of "certified organic" goji berries to ask them how they knew for sure that their "certified organic" goji berries were truly organic.  I never got a response.<br /><br />I have learned that the Chinese government does not allow non-Chinese, independent individuals or agencies to inspect the organic farms in China.  I do not know whether the Chinese government has changed that policy or if any progress is being made as of this writing.<br /><br />Until I can be sure the higher prices for "organic" labeled foods are justified, I am going to avoid any food products that are "Made In China" from Whole Foods Market or from any other distributor.<br /><br />If you don't see the country of origin on the label, my feeling is....why?  And I don't buy it.<br /><br />Of course, even if the label says "Made In USA", that is no guarantee that some ingredients in the product do not originate in China.  E.G., Trader Joe's does not sell products "Made In China" but that does not mean that products put together and "Made In USA" do not use ingredients imported from China.  Which is worrisome.<br /><br />The consumer is king.  If you weigh in with your buying habits (your almighty wallet), the producers will listen.  Your health is the most important asset you own. Become a fierce creature and protect your health.
