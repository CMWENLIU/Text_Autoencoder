when i read the description of this product it said "no added sugar"<br />so i purchased it thinking it had NO ADDED SUGAR. but the ingredients<br />list 'high fructose corn syrup'. this is just down right devious to describe the product as having no sugar added but have hfcs in it. they didn't let you see the ingredient label online and then it's not returnable to boot. it's an out right royal rip-off and i am very HIGHLY dissatisfied with the whole transaction!!!!!
