When I got my basket I couldn't believe it was so old and beyond staleness that they actually sent it that way.  Everything in the basket was a WASTE OF MONEY.  Nothing I've got was no good, not good at all, you couldn't eat any of it. But prepared by a national known chocolate company Ghirardelli that supposed to be great chocolate, it doesn't surprise me they don't even check to see if it's any good to eat anyway.just to save money.  It only reenforces one thing for me when it comes to chocolate: stick to Hershey's, at least they give a damn.
