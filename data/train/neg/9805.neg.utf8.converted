You get what you pay for with this product.  I drink Matcha Tea daily and absolutely love it.  When I saw the price and reviews I thought I had found the perfect product at a great price.<br /><br />It has a dirty/muddy flavor that is disappointing to say the least. Try DoMatcha 2nd Harvest, good price and much better flavor at a good price.
