My husband has used Head & Shoulders anti-dandruff shampoo for a good 15 years, so I thought it would be interesting to have him try this product. After a week, I asked him what he thought and, in his typically manly-man fashion, he shrugged. "It's OK, but I don't use it anymore," he said. After a bit of prodding and asking specific questions, I found out that he noticed a significant increase in the amount of hair in the shower drain after he washed his hair with this product. For this reason alone after three days he stopped using the product completely. He also commented that his hair didn't have that "clean hair smell" after shampooing.<br /><br />I will add that I purchased another CLEAR SCALP THERAPY product for my own use, and had absolutely the same problem -- a noticeable (seriously noticeable) amount of hair in the shower drain after shampooing. I don't know if this is a problem with all CLEAR products, but it has been with the two that we've tried.<br /><br />This will not be a product we will buy in the future, as we both found it causes serious loss of hair. I now have two full bottles of this product (one for men, one for women) and neither will be used again.
