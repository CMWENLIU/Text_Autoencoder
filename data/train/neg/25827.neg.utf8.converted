These are excellent graham crackers. We love 'em, and the kids do too, and it's not often that we agree. But you'll be sorry if you order graham crackers -- or any other food that can be damaged in shipping -- from Amazon.<br /><br />Our recent order arrived in the original box from the factory, containing 12 boxes of New Morning Honey Grahams. That was it. No packing material. Nothing to shield the crackers from the drops and shocks of being shipped to us.<br /><br />So we didn't get graham crackers. We got graham crumbs, and a few graham cracker fragments.<br /><br />By all means, order these crackers. Just don't order them from Amazon. Instead, find a retailer that knows how to do it right, or buy them from your local grocery. Unless you really want graham cracker crumbs...
