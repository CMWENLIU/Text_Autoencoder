I used two varieties of this kitty litter because I liked the idea of being able to go two months between total litter changes.  I cleaned out the litter box daily, but by the end of the first four weeks, the litter was urine-saturated and I could not stand it any more.  The whole area reeked.  I went back out and bought the cheap clay litter.  Now I really don't know what to try.  I was extremely disappointed.
