Carrageenan is an additive used to thicken foods. In Feb. 2000 issue of Cancer Letters, a cancer research journal; Carrageenan was injected into the vicinity of a growing tumor.  The carrageenan caused the tumor to grow faster.  I do not want to give my dog a cancer accelerator.  I also check food labels as well.  Some of the other flavors do not have carrageenan listed in the ingredients.
