sorry...i must say this was really bad.  it tastes like uncooked tomato paste!  I've been making my own baby food and i've cooked lentils for my son, which he loves.  these he did not like at all.  i like how its packaged...doesn't weigh much or take up a lot of space.  need it for a trip we're taking overseas. oh well.  we are going to try other flavors and see.
