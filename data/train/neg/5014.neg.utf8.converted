Mediocre "health" drink as it is...but at this price?????  This is mental when the same thing in Japan is about $0.50-0.80 per can.  The most expensive available was of course on Amazon Japan at about $150 per can.  Save your money and buy something local. Basically you are drinking curry powder, so yeah...if people are insane enough to believe this has serious health or energy benefits, then I'm sure the price also seems reasonable to those people.
