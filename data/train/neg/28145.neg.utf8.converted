If you are thinking about buying these, you could probably just get away with going to your local grocery store and picking up a bag of Chips! Ahoy cookies instead. Yes, these are a bit more substantial, but the taste is almost exactly the same. There is definitely nothing "luxury" about these cookies. I bought these because I loved the Cadbury Oatmeal and Chocolate Chip cookies. Sadly, these did nothing but disappoint.
