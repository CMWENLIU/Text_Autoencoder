*The coffee: Nothing special. Personally, I really don't care much for it. But taste is a personally subjective judgement.<br /><br />*The packaging: I do not see how 25 fairly large and thick foil packets and a rather thick, heavy and large round box (they are much larger than they look in the pics) can be ecologically preferable to 25 K-cups from that standpoint. Kind of a close tie imho.<br /><br />*No more convenient than scooping loose ground coffee into a Solofill which I use.
