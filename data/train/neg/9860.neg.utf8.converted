The Sweet n Sour sauce pictured is bright red and VERY similar in looks to the Sweet n Sour sauce you get from Chinese food restaurants.  I ordered a case of this stuff for $ 19 and was very disappointed in it.  The sauce I received is a brownish color with bits of red and green pepper in it.  It's not very sweet like you would expect (and hope) it to be.  The label on the sauce I rec'd was totally different also.  The one online is the 'New and Improved' label and the one I rec'd was not.<br /><br />My opinion is that if you're looking for the traditional restaurant style sweet n sour sauce then this is definitely not it.  Now I have to figure out what to do with an entire case of this cruddy stuff.  It would be one thing if the sauce was just different but I actually don't like the flavor at all.  Oh well, I'll just keep looking.  :)
