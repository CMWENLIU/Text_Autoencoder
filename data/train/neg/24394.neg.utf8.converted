Thanks for the reviews......I almost bought this product thinking it was k-cups.<br /><br />You can actually buy the Ghiradelli hot chocolate in a can from most grocery stores AND it is much cheaper.<br /><br />Wonder how many people got scammed??<br /><br />Thanks to those who took the time to review the product.  Saved me some $$$$
