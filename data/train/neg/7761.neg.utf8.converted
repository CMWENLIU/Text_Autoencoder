IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY USING "TASTE OF THE WILD" CAT FOOD, IT MAY BE PART OF THE CURRENT RECALL BY DIAMOND PET FOOD FOR SALMONELLA POISONING IN PETS AND PEOPLE HANDLING THE FOOD.<br /><br />"Taste of the Wild" cat food is made by Diamond Pet Food, a manufacturer who is associated with previous recalls. Their current pet food recall now also includes "Taste of the Wild" CAT FOOD with production numbers in addition than those currently shown on their website. I called them today after reading the news stories about the large dog food recall and learning that "Taste of the Wild" is one of their brands. I was horrified when the customer service rep told me my cat food bag was indeed part of the recall. This is the link to their recall website (although the recall information currently on there today is incomplete): [...] Also, the Diamond Pet Food recall telephone number is (866)918-8756.<br /><br />FYI, my cat has had bloody diarrhea/stools for a couple of weeks now and is currently taking a 2nd round of medicine prescribed by my vet because the 1st round was ineffective. A couple of nights ago, the sound of my cat vomiting woke me up. He threw up approximately 8-10 times over approximately 2 hours - very unusual for him. I now suspect that both of these issues may have been caused by the "Taste of the Wild" cat food. Thank goodness the recall occurred before he got any worse as pet deaths are being reported.<br /><br />If I had only realized "Taste of the Wild" was made by Diamond Pet Food, I would have never bought the stuff. Ironically, I switched to this food two months ago because I wanted a healthier food for my cats. My cats like it, but it is not worth the risk.
