Altoids - Spearmint. It was a great product. Alas - it is gone - probably for good.<br /><br />For several years I've been seeking out this wonderful item - and no other mint (I'm loyal - for good reason). It had a delightful flavor - not as strong or overpowering as some of the other Altoids flavors. No - it was just right. Sweet, minty, but not too strong. Something I would always offer to visitors just because I knew they'd like it. (An analogy would be the flavor of Scope compared to regular Listerine. Scope has a much more pleasant flavor than the hit-you-over-the-head taste of Listerine, if you know what I'm talking about.)<br /><br />Over the past couple of years, the number of retail outlets that carried this flavor had diminishted down to only one in my area - CVS (after Walgreens stopped carrying it). They still carry it. But, just last week, I went to the store and picked up my monthly stash. I noticed that there is a new banner printed on the top of the tin, "NEW GREAT TASTE! SAME PUNCH!"<br /><br />Well, today I finally used up the last of my old, trusty batch and popped into my mouth the first of the new tin, and I found out - to my horror - that they have totally changed the product in a manner that is most unpleasant. I'm so disappointed.<br /><br />The new Altoids Spearmint flavor is completely altered. I really hate the new flavor. It is very strong (not unlike the peppermint), and has lost much of the delightful sweet/mild flavor the old spearmints had. Needless to say, I will be returning my unopened tins as soon as I can get over to the store.<br /><br />I sent a letter to the US distributor (Wrigley's) complaining of this awful change. Not that it will do any good.
