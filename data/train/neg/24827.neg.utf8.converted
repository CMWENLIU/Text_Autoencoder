Ok, I had my daughter pick me up some Truvia at the grocery store. I was pretty excited about it, after all the hype, because the grocery store that carried my Sweetleaf  Stevia all of a sudden decided not to carry it any more. Go figure*sarcasm*<br /><br />Anyway, I was pleased until my daughter brought it home, and then I got a look at the ingredients. Have you ever seen the ingredients listed anywhere online, the way they are on the package? I looked around online (this was right before it hit the store shelves) and I even wrote the company an email. I went to the Truvia web site to check it out the same day it was announced. I got an email back saying that the ingredients were Stevia and "natural flavorings'.<br /><br />That didn't answer my question, because I asked them in the email what the "natural flavors" were exactly. I believe I've still got the email saved somewhere on my hard drive.<br /><br />Well, I don't have much of a problem with erythritol, except this product is mostly erythritol and very little stevia. It doesn't taste like stevia or pour like stevia. If I wanted erythritol I can order 100% erythritol. I like the health benefits of stevia. I don't mind a touch of erythritol but this product has too much of it.<br /><br />I'm sorry but as far as I'm concerned this product being marketed as stevia is deceptive marketing at its' best.<br /><br />However it does taste sweet, and if my only choices were table sugar and Truvia, I'd take the Truvia. So it gets two stars for the taste without the health benefits.<br /><br />I was very unhappy with Truvia and the people who make it for not telling me the whole truth when I emailed and asked them directly for a clarification of the ingredients.<br /><br />I will not be buying Truvia again, from any source, online or not.
