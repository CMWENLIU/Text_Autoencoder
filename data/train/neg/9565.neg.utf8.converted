Dixie's "Plain Bread Crumbs" is a poor product.  It tasted sour when used to coat some breaded skinless boneless chicken breasts (with an egg wash as a binder), and did not hold texture at all in frying or baking (as a baking coating it got pretty soggy).  We tried it in a meatloaf recipe as well, and it added a strange sour, almost bitter, aftertaste to it.  This is simply not a good product to my taste buds.  The only reason I did not give it a 1 is that some people's tastes may vary, and the company itself did a good job on order fulfillment.<br /><br />If you're looking for crumbs, you're better off buying Dixie's "Bakes Quick" biscuit mix, then making biscuits and then making crumbs from those.  Its what I did before, and what I will do from now on.<br /><br />If you're looking for a frying coating/batter, go with Dixie's "Batter and Coating" mix - its a far better product.  I use it frequently.<br /><br />Sorry Dixie, in my opinion, this one's a loser.
