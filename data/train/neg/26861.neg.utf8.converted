As a person who is more involved with health and nutrition than the average person that has also purchased raw food bars before, I was happy that this was offered though the Amazon Vine program and I glady ordered the sample.  It tastes good and it claims to contain "nothing cooked, nothing processed," but that is not the simple truth.  The bar contains "agave nectar" which does not occur naturally.  It is not unprocessed and it is in fact, a highly cooked and processed sweetener.  It is derived from processing and cooking the core of the blue agave plant for many hours in order to break down its starches into sugars.  Agave nectar was originally touted as a "healthy alternative" to table sugar, but it is potentially much worse than table sugar on your body.  It is essentially a super high fructose syrup, just like high fructose corn syrup, but with a much higher fructose content.  Typical high fructose corn syrup used in soft drinks is about 55% fructose while agave nectar contains a whopping 85-90% fructose.  First of all, I don't understand why they thought they needed to sweeten this "raw" bar, and second, they used "agave nectar" which sounds good to the uninformed, but it is not a raw ingredient and it has a very high fructose content.  I think they used "agave nectar" to hide the additional fructose (or sugar) on the label.  There is controversy, but fructose and particularly agave nectar may be bad for you.<br /><br />You can research for yourself, google "agave nectar bad"<br /><br />and look for entries from "foodrenegade," "nourishedkitchen" and "living-foods"<br /><br />You can also google "fructose bad"<br /><br />check out the hits from "about" and "the american journal of clinical nutrition"<br /><br />Fructose and in particular, High Fructose Corn Syrup are the subjects of much controversy today.  There are studies that conclude that there is no appreciable difference between sucrose and fructose to our bodies (and of course, fructose is a component of sucrose).  There are also studies that indicate fructose may be problematic.  Regardless of which camp you're in, "agave nectar" is a hidden source of fructose in this bar and it is not raw.  The fact that the manufacturer of this bar claims "nothing cooked and nothing processed" is nothing short of fraud.
