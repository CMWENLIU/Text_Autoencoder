You might not think, from reading ingredients, that this cereal has gluten in it, but it does.  While the cereal tastes yummy and has decent nutritional content, if you are gluten-sensitive, stay away.  I tried it twice and both times spent hours doubled over in agony.  I suspect the gluten source has to do with how the oats are processed.  I wish food producers would realize that celiac disease is no joke and be very careful about product labeling.  Are you listening, Nature's Path?
