Bulbs arrived 3 days ago. One was broken on arrival due to poor packing. I needed them so I opted not to send them all back. I installed all 5 remaining bulbs and 3 days later one has failed in a puff of foul smelling smoke and two others are flickering. Two are working well. Not a very good average. I bought them because they seemed like a good value - they were less than $5 each. If the two that are working continue to work they'll have cost more than $12 each... not so good! I'd recommend avoiding these.<br />UPDATE: 10 days later one of the flickering bulbs has failed. 3 dead - 1 flickering - 2 good.
