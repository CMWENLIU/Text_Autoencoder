The product description states that this is a 3+ pound bag of treats --- it turned out to be a single, individually-wrapped greenie! We're talking a small, single item that weighs less than 2 oz! I made the mistake of paying $7 for a single dog treat! What a joke!!!<br /><br />Fortunately, they credited back my card instantly and Amazon is letting me ship it back completely at their expense. How disappointing! These are my dog's favorites and I thought I was getting a great deal! What a joke!
