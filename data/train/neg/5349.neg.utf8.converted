I figured for $10 for 4 bags, I'd give this a shot despite mixed reviews. I usually brew with a Toddy and drink the coffee pretty concentrated (black), and this stuff is DISGUSTING! I'm not a huge coffee snob, but this stuff is undrinkable, and I'm going to have to toss the remaining 3 bags. DO NOT BUY THIS!
