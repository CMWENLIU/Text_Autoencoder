Do not buy this product in the bag if you are a lover of the International Coffee Italian Cappuccino in the can!<br /><br />IT IS NOT THE SAME AT ALL!<br /><br />I thought I'd be smart and get the stuff in the bag to save money and for the convenience but DON'T GO THERE!<br /><br />The stuff in the bag has a strong chocolate taste and is heavy, I'd rather drink hot chocolate than this, hot chocolate tastes much better.<br /><br />So, my point is keep buying International Coffee Italian Cappuccino flavor in the can and FORGET THE BAG STUFF, it's terrible.<br /><br />Hope this keeps you from making the same mistake that I did, now I'm going to sell the balance of my order on eBay!
