I read other reviews that there was at least a 16 ounce glass teapot...wrong!! It barely hold one cup and broke the second time I used it it is so cheap.First barely flowered, the second not at all. had bought these for presents but cannot give..embarrassingly cheap. you also cannot return to Amazon so am stuck with them. Not top quality or giftable.
