I am a daily sencha drinker and I have had not so good sencha in the past, but this wins the not so good medal from me.  When I first opened the ziplock packaging I could hardly smell anything and the tea looked more brownish than I am used to seeing sencha look  It was loaded with stems (about 10% stems I would estimate).  This was all not a good sign.  Next, I made a cup and only left it in the water for about 1.5 minutes which is about the max I steep Rishi Organic Sencha before it turns bitter.  I was left with a cup of tea that barely smelled like green tea and was seriously weak.  Next, I tried to steep for 5 minutes and still no change.  I guess you get what you pay for.  The packaging and the deliver is good is the only positive thing I can say.  On to trying another brand.
