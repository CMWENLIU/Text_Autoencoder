I have had a keurig for over 4 years.  Never have I had grounds in my coffee until I bought a fifty pack of Jet fuel.  As I work my way through the box, I am throwing out about every third cup.  I "believe" the problem is a thinner than usual foil top, a larger hole is created, during the punch,  and the water is not regulated at the same percentage.  I called to talk to "the coffee people", 2x - never got a human, left my phone number both times, and have never gotten a call back in since the orginal call 10 days ago.  I am done with jet fuel and coffee people, Timothy's  - you have my k-cup money!
