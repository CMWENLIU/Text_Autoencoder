I was really excited when I fund these online, having been looking for "real" sprinkles that actually had chocolate, not chemicals and corn syrup.  The ingredients are much better quality than the typical sprinkles one finds in the USA, but unfortunately the main ingredient is sugar and it tastes that way.  I like chocoloate sprinkles on vanilla ice cream, but these are just way too sweet. Instead, I'm just grating blocks of good dark chocolate.  Some extra effort, but tastes much better than these super sweet sprinkles.  Too bad.
