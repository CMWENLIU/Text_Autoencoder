The new box says "NEW LOOK! same great taste!" and that is a patent lie.<br /><br />I have been drinking this tea for over 10 years.  The previous reviewer is right - the tea is different now.  I had some of the original/previous tea and then I got a big order of the new tea, and I tried them side by side.  They are similar, but the new stuff (in the dark purple box) is more overpowering and I actually disliked whatever new ingredient they added.  It was so terrible to smell and it also affected the taste of the tea.  I drank one glass and it was truly awful; I won't be drinking another.  So sad.<br /><br />This really ticks me off because the product has been perfect and consistent for the last 10+ years.  I noticed that there are fewer tea leaves in the individual bags as well (this was obvious to the naked eye, comparing with the previous tea bags), so it's not as potent as the original.  The old tea bags used to be generous in terms of how much tea was in each bag, and it made a perfect cup of tea.  The new ones are skimpy and one tea bag will not be enough.  That being said, the new flavor is so bad (to me) that I am going to have to give away the 6 boxes.
