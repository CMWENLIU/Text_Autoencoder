The name of this product is a bit misleading. Most people assume that if peanut butter is labeled "natural" that the only ingredients are peanuts (though some manufacturers add a little salt to their natural peanut butter, too). Skippy, however, also adds sugar and extracts the peanut oil and replaces it with palm oil. I don't believe most people would think that something made from peanuts would "naturally" contain palm oil. So while Skippy is technically correct in labeling this "natural" since it does not contain any artificial ingredients, I think they're consciously taking advantage of the fact that most people would think "natural" peanut butter just contains peanuts and its byproducts.
