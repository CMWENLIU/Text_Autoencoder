My daughter has been on Nutramigen Lipil for about 5 months now for her acid reflux.  It has really helped with her spitting up and digesting the food quicker.  Since the stores in our area decided to discontinue carrying this type of formula and started stocking the Nutramigen with Enflora, I've had to switch over to using that instead.<br />For one thing, it is much more expensive.  It's a 12.6 oz can instead of a 16 oz. can.  The scoop inside is much larger so you are using more formula per bottle.  They say the reason for the scoop being larger is that the formula is less dense.  In any case, it is still costing you more money (as if it wasn't expensive enough already.)<br />In our case, our daughter is now suffering very painful gas pains, especially in the middle of the night, since we've started using this new type of formula.  She is also pooping much more frequently during the day. Before she would go about once a day, now it's about 4 times a day.<br />I've called Enfamil to see how I could obtain the original formula and they looked up their past orders to see who in my area has ordered it recently.  All the names they gave me were stores I am familiar with and have personally checked to see if they stocked it, which they do not.  Fortunately, I found a case of it here on Amazon for much cheaper then they (Enfamil) or any grocery store could ever offer.<br />I'm not sure why they felt it necessary to add Enflora to this formula if for no other reason than to make even more money.<br />I strongly recommend that if you are going to start your child on Nutramigen, to get the formula that does NOT contain Enflora.  Check with your pediatrician first to see if they have any free samples they can give you.  I am eagerly awaiting my case of Nutramigen Lipil so that I can once again enjoy a full night of sleep without waking up to my baby crying out in pain.
