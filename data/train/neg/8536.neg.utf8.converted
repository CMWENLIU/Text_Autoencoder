There are many unsual types of colas and drinks that I enjoy.  If I don't like a certain drink, I am at least able to sample it further to decide what it is I don't particularly like about it.  This was not the case with Chinotto.  This drink tastes so awful that it sort of made me gag a little when I tried a second taste.  The best I can decribe it would be like drinking liquid Vegemite.  If you were never brought up with Vegemite and later in life you were able to pick it up and truly enjoy the taste of it, then I would recommend you give this a shot.  If not, go to a store, pop one open, have a quick sip, leave it on the shelf, and then run away quickly!  For advanced palates only.  :)
