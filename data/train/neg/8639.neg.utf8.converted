My rabbit won't eat pellets and there is no food around here that has no pellets so I decided to get this because, although it contained pellets, they look darker and larger. I was hoping they tasted different and they probably do and that maybe my rabbit would give it a chance. In my opinion, it smelled like cigarette ash and my rabbit wouldn't eat it and just avoided it. I can't stand the smell and it seems my rabbit can't either but I spent $16 on this in Petco. I ordered a new bag of Kaytee Rainbow Rabbit food that smells like play-doh and paint and last time it ate every piece to give you an idea of how bad this is. I strongly would NOT recommend it.
