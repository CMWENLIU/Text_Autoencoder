I have issues with portion control when it comes to peanut butter, so I thought the was the perfect solution.  Yes, I read the bad reviews but thought just how bad can it be?  Well, let me tell you this stuff is BAD!  I didn't want to throw it out so I tried mixing it in plain Greek yogurt.  That was a cruel thing to do to the yogurt.  It takes a lot for me to dislike something enough to throw it away, but this stuff was inedible.<br /><br />Now with that said, I also bought the apricot and strawberry jellies and they were good!  I tried mixing that peanut spread with the jelly and that was bad.  Jelly good!  Peanut spread bad.  No way around it.<br /><br />But in the end, I think I rather stick will real whole foods, not processed products.  That's what I get for looking for a short cut.
