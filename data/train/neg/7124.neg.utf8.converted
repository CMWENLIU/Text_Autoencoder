Really simple - nestle changed the formula of Ovaltine to make it cheaper to produce, and the result is a powder that has 1/4 the vitamins and half the flavor. The marketing spin is that it is somehow healthier because it has less sugar, but that's only because you are putting half the amount in. Alternatives my kids like are carnation instant breakfast which still has all the vitamins and tastes great.
