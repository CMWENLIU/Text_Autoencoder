The cheese is great - the packaging is out of date.  The problem is the cheese ships in styrofoam, which is a petroleum based product that cannot be recycled and is a major source of ocean debris.  Thus, this product, although delicious, is non-sustainable because of its packaging.  For those who care about the environment, look to other sources for cheese.  I will.
