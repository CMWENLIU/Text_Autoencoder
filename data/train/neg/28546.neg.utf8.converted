As a serious coffee drinker, I should have read the other reviews. My coffee preferences are Bold and Dark blends. I like a strong cup of coffee and this was very watery to me. I brewed it on the smallest cup size and still thought it was weak.<br />it smells amazing. But if you like a good strong cup of coffee do not buy this. My roommate who prefers lighter coffee, really liked this one. She can keep the extras, im going for that dark Roast cup of coffee.<br />And if you arent sure if you are a DARK or a LIGHT roast person, if you prefer your morning cuppa at Starbucks- then you prefer a dark roast. If you prefer a cup from Dunkin or krispy, you like the lighter roasts- so this cinnamon roll would satisfy you.
