I ordered them thinking I'd be receiving kit kats that matched the picture. I thought it would be perfect for my husbands birthday party, as kit kats are his favorite and the colors were white/black. But I received a box of regular kit kats that I could have purchased cheaper at a has station. Just feel a little mislead that the product picture is NOT what they are selling.
