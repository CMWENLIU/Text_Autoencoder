WARNING - THE BOX I ORDERED ARRIVED MELTED & DRIPPING - DISGUSTING - IT WASN'T EVEN HOT/WARM HERE IN L.A. WHEN I RECEIVED THEM SO I'M GUESSING THEY MELTED BACK IN THE WAREHOUSE OR SOMETHING. AMAZON NEEDS BETTER QUALITY CONTROL ON PRODUCTS LIKE THIS BECAUSE I WILL NOT BUY ANYTHING THIS PERISHABLE AT AMAZON EVER AGAIN.
