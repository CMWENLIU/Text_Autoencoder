Since I don't taste cat food, the reviewers are the cats. Our feral cat (who has an elegant house with heat and has been spayed) eats this food reluctantly.  Our house cats lick the gravy off and then walk away. It looks appetizing to me and I am the one who buys the food for the cats anticipating their eagerness to eat the food I have spent hours selecting for them.  Alas, true to form, they don't eat what I think they might like.
