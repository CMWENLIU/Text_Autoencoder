I ordered this pasta, thinking it was gluten-free, as it came up in the gluten-free search on Amazon.  My fault, I guess, because I didn't look at it closely enough.  I am just irritated with both myself and the company as it was not inexpensive.  Of course, I have not tried it since I have celiac disease, but I am sure the rest of my family will enjoy it as per the other reviews I read before I purchased it.  If I had read further down the review list, I would have seen the review by the person who did the same thing as I did.
