I love Pad Thai.  I order it frequently at Thai restaurants, I buy a frozen version at Trader Joe's, and I have bought make-at-home boxed mixes.  I love them all.  I was really excited to see a shelf stable version I could take to work and have for a quick lunch on a busy day.  I've had other Dr. McDougall's soups before and thought most of them were fine, but I was very disappointed by this one.  That there was too much sauce is excusable because it is, after all, called a soup.  That the noodles weren't right is excusable because you are reconstituting them in a few minutes by adding boiling water.  But the flavor is NOT AT ALL like Pad Thai, and for the life of me I can't figure out why they hung that label on this product.  Pad Thai should be slightly sweet with maybe a hint of peanut.  This tastes like the same salty faux meat flavors found in several of their other soups plus a slight sour taste.  This isn't inedible - but if you were expecting anything resembling Pad Thai you will be disappointed.
