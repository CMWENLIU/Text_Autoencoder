I'm a big fan of Lavazza. I usually drink espresso at home. I decided to buy this drip coffee for the office. Try to get a better taste than the local brands used here.<br />This coffee has a weird after taste. I tried to change filters, water, and coffee machine. There is some kind of sticky after taste that kills this coffee.<br />I will not buy drip coffee from lavazza again. I will stick to the espresso.
