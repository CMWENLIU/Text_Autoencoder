In all fairness, I didn't purchase this food but I'm sure my dog would have been crazy about it! What stopped me in my tracks was the ingredients... why is there wheat flour and sugar?? Those aren't the best quality ingredients for dogs and wheat is know to cause allergies. I'll be moving on to something with higher quality ingredients.
