My son purchased this product for me with his Amazon Prime, which allowed him super quick shipping.  It came today, nice and fresh.  It is horrible.  It is made with dried potatoes instead of fresh, vegetable shortening instead of butter and sorbic acid as a preservative.  I took a bite and spit it out right away.  If you've ever had the real deal, homemade, this is NOT it.  I told my son to contact Amazon and get his money back.<br /><br />No matter how bad a cook you are, you could not mess up a recipe of this, so I suggest you go out and purchase a cookbook with a recipe for lefse in it.  Oh god, this is awful!
