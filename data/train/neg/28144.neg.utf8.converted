Manufacturer claims 750,000 SHU. Magma, rated at 500,000 SHU is MUCH hotter. I am seriously let down. This stuff is good to spice up things that don't go well with pepper flavor. Beer and Soda are the two things that come to mind. If you're looking for something in the 750,000 SHU to 1,000,000 SHU range though, go elsewhere. If I had to guess, I'd put this hot sauce at 300,000 SHU at best.
