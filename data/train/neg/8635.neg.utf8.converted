this is a joke !  the plant is in a 4 inch pot but it is barely 2 inches high with 4 small leaves.  i bought one a couple of years ago and it was fine but this is sad.  bay grows slowly so i'll be long gone before i can harvest a leaf from this plant.<br /><br />4-20 addendum -  i just received a bay from hirts - go to them if you want a bay plant.  it has lots of leaves and is 8 inches above the soil.  very healthy looking
