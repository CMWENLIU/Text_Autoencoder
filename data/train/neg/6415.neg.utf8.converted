I have been buying Lindt 70% Cocoa bars for over a decade.  It was the best dark chocolate for the price.  However, the new recipe, as of Fall 2010, lacks the full rich flavor of the original recipe.  It is now bland and too sweet and definitely not work the price any longer.  I bought one bar of the new recipe and won't be buying any more.  I will probably start buying Green & Black's 70% Cocoa bar instead, unless I can find another better 70% cocoa chocolate that costs less than $3 or $4 per bar.
