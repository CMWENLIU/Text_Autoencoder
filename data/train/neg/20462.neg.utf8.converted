I bought this brand because the normal brand I buy is out of stock on amazon. This brand is not as fine a powder and so it does not stir into liquid.  As soon as you stop stirring or blending it all drops to the bottom. Then when you drink it, the last gulp is all 'sand' that gets stuck in your teeth. So, now you have to brush your teeth or walk around with black stuff stuck to them. There are other brands with as much fiber, more protein and mix right up in liquid.<br /><br />I am sending my stuff back to amazon for a refund.
