I am a big fan of green tea and I usually drink Japanese green tea. However, supermarkets don't sell Japanese brands so I decided to give Bigelow Tea a try. This tea is tasteless! I don't understand how it can get generally positive reviews. I recommend getting Yamamotoyama, you can find it on Amazon. There are better brands but I know Yamamotoyama is easy to find because of it's popularity. It's inexpensive too!
