I was really excited about ordering this set and thrilled when it came.  I have noticed something unexpected about the teas, however.  With the teas I have tried from this set I have noticed an unpleasant dry aftertaste.  Another taster noticed the same thing without my mentioning it.<br /><br />I really like the glass tea pot.  It is very nice to watch the tea fill the glass orb with color and flavor.  Whether the flowers are beautiful or look more like sea urchins will be a matter of personal taste.<br /><br />I had high hopes for the Starlight Rose Tea (white tea leaves with rosebud) and found it far inferior to Rose Petal Black Blended Tea by The Republic of Tea, which is excellent.  On the other hand, Numi's Moroccan Mint is one of the finest teas I have ever tasted, superior to an old favorite of mine- Stash Tea Moroccan Mint.<br /><br />After tasting this tea I am surprised by the number of reviews rating the tea that comes with the set as quite good.  Maybe I got a bad batch or have strange taste buds- but there it is.<br /><br />The bamboo box is quite charming.
