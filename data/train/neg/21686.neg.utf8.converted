I don't often go out of my way to write reviews, but when I tried the free sample of this bar I received in the mail, I found it just sickeningly sweet.  I did not feel at all like I was eating a healthy food, and I did feel a little sick afterward (should have stopped after first bite)  .  Tasted horrible, fakey 'coconut', just not good!
