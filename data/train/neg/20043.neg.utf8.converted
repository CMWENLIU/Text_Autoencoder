I bought this tea because I was thinking the orange flavor would be great in the morning.  I was correct, BUT...<br />The bags are plastic.  So everytime you drink a cup of tea, you leave a little bit of plastic behind for thousands of years.  The tea is delicious, but needless to say, I will not buy this product again.
