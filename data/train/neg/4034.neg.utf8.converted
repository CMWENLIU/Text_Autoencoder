It's a sweet SUGAR ADDED beverage (so of course it's sweet. You could add sugar to any other coco water and make it taste 'better'). Tried it on sale but wouldn't buy it again.<br /><br />1. Taste Nirvana or C2O<br />2. Vita coco<br />3. One or Zico (it's from concentrate - but the chocolate is a great post long run drink and delicious!)
