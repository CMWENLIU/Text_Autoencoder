I'm preparing for my 3rd Master Cleanse and well found this 'interesting'...I don't think the present Maple Valley Syrup, the one recommended in Burrough's book, is formaldehyde-free any longer. Please see recent email (below) that I sent to Maple Valley after I received my purchase directly from them. NO WHERE was I able to find that it's formaldehyde-free. The website uses Burrough's 1976 quote (or was it 1940?)from his book but I couldn't find any other mention of the syrup being made without formaldehyde stated anywhere else. Organic - yes but nothing else.<br /><br />Email sent to Maple Valley:<br />Hello - I'm curious- Why do you not clearly state (and LOUDLY claim) on your receipt, on your bottle, in your brochure or on your website that you do not use formaldehyde. You quote Stanley Burrough's statement in his book of why he recommends your specific product:<br /><br />"From page 17 of The Master Cleanser by Stanley Burroughs:<br />"... maple syrup is a balanced form of positive and negative sugar and must be used, not some 'substitute... The maple syrup has a large variety of minerals and vitamins. Naturally the mineral and vitamin content will vary according to the area where the trees grow and the mineral content in the soil. These are the minerals found in average samples of syrup from Vermont: Sodium; Potassium; Calcium; Magnesium; Manganese; Iron; Copper; Chlorine and Silicon. Vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, C, Nicotinic acid and Pantothenic Acid are also present in the syrup... Some uninformed operators of the sugaring of the maple syrup do use formaldehyde pellets, run through polyethylene tubing but there are many more that don't. Search out and demand the kind that does not use formaldehyde. Maple Valley Syrup (formerly Maple River Valley) from WI. does not use it. This is the kind I recommend."<br /><br />but you don't advertise that specifically, anywhere. Obviously, now-a-days, you DO use formaldehyde. If this is not true then why not claim it...if it's the truth?<br />Sincerely, Cecilia<br /><br />Just a heads-up for today's world of 'half-truths' and greed at any cost.
