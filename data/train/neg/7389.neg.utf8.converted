My one and only experience with this hot sauce was during a roadtrip to the coast.  I had packed my special blend of homemade Bloody Mary fixin's to enjoy in our Hotel.  Unfortunately,  this time I included "Dave's Insanity Sauce" which I had unwittingly bought for my husband who likes it hot.  Once we hit our room I made two potent Mary's & not knowing what to expect barely dipped toothpick in  Insanity Sauce & swirled it into my  cocktail.<br />Immediately  upon my 1st sip FLAMES began shooting though my left ear "CARTOON STYLE"...<br />It hurt so bad I thought I was going to have to go to E.R. Nearly ruined my entire weekend... On our last day in Monterey we found this little shop called Slow Burn (alas no longer open) which was packed to the brim with hot sauces from all over.. I would say there were at least 10 different bottles to sample. To my delight some actually had distinct flavor rather than just hotness and pain. My favorite was a little bottle that had a sombrero for a cap, (not sure the name) but yum! The owner explained to me why the Insanity Sauce caused me such pain. He thought it might be sugar that caused the heat to stick.  They're not all like that. I don't see sugar listed in the ingredients listed here though...
