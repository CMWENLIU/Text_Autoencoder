I bought a 6 pack case of this when it first came out and liked it so much I set up a subscription.  Half way through my second order I finally asked my wife if the cereal seemed to have less pecans and less bunches.  When I asked she told me she was wondering the same thing.  Well I just received my third case and I have no need to ask anyone.  My first bowl had almost no pecans in it and no crunchy clusters.  Just to be sure this wasn't a fluke of a bowl I pulled the cereal from the box and found myself staring at what looked like a plain bran flake cereal.  I really had to look hard to see anything other than bran flakes.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed with what started off as a very good cereal. My subscription has been cancelled.
