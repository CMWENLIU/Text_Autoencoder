i was expecting something like a bunch of bully sticks but these are gone in literally 4 bites! even with my 14 week old aussie! it seems like a bargain but it's seriously not much at all when the dogs devour a stick in like a min.  they smell like they where dipped in motor oil or something awful. it get a bit better when you rinse them but still stinky and i feel reluctant to feed them to my dogs. my cattle dog mix turns his head when i try t give him these! awful treats, don't recommend to anyone!!! (i bought the beef basted)
