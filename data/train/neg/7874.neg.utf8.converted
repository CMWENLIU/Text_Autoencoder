I only drink ginger tea. I tried this product even though it was labeled "lemon ginger tea". I don't think this tea has any ginger in it. The label reads Organic Lemon Ginger tea. Underneath it says: Contains: organic carob,organic chicory, organic S. African rooibos,lemon myrtle. This is not ginger tea and should not be labeled as such.<br /><br />b. Thomas
