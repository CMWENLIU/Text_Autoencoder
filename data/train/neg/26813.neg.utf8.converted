Looking for some bulk 1 minute oats as our local Sam's Club sometimes does not stock it, so off to Amazon.<br /><br />Save your money and go buy it at your local supermarket - this stuff is at 2-3X normal supermarket prices.<br /><br />The oats themselves are fine, a commodity...try them with some ground almonds and a handful of raisins - mmmm.
