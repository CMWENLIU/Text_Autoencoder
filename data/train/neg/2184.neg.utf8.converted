I discovered Goya's Pink Beans at a local liquidation store.  Tried them and loved them!  I decided to check Amazon to see if they had them.<br /><br />Amazon had them listed as 4 pound bags so I snatched up all 5 bags the seller NACM had left in stock.  I was supposed to receive 5 FOUR pound bags for a total of $31.40.  NACM sent me 5 ONE pound bags instead.  I received the packages and immediately knew there was an error.  I contacted the seller straight away to tell them of the issue.  For some reason they assumed I was being dishonest and greedy???  They were defensive even though I told them Amazon has the listed as 4 pound bags.<br /><br />I sent several emails back and forth, being courteous each time, and their response was always in the context that I was trying to take advantage of them.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon customer service for the first time in over 100 transactions.  Was on chat with someone from Mumbai or India.  I was getting the run around.  "Contact the seller"......"Amazon is like a mall and the individual sellers are like small stores within that mall"......"we will not get involved unless the seller refuses to refund your money".<br /><br />At this point I thought I was stuck with beans at $6.28/pound.  I can purchase 16 pounds of these everyday for about $48.00 on another site. And less than $3.00 per 1 pound bag at a box store.  So I thought $31.40 was a pretty good deal.  The kind of deals that Amazon is known for.<br /><br />Fast forward to the next day.  I got on chat with Donovan from the US.  He researched and saw that these were incorrectly listed by Amazon as 4 pound bags and I was due compensation.  He gave me a promotional credit and I was happy.<br /><br />I contacted NACM and told them that I would NOT remove my negative feedback because of the unprofessional and accusatory way they handled the situation.  They tried to make me feel like a thief again.  I don't know any buyer who appreciates being accused of being distrustful, greedy or an out right liar.<br /><br />Here's the feedback we left each other:<br /><br />Date: August 29, 2012 Feedback 1/5:  "These were listed as 4 pound bags of beans by Amazon. I rec'd 1 pound bags instead. Paying $6.28 x 5 ($31.40) is NOT what I had in mind. NACM claim that I misread the listing and are not helpful at all. Claim filed"<br />=====================================<br />Seller Response: The beans is listed as $6.28 + free shipping for a 14oz bag, but I sent him 16oz bags. Nowhere has Amazon listed it as 4lb. Where can he get a 4lb pink beans for $6.28 plus free shipping.Customer is trying to be super greedy<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />The beans themselves are PERFECT.  The seller NACM should be avoided at all cost.<br /><br />There are 4 pound bags of these listed here on Amazon for $9.79 + shipping.  The photo listed shows a 14oz bag instead.  What I would receive if I placed another order for these in a 4 pound bag?  I'll never know because I'm getting these elsewhere next time.
