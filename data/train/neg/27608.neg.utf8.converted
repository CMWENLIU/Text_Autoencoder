Pretty OK coffee. Nothing special, but I suppose its a fair deal for the price. We picked up the pack of 3 as an emergency stash, and it has worked well for that, but its not my caffeine deliver system of choice ;-) Of course, my coffee of choice is over three times the cost of this stuff, so the comparison is not very fair.
