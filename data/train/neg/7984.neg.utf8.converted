I love a good latte' - which was why I  purchased this Syrup (as well as, the Pumpkin Spice Syrup) - I have always used the Gourmet "Sauce," but decided to give this a try, big mistake! I found it to be bitter and the flavor was harsh, even when dispensing less than a 1/2 of tsp.  To say that I am disappointed would be putting it mildly. I haven't tried using either of these syrups in baked goods, so I am unable to comment on that particular aspect. However, if you are searching for a product to put in coffee to make your favorite hot or cold drink, I recommend purchasing the sauce not the syrup, it is well worth the difference in cost. The sauce is thicker, has a full bodied, authentic flavor and mixes well with hot or cold beverages.
