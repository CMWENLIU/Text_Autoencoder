Who decided walden farms should sell this product? It's so terrible. The fact they still sell this should be a crime.  Tastes like a packet of splenda mixed with mystery chemicals. Why does it have to be that sweet? It's like they didn't even taste test before this was put on the market. Was this a joke on the consumer or what? I mean it is THAT bad. I told myself I'd eat it because I hate throwing food away, but even opening the jar makes me gag when that awful smell hits my nostrils. What a waste of money. I bought mine at the store, not through amazon, but seeing the other reviews on here, it's going to be terrible either way. I don't normally complain about food but man, this is the worst thing I have ever eaten. I hope there are better alternatives to peanut butter out there than this.
