This coffee literally stinks! Opened the bag, dripping with oils and I almost got sick from the smell. It is so strong in flavor you cannot make it drinkable. I find it bitter unless you add a ton of milk and sugar (not good). I do not understand all these good reviews (thats why I chose it)because it is hands down the worst coffee I have ever had!
