This was one of the worst cups of coffee I have had in my life. Very weird, bitter taste to it; everyone who has tried it has had the same opinion. I usually enjoy bold and full-bodied coffee, but I had to throw out the entire box. I don't know if it has something besides coffee in it (isn't there a tradition of putting chicory or something in the coffee in New Orleans?), but YUCK!
