Disappointed, nothing like I expected.  It was as different as expecting New England-style clam chowder and then getting Manhattan-style.  This was not creamy, it smelled bad, and had a sour taste to it.<br /><br />I even made a second can with cream because the first one tasted so bad.  No improvement.
