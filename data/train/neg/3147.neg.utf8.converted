I was so happy to see Israeli Couscous available here, but when I got it, it was stale.  I tried to cook some anyway to see if it was just a strong wheat smell throwing me off.  Nope, it really was stale--disappointing.  Because it's whole wheat, it can go bad quicker than other similar products.  I hope this is offered again when they find a way to refirgerate/freeze it before it ships so that it doesn't get stale.  Also, the manufacturer probably needs to add an expiration date to the packaging so that warehouses know when to get rid of it.
