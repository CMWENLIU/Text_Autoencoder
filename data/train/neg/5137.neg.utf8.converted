This is the 1 lb. sample size, and it goes for 8 bucks and some changes. I guess that isn't bad, except that it comes with a big sign on the front that says "SAMPLE SIZE - $2.99", and then there is a coupon on the back. Total ripoff. Don't order this. Just go to the store, buy the sample size, and save yourself 6 dollars and waiting almost a week.
