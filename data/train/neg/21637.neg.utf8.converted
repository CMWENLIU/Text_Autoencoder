I bought this as its advertized as a Green Super Food!<br /><br />If it had as much greens as it claims, it would have ALLOT more Calcium in it, which it only has 30mg, which is only 4% of daily intake, and does not amount to anything.<br />The only vitamin that comes close to 100% is vitamin A.(no big deal)<br /><br /> I know that eating greens has calcium in it, and is a good source of Calcium that<br />does not cause plaque in your arteries, that is now being found with certain forms of calcium pills/tables/capsules...<br />It seems this has a little bit of allot of different things, but not much of anything<br />in my opinion.<br /><br />I see where people here had allot of energy after drinking this.<br />I can now see why. there is allot of fruits & veggies (but not much) that give off allot of natrual sugar.<br /><br /> I do mot see the supplement facts on this page, which there should be one!<br />I'm very disapointed in this product.
