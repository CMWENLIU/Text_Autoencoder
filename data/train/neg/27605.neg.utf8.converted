I was excited to try a blend of Jamaican blue coffee.  We had been there and loved the coffee but the pure beans are to difficult and expensive to get here.  I had tried another blend and was pleased but could not find that brand again so I tried this one.  Frankly it tastes awful.  Like the back end of a 5 pound tin of 4$ a pound coffee.  The flavor was harsh, stale and acidic without a hint of the the mellow chocolate notes that come with the Jamaican beans.  It was my first exposure to this brand and I will not try Jeremia's Pick coffee again.
