Note on my rating: the one star rating that I gave was for the poor marketing of this product, not on the quality or taste.  The folks at Puck could have done a much better job in naming this product something closer to what it is (a bag, not a "pod"), and amazon could have done a much better job separating this product from k-cup products, thereby saving me the cost and inconvenience of ordering this product by mistake.
