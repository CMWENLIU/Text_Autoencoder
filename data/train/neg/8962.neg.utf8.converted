This is so easy to make - add a little water, stir, put in the microwave, and you're good to go. It's very high fat though, and the taste isn't as good as baked items. We tend to put a lot of ice cream or whipped cream on it to help the taste, but that just adds to the fat content. I'd encourage anyone to try a single box from their grocery store before being this large package to make sure you like it.
