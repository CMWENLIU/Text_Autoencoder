This dish is classic southern Mediterranean food. It has stood the test of time since ancient Egypt. When you violate time-honored tradition and try to improvise, more often than not you'll end up going astray. This is what happened in this case; they went astray. The resulting taste of violating traditional ingredients can never be accepted by the true aficionados of pure traditional stuffed grape leaves. It tastes yucky; I ended up giving it to my dog. He ate it, but then gave me that look, you know what I am talking about; "Why me? What did I ever do to you?)..... Stay away; it is definitely not worth half what it sells for.
