I too was shocked that a third of the k-cups in this product were tea or lemon beverages.  Foolish me -- when I order a product called "Timothy's World Coffee K-Cup Variety Pack," I actually expect it to contain a variety of COFFEE k-cups. Having to order a minimum of two boxes from Amazon only compounded the problem.<br /><br />I am giving this product one more star than it otherwise deserves because when I called the company to complain, they did send me one free box of just coffee k-pods. However, the combination of deceptive labeling and having to throw away a third of the contents of the box unused makes this a poor product choice in my opinion.<br /><br />If this product contained only coffee k-pods, I would probably order it again because the coffee k-pods actually in it were pretty good, but I certainly don't recommend it now.
