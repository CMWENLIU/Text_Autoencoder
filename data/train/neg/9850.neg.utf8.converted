I read all of the good reviews of this popcorn and was hoping that it would be at least halfway decent.  I like food to be more salty than most, but this was far too salty.  There is also almost no cheese taste and it has kind of a bad after taste too.  After eating about 1/8 of a bag I just couldn't eat anymore.  I dumped the rest into the dog's dish because she eats anything, even veggies.  She wolfed down several bites but then refused to eat anymore of it and I had to throw the rest out.  I think I'll leave the remaining bags by the microwave at work and donate the unopened boxes to a food shelf.  Avoid this stuff at all costs!
