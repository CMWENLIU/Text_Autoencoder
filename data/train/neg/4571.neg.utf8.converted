I purchased this product because I wanted a powdered full fat cream substitute for baking and cooking on my low carb diet  ( full fat cream has zero carbs). However, when the product arrived, it was DRY WHOLE MILK which has 8 grams of carbs per 3 tbsp!  It has a decent taste and arrived as promised, but I would have never purchased dry whole milk... The product title is misleading.....
