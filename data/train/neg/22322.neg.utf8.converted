There is so much Grit in the product (Tiny little stones), that they are in every single bag, in every single breakfast serving that I've had. You're chewing then you get a hard CRUNCH (probably not that healthy for your teeth chewing stones!) Not only that, Bobs brand is HORRENDOUSLY overpriced. What are we paying for? I'll be getting my Quinoa elsewhere thank you, for much cheaper and a higher quality too! I'd rather support a company that doesn't gauge the consumer and does it right. :)
