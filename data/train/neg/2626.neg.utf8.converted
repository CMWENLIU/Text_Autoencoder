Yes it came packed very nicely like the other reviews say, it even got here earlier than I expected.<br /><br />What I was upset about is really how ugly this tree is.  I wasn't expecting something as perfectly manicured as what is shown in the picture but I definitely wasn't expecting the Hackjob that arrived on my doorstep.  It looked like it someone had just lopped off about a foot in order for it to fit in the box...  I just got it an hour ago and I'm seriously debating returning it because I don't know if I have it in my to make this look like anything other than a diseased, half-dead stick with some leaves glued on.<br /><br />The trunk is very straight which is nice, and even with the free shipping it still arrived with moist soil.  The pot is also very nice.  The reason for a 2 star instead of a 1 or less.
