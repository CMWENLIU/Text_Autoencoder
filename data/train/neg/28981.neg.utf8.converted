I bought this Treat Ball with my Aussie puppy in mind; I wanted something that would keep her busy while in her crate AND something that she couldn't destroy within a few minutes. She had the actual chicken treat out of the ball within minutes; I replaced it. My other Aussie mix had it out of the ball within less than a minute. After the treat was consumed, they got to work on the ball itself...it's a great item for my dachshunds, but for the Aussies and the German Shepherd, it's hardly "Everlasting". Darn it! I was hoping I finally found something that the little herders couldn't immediately destroy!
