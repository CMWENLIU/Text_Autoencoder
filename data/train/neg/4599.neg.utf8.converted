These lemon drops are OK.<br />First, they don't have a very strong lemon flavor, and you may like that. I like lemon and i want to pucker up.<br />Second, these babies are rough in your mouth. Lots of sugar to get through before you hit lemon.<br />Third, they are all beat up in a bulk bag, which doesn't make them very nice to put in a candy dish.
