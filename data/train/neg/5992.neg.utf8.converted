The meal versions are not good they are grainy and never dissolve. I have tried both the vanilla chai and chocolate both have this texture. :.( I wanted to like it because I love the chocolate and berry amazing grasses. So I thought adding protein would be great. Even if you can get past the texture. this tastes nothing like vanilla chai.
