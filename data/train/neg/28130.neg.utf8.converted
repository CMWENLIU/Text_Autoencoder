I also did not receive a 40 oz. bag and instead got many 2.83 oz. boxes and bags, one of which opened in shipment. M&Ms EVERYWHERE! I'm definitely annoyed and disappointed as it's a Christmas present and it seems silly to hand them a dozen tiny packages. The description seems very clear but it's not what I received.... Oh well, yummy candy though!
