I was VERY disappointed in both the quality and price of this product. The quality was poor, as the candy was stale, and the price was totally ridiculous...over $16.00 for a few pieces of toffee. I'll never buy this item from this seller again. Hopefully the Mackintosh's toffee bars will become available again sometime soon, because I've never had a bad one of those!
