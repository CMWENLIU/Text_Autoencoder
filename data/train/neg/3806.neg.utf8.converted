Despite the box color and misleading labeling Muesli, don't be fooled as I was.  This is not the same as the No Sugar version of the Original Formula with the muesli consistency that expands when soaked with milk or soymilk and which has the wonderful date pulp flavoring.  This is a new hybrid muesli-flakes version that I have never seen for sale in stores especially created for American taste which is used to lots of flakes and raisins.  Now I have to finish off six boxes before I can go back to Original Formula or No Sugar Original Formula.
