It's hard to believe people sat in a room and thought this would be a good idea. It's a terrible idea peddled as modern day snake oil. Look at the price, over $2.29 a bottle. It's black and psychologically nasty looking. People can say it looks like coffee all they want, but coffee smells like coffee and this is supposed to be water. Water is meant to be clear, pure and cleansing. This product fails on every level. I'm sure the positive reviews are friends and family. I would expect to see this as a joke product at Spencer's gifts. Avoid it.
