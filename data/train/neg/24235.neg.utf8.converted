Buyers beware that this sale is for 1 box of 5 cookies NOT five, 5-Count Boxes as what seems to be advertised here. I thought I was buying "in bulk" - five, 5-piece boxes - at what is competitive, albeit slightly more expensive than several retailers that sell the same cookies; the few cents more was not an issue since free delivery is a plus. Surprisingly, I received one box of 5 cookies for the outrageous price of $18.85. Hopefully, the Amazon webmaster will correct the description so that the next buyer knows exactly what he/she is paying for - 1 box of cookies.  The Amazon rep was very helpful in rectifying situation which was the only saving grace here.  I'd be happy to buy again in the future and give 4 stars if this does indeed become a five, 5-count box offer.
