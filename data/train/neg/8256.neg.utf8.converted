I'm annoyed that through negligence or incompetence there is a picture online of the product for sale (a box of cookies and a jar of something that looks like lemon curd or preserves), which does not match the item that arrived.  The cookies were to be a gift for a French friend from Aix.  Not knowing if she'd like the "lemon curd", I bought 2 of the item, thinking I'd try the "preserves" to make sure they were tasty or suitable for a gift; if not, I'd use it.<br /><br />Imagine my disappointment when only 2 boxes of cookies showed up - the cookies may be good and my French friend was touched I went to so much trouble, but I'm annoyed that through negligence or incompetence there is a picture online of the product for sale, which does not match the item that arrived.<br /><br />Lame.  I won't bother shopping here again.
