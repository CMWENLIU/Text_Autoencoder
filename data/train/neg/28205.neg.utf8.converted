My dog is not at all a picky eater - in fact, he'll eat anything.  At least until these VeggieDent Chews.  He did initially but reluctantly try 2 of the chews but then refused any additional ones offered.  The chews make a significant cracking sound when he bites down on them and recently I can tell his mouth has been irritated.  It may be related to these hard chews - I'm not sure.  At any rate, he wants nothing to do with them anymore and when I gave him a beef hide CET chew as a substitute, he scarfed it down without any problem.  I liked the idea of the Veggie ones but he obviously prefers something he can actually "chew" not crack with his teeth.  So now I have a nearly full bag of the Veggie chews that may end up in the garbage.  Not sure I want to risk giving these to another dog.
