I do not drink coffee but love a good cup of Chai. My first impression upon sipping Cafe Escapes Chai Latte was that it was delicious!!!...creamy, rich and flavorful. Unfortunately, I soon noticed an after taste that ruined the experience. After reading the ingredients, I was unhappy to see that this company uses Sucralose, an artificial sweetener (see: dangers of sucralose).<br />The terrible after taste and unhealthy choice of using an artificial sweetener has caused me to give this product a poor rating.<br />I feel the negatives of the product far out weigh the company's attempt to make a low calorie drink. Green Mounta, how about making a Chai K-cup without the artificial sweetener.!
