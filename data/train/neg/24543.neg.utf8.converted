I immediately found the look and texture unappealing but I proceeded to try some straight out of the bag making a mess all over the counter because of the fineness of this product.  There was no resemblance to any shredded coconut I have ever tasted.  In my opinion it's organic but it has nothing else going for it besides that.  It would make sense to see if you can find this somewhere in one 8 ounce bag before you purchase 12 - 8 ounce bags like I did because who knows how many people feel they have made a mistake with this purchase as I do but not left a review.
