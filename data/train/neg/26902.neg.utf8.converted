I love stevia and am always making and buying healthy organic foods for our family. I gave up sugar 9 months ago and thanks to stevia it is going great! However, this product contains too much fiber. My husband and I have been having these terrible stomach aches recently ( never used to ), the only thing I can think of is my recent use of this form of stevia. While a little fiber is great, too much is bad for your body. I have been using it in everything; baked goods, pancakes, my homemade pasta sauce, even our tea and water. Now we are learning what over use of this product can do! My other problem with it is the fact that it "poofs!" when you bake with it. I am very careful but no matter what I do it all goes into the air and my lungs. It does not blend easy a bit. The only way it blends is if you mix it with hot boiling water first. Spend the extra and get the liquid stevia without fiber!
