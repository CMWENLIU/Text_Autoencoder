I read all five reviews before placed an order.  The cake is terrible and I would not recommend to anyone.  Here is why:<br />(a) Two of the five reviews online said the cake could last 3 months, so I bought 4 cakes in one order.  Guess what, all four I got had an expiration date 2 weeks later.  Maybe I am just that lucky one who got the cakes just before they expired.<br />(b) Tiramisu I've had in restaurants has been moist and NOT very sweet.  This cake is dry and very sweet (comparable to cakes in Walmart).  The dryness may be due to the fact it is close to its expiration date.<br />(c) The cakes arrived upside down.  I opened one and part of it stuck to the cover.  This may have nothing to do with the seller, instead, buying cake online and getting it shipped to you may not be a good idea after all.
