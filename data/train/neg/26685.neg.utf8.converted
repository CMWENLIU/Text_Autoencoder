Tastes like sick chemicals. I cannot imagine any child eating this and liking it, same goes with all of Annie's mac and cheese products. Sauce is thin, noodles are too small, and it tastes like vomit or stomach acid (I'm serious). Kraft now makes Organic mac and cheese and it's DELICIOUS, I'm eating some right now.
