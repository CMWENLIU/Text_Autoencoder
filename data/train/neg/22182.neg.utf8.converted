First of all, I got this same bag for $5 at Walgreens. Amazon is price gouging. Secondly, these have a weird aftertaste and more crumbly texture despite the fact the expiration date was 8/2014. And Thirdly, these aren't even close to Red Bird Soft Peppermints, which are made in the US and have no sour aftertaste. They also sell Red Bird at Walgreens or CVS in a tub for $3.99 so Amazon isn't even close to those prices.
