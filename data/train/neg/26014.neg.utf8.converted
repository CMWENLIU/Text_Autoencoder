I guess I was also disappointed in the assortment.  The info suggests you get 34 different coffees, so that you don't have to "buy 34 different boxes."  But as others reported, I got repeats in the assortment, as many as 4 of the exact same product.  Furthermore, I received two CIDER products, which are not coffee.  I don't want cider, I want coffee.  And thanks for the iced coffee sample, which I also don't drink.  Lastly, the k-cups are packaged in a brown paper bag which is stapled shut.  I'm guessing that doesn't even meet food packaging codes; there's no product info, ingredient info or nutrition info.
