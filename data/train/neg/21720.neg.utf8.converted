I purchased unsweetened carob chips for candy making. They do not melt well and are supper grainy, plus they have a horrible flavor. I called the company and even though they say quality guaranteed these were awful and they would not do anything to make it right and were very rude on the phone. Do not waste your money on these!!!!!!!!!!!
