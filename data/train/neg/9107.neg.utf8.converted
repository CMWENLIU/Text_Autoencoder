I have been looking for tender, crispy popcorn for some time.  I decided to try this popcorn since it was organic.  It's not what I'm looking for.  It is a little chewy, even though I've made several batches with a few changes, trying to see if I could make it crispy.  Nothing worked.  Perhaps it is old, & maybe it was crispier when it was fresher.
