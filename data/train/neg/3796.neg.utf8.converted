Note the Disclaimer: product may be different than pictured.  Pa. Dutch Gen'l Store doesn't know Barbados Molasses from old motor oil - and the label on the jar doesn't state what is in it. This goop is no different from Brer Rabbit sorghum (syrup) that you can buy in your local grocery store, other than it costs 3X as much through Amazon.  When I contacted Pa. Dutch Gen'l Store I was told they were just the distributor, so tough luck if I ended up with the wrong product.  Amazon is silent.  Lesson: DON'T TRY TO BUY "MOLASSES" FROM A BOOK STORE.  And DON'T BUY ANY PRODUCT FROM PA. DUTCH GEN'L STORE.  "GOLDEN BARREL" ISN'T THE "BARREL MOLASSES" YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.  It's just a name on a label.  A PENNZOIL label would have been just as accurate.  The Disclaimer conveniently allows the vendor to display any picture, but ship anything from axle grease to dishwater.  Amazon needs to go back to selling books and stop trying to be Walmart.
