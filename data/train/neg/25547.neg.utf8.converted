I was so excited when I had read about this tea and wanted to try it and saw it was sold here on Amazon. I quickly placed my order.  It arrived quickly (about 5 days) so no problem there.  Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and the tea was mislabeled as something else...basic green tea from China.  I contacted the seller and was told that they do this so as not to have any issues with customs.  The seller also told me to mix the powder with a bit of baking soda and put it in my mouth and if it numbed it than it was good....well it didn't.  I tried to brew the tea also and guess what?  It was awful..I drink a lot of tea too, so I think I would know if this was ok or not.  It made me tired, and didn't give me any kick of energy or any clarity at all...as a matter of fact it was a total waste of money.  I would not buy from this seller again. Don't waste your money!
