It is supposed to clean dogs teeth as it is chewed and it is supposed to last a while.  My Yorkie chewed a half inch off one end and swallowed the rest, all four inches of it in less than five minutes.  She didn't choke and it is digestible, but it scared the hell out of me and I won't give her another one!
