DON'T LISTEN to the COMMENTS of the OTHERS. They are just fake!!!<br />I have ordered 8 of them and expect a quality that the price should deliver.<br />If you want to order for one can... that is enough...<br />BUT PLEASE Don't waste your money on this if you want to have something tasty!<br />The taste is bad enough for you to feel that the cow just went to the killing process line...<br />and Hei! You are just eating that last shit from the cow right out of the can. PLEASE DONT BUY, the "awesome" comments are just fake.
