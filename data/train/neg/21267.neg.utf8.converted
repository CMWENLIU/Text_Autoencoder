I didn't like them at all.  WAY TOO SWEET!  They're not as gummy and chewy as you'd expect from Haribo.  I didn't taste a whole lot of raspberry flavor either; maybe I'd had better ones.  Originally, I thought there were the same gummies I received at Christmas from a friend who's living in Europe; but boy, was I disappointed.  My husband and kids didn't like them; my husband then brought the candies to work - they weren't a hit either.  I tried to give the candies away and nobody wanted them.  I read the other reviews before I bought these and except for 1 review, all the other customers seemed to love these.  Well, good for you if you love them; we definitely don't enjoy them at all.
