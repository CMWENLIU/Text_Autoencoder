I normally buy Maple Syrup from the Amish around here but ran short before I could get there to buy more...so I ordered this thinking it was going to be the same.  It's pretty thin and doesn't have the same full bodied flavor as making it the old fashioned way.  I wouldn't pay the price for it again.
