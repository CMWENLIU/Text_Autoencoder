I love these tomatoes, they taste great and they cook well. But what is with the price??  I buy these by the case at a warehouse store S--- C---- and the case is only $6! (Unless you are in a situation where you have to have groceries delivered) I can't see spending more than triple the price for the convenience of home delivery.  It is a shame, I would love to have groceries delivered to my home, and I can see paying a bit more for the convenience, but this price is excessive-- no thanks!
