This soda is terrible! What a waste of my $! The only reason I purchased a 6 pack is b/c the Amazon reviews were so good. If you drink diet or regular soda don't even bother! This stuff honestly tastes like plain, carbonated water!?, I can't even taste a HINT of black cherry! I don't know if all the reviews here are written by Zevia stock holders or what but I am NOT impressed with any tasteless product. Will just have to go back to the drawing board and dose myself off the bad habit. I should have known if it sounds too good to be true IT IS. Bummer!
