When I had heard enough about dogs getting sick or dying after eating Chinese chicken jerky, I went looking for products made in the US and found this and have ordered several 1 lb bags. When fewer and fewer vendors were listed on amazon and the price quadrupled from my last purchase, I called the manufacturer to see if they had stopped making the product. The person said no, they had reformulated it so I waited for that to show up. Now it has so I went back to the manufacturer's web site to see what they changed.<br /><br />I was appalled by what I found. From my bags of the old product here is a list of the ingredients. Chicken, natural smoke flavor. That's all.<br /><br />Here's the reformulated product ingredient list: Chicken, betaine, brown sugar, cultured dextrose, sea salt, natural smoke flavor, garlic powder, mixed tocopherols (preservative), paprika extract color, rosemary extract.<br /><br />I didn't know what betaine was so I looked it up on the net. After reading about it, I still don't know what it is.<br /><br />The crude protein dropped from 77% to 50%.<br />  crude fat increased from 2% to 5%.<br />  moisture increased from 18% to 28%.<br /><br />I am not going to give this product to my dog and will make my own chicken jerky in the oven.<br />___________________<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I just went to a new Petco that opened near me. I found a 1 lb package of Colorado Naturals Chicken Jerky Dog Treats. Made in the US.<br /><br />Ingredients: Chicken breasts, natural flavorings.<br /><br />Crude protein 70%<br />Crude fat 3-7%<br />Moisture 10%<br /><br />I will be buying these once I use up my old stock of True Chews.
