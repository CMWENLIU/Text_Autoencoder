I purchased this and must say that it's difficult to clean, stretches with every use, and still leaves behind a considerable amount of sediment which is my purpose for buying a nut milk bag. I'm disappointed in the performance of this product. Paint straining bags/bags brought in the canning section of the hardware stores work just as efficient and cost much less.
