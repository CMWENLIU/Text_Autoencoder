I have been a HUGE fan of this product for a long time, but now, in the version at grocer's freezer they cut the portion in HALF and add some cruddy rice and charge the same price!!! I complained to the company and they responded that "a lot of consumers asked that we add rice" (yeah... sure they did. They just wanted to improve their profit margin so they cut the portion in half) I can't order a CASE of this stuff, I live in an apt. so I won't be having any more Tandoor Chef :( Greedy so-and-sos!<br /><br />This review is not against AMAZON - no problem with amazon.com but I'm very bummed at Tandoor Chef.<br />(but really, they ship frozen food???)
