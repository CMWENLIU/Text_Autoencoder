A pleasingly crisp exterior conceals a thin layer of oversweet filling.  The ingredients list explains why: High Fructose corn syrup shows up twice, as does regular sugar and brown sugar.  The taste/texture combo made me think of an adult version of pop-tarts.<br /><br />I'm a fan of natural foods (and minimalism in processed foods), so the long list of artificial ingredients in these bars is major turn-off.  Considering HFCS's reputation, why not use regular corn syrup?  FDC Red #40, why?? And there's a laundry list of preservatives as well.  Especially off-putting considering that the marketing and packaging both seem to trumpet the food's wholesomeness.<br /><br />Portability might be a plus, except the GF commented on how the bar crumbled as she ate it in the car, leaving crumbs all over her lap.  Why not a thicker layer of natural fruit preserves (much like Stonewall Kitchens preserves are made of all natural ingredients), to make this actually fruity and wholesome?<br /><br />Recommended for coaxing people off pop-tarts, but those of you who already enjoy "adult" food will not be impressed.  I won't repeat.
