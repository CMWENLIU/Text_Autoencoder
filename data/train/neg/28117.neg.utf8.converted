I have ordered the larger versions of these cakes and have been very please, in the past.  This cake was dark, stale, lacked flavor and none of my guests took more than two bites.  It is really bad.  Either the baker quality is gone or this is a fluke. I was considering this as a Christmas gift for friends, but do not intend to buy this again.
