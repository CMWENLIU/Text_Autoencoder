I admit to being sceptical about having an instant tea that I would normally let steep for 5 minutes.  This is the most bitter green tea I have ever drank.  Maybe it's too concentrated, or the water's not hot enough.  I tried different drink size options, and that didn't work.  Maybe the black teas are better.  I'll stick to a different green tea, and brew it the old fashioned way.
