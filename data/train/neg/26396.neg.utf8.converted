I ordered this sampler along with the "Extra Bold" sampler, which I've already reviewed.<br /><br />This sampler was more disappointing than the other. Very different mix from that advertised. Among my 35 K-cups are 3 that are for ICED coffee - they say "Brew Over Ice." Well, most of us don't have the Keurig that does that. Nothing to do with these but toss them into the trash.<br /><br />Also included without advertisement were 4 that are decaf. That is a major foul, Amazon! Into the trash with those too. So one fifth of these - 7 out of 35 - are completely useless to me.<br /><br />There were 5 teas as opposed to the 3 advertised. Fortunately, I do like a variety of teas.<br /><br />Among the other coffee K-cups, most were included on the list on the product page, but some were not. Not a big deal. A sampler is a sampler.<br /><br />But I think Amazon should state the apparent truth on these pages: These "Crazy Cups" samplers are probably a way for Amazon to recoup losses when someone returns an opened package of K-cups, or they have boxes that are damaged, or whatever. They just count them out and toss them into a carton at random, and ship it. It's not a genuine retail product.<br /><br />Not bad if you haven't tried a lot of different K-cup varieties and just want a bunch of different ones to check out, but don't expect an exact match to what's listed on the product page. I will say, this assortment had zero duplications, whereas the "Extra Bold" sampler (MUCH of which was not extra bold) had 3 of one variety, and many duplications. However, if I ordered the same samplers again, I wouldn't expect them to match up much at all with the previous purchases. I really think this is just Amazon's ways of getting rid of hurts and returns, and you get what you get.<br /><br />By the way, "frustration-free" packaging just means Amazon is being cheap. Throw stuff into a box loose and stick a piece of tape on it. It was NOT frustration-free, because it had a shipping label that has the packing slip stuck to the back of it. It had "tear here first" tear strips that do not come off, so no access to the packing slip without tearing it up.<br /><br />I'm editing this to add that I have just noticed that another reviewer said that as of 12/31/11, Amazon was sending these in nice giftable boxes. NOT anymore as of 1/6/12. Just a plain shipping carton, with loose K-cups. DO NOT expect something you can present as a gift without some creative repackaging of your own, and if you don't mind giving some K-cups that look pretty beat up.
