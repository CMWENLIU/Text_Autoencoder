Go with Simply Heinz Ketchup not these packs its the best ketchup with real sugar. No poisons like HFCS.<br /><br />HFCS.. Here's why it's far more dangerous to your health than table sugar<br /><br />High fructose corn syrup is a popular sweetener because it is chemically different from sugar ,it has a longer shelf life and mixes better into beverages. Yet the corn industry likes to downplay these differences, pointing out that sugar is 50 percent fructose and 50 percent glucose, while HFCS is 55 percent fructose and 45 percent glucose.<br /><br />This framing glosses over an essential difference: sugar (sucrose) is a disaccharide composed of a single glucose molecule and a single fructose molecule. HFCS, in contrast, is a liquid solution composed of separated individual glucose and fructose molecules (monosaccharides).<br /><br />To make HFCS, a 100 percent glucose solution is converted via enzymes into a 42 percent fructose-58 percent glucose solution. This solution is further treated until it is 90 percent glucose, then mixed with more 42-58 solution to yield a 55-45 concentration. So while the final ratio of fructose to glucose might look similar to table sugar, it is in fact a very different product. Is it any wonder that HFCS is processed differently by the body?
