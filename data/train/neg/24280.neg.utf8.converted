Let me get this out of the way:  Amazon shipped this to me quick and did a great job so this review is not their fault.<br /><br />I grew up in the UK and still have family that lives there that will send over Alpen Original whenever they can.  I had no idea until last week that you could even purchase Alpen in the US.<br /><br />I read the reviews and everyone says "this is great - just like I remembered".  Perhaps these people are used to the Canadian/North American version of this but let me assure you that this is NOT like the UK.<br /><br />This version is more like rasin bran + muesli. It has bran flakes and a different consistency.  It's not bad per se but just not at all what I expected.  The UK version is closer to oatmeal and muesli together.  This version doesn't soak up the milk quite the same but it does stay crunchier.<br /><br />Perhaps its always been this way but I won't be ordering this version anymore and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for the UK version.
