I used mot of the bottle on my small front lawn.<br />It did no good at all.<br />No rain that night still the next day my neighbors small dog wandered all over my lawn and yes left that nasty stuff some of you may like<br />as fertilizer.<br />Do not waste your money on this , I already got a refund at Lowes<br />for my purchase.
