Well just received my Jamaican coffee.  The aroma upon opening bag was incredible!  It permeated the house! Brewed some using a French press.  I immediately noticed a nice buttery smooth full body taste but the more I drank it the more I noticed this slight burnt after taste.  The coffee was supposed to be a medium roast.  All I can say is for my taste preference a medium-dark roast is a little bit to strong for me. It unsettled my stomach,  I could not even finish my cup of coffee.  O well I guess its back to "Country Traders" Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee!.
