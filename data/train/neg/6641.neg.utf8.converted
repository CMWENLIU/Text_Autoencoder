After trusting in this product and brand I was very angry when I found out it was labeled Organic while the can is laced with BPA. I emailed the company and got a statement saying the FDA recognizes BPA as being safe.<br /><br />I was so discusted with there response the wording was cold and filled with Corprate mumbo jumbo and not<br />at all consumer friendly.<br /><br />I will be sticking to glass jars from now on.
