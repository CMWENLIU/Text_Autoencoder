I wish I would have read the return policy before I bought the beans. NO RETURNS & the coffee was terrible. The beans looked old and dried out. Coffee was weak & not very rich in flavor. I read other reviews and it sounded great. I use a french press and used the same amount of coffee as I do with any other espresso that I buy and it is no where near the same. Tried adding more coffee and still was not good. now i have a couple pounds of beans.....guess I will donate them to the free store or to someone that is use to automatic drip
