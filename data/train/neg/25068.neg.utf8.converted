I ordered 2 packs of the Tassimo Gevalia Caramel Macchiato. As stated in the description of the item, ONE package contains 8 servings, which is 16 discs. HOWEVER, of those 16 discs, half of them are the latte creamers. If I am ordering 16 T-discs of the Caramel Macchiato, I should receive 16 of the actual coffee flavor AND 16 of the creamer that comes with it! I should have received FOUR packages total; I only got ONE! After shipping I was charged a grand total of $44.49, which is a whopping $5.56 per serving! On the actual company website ONE package (what I got) costs ONLY $10.99!!!!!!!!!! THE SELLER IS CHEATING YOU IF YOU BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!! I WANT THE REST OF MY ORDER!<br /><br />[...]<br />^ LINK TO THE ACTUAL WEBSITE!!!! READ THE DETAILS!
