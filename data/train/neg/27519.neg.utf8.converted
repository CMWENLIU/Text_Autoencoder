I did indeed get 91 assorted coffees and what might be a limited edition print but the packaging was atrocious.  The box was a plain cardboard box & it looked like they had just dumped all the coffee from damaged boxes into a bin and had counted out 91 k-cups into the first box they had found handy. (At least the selection seemed extensive.)  The tube with the print was so stiff that I couldn't get the print out. Since this was the last one in this shipment I sincerely hope that there was a shipping accident at the vendor's and they chose to send something rather than cancel an order and the one that I ordered as a gift went out in a proper box.
