This is more a review on the packaging, than the product.  When this was received the edge of the wrapper was torn along the top of the Reese's cup (keep in mind each cup is 1/2 a pound so they are large).  I think that this was due being delivered in an envelope and not a box. There was not adequate protection and when anything came into contact with the envelope it also came into contact with the product inside and therefore tore the package along the top edge of the Reese's cup.  I have requested a return label and I was told I would not be charged for the return, so at least that is one positive aspect of this situation.
