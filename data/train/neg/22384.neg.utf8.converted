I read a similar review saying that the person had received an unmarked box with the 24 packets and that there was no expiration date and it was gritty/of a weird texture, but I figured it would just be the luck fo the draw. This came to me and the packets are completed separated into oil/nuts and you can't even mix them. I cant even get it out of the package. They're basically inedible, and not creamy and soft like the samples I received directly from Barney Butter which is what I was hoping for. I basically have to just throw these out.
