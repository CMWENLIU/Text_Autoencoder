I am very unhappy that Canidae did not mention the formula change. My Pomrerain has lost 1/3 of his weight since the last bag I bought. I had noticed the color in the food looked lighter but than he got diarrhea and now has been diagnosed with diabetes. He had been doing very well since I had put him on Canidae Platinum 2 1/2 years ago until this change.I know he is an older dog but I thought I was giving him some of the best food for him.<br />Hopefully not many people have had to experience this with their dogs.<br />I know the diabetes may not be due to the food but the diarrhea ???<br />I had my kittens ,now cats, on Felidae but now I will consider another brand. The bag got smaller but the price stayed the same and I do not want them getting sick also.
