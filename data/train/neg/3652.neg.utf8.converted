Until this year, these chocolates were the best.  Kirkland (Costco) has substitutes most of the chocolates with cheaper chocolates.  These are not gourmet chocolates anymore. I won't be buying these anymore.  The countries listed need to be revised.  United States is now one of the chocolate producers.  I'm guessing they are the cheaper, less tasty ones.  Oddly, Switzerland chocolates are last on the list, or the least amount you will get.<br />P.S.  These are only $9.99 at Costco.
