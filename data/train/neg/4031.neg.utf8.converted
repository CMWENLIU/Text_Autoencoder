The only reason this product got a 1 star is I can't give it a 0! The picture and product info lead me to believe I will be getting a plant, I received a seed, one seed and it did not grow. I do read the reviews, and then tend to temper my decisions based on whether or not I am willing to take the risk. However, when  see 1 review I think okay maybe a bad purchase. I chose to make my decision and purchased the "magic can". Shame on me, I have now decided to add my review in the hopes that the next buyer will save themselves some headache. The item has not produced a plant of any kind,and I have waited almost a month now. The growing medium is nothing I have ever seen before, sparkles and fluff, and one little seed inside the can. The whole experience was a dud.
