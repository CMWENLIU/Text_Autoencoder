I was expecting great things because of 1) price and 2) Omaha Steaks name.  This product did not live up to expectations.<br /><br />Chicken breast size is nice and cooks up well, but the artichoke parmesan oozes out during cooking and makes a mess.  Most all of the stuffing oozes out and leaves a bland (and horribly expensive) chicken breast.<br /><br />Omaha Steaks offers the Chicken Cordon Bleu which is better for both the tastebuds and wallet.
