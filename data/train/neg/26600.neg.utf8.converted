Japanese green tea has a cleaner, grassier flavor than the Chinese variety.  You don't get as much tea for the money with this one as the less expensive brands, and I find the flavor to be too subtle.  But after reading about the potential dangers of fluoride in green teas, especially the non-organic and Chinese varieties, I will try to stay with this kind, which is said to have a lower level of the carcinogen.  The Tazo China Green Tips green tea has a stronger flavor I prefer, but is said to have a high(er) level of fluoride.  I figure going organic AND Japanese Sencha will reduce my exposure to a degree.  The plastic cover on each teabag is hard to tear without also ripping the delicate bag inside.  Perhaps they should look at the way other brands encase their bags.  The company could reduce the amount of packaging as well by reducing the size of the outer box, which is bigger than it really needs to be.<br /><br />Addendum: After a couple of months of trying this tea, I've knocked off two stars.  I find this one just lacks flavor, and I've wasted about a half-dozen bags that tore open while I tried to open the wrapper, no matter how careful I was.  You should be able to tear open the wrappers, but even if I cut them open, some bags were adhered to the inside of their wrapper and tore open when pulled out. The wrappers are tough plastic and the bags are very delicate. And the strings come off easily, especially while steeping in hot water.  We won't be buying it again.
