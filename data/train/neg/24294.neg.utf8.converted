Fancy Feast Fish & Shrimp once was the number one favorite in our multiple cat household, but no longer.  As a matter of fact, our cats are walking away from most of the Fancy Feast selections they used to gobble up, returning to eat their food as a last resort only if we don't have fresh turkey or chicken to give them.  What has changed about the recipe, and can we expect it to return to its original formula in the future?  We're searching now for a replacement.
