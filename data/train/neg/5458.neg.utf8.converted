I bought these looking for a healthy alternative to fruit roll-up type snacks, and they are insomuch that healthy means they dont poison you, however they have nothing to offer more than a heaping 15g of sugar (half a soft drink), more or less the same taste for each flavor, little to no nutritional value (being mostly apple juice), and all that at $.66 a piece. Not a big deal given that there are no real alternatives, except wait, they taste exactly like prunes, which have 10x less sugar, alot of nutritional value, and cost about a 1/3 of the price of this pathetic attempt of pushing empty sugar on kids under the guide of being healthy organic food.<br /><br />Clif Co. stooped to the level of major corporations and attempted to manipulate its customers through deceptive marketing practices. They have certainly lost my business.
