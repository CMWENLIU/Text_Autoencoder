FYI... When Amazon is having a 'hot fire' sale on Grocery products, BEWARE! They are simply trying to rid themselves of old inventory. This has happened to me twice and I'm just starting to catch on. This is a snack for babies/children and I wonder how Amazon expects a child, who may be eating this for the first time at five or six months, food that is nearing its expiration date.<br /><br />Amazon as an aside, if you continue the practice of selling products nearing their expiration date without giving customers the option of returning them, you are toying with a class action lawsuit. #JustSaying
