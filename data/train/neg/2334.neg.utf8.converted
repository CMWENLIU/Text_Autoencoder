This tastes like sweetened lemonade that has been heated up and heavily doused with ginger.  There is more sweetness than tartness to the lemon portion, and the ginger is very strong.  It makes your whole mouth and throat tingle.  I really was not impressed with this hot drink.  I'd much rather drink an herbal lemon tea or  ginger tea, but not this.  I couldn't even finish the cup, and no one else in the family would try it either.  The combination of its muddy tan color and its smell turned them off.  On a positive note, the powder completely and quickly dissolved in the hot water.
