Why do they taste so salty? Because they are packed with salt: 230 grams of sodium (that's 9% of your recommended daily value!!) in four not-that-huge crackers. That's just silly (oh, and unhealthy).<br /><br />Years ago, these were my favorite graham crackers. Then, Mi Del reformulated them and made them oddly lemony and salty. I can not eat even one!<br /><br />There are better whole wheat crackers out there. For example, Health Valley Crackers, Graham Amaranthtaste better and are lower in sugar, not to mention sodium, too.<br /><br />P.
