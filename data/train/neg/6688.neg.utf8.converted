Disappointing! This purchase was a container of six packages of cookies.  One of the packages had not been wrapped/sealed in cellophane at the Crimbles factory.  The cookies were completely uncovered.  They were as hard as rocks, very stale, and had been exposed to who knows what.  Obviously not safe to eat; I had to throw the pack away.
