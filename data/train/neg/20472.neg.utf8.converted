I know this is totally a personal taste thing, but I simply cannot stand this stuff. The flavour of the spices and tea is extremely weak, I can barely make anything out past a very vague bit of tea taste. And to boot, it's disgustingly sweet (and I have a sweet tooth: I like pops, fruit juices, etc.). The drink leaves a terrible thick sensation in my mouth and an aftertaste that doesn't soon go away, and becomes difficult to even swallow after a few sips. The feeling in my mouth and throat after consuming a glass of it was not a good one in any way.<br /><br />I prepared it to instructions and included exactly the suggested amount of milk, and I tried again with the same result. It's not user error.
