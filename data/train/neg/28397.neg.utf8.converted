I have ordered Starbucks Espresso Dark Roast Coffee Pods from Starbucks through Amazon in the past and the coffee is delicious! When Starbucks was out of the coffee pods, I ordered it from the Amazon vendor Nicorazz. What I received from them was a product over one year past the sell-by date. In an email answer to my complaint, they snidely told me that the information was on the order before I purchased it. I went back to the item and it's true, the information is there and I overlooked it. If you read it, however, they attempt to convince you that nothing is wrong with selling it long after the sell-by date. Don't believe them! The coffee tastes like dishwater. In all fairness to them I guess, they offered to refund my money minus shipping if I would send it back. They'll just sell it to some other poor sucker, so I'll toss it and feel better about the coffee not going to anyone else. You just lost a customer, Nicorazz.
