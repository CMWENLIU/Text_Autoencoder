Since I read how great the English Toffee tasted, thats the flavor I chose.  It does sweeten my coffee but the flavor of the english toffee isnt that great. I will probably end up throwing it out because why drink something you dont enjoy.  I would like to try the orange or chocolate but am afraid it will be a waste of money like the english toffee. I personally wouldnt recommend it.
