I find that these travel-sized "flavor enhancers" are a mixed bag. Some, such as "Mio" Sweet Tea and "Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch" are pretty good for what they are. However, most are just either bland or too artificial-tasting for my palate. Unfortunately, "Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Blackberry Pomegranate", falls into the latter category, somehow managing to taste bland and artificial-tasting, all in one felled swoop.<br /><br />In all, there are far better drink alternatives out there. Avoid.
