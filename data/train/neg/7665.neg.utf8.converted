I've tried all of the St. Dalfour Gourmet on the Go entrees, and I find this one to be the second to worst. The worst is the Couscous. I am giving this entree two stars instead of one because it is a very healthy choice - whole grains and beans. It may have potential if you add in some of your favorite ingredients and toss.
