I was a Blue Buffalo advocate from day one when I purchased it for my dog.  The ingredients were fantastic for a pet-parent who's dog is allergic to anything with corn or chicken (which is hard to find).  I'm a trainer at Petsmart and told all of my clients about this product.  This was before I had to deal with their customer service department.  On my way home from work one night I realized I needed to stop and get a bag so I swung by a Complete Petmart and picked up a bag.  I got home and realized it had been expired for almost a year.  On the bag it said they guarantee their product 100% and this guarantee means they will tell you to take it back to the store and exchange it and that it was your fault that you didn't look at the expiration date.  Why did I have to do the leg work for someone who is paid to check the dates?  In my Petsmart, Blue Buffalo has a store rep who is supposed to be rotating product and she visits every week.  How is this my responsibility?  They kept sending harassing e-mails and would never really answer my question as to why the store representative let a bag of what is supposed to be a high-quality brand sit there expired for almost a year.  I have since switched my dog to Evo and happy to report his stools are much more solid and he absolutely loves it.  I'm sad the customer service for this company doesn't exist because I truly believed in their product.  The only reason it got 1 star is because the first ingredient is actual meat and not a meal.
