I thought this was a great deal when I purchased this item a few weeks ago. So far, I have opened 2 out of the 5 boxes and more than half of the cereal is crushed and not edible (unless you like it that way).  I also bought the chocolate Special K cereal and the same problem so I assume it has to do with the shipping.<br /><br />It's a shame because the big bite size is rarely on sale like the small bite kind so I jumped on this price. Considering you are only getting half the cereal it turned out to be a bust.
