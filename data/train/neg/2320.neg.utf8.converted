Let me start with a positive.... Amazon saved a lot in shipping with these syrups.  If you order directly from the manufacturers web site, you will probably pay twenty dollars or more in shipping which is outrageous!  Now the negatives...  I was born and raised in Hawaii and the delicious shave ice there is a common treat, much like ice cream in the continental US.  Sorry, but these syrups barely taste like the ones in Hawaii.  I sampled the cherry and it tasted very much like cherry cough syrup, yuck!  But that's not what really ticked me off.  Looking at the ingredients listed on the bottle, instead of cane sugar (which Hawaii used to produce and distribute in abundance), the second main ingredient listed after water is high fructose corn syrup.  Double yuck!  I'll stick with the Davinci syrups which use cane sugar and to me and my kids, taste a lot better.  This company needs to rethink it's ingredients, especially when they claim they use quality ingredients.
