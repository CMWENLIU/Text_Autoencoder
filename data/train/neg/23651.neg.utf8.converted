My family has celiac disease and we were thrilled when a major company came out with a gluten-free version of their cakes.  However, Betty Crocker's GF chocolate cake was not very good.  The best gluten-free chocolate cake we've ever tried is the Gluten-Free Pantry's Decadent Chocolate Cake Mix.  No comparison.  Betty Crocker's had an "off" taste and nobody would finish it.  I can serve the Gluten-Free Pantry's cake to everyone and nobody suspects it's gluten-free.  Very disappointed in Betty Crocker.
