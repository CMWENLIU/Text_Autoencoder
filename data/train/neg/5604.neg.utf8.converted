I wanted to "test" order this item before I bought several and have them shipped as gifts, and good thing I did, because the cookies came in crumbs.  Although the box is a metal box and came un-bumped, 1/3 of the cookies inside were broken to pieces.  Others were broken in half.  For $25, the galettes became very expensive crumbs that can only be used as a crust.  Expensive crust...  Wishing I could upload the pictures of the state of the cookies.  It's probably not a packing issue as much as a systemic problem.  Broken pieces/crumbs tasted great though.  I guess I'll be looking for alternative gifts now.
