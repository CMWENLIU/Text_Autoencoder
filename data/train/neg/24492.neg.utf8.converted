My prior two failed traps: the WHYTR-BB8 W-H-Y Trap for Wasps, Hornets and Yellow Jackets and the Victor Poison-Free M370 Yellow Jacket Magnet Disposable Bag Trap both ended without success and both left me red and swollen.  Once I was able to move again I took a trip to the hardware store and purchased the Safer Brand Deluxe Yellow Jacket/Wasp Trap, since it was the only product on the shelf that I had not purchased.<br /><br />Strike three!  This thing didn't work for me either.  I followed the instructions and filled it with grape juice (apple didn't work in previous attempts) and set the bait up.  I gotta say, of the three traps I used, this one has the stinkiest bait.  I hung it on a tree and waited three weeks.<br /><br />After three weeks I checked it and nothing, NOTHING was floating in this little plastic coffin.  I was so mad that I took a baseball bat and knocked the trap right off of my tree, spraying my grill with bait.  If you've read my other reviews, then I'm sure you know what follows next....<br /><br />Yup, raccoon attack.  I know, completely predictable right?  Unfortunately for me, I like to have a midnight burger.  Meat in hand, I sauntered out to the grill at 10 past midnight.  I felt confident that, since it was night time, and wasps are not active at night, that I could use the grill despite not having washed the bait off.  I popped the top of the grill and was confronted by a 20 pound raccoon, no wait, it must have been a 300 pound mutant raccoon... yeah, that's it....  I dropped my meat and turned to run.  As I sprinted right into my reinforced sliding glass door (I bounced off of it) the raccoon reared up and launched itself at me.  Before a passed out I saw its little beady eyes peering down at me.<br /><br />I woke up the next morning completely naked and covered in raw meat.  My wife claims that there was no raccoon, and that I was acting out some strange fantasy... but I know the truth...
