I am a HUGE fan of miso soup.  I've tried many of the instant miso soups thanks to my asian market.  Kikkoman's Instant Miso is by far the best soup out there.  It's the closest you can get to the "real" thing without actually making the soup yourself.<br />However, this company is selling it at a ridiculous price!  I've purchase the EXACT same thing at Walmart for $1.99/package (which comes out to $0.67 per packet).  This company is trying to sell them for over $3 per package (or over a $1 per packet!) - not even including shipping.  I'd do my homework and buy elsewhere because this company seems to specialize in rip-offs.
