First of all, the palak paneer we're served in Indian restaurants in USA doesn't taste half as delicious as that served in restaurants in India. So when I buy frozen palak paneer in USA I'm not expecting much but Tandoor Chef Palak Paneer is so very disappointing! It is extremely bland and has a plasticky aftertaste to it which is surprising because their kofta curry (that comes with spinach pilaf and channa masala)is pretty good. I'm going to stick to the channa masala/kofta curry from now onwards.
