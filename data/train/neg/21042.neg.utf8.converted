The ingredient tab on the product page doesn't show what is in this cappuccino.  The very first ingredient when I got my order and reviewed it was trans fat, and not just a little.  This stuff will clog your arteries.  I wouldn't have purchased this had the product info been shown.  I didn't know they still used this stuff.  New York outlawed the stuff and the FDA explicitly makes manufactures show this ingredient.  Shame on Amazon for not displaying this.  I did order addition K-cup coffee. I"ll return them.
