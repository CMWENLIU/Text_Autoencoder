Not a fan of this at all.  I used the sugar free cake (not as good as the real thing as it's more spongy but still tastes ok) and the sugar free icing.  The icing is awful! It's very chemical tasting as some sugar free items tend to be. I'm surprised too as I love splenda and use it daily.  Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this at all.  I'm going to give the low sugar one a try and hope for the best.
