There must have been something out of the norm with the two I received. The texture was simply rubbery and I could not taste a single trace of "sea salt, coriander, spices, mustard, black pepper, paprika, or herbs". I looked at the date and it was fine. I tried the other stick and it was the same. Compared to the photo though the color of mine were brown but the package was sealed tight. I'm truly bummed. There are just no other options for beef sticks with high quality ingredients.
