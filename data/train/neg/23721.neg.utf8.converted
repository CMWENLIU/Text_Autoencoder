I hate to give a bad review since I have no idea if it actually works to improve milk production (which is why I purchased it). I just feel the need to share that I took one dose and experienced a fairly severe allergic reaction. It was 2am and I went online and discovered that fenugreek is in the same plant family as peanuts (and chickpeas). This is not marked anywhere on the label, on Amazon's page, or on Nature's Way's website.
