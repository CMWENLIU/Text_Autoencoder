Last month after my local pet store ran out of the Cosmic cat grass my cats had long been using to fight off hairballs,  I came here to Amazon, found two products that looked interesting and bought  one of each.  I had very disappointing luck with this one.  I  read the instructions and followed them clearly, paying particular attention to keeping the soil moist and warm and the light dim until germination. I used an 8-inch garden pot and the same Miracle Grow potting soil that had worked wonders in my outdoor garden pots.  But the results were disappointing.  All I got were a scattered few strands of grass.  A  second attempt, using more seeds and a different, smaller pot netted the same meager results.<br /><br />Meanwhile my other purchase, the Pet Greens Garden Wheat Grass Self-Grow Kit--which came with similar instructions, but  its own soil, disposable planter pouch and far fewer seeds at twice the price--produced a veritable thicket of grass that kept  growing and growing and, despite daily grazings from three cats,  lasted  five full weeks.<br /><br />I still have some Nibble-Licious seeds left, so would gladly appreciate comments from those of you who've had good results with  this product on what you did right that I may have done wrong and how to fix it.<br /><br />\<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006348H2">Pet Greens Garden Wheat Grass Self-Grow Kit</a>
