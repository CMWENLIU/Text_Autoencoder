i really loved the picture and the items but when i got em i was deffently shocked it is not worth the price maybe $20-$25 bucks at the most.the box paper was comming off when i got it a piece was ripped and the box was half filled with red paper so you got the same amount of paper and candy lol the goods inside wernt very impressive either they were like dollar candy couldnt been more then 10 bucks at the most.im not a picky person but i was very dissapionted and im not recoming this to you to buy also the picture shows more then 3 boxs i only got 3  thanks
