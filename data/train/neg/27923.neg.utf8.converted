The bars arrived from 'Indian Foods' in Houston today.  They are all melted and hardened into lumps!  I know its hot in Houston in the summer but to send out a product like this does not do Amazon's reputation any good at all.  I DO NOT recommend buying this product from Amazon if the supplier cannot supply a decent product. I will attempt to be reimbursed by Amazon for this product.<br /><br />Went back to Amazon who referred me to the seller.  Money refunded with good will and personal recommendation to not buy during hot weather.  Good advice and, since I want my Lion Bars, will reorder when the weather cools.  The supplier seems a very decent and ethical person with whom I'll be doing business in the future..
