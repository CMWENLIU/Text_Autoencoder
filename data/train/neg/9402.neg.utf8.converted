These are not what I was expecting. They don't taste like any unsulfered apricots I've ever eaten before. Their texture is strange, too. They're soft and squishy, and not very chewey, which is what I'm used to.  Most importantly, they smell and taste awful.  Amazon doesn't accept returns on Grocery items, so it's money down the drain for me.
