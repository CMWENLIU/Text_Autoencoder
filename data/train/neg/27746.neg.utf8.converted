I buy and eat a lot of almomds. I make almond milk and almond butter. I usually buy almonds from the produce section in Walmart. Walmart almonds are always fresh. Many times Walmart doesn't have them in the produce section because they sell out. These almonds are soft and do not taste fresh. The almond butter doesn't have a good flavor when I use these.I'll stick with Walmart and will not be ordering these again.
