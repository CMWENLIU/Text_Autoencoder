I thought that this was natural energy from the vegetables, but it has green tea in it.  Anytime something has green tea, that means that it's loaded with caffeine.  They almost got me but thank god that I read the ingredient cafefully.  The energy is not coming from the vegetables.  The energy is coming from the caffeine.  What a waste!  I want natural energy.  I'll just stick to my alkalized raw food diet.
