I really loved the Mio line.  Tried most of the flavors, liked most of them.  REALLY loved the Blueberry Lemonade.  Was great in water, but also in mixed drinks at Happy Hour.  Unfortunately, after about 5 months of regular use, I finally noticed a correlation between fits of explosive diarrhea and Mio usage.<br /><br />I searched online, and I'm not alone. It seems to affect lots of folks this way.  Most seem to believe it's due to the Propylene Glycol in it... basically the same stuff that's in anti-freeze.  The body can't absorb it, and it's a slick oily-feeling liquid, so it triggers a very negative reaction in most.  Since many things in modern diets cause a similar reaction, it might go unnoticed for quite a while.<br /><br />But when I stopped, the difference was amazing.<br /><br />so... sorry Mio.  So good, but not worth the emergencies.
