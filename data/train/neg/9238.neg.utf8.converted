I don't know if it increased my milk supply because it was so disgusting that I could only stomach it a few times.  I suppose if you are desperate, but I would go with the fenugreek and blessed thistle  pills.  You have to take a lot of the pills, like 9 per day but at least I could manage to take the pills.  This stuff I had to force myself to drink, and it smells awful too.
