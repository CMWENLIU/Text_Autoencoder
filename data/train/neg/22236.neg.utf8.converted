<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025VF8OA">Snow's New England Clam Chowder, Ready to Serve, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> VERY UNHAPPY! Snows Ready to Serve WAS the best. Now that bumbule bee has taken over it is a watery disapointment. Just think of BUM and go no further. If they go back to the original let me know, otherwise FORGET IT!
