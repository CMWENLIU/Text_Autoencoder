I was surprised when I tasted this tea for the first time, I thought I would love this combination but all I tasted was a fake orange taste.  No chocolate, no green tea, just a acid orange taste.  Then I tried another tea bag and I got the same taste.  I did not like the taste and I would not recommend this tea to any one, sorry.
