I recently purchased two boxes of twinkies from American to be sent to Australia.<br />Firstly they did not arrive within the time frame that was given to me (6 days after maximum date), even though I paid for express post.  I was also not informed that they would be out of date by the time they would arrive here in Australia.  When I opened them they had sweated inside the bag so they were soggy.  Unfortunately it was a complete waste of money, never again!!
