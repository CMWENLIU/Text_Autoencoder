I was so happy to see a k-cup variety of most of the flavors I would be interested in trying.  I was lead to believe what was posted in the description would be what I would receive.  From the description it said you would receive 25 different flavors.  What was received was 80% of coffee from Green Mountain in only 3 flavors and I received flavors that were not advertised like Limited Edition Gingerbread and Pumpkin.  I understand not all of what was advertised would be available but when I go to my local grocery store or WALMART I see Hazelnut Decaf and Kahlua, of which I received not ONE in my order. In fact, not one DECAFE was added to my order, which was expected.  If I wanted what I received I would have purchased the variety pack from the local Bed Bath and Beyond.  In addition, the packaging looked as if I took home something from my local market,stuffed in a brown paper bag and stapled closed. Please be aware what you see is NOT what you get. I am so disappointed with this seller I feel that AMAZON should put a process in place to limit a seller who has a bait and switch like this.  SELLERS should be more wary not to take advantage of their bread and butter..."THE CUSTOMER"!
