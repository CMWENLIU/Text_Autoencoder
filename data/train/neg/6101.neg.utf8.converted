Neither of my two cats would eat these treats. In fact, neither of my dogs would eat them either-- and they're willing to eat the occasional "cat cookie"! I looked on the package and it looks like the main ingredient is corn meal. These treats look and smell like cheap dog food, not fish. The scent is not at all appealing. So basically I paid for an overpriced 3 oz. bag of corn meal based pet food and now I'm stuck with a bag because none of my four pets will eat it.
