I didn't find much in the way of the tofu bits that make many brands of miso soup interesting (yes I know they don't all contain that) and very little seaweed.. it was just this super dark murky watery stuff.  Mine tasted strongly like smoke and a weird chemical taste.  Bleh.  We poured it out.  To be fair I picked it up at a local supermarket, not here and it was not cheap.
