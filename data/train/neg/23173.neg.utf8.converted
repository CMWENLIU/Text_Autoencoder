There are two different types of Chocolate Chex cereal. The pictures on the front of each one is different.  There is this picture and the other one has woman raising a bowl in the air.  Even though this box of Chex Chocolate cereal indicates it is the same as the other box, the recipes for each one.  For instance, this Chocolate Chex uses molasses and the other one uses brown sugar.  There are a couple of other ingredients that are different, but I don't remember what they are.  The appearance and taste of the two cereals are different.  I DO NOT LIKE THE CEREAL WITH MOLASSES IN IT.  I LOVE the cereal with brown sugar.<br /><br />So this is a cautionary tale that just because the boxes say they contain the same cereal, make sure to compare ingredients to be sure.
