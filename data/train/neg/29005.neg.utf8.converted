It is advertised as the original 10 calorie Propel Fitness Water, but it's only Propel ZERO! If you don't know, Propel Zero is disgusting and leaves a very bad artificial sweetner in your mouth!!! Not to mention you can get this exact water at your local supermarket for a third the cost. I only paid such an outrageous price because I thought I was getting the hard to find (and discontinued) Propel original recipe!!! I have been robbed, but I will fight back! The economy is too bad to let people like this rip you off!
