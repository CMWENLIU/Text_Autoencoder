I've purchased the 3 types of treats thru Subscribe and Save.  They are no longer supplied by Amazon and I am not surprised. You can still obtain them from other vendors on Amazon.  Be aware they look nothing like the product pictured. The quality has deteriorated and is now poor at best. The apple treats are now nickel sized pieces of apple(more like little sponges)and the chicken strip around the apple is nearly black in color. It is beyond hard. Whats with this?  The ingredients state this is supposed to be chicken breast!  BEWARE-THESE TREATS ARE MADE IN CHINA!!  I cringe to think what may have been substituted.<br /><br />There was no notice by Amazon that these came from China-known for manufacturing deadly dog products.  I would never have purchased them. I suggest you don't either.  My dog no longer eats them.  I have nearly $100 of product.  I can't with a good conscience donate these to the animal shelter or even toss them out for the crows. Inquire as to the country of origin before you buy - "distributed by" doesn't count.  There are many other safe and healthy treats available and they proudly state 'made in America'!
