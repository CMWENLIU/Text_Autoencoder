<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PUS2BY">Paskesz Candy, Fizzers, 3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a><br />I recently had Fizzer candies from the UK and bought these thinking they were like them. I was so excited to see a U.S. company had them because to purchase them from the UK the shipping is more than the candy. Unfortunately, they aren't the same, they remind me more of Smarties and while I like Smarties I can get them without ordering on-line.  I wish there would have been a cheaper way to find out these weren't what I was looking for.<br />If you need Kosher food item's these may be worth it but if you are looking for Fizzer candies don't bother.
