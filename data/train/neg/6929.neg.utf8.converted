"Pignolia" generally refers to pine nuts from the Stone Pine.  The nuts from this tree are superior in their taste and health benefits to other pine nuts.  The packaging here seems intended to make the buyer think they're getting Italian Stone Pine nuts, but they're not; they're Chinese pine nuts, which tend to be blander in taste and to have fewer health benefits.
