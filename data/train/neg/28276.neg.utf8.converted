I love the Shea Moisture products so I saw this labeled Shea hair oil and said why not give it a try.<br /><br />Unfortunately the first ingredient listed in this is Mineral Oil which I'm sure most people know is not good for your hair. Suffice to say that I didn't bother trying it.<br /><br />Shame on you for labeling this the way you did. Why not call it Ultra Mineral Oil...
