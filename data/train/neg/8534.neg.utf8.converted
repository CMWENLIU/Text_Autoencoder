UPDATE: I can't drink this stuff! I have tried to bear it but the more I drink it the worst it tastes. Please don't buy if you're sensitive to flavor (for example, if you know for a fact that Starbuck's green tea frappuccinos are better than Jamba's slimy MATCHA shakes, hehe).<br /><br />I don't like the fact that this product has sugar and other stuff mixed in it already because I have to use more to get the flavor I like which by then it is too sweet! It also makes me feel like they are selling me just a little bit of MATCHA with glorified sugar, I can always add my own sugar. The packaging is very unprofessional too, its kind of scary buying food items with unprofessional packaging and labels that look printed at home. For the price, taste, and value I would be better off simply going to the local Japanese food supply shops and picking up little jars of MATCHA. It has been a horrible waste since we don't touch this stuff anymore.
