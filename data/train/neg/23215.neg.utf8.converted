The cans I received were packaged in November of 2007, and expire in November of 2009, about 4-5 months from now.  Since I will only have 1/6 of the shelf life of the cans, I will give them 1/6 of a full positive rating, or one star.  This is a hazard of ordering from Amazon, I guess.  In a store I would have seen that and not bought them.
