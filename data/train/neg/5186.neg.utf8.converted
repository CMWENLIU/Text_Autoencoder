I am not one to usually write reviews, and I usually never have a bad experiance on what I purchse.<br />I'm not writing this to "slam" the Blue Buffalo company,and can't prove that the food I purchased was 100% responsible for my experiance,but here is what happened. I have fed my dog the same food for years. Dog is healthy with no issues. She is getting older and I did some research and decided to get her on a better brand AND figured it was time to switch to "senior" food. I followed the directions and slowly started to mix "Buffalo" with her old food to get her adjusted. Within a few days she started acting odd and had blood in her urine. Took her to the vet, and he said that he has seen this type of food cause the urine to be too acidic and cause an infection. He told me to STOP feeding her "Buffalo" and to go back to old brand. After 1 day of not feeding it to her, and the first day on her round of pills, she is much butter and no more blood in her urine.<br />Like I said... could be totally unrelated, but seems obvious that the problem started within 3 days of feeding this to her, and the problem stopped (per advice of vet) when I stopped feeding it to her.<br />I am writing this to inform you, in case you have the same issue and to hopefully save someone the expense of a vet bill and all the hassle my purchase caused me.
