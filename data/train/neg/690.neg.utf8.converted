My 35-lb dog could not break these treats by chewing on them. She gave up after only a minute or so and decided to look elsewhere for a treat.<br /><br />I was unable to break the treats in two even though they are scored across the middle.<br /><br />My toy breed dog thought it was fun to play with, but he couldn't get much headway trying to chew it either, and never ate it.<br /><br />They need come out with something soft!
