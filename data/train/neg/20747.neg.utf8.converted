I love drinking coffee, Cappuccinos, and even iced coffee. So when I seen the illy issimo coffee drink I just had to get it. The day it arrived in the mail, I was eager to drink it. This had to be the worst coffe drink I had ever had. It tasted like coffee grounds with water, I couldn't even finish the whole drink. I personally wouldn't recommened this drink, but if you're a coffee drinker and like try try new things it doesn't hurt. You may actually enjoy this drink more than I have.
