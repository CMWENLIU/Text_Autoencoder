I expected more Lobster flavor from this Progresso Product and I felt the Lobster flavor was very weak and I didn't see a speck of Lobster meat in the sauce. Although the sauce was good my guests thought that they were eating regular Spaghetti sauce and were not aware that it was a Seafood Sauce. There is a need for improvement.
