I have been drinking Tulsi(Holy Basil) for several years now not only for its wonderful musty, clove-tinged taste(especially blending tulsi with peppermint and stevia) but for its reputed mood stabilizing/adaptogenic qualities (read the book co-authored by David Winston for more info). Many of the usual places I buy tulsi were out so I tried Amazon. I have enjoyed Tao of Tea products in the past but this stuff was garbage. Not only were there a large amount of sticks/stems in the product but the tulsi itself was totally tasteless with a distinct odor that was unlike any tulsi I had ever tried. Even infusing the tea at triple the strength I usually use (1 tbl. per 6 oz of water) did little to improve the weak character of the product. The only thing about my order that was any good was Amazon.com listened to my complaint and sent me out another 1 lb. of this tea no questions asked; unfortunately the second bag was just as lifeless as the first. Worst purchase from Tao of Tea that I ever made.
