I will preface this by saying that I have not tried this coffee.  But the reason I decided not to order is that at 10 grams of coffee per pack and 25 packs per container, it's really expensive.  250 grams =.55 lbs of coffee, which works out to almost $20 per pound. It's a lot cheaper to continue using my Solofill cup to scoop some coffee out of the can.  Just as easy, too!  Solofill cups are great, by the way:-)
