If you do not live somewhere where there is sun everyday of the year, do not get it. 1 day after it arrived, most of the leaves feel out. it was supposed to be a Christmas present and since most of leaves feel out we could not give it away. it was pathetic. it is definitely not worth 60 dollars.<br /><br />we really regret buying this plant.
