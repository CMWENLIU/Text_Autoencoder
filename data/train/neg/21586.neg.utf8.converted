You only know the soul of a company (or a person for that matter) when something goes WRONG. Well there was a mix up on my order. Unfortunately the woman on the phone was unfriendly, accusing and rude! Wow! How can people run a business like this? How can they think it is okay to talk to someone, much less a customer, with such an attitude? Needless to say I did not receive my order in time for my event. It is time to find a different brand of gluten free flours, any ideas?
