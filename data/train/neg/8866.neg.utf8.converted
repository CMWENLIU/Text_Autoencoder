I had mixed results when I planted the seeds (they did sprout but not as fully as I would have liked). I ended up picking up some seeds from a local garden center that ended up working a lot better and being a lot cheaper. In the end I found that my local farmers market has some organic wheat grass I can pick up for $0.99 and get some of that every week. I'd recommend trying to grow a planter of whatever your pet likes best by yourself and just giving them that.
