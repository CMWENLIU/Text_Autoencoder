My friend purchased a 12-pack of the Tangerine-flavored VitaCoco and it was excellent.  Really light flavor, refreshing, perfect bit of citrus.  I decided to try a different flavor, so I bought a 12-pack of the Peach & Mango.  The name sounded appealing - how can anyone mess up peach, I figured.  Let me say this - it is honestly one of the foulest things I've ever tasted.  I cannot articulate the taste because it's so uniquely bad - you will have to try it for yourself (which I don't recommend).  I was able to drink half of one container before pouring the rest out in disgust.  Reminds me of when I was a teenager and I was forcing down my first mixed alcoholic drink and the taste was nearly unbearable.  I had my friend try a container and his was awful, too.  I eventually threw out the remaining 9 cartons (note: I used a 3rd one to trick another friend into trying this repugnant crap as a gag).<br /><br />I don't know if I got a bad batch or if this is how Peach & Mango is supposed to taste but I am thoroughly dissatisfied.<br /><br />Update: it's been months since I wrote this review and I stand by it.  My friend bought a separate batch and the taste was identical.  Peach & Mango is the worst VitaCoco flavor, in my opinion.  Honestly, it's one of the worst beverages I've ever tasted - period - next to a can of unsweetened Oolong tea I purchased at Wegman's.  Maybe it's an acquired taste; unfortunately, it's not one I'll be acquiring at the current price of coconut waters.
