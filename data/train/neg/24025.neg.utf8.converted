I purchased this item to help with bloating and eat it directly from the jar. Product has a strong odor and doesn't seem to be easily edible. There is no significant taste, but it is not something you can just munch on and feel comfortable like sesame seeds for example. Sorry I purchased it, probably it is much more useful as a seasoning.
