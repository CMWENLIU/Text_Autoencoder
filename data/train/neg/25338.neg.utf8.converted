Unfortunately, basically everything in this box was horrible.  The yogurt pretzels were stale, the caramels tasted like chalk, and the popcorn was pretty bad too.  I liked the milk chocolate truffles, but there are only three in this box.  Save yourself some money and trouble and spend it better elsewhere!  (and being a foodstuff, this product cannot be returned!)
