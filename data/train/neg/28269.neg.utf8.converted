With all the natural oils, I thought this would be a great product. Although I am caucasian, my hair is very dry and frizzy. Sometimes oil helps. The dispensing nozzle on this is nice because it allows you to get the product directly on your scalp and not use much. The down side is even if you only use a tiny bit and rinse it out, your hair will be left very oily. I didn't like the greasy hair it left me with at all.
