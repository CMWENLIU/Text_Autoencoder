I have been a consumer of NOW foods goods for at least 20 years and have generally been very satisfied with their products (mostly vitamins or supplements). In fact, I had a previous good experience with this product--raw pumpkin seeds--(received as a gift a couple of years ago) and so I thought that what I was ordering would be very close to the product I had previously experienced: a package of well-proportioned, well-colored (dark green), good-tasting raw pumpkin seeds.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what I received could hardly have been any different:the packages I received (I ordered 8 in total: 2 x Pack of 4)contained many small and broken seeds, and the seeds were pale and as much yellow as green. Worst of all, but unsurprising given their appearance, they do not taste anywhere near what fresh raw pumpkin seeds should taste like and I have had raw pumpkin seeds from many sources over the years so I know what they should taste like. The packaging claims nitrogen flush technology in packing to maintain freshness and the expiration date is a year from now so the packaging presumably is not to blame. The circumstances of this order make it unfeasible for me to return them (they are now several thousand miles away from the US and the postage back would cost more than the product) but had I received them directly from Amazon I most certainly would have sent them back immediately. I can only hope that nutritionally they are uncompromised and that by including them in salads and other dishes I won't be reminded too much of their inferior taste.<br /><br />I recommend that you avoid this product unless you are able to buy it in the store and can see what you are getting.
