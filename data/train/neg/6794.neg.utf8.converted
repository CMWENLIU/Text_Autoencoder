BRS is neither organic, safe for diabetics, nor does it enter the bloodstream slower than other sweeteners.<br /><br />BRS is an entirely man-made food which exists no where in nature. It is made by harvesting enzymes from bacteria, mixing them with ground rice flour, and cooking the mix to simulate the action of salivary and pancreatic amylase. This is EXACTLY the procedure used in laboratories to study the digestion of polysaccharides.<br /><br />The result of this process is a concoction which consists of large amounts (~50%) of maltose and glucose, with a glycemic index of 105 and 100 respectively. Simply ingesting a teaspoon of this stuff will make your face flush with a sugar rush.<br /><br />Under no circumstances should BRS be taken by anyone with diabetes. It will almost certainly result in hyperglycemia. Yes, it tastes good, but so does maple syrup, and that is a MUCH, MUCH better choice for sweetening foods.<br /><br />The primary user for BRS is Cliff Bars. Buyer beware!
