This is by far not worth the money I paid for it. I ordered it as a suprise for my daughter's classroom. It is a plaster like cast with very little detail.  It came late (ordered 10/18, recieved 11/5).  It is damaged (chipped in one corner), dirty (covered with plaster-like dust), and will break the first time it is dropped or bumped.  I probably could've used clay and some plaster to make a cast of simliar quality myself. Don't waste your money!
