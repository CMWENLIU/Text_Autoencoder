I work long hours. Coffee and soda don't agree with me, so I'm always on the lookout for alternative sources of energy. No Fear Energy Drink may work very well--if you can stomach the flavor. It tastes like cherry medicine. If this is what I have to drink to keep up the pace after 10-12 hours, I'd rather stay sluggish. Better to stick with Red Bull or another variety carbonated energy drink.
