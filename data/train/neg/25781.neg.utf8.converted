Cutter 32 oz. Backyard Bug Control Spray Concentrate is no longer effective. I used to be able to spray my yard with this and mosquitoes would disappear for about 10-14 days.<br /><br />Something happened in the last year or so. First, the applicator is terrible. I noticed that the solution doesn't even come out most of the time, only water. I notice that I am spraying my entire yard, but the same level of bug spray is still in the bottle. I tried 3 different bottles and the same thing happened each time. I had to manually open the hole with a stick to get any solution to come out.<br /><br />Even with the hole now slightly open and the solution flowing out, the product flat out does not work. My yard is still infested with mosquitoes after spraying.<br /><br />Will not purchase this again. Now I'm stuck with $30 of spray that doesn't work b/c I don't have my receipt to return them.
