This product was a huge let down. I wanted something I could throw in my purse to have available on busy days. I am a huge miso soup fan, but not overly picky. If it is miso I'm usually happy with it. The first thing I noticed were the onions, they were brown and pathetic looking, like they had been used after they were rotten. The smell of this soup is like nothing I have experienced before it is so off putting I didn't want to try it at first, but I was famished, and only had a 15 minute break in between meetings. I couldn't even swallow it. I would happily starve if it meant I never had to go near this awful stuff again.
