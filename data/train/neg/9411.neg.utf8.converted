This was delivered while the weather was still quite temperate. We brought them in immediately and the package was not warm inside. I can't prove it but I find it hard to believe this was a 2012 product. The cardboard inserts in the packages were soaked with oil. The eggs had obviously melted partially and then cooled.<br /><br />All of the other chocolate candy delivered the same day was fine.<br /><br />Reese's eggs usually have the creamiest filling of any of their products, but these had crunchy crystals within the peanut butter filling.<br /><br />I was disappointed in the quality and if my suspicions were correct and they were sold in this condition, shame on you.
