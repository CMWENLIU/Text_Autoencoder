Disclaimer- my hair is keratin treated and may not be representative.<br /><br />First, I recognize that the shampoo and conditioner claim to make stronger hair in 7 days and that I didn't use it for that time.  But I don't feel that the immediate downsides of this product make trying for a long term benefit a good idea.<br /><br />The bottle arrived open and most of the product was spilled into the bag.  Because it has a pop top it will spill very easily.<br /><br />My hair is fine and quite long (well past the bra line). It is also keratin treated.  Like most people with long hair I care a great deal about it and put quite a bit of effort into it's care.  I was excited to try this product.<br /><br />It lathered up very nicely and smelled good.  My first hint of trouble was that as it rinsed out, my hair was feeling very stripped and was tangling.<br /><br />While this product is meant to be used over time to gain results one of the biggest things to avoid with long hair is dry tangly hair.  It causes immediate damage.
