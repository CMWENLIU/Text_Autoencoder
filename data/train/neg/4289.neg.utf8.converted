The cups are smaller and hold less coffee than the competitors. They also are not airtight so will degrade once the package is opened unless used quickly. But even if used quickly they are weak and watery. Actually, more like dishwater. They should come with a warning label. I would have wanted to know that they were weak and watery by design.
