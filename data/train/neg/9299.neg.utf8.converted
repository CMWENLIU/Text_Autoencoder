Im pretty dissappointed with the Kaps. Ive tried to use them several times and every single time I get a very watery cup of coffee that I end up having to dump down the drain because it tastes so watered-down. Ive tried a few different brands of coffee and all the same. Maybe Im just using the wrong kind of coffee..but I thought the point was that you could use ANY kind that was your favorite. I have not yet found a brand that actually works in here. Its a great idea..but I was expecting a lot more. I feel like I wasted my money because the Kaps are now tucked away in a drawer and I continue to buy the expensive K-cups. Oh well..
