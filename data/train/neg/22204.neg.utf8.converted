Well it looks like Polaner went and ruined a good product with a misguided marketing ploy.<br />They have added 'fiber' to their All Fruit products. The so called fiber come in the form of maltodextrin, the source of which is not specified. In the grape version of "All Fruit" with Fiber, the maltodextrin comes before any of the grape ingredients. This means that there is more maltodwxtrin in the almost "All Fruit" that grapes.<br />To top it off, the flavor has changed, the taste is flat.<br />They have lost me as a customer.
