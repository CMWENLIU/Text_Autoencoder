If you feel compelled to buy this, get it from Whole Foods so you don't waste money buying the 6 pack. Buyer beware that you cannot return many food items. The texture of this after rehydration was like a cellulose sponge.If you must have dehydrated tofu for hiking or camping trips, make your own or buy the tofu in the sealed boxes.  On the flip side, I love many of Eden products but this was a waste of my money.
