I guess I am in the minority, but this hash product tastes like cheap fatty meat and stale potatoes.  It splutters out so much grease while browning that you need to be prepared for a very stinky house and a stove that needs A LOT of 409 to get clean.  Maybe this is a nostalgia food I missed the boat on; I bought a can to try to see if our family wanted to stock some in our emergency food box since I have never had canned hash before.  This roast beef flavor has less salt than all others which is why I bought it, I cannot imagine how salty those must taste. If you like canned hash, listen to the 5 star reviews; if you never had it before, buy one can at the store to try before investing money and pantry space -- I am so glad I did!
