Mighty Leaf have positioned themselves at the high end of the tea bag market, sorry, I mean tea 'pouch' market. They do deliver good teas, but firstly they are extremely expensive - its close to 50c per bag (!)and secondly some flavors have just enough tea in the bag for a single cup, not a one person pot. Ginger Twist is like that, try and make a small pot for one, and you'll end up with flavored water. So what? well any high end tea maker should be aiming for the small pot (a tea pot is essential for quality tea drinking!) and regardless if you agree with that or not, at these prices you simply should be getting enough to make a small pot for one, without using 2 bags.<br /><br />It doesn't apply to all their products, but is something to bear in mind if you want to protect your pocket-book, and favor the teapot over a bag floating in a mug of water.
