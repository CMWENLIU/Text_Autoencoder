I should start off by saying that I have never understood the appeal of artificial chocolate flavoring.  Even when I was a kid and a total junk food junkie, the things that were artificially flavored chocolate always tasted strange.<br /><br />Fast forward to my life as an adult and I find that neither has the technology behind artificial chocolate flavoring improved, nor my opinion of it. It still has a subtle (and sometimes, not-so-subtle) metallic taste and an obvious artificial one. So do many artificial flavorings, but most seem to replicate the real thing about 75-80% of the time. Not so with artificial chocolate.<br /><br />So then, it will come as no surprise that this K-Cup variety is equally disappointing. Imagine the most mass-produced chocolate doughnut with a laundry list of ingredients (and unpronounceable ones at that) and one pretty much has the taste of this coffee flavor---at best.  It's not the worst chocolate flavored coffee I have ever had, but when most are pretty bad, that's not saying much.<br /><br />For the life of me, I can't understand the reviews of other incarnations of this product which claim that it's "like licking the frosting off a chocolate donut" or "tastes like adding chocolate syrup to your coffee". No, and no!  It's also a far cry from "cafe mocha", as well.  Come to my house and I will make you a K-Cup of coffee with real chocolate and you can have a far superior cafe mocha experience.<br /><br />It tastes little like a doughnut, a chocolate doughnut, and nothing like chocolate doughnut glaze and marginally like chocolate at all.  If you are a fan of products from companies like Ghirardelli or Lindt, I will guarantee that you will be disappointed at best and disgusted at worst.<br /><br />I received this flavor as part of a sampler from the manufacturer's [GMCR] mail order program, and fortunately only received one K-Cup, as I would never place a full order for this flavor.  I kept hoping it would get better, but such was not the case. It was all I could do to finish the cup of coffee and not throw it out.
