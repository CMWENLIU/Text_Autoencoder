<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1BM3E">Good Seasons Salad Dressing & Recipe Mix, Mild Italian, 1-Ounce Packets (Pack of 24)</a> This is unbelievable that you folks would ask for a product review. Here's what happened; we ordered this 24 pack and paid the full price plus shipping. When the package arrived it contained only one packet not twenty-four. When we called about this the customer seviceperson stated that there was only one packet in stock. He ageed to credit us the cost of the product but refused to reverse the shipping charge. Apparently that amount is credited to my account against future puchases. Well you can more than likely keep this as we probably will make no further puchases from your company. I cannot believe what a  poor experience this has been! I have passed this experience on to several others and be assured I will continue to do so.
