I rarely review anything with limited time...unless it's either really great or perfectly horrid. Bustelo out of the can is without exception, the very worst coffee I've ever had in my life. I sensed the flavor of dirt off a factory floor with a mild flavor of old dirty cigarettes. This was with filtered water (so no water issues). Maybe I got a bad can, but man, this was rough and acrid stuff. Your mileage may vary...
