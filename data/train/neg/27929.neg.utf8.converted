Sour and bitter.  We were EXTREMELY disappointed by this coffee.  Not sure if Colombian is supposed to be sour and bitter, but this bag carries it to the nth degree, and the bad aftertaste lingers for awhile.  Unfortunatey we have 33-oz, and while normally I can plow through a bad bag so that it doesn't go to waste, I might have to throw this bag away.
