I bought this shortly after I quit drinking regular coke, I obviously knew it wouldn't be the same but expected it to give a bit of satisfaction when I craved soda, Boy was I wrong, this stuff is SWEET I know it's all natural fruit juice and that has sugar but even 28grams seems pretty high for 8 ounces. These taste like drinking a pixie stick, nothing like soda, I ended up giving some to a friend who loves that apple soda thats really sweet and even she said these were much sweeter and not very good. My fault for trusting the reviews and buying a case now I'm slowly forcing myself to drink them so they will be gone !!
