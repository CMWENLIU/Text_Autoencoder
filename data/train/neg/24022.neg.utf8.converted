What a disappointment. I had high hopes for this syrup since I live the Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks lattes. However this is nothing like this. For the reviewers who claim that it was similar to these products, I have no idea what else they added. I tried it with extra sugar, with honey, with whipped cream, extra pumpkin pie spices. Yet nope, still tastes like butternut squash. Really gross. I'm pretty miserly but just poured the whole bottle down the sink.
