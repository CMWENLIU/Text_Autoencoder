Spearmint altoids have been my favorite for years.  My local stores have not had them much lately, so I was thrilled to be able to get them online.<br />Wow....how disappointing.<br /><br />They tasted so awful with a very artificial type of flavor.<br /><br />I have also recently bought the wintergreen and peppermint, and these are still pretty good.<br /><br />But why did they have to go messing with the spearmint!!<br /><br />I hope they go back to the Old great taste.
