The soup was a good price compared to grocery stores but half the cans were seriously bent in the middle.  It appeared that Amazon was shipping what the big buyers were rejecting.  I bought 48 cans of soup shipped in three different shipments so there was no reason cans on the inside should be bent in the middle.  I was very disappointed but had been warned by previous feedback.  Won't buy again.
