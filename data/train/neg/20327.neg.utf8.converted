The tea didn't make me drowsy in the slightest and tasted nasty.  I've barely had tea in my life, so I checked to make sure I was doing it right the second time, including adding a second bag of tea to see if I just had low sensitivity, but still nothing happened, and it just tasted nastier.  Judging by the other reviews, I guess I'm unlucky?
