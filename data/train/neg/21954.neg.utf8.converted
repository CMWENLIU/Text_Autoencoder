Without exaggeration, practically every mouthful of quinoa from this brand contained some grit.<br /><br />After using the entire bag of this brand, I bought cases of two other brands for comparison.  I encountered no grit in a whole bag of one of those other brands, and only one little bit in one mouthful out of the other entire bag.<br /><br />I won't be buying this brand again.
