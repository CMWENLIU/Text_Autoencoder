I purchased xylitol for years from another source, no problems.  I purchased this xylitol and it gave me hives.  I stopped eating it and tried again just to make sure if it was this product.  The hives came back.  I dont know what is up but I will not purchase this again.  I wonder now if it had some contaminent.<br /><br />I gave it a star because it tasted fine
