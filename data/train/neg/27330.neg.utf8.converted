My kids loved the cocoa loco bars - until I opened our newest shipment and found that the bars had completely changed!  They are completely different and they are awful.  My kids generally love anything chocolate, but they threw these in the garbage after one bite.  They described them as tasting like rubber.  I ate one and fully agreed.  There goes the one gluten free snack bar that my kids actually liked!
