Loved the name, loved the concept. I tried this for several months, but I finally switched to Nature's Miracle.<br /><br />Here's why I switched:<br /><br />1) Hardened clumps impossible to get out of box-even used screwdrived as chisel (old-fashioned wheat paste is glue for a reason-it works)<br /><br />2) Strange fermenting dough smell if box not thoroughly cleaned daily<br /><br />3) Large Dough clumps clog toilet when flushed even if waiting until softened.<br /><br />4) IF not flushed, still fairly heavy to take out.<br /><br />5) This product appears identical to the wheat germ in my kitchen-my cats would eat it on occasion when it was fresh. I decided that I didn't feel comfortable with the idea that my cats were possibly urinating into food-grade grains when there are starving people all over the world
