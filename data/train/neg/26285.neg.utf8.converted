I bought some of these at Costco and have been feeding my miniature dachshund these off and on in small amounts for several months. She has had several gastrointenstinal issues which we have had to take her to the vet - vomiting, diarrhea. We feed her Innova Evo and Evangers kibble so I know it's not the kibble! She just was vomiting and had diarrhea last night after giving her more than her usual amount of this product. I Googled this product and found lots of info about how it is making other dogs very ill. Some even dying! Better safe than sorry...I'm definitely reporting this and throwing it out!
