Would have given this a four or five star rating if not for two problems. The first was the food is not completely cooked, quite "al dente". Both the rice and chick peas in sauce required additional cooking. The taste is quite good but what rates this a one star review is the "dirt/sand" contained in the meal. I tried both the Chana Masala and the Mutter Paneer and both had a bit of crunchy, gritty in it.
