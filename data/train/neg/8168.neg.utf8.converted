I just got 2 jars of Roland Mushrooms, Dried Sliced Cepes - Bolets from Amazon.com at $16.35 for a 1lb jar. I thought it is deal to good to be true, but I bought it anyway. Right after opening the jar I realized I made a big mistake. Mushrooms, and especially bolets should pleasantly smell and not stink. The content of the jar stinks. I am not sure if such mushrooms are appropriate for human consumption. Of course, I paid for it and I will Try it. However, I think I discovered the reason for this stink. You see, I purchased some other Roland products, like sliced olives, roasted paprika, etc. On sliced olives for example it says "Packaged for 2010 Roland Company...", and on Roasted paprika it says "Packaged for 2011 Roland Company..." But on the jar with Roland Mushrooms, Dried Sliced Cepes - Bolets it says "Packaged for 2001 Roland Company.." Is it possible that Amazon.co is selling Roland Mushrooms stored for the past 10 years? Unfortunately, there is no expiration date on the jar. Anyway, a freshly opened jar of dried bolets with clearly defined expiration date I purchased in a local store (1 year before expiration date) smells a lot different.
