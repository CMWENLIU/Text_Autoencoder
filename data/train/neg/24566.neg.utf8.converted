When I found out I was pregnant I had to give up my beloved caffeinated tea so I bought this thinking it would be safe in pregnancy.  BUT, my doctor said no red raspberry in the first trimester (ingredient in the tea) as it is a uterine stimulant.  If you are thinking about buying this tea, ask your doctor to see if the herbs are safe for you in your pregnancy.  On the other hand, the taste is good and I will drink it in my 2nd and 3rd trimesters.
