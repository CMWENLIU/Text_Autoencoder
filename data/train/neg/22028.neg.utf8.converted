I brought home a box of these thinking I had found a good nutrition bar.  Fortunately I didn't open the box of bars because when I saw the "Made in China" on the box, I immediately stopped.<br />Unbelievable.  What is wrong with these companies that are having food made in China.  I<br />wouldn't ever buy another Mrs. May product again, particularly any that are made in China.
