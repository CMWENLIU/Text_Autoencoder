The company did a great job shipping the product, but the product itself was awful.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Ghormeh Sabzi and this was by far the worst I've ever tasted.  I tried another packaged product in the past that was pretty decent.  However, this stuff smelled awful and tasted even worse than it smelled.
