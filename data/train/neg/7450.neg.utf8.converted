Bragg markets this product as "no salt added" and "Healthier than soy" while she herself advocates raw and natural food. This product is made by chemically processing "liquid soy protein" in a way that chemically creates table salt and strips glutamic acids from the soy proteins, creating MSG.<br /><br />Naturally fermented soy sauce starts with the same base, is obviously fermented rather than chemically processed, does add salt but is able to use healthier salt than the chemically made salt in Bragg's, keeps the glutamic acids bonded to the protein, boasts the same assortment of amino acids, and doesn't cost any more than Bragg's.<br /><br />In short, Bragg is hypocritically marketing a product with no advantages over a good-quality soy sauce.
