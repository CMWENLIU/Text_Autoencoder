The concept of a filling pasta with virtually no calories was the most tempting thing about this product, but alas...<br /><br />But for someone raised in a Euro-American culture with pastas and noodles made from carbohydrates -- even if you like those pastas served al dente, which I do -- the texture of these noodles is really overwhelmingly hard to get accustomed to.<br /><br />It is as if the noodles were made of rubber band material or a kind of somewhat sinewy raw meat.  Really unpleasant.<br /><br />And I have found since trying the straight shirataki noodles that the ones which combine the shirataki with tofu are better?  But I still would rate them low on my list of food choices.<br /><br />If only they could find a way to improve the texture, then I might go for it, because the taste is not all that bad -- a little bland maybe, but the taste is not too bad.<br /><br />I just can't get past the texture of these noodles.<br /><br />There are no "miracles" when it comes to weigh loss.<br /><br />You just have to eat wisely and move a bit.
