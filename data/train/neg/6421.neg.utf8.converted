I have been addicted to Lindt 70% chocolate bars for a long time.  It was fine European style chocolate with all natural ingredients and the best value for the money around.  However, the last time I purchased one it was labeled "NEW FORMULA" and it was absolutely terrible.  It was mealy and oily like cheap chocolate and much too sweet.  I think they have adapted their recipe to appeal more to the American market, but if I want cheap chocolate I can pay 50 cents at any grocery store around.  I get Lindt so I can experience fine chocolate.  Skip this one.  If you are a die hard dark chocolate fan, get the 85% bar (which as of December 2010 they haven't screwed up yet), but eat it with a cup of your favorite hot beverage to help it melt since the 85% does not melt well without the extra heat.  I am currently on the search for a replacement for my old recipe Lindt bars and wondering why they couldn't learn from history not to mess with a winning product.  (I mean did anyone like New Coke?)  Lindt, if you are reading this GO BACK TO THE OLD FORMULA AT ONCE!!!!!
