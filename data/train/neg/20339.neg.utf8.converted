My mom gave me a box of this a few years ago and I had just recently gotten around to trying it. It was excellent. I bought another box and the second I opened the first packet I could smell that they had changed the recipe. Checking the back of the two boxes confirmed it. Cinnamon is about all I taste when I drink it, although the aftertaste has a hint of clove. Pretty expensive for something that tastes mixed by a child.
