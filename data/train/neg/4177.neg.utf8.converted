I ignored the reviews because I figured it would not be that bad. Was I ever wrong. Very disappointed in the horrible selection. Not even one iced tea. Not one. And half of the regular tea was Green Tea. What a joke. Do yourself a favor and just move on. I wish I did.<br /><br />Amazon you should be ashamed of this product. You need to seriously consider how this process works.
