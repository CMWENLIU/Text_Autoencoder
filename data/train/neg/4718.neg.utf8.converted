Tully's Kona K-Cups are great.<br /><br />BUT -- I recently ordered them from Amazon, and received a case of K-cups which was sold to a Brian Ewing in Orange CT via KOHL's shipped direct from California.  I have a Kohl's two miles from my house!!!! What a run-around. I'll never do that again.<br /><br />In the future I will go to my Kohl's, or order from a real on-line vendor, not someone playing games with purchases from a retail outlet and perhaps getting $10 on each $50 spent or "points" on their credit card.<br /><br />Sorry for such a review, but you deserve it.<br /><br />Muriel Fallon<br />Florida
