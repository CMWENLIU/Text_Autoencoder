This product arrived with the jar lid off and almond butter spilled all over the inside of the shipping box.  The jar is soft plastic, which allows phthalates, from the plastic, to enter the food contents.  The product is thin and processed in a facility where peanuts, soy and tree nuts are used.  We would never recommend this.
