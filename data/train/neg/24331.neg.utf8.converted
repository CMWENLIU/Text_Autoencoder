I ordered several cans of Similac Sensitive for spit ups which was the product described.  I did not get this product.  Instead I got similac for spitups.  When I recehcked I noticed that the picture does not match the description.  The description was SENSITIVE for spitups and the picture is just for spitups not sensitive.  I was very disappointed as I could not use the product for my child and had to buy the correct product in the store.  I did not know if you carried the correct product that I needed and there was no way to contact you so.  So future buyers beware since you will not get the product described.
