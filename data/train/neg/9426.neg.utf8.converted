I have been looking for a Hazelnut Flavor... this is not the one... When I got it I was really happy hoping finally I was going to be able to bake with a wonderful hazelnut flavor... but when I opened the bottle I found out that what I had was something like plain water... NO FLAVOR OR SMELL AT ALL... so now I have 4 bottles of nothing!!!! I am really disappointed.<br /><br />I don't usually write reviews, but this one really deserved my time... Please please don't buy... Look for something else!!!
