I've ordered the Dubble Bubble Gum Party Box twice and both times they sent me Bazooka Gum which I don't like. Do you think they'd do any thing about it after numerous calls - NOT! Amazon needs to stop carrying them with their poor customer service and can't seem to send the customer what they ordered.
