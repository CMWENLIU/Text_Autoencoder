after researching and finding out the dark side of soy, i switched over to rice dream rice milk (get original only, and dont get any milk substitute in these shelved containers- get em from the fridge section).  the rice milk far better.<br /><br />  rice dream  ---  vanilla silk<br /><br />taste:  5*  ---  4*<br />MSG:  no  ---  yes (carageenan- bad!!)<br />texture:  thinner  ---  thicker<br />color:  ultra white  ---  off- white<br /><br />  silk is great that its organic (one thing that rice dream doesnt have), but if you know your stuff, you know that up to 10% of the soy in organically labeled food can be genetically modified.<br /><br />  for the record, i drank silk for at least 3 years and loved it... until i researched the ingredients and made the switch.
