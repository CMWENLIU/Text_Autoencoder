I used to buy this gravy often when the ingredients matched those listed above. I recently ordered a case (for myself and to share with friends) because I could no longer find it locally. The ingredients have changed and now milk is listed as a "natural flavoring." The allergy information has been changed to read: Wheat, Milk. HUGE disappointment!
