I would strongly recommend staying away from these bags.  While being environmentally friendly is important, a product first needs to serve its primary function, in this case, storing garbage.  These bags tear with any application of weight and do not trap odors whatsoever.  In an attempt to be "green," biobags miss the boat on basic trash bag functionality.  Purchase at your own risk.
