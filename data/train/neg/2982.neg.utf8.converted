I have had Wild Rice many , many times over the years...fresh from Minnasota or Michigan where its grown and packaged for use like this order was.<br /><br />Sadly , this was the poorest tasting Wild Rice that I have ever had. There is just no taste to it at all.<br /><br />I do not know why this is...and I notice it states Grade A on the  packaging....maybe thats a low grade plain and simple.<br /><br />I cannot suggest this rice to you because I believe they should STOP SELLING this particular product to others. It is that poor tasting.<br /><br />I know I will  never buy it again.
