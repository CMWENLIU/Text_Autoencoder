For the 3 seconds the flavor lasts (the outside strawberry flavored gum mixed with a lime liquid center) it's pretty enjoyable.  After that, it's all downhill.  Not since chewing Fruit Strips gum as a child, can I remember a gum losing flavor this quickly.  You maybe get 5-10 minutes of flavor and after that it's like chewing rubber.<br /><br />The packaging is another annoyance it's a foil blister pack with a cardboard sleeve containing nine pieces of gum.  It's a waste of packaging if you consider the whole thing could have been put in a Mentos-like package.<br /><br />I made the mistake of buying a 3 pack.  If you must, go with a single pack.  It will be enough to turn you off.
