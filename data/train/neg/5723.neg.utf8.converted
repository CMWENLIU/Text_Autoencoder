I'm in Florida and every insect that  breathes, moves or flies is hovering around my plants, chewing on my plants, nestled between leaves, lounging in the soil or crawling around the outside of the pots they are everywhere - tiny tiny bugs, gnats swarming around my head while I check these strips for GNATS, spiders, mosquitos,ants, flies, little beetles, etc. I have looked in my plant books and online and watch them munch under a magnifying glass - I don't know what they all are but I do know that I have had these strips in every single plant-some on a covered patio and others outside and unprotected.<br /><br />NOTHING HAS STUCK TO THESE except my fingers the first time I put them in a couple plants, then my gardening gloves the next time I put them in the patio plants thinking maybe it gets breezy (which it just isn't at the moment)and that's why they don't work outside, or maybe there's dew in the morning, the leaves of the plants stick just fine when I move the stick but NOT A SINGLE INSECT BUG OR ANYTHING OF ANY KIND!!! What a complete waste.<br /><br />Also very important to not, these are for relatively small plants.  My hanging plants and some other potted ones are in 12-14" pots and need at least three if they were actually going to do anything helpful (but since they don't it doesn't matter anyway) but it is something to keep in mind if you are going to buy them - they are very small and for a well growing healthy plant, they are not tall enough, they tend to curl over sometimes, and you really would need several per pot to try it.<br /><br />But obviously I would not recommend this product since I did not get a single bug, while I can see the clever little suckers everywhere.
