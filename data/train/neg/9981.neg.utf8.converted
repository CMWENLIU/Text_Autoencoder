I purchased "Lemon/Lime" & "Tropical" and I disliked both flavors. I was looking forward to a refreshing natural fruit flavor but I thought that my water & seltzer water was more refreshing without Flavrz.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this product cannot be returned and I threw both cartons away which was not inexpensive.  However, I knew that I would never use Flavrz in my water or selter water and none of my family or friends wanted them after tasting.  If you are interested in trying this product, I recommend that you find a local supplier and initially just buy a few packets.
