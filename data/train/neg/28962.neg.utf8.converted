These are far from the "original" Necco Wafers.  Some genius decided it would be a good idea to replace the artificial colors and flavors generations of Necco lovers have come to adore with things like beet juice, cabbage, and turmeric.  The result of the switch to "natural" flavorings and colors is, at best, disappointing, at worst, an unmitigated confectionery disaster.<br /><br />The black Necco, with its sweet quasi-licorice flavoring, was always my favorite.  Now, it's hard to tell it apart from the other Neccos.  There are only mild differences between the flavors of these false Neccos, these fraudulent wafers.  And all the flavors are forgettably bland.<br /><br />The New England Confectionery Company has ditched the old packaging, too.  In a way, the change is a blessing.  The new wrapper lets the Necco lover know not to waste money on the worst product formula change ever.  Forget New Coke/Old Coke; the Necco debacle is unequaled in world history. It makes the Portland Trailblazer's decision to draft Sam Bowie instead of Michael Jordan seem enlightened.<br /><br />What makes the whole sordid affair even harder to accept is company's failure to note the ruination of Necco anywhere on the package.  I bought a sack of the small size rolls and thought I must have purchased an old, stale lot of Necco rejects.  It was only after I tried Neccos from the regular sized roll that I realized something was horribly wrong.<br /><br />Goodbye old friend.  If I had known the fate your maker had in store for you I would have bought a truck load of you and would, perhaps, be savoring one of your delectable pleasure discs right now.
