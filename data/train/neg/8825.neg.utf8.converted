We have purchased several types of coffee beans from Coffee Bean Direct (and had very good luck thus far) but this was our least favorite by far! We knew they were not going to be premium beans but when we opened the bag they had little aroma and we thought they tasted like cheap Folgers coffee. We COULD NOT WAIT until the beans were gone and we could place another order for different beans. Might not want to waste your money on these beans...for a few more dollars you can get a really nice roast (Italian or French).
