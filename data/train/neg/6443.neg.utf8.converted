This was my favorite chocolate bar for years.  It was so bold and flavorful.  Then, I tasted the "new" recipe.  It is waxy and flavorless.  I didn't even finish the bar.  That never happens at my house!  Do they really think we won't notice?  Well, now I am searching for another good chocolate bar.
