Well, it looks like they took my review off from last week. So, I will re-enter it. After buying 3 1 lb bags for all uses, my family decided to try a handful and everyone stated their throat burned including me. The company said they will refund my money and said they don't have preservatives in them. But, something is wrong. Your throat shouldn't burn after eating a handful of walnuts. Guess that is why they are such a good bargain.
