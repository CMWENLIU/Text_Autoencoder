I was feeding our cat 2 cans a day of Fancy Feast for six months. No snacks or treats or other food. She's very active and gained 1 and 1/2 pounds in that time. After speaking with our vet who was concerned about the weight gain she referred to Fancy Feast as the McDonalds of cat food. Junk food essentially. High in calories and fat. Sure your cat loves it.. but would you feed you kids McDonalds every day just because they like it? Find something better. Wellness, EVO, Avoderm, Purina Pro or Royal Canin are all better for your pet.
