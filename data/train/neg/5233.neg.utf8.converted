This flavor does not actually contain 120% of daily iron for babies, as still listed on most packaging.  This was a grievous error (a "printing error" according to the company).  This flavor only contains 6% iron, in the realm of most other baby food pouch products.  Unfortunately, this company has failed to pull mislabeled products or notify distributors of the long running error.
