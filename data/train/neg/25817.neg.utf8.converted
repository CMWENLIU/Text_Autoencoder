We have switched to organic, natural foods and have tried to eliminate hydrogenated oils from our diet - that meant finding a replacement for Creamora. I was excited to find this product. Sadly the taste does not live up to the name. Instead of Creamer it should be called Milker. There is no creamy taste, frankly it is the equivalent of adding non-fat dry milk to your morning coffee. True, no hydrogenated oils, but also no cream, so what is the point? They need to do a version that is not non-fat, using real cream. Oh well, live and learn. I'm still using it by mixing it with Creamora until I can find a true replacement. Will not be a repurchase.
