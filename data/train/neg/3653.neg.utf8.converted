I had high hopes for this product having read other reviews.  I was disappointed.  It didn't seem to "sweeten" my baked goods.  It had a weird bitter taste that I did not like.  As far as baking with it, my baked goods came out looking great, but not tasting as sweet as I wanted them to.  Also, the product does not measure cup for cup to sugar so you need to use more.  For one cup of sugar, you need to use 1.75 cups of Just Like Sugar.  So product is used fast, it is expensive, and not readily available like other sweeteners.
