This spaghetti makes for some good food, but it certainly doesn't make the best shoes. I was advised to buy this specific spaghetti (De Cecco) along with a chocolate shoe mold (which doubles as a real shoe mold) in order to make my own shoes. After successfully crafting the shoes (after dehydrating them via baking), I tried them out. Note: the chocolate shoe mold doesn't offer different sizes, so the shoes were a bit smug. I won't let that impact my current review, however; I am focused on the spaghetti.<br />Unfortunately, I have to label the shoes as a failure for several reasons:<br /><br />Durability: the packaging doesn't warn you, but as soon as you bake the previously boiled noodles, they tend to crack without too much strain. I am 14 pounds, and I cracked my right shoes after 2 steps. The left held out for 14.5 steps (a large gust of wind was the source of demise). Needless to say, I had to make 7 pairs of shoes to make it to the bathroom.<br /><br />Shock absorber: after baking the noodles, they refused to give as they tried to act as a medium between the ground and my feet. I suffer from lower-back problems, and the incessant cracking of the noodles absorbed shock temporarily, but failed to work for too long (steps 3-14.5 for the left foot)<br /><br />Style options: Sadly, De Cocco doesn't offer spaghetti in a variety of colors, such as turquoise and violet. I like to branch out from the norm, and I find myself with similar shoes to my peers as a result of the manufacturer's failure to diversify.<br /><br />These are three of the primary reasons that I have to label the spaghetti as "minimally versatile."
