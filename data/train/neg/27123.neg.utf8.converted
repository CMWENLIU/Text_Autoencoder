I'm sorry to admit this, but these quinoa flakes are disgusting! I tried eating them savory, I tried eating them sweet. How are you supposed to eat them? I was finally able to make them edible, but after a while I felt that if I took one more bite, I would throw up. These taste fine in baked goods, so I might only buy it for that purpose. Sorry that I had to give this such a bad review.
