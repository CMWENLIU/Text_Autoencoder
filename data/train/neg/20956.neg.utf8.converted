I purchased several boxes of this product last year. They were from Norway and excellent. Perfectly smoked and texture was just right. This time the label said "prodcut of Poland" so not sure if I ordered the wrong item or if it was substituted; but these were definitely not the same quality. Sardines were muushy and had a metallic taste to them.
