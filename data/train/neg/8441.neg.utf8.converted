I am heartsick and mad at myself for feeding my dogs Iams without doing research until today.  It has low ratings.  For example, "red flag" ingredients in Iams Proactive Health Adult Minichunks are corn meal (the second ingredient listed on the label), chicken by-product meal, dried beet pulp, dried egg product and caramel.<br /><br />I've lived with healthy, long-lived dogs my entire life---large, small, strays, AKC registered.  Growing up, we always had from one to three dogs.  After leaving home, I've had two sets of dogs.  My first set of dogs were healthy until their 16th year.  I never brushed their teeth or had their teeth cleaned otherwise I'm sure they would have lived longer.  I've never feed Iams products to any dogs until my second set (present set) of dogs.  As far as them, I've regularly brushed their teeth.<br /><br />They've had a lot of health problems and they're always eating grass and wanting to lick the floor and the A/C-heating system's metal vents on the floor.  Their stomachs are often upset and it's as if they don't get enough vitamins and minerals.  Also, their coats quickly went from being shiny as youngsters to very dull.  So much of their hair turned white that by the time they were three, they both looked like senior citizens - especially their faces.  I have hundreds of photos to prove this.  They drink excessive amounts of water and I have a hard time keeping their weight down.  None of these problems have I experienced or even thought about with my previous dogs or with our family dogs when I was young.<br /><br />Tragically, on May 1, I put one of the present two "to sleep" at age 12.  That's why I've been reading dog food reviews today.  She and I spent 22 horrible and painful (and expensive) days trying to save her life, including having her gallbladder surgically removed.  My other dog has suffered from arthritis since age five, among other problems.<br /><br />After checking the reviews, I suspect their diet is the reason for most if not all of the problems stated above.  I feel guilty because I trusted the word "premium".  I feel guilty that even though I had suspicions throughout the years, I didn't look into it until it was too late.  It was just so easy to pick up their food at the grocery store.  Educating ourselves is more important than trusting that a label (such as "premium") means we're feeding them what is best for their health and well being.  I did everything in the world for my dogs---except give them a proper diet.  With the Internet at our disposal, that is unconscionable.
