I have a half-dozen varieties of ghost pepper sauces in my house, and this one rates at or near the bottom for several reasons.<br /><br />First, yes, it's hot. But it's hot for hot's sake: the sauce is really just a heat delivery system, without really bringing anything to the party in terms of flavor. It smells like it should have some of the smoky sweetness of a good jolokia sauce, but if you can actually pick up any distinctive flavors behind the wall of heat it generates in your mouth I'd be surprised.<br /><br />Second, the texture of this sauce is just off. I know Dave's sauces tend to be thicker than most, but this is practically a paste. The thickness causes two major problems. The sauce is difficult to dose out, tending to either catch in the bottle's neck or plop out in large dollops well beyond what any reasonable person would want. Also, it's hard to distribute across your food.<br /><br />Third, it's impractical. Something this hot and thick is far more useful as an ingredient than a condiment, but even when I'm making spicy food I seldom have need for anything this potent. I can't imagine using it on a slice of pizza or in scrambled eggs.<br /><br />Sauces like Holy Jolokia and Naga Soreass will let you experience the subtle flavors that come with the intense heat of the pepper. Dave's Ghost Pepper just gives the heat, without really showcasing the pepper itself.<br /><br />Get it for when you make large pots of chili or when you want to haze fraternity pledges. Otherwise, stick with thinner sauces that have some versatility.
