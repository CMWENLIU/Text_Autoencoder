Earlier this year, the FDA enacted a new rule forcing companies to take the gluten-free label from anything that has more than 20 ppm gluten.  (I'm looking at you, Arrowhead Mills and Bob's Red Mill.)<br /><br />However, you can be right at 20 ppm, which makes a lot of celiacs sick, and still label yourself, "gluten free".  (The rule should have said, "less than 20 ppm", not "20 ppm or less".)<br /><br />This is where Amazon is fantastic--they made the company list the gluten in this, so we know it's NOT gluten free.  (I have yet to find a Hain's food product that was actually gluten free, although some of them are legally gluten free.  Look for their name on the labels so you know what to avoid, even if they are hiding behind the federal law and they have labeled their products gf.)<br /><br />Pacific Rice Milk and Whole Foods' store brands of rice milk are gluten free, though.  Buy those instead.
