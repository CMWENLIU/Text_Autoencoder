I have been ordering these for a while.  My dogs have always liked them until the last batch.  All of a sudden, they do not like them and just leave them lying around.  I thought they smelled funny, like a chemical smell when I first opened the bag, so I called the company.  They said that they would check into it, and sent me a box of replacement dog goodies. Guess I never thought much more about it until I read some of the reviews about these chews making dogs sick.  Guess I won't buy them anymore...
