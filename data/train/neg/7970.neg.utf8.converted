I bought this gum about three weeks ago and have never been more disappointed in a product. When you first chew up the pieces the taste is anything but spearmint. But it gets worse as you continue to chew it; what flavor there is disappears in less than 2-3 minutes and it is just plain nasty!<br /><br />As bad as the gum is, I also tried the Xyla mints and find them to be wonderful. The flavors I like most are: Wintergreen, Coco mint, Peppermint. Licorice mint is also pretty good.
