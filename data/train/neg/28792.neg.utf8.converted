I love Terra Yukon Gold Potato Chips, so I thought I'd order some in the smaller packaging.  The carton arrived with 24 small bags.  The product was stale even though the expiration date on the packages was 3 months AHEAD of the date I received the chips. The small bags also contained many chips that looked "burned".  I was really disappointed
