These cookies were falling apart when I opened the package and they were also oddly discolored. My spouse and I went ahead and each ate one. Well, he ate one. I took one bite and rejected it. The chocolate is too thin and bitter for my taste. The cookie continued to fall apart after one bite. The one bite I had left an awful aftertaste in my mouth. My spouse wasn't impressed either. We will not be purchasing these.
