The best thing I can say about this product is it is POOR.  Poor in taste and quality.  We end up getting coffee grind in our cup 80 pct of the time.  We now strain the coffee in order to avoid the grounds. It's not the coffee maker because others work fine, NO Grounds at all.  If I new how to return them I would.
