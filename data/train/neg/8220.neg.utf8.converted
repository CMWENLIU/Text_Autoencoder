I was so hopeful about this product.  Yet, it was squeaky when chewing.  It didn't make much food (two servings a bag?), it didn't absorb flavor and I was still hungry afterwards.  I use Dreamfield's low carb pasta and was looking for a better alternative.  This wasn't it.  I'll stick with the Dreamfield's.
