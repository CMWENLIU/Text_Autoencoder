I bought a single package of this from a supermarket at a reduced price as it was 1 month before its Best Before date.<br />The product photo shows fresh chunks of potatoes, carrots & green peppers. I really didn't notice the vegetables in the finished product - I assume they were there.<br />My sauced rice did not look like the photo either. The directions state to break the chunks of the precooked rice with the back of a spoon to separate the grains. This was hard to do & when I'm microwaving, I want quick food. Also the sauce was darker & surprisingly hot.
