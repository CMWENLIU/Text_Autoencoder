I bought these pods on Amazon because they were a dollar cheaper than at the local grocery store.  Now I know why.  When I opened the package the Senseo Watermark was faint or hardly visable and it took me 3x the amount of pods to make a decent cup of coffee.  Buyer beware,  I am back to buying pods at the grocery store.
