I was totally shocked by the cost of shipping which was higher than the cost of 10 of the item.  Then to pay that much to find out it has taken nearly a month to receive the product is ridiculous.  I placed my order on 1-21 and after several e-mails, follow up promises of shipment last week, today on 2-15 I finally recieved notice it would be shipped.  This company wont receive my business again.
