I'm used to buying 12 poptarts for $2.89 in my area (Tennessee) so I thought 36 for $6.70 from Amazon was a slightly better deal with the prime free shipping. Well, it would have been if the poptarts tasted fresh and as good as they do when I buy them from the grocery store. They're not packaged in tinfoil like they are at my grocery store, they just don't taste the same. They'll do and I'll eat them, but I won't be buying them from amazon again, especially since the price has increased to $18 at this writing!
