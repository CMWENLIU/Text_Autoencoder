I am very disappointed in the lack of concern for the customers of this product. There should be clear warnings re how this might affect many people re GI upset and gas etc..<br /><br />The taste isn't bad but I would think they could have made this product with less  sugar alcohol and thus reduce the side effect considerably.<br /><br />I will not be re-ordering this product..other that stating it is sugar free..it is NOT low Calorie at all.<br /><br />Serving size: 17 pieces (41g)<br />Amount per serving:<br />Calories:  160 ...... might as well get the Full sugar version and NOT have the side effects...<br /><br />Sorry..very very disappointed in this product
