Total bummer.  My little pup doesn't like these 'Lamb and Sweet Potato' tidbits at-all.  And I have no idea why.<br /><br />I bought this recipe at the grocery store and everything on the package looked good.  There's 9% protein, a reasonable 4% fat, with 11% moisture and 4% crude fiber.  The approximately 1x1 inch tidbits (about 1/4 inch thick) are made with barley, lamb, sweet potatoes, with organic molasses (yum) and few other good things, and yet, I couldn't interest Ms. Charlene (Charlie) in playing with one, much less eating one.<br /><br />She's a puppy -- Russell/Beagle mix -- so maybe she's picky or maybe she prefers something with more fat content, or with more smell-appeal.  Again I don't know, but I did want to write a review to warn you that you might want to buy a single bag versus a box full.<br /><br />Two Stars for excellent organic ingredients.  No additional stars because my young pup wouldn't eat more than one tiny corner of one. [The neighbors Australian cattledog is in for a treat]<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/#kidlit blogger
