First, my cat loves this treat.  However, it is definitely not a dental product as the manufacturer advertised.  There is no enzyme in Greenies that would promote dental health.  The size of the treat is pretty standard compares to other brands of cat treats, so there is no need for the cat to chew on it (my cat swallows it in 2 seconds), which means Greenies does not "brush off" the tartar either.  I took my cat to the vet few months ago for professional dental cleaning.  After the treatment, the vet gave me some handouts about dental care for cats, and explained to me that Greenies does NOT promote dental care.  Instead, the vet recommends the CET chews for cats.  However, the vet says, nothing beats brushing your cat's teeth at least every other day.  So, if you are looking for an oral hygiene chews, look somewhere else, however, if you just want to please your cat, Greenies does make a tasty treat!
