I buy a lot of stuff, and a LOT of vitamins, herbs, homeopathic remedies, and only organic food.  I bought some over priced oil from these people, and it came in a simple envelope with the lid cracked off (the foil kept it from leaking in the mail.  I called and asked them to mail me a cap for the plastic bottle, so I may dispense & use the oil.  No cap came.  With other companies available online, and an opportunity to make a comment, I waited over a month to post a comment.  These people need to  a) ship in a way to protect your purchase  b) replace what they send and is recived broken.  Won't be back.  (you know, first time, shame on you.  second time, shame on me...)
