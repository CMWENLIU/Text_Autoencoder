Not a huge fan of this eye cream. It takes forever to dry so its not as practical in the morning when I am in a hurry and don't have so much time to wait. Putting on makeup when its still wet is not pretty under the eyes, which defeats the point of using the cream. It works better as a nite treatment. Haven't noticed any dramatic improvements so far in reducing puffiness and dark circles. Its also quite oily. One pump delivers way too much cream also. Would not purchase again.
