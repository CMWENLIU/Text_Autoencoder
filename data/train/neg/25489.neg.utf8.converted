I am disappointed in the product and the company.  The product was completely ruined upon receipt...each layer of candy was smashed, though the outer shipping box was intact and without a single dent...leaving me to believe that it was damaged prior to being shipped to me.  I have a confirmation from the USPS that the item I shipped back was received, but I have not yet received a refund...and it has been 19 days today.<br />I would not recommend this company to anyone!
