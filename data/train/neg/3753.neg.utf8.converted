It was very good while it worked. We have had our Saeco automatic expresso maker for three years now.  When it arrived we thought it looked awfully flimsy for a $600 machine. We were right. After the first year, knobs and buttons started falling off, and month by month after that the tolerences opened up, and the whole thing fell apart. You could hear it creeking and groaning ever more loudly as it did so. Finally, after three years, it's dead.  You get what you pay for: in this case you'll pay $500+ for great expresso/coffee for three years.
