I was surprised when the catnip arrived to find it was only a one ounce tin.  The listing did not say how much was in the tin (my fault I guess). I just found the same size tin of this same catnip at a high end natural food store for only $4.95.  This is good stuff, but overpriced and can probably be found locally for a lot less.
