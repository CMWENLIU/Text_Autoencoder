Another product bites the dust.....Barney Butter almond butter. I used to enjoy this...now they are putting adulterants in it. Evaporated cane juice (?) and PALM OIL (!!!)<br /><br />The clearing and burning of rainforest in Indonesia, Malaysia and other parts of Asia for palm oil plantations is destroying the habitat of endangered species. It is the main reason there may be no Orangutans in 20 years. When they venture into the plantations because they are hungry the mothers are brutally killed, the babies ripped from their dead bodies and sold in the pet trade. Palm oil anyone? yum!
