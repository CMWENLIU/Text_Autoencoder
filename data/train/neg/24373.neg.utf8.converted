I was dying to get my hands on these after reading such wonderful endorsements.  I had nothing but high hopes.  I was totally open minded.  I thought it seemed too good to be true (low cal no carb noodles!) but hey, I'm an optimist.  Guess what? It is too good to be true!  I read about washing them and drying them.  I did.  No problem.  I added sauce.  I put them in my mouth.  The taste was not the problem it was the texture.  It was seriously like chewing rubber bands.  No noodle resemblence whatsoever.  I honestly can't understand those who rave about these, but, hey, to each his own.
