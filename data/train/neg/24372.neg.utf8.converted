I can't believe this was made and packaged for human consumption. I am still reeling from my attempt at eating it- spare yourself.<br /><br />Open the package and breath in the heady scent of... ammonia. But wait, they warn you of the authentic scent of Shirataki, and recommend that you parbroil the noodles to reduce the stench, excuse me, aroma.<br /><br />Once cooked you can enjoy pseudonoodles with the scent and consistancy of overcooked squid. Mmmm, so difficult to chew.<br /><br />Described as the perfect diet food for good reason. You won't be able to finish more than two forkfulls.
