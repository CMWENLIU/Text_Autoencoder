I purchased this food after reading the many positive revieves for  my 6 pound Exotic who loves to eat, especially chicken. On opening I was surprised  how much like human  food it looked and smelled and was sure she would love it. Well, one sniff and she looked at me as if I were  nuts. My other more finky cat likewise.  I tried  again a few weeks later with the same results.<br />I then decided to let a neighbor try it since I did not want it to go to waste.  His cat had the same results.  No deal.  He  then put some out for  four ferral cats  he was feeding . NO takers.  It is hard to believe that not one  of seven cats would refuse something hailed as so tempting unless the food was defective..<br />I would not try this food unless youi needed some cans to hold up a bookcase.<br />If looking for a premium chicken try Instinct. A bit pricy but my cats love it. I also learned not to fix a good thing.  Cats are not like  humans and don't seem to mind the same food everyday.
