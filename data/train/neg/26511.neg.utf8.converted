The mini-milks usually sell 6 for about $3.25. This product that is listed for $18+ is supposed to be SIX packages of SIX mini-milks, which works out to be a little over $3 per sixpack, which is the correct price. But if you order it, they will ship only ONE six pack... making these mini-milks more expensive than the big milks (which sell at 13.5 ounce, six to a pack, for $14+)! It took me two hours talking to customer service to get this mistake corrected. The person who entered this in inventory misunderstood that it is a sixpack of sixpacks... so he/she entered it as one package of six. When I ordered this product last summer they had it listed right and the order was correct, but right now it is listed wrong.
