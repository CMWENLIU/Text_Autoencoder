I read the reviews and thought I would try the formula even though there were some complaints of constipation, my daughter is on prophylaxis antibiotics and I hoped that would even it out. The first day was okay, I guess she still had some of her previous formula still in her system. Days 2-6 got worse and worse. Day 2 started the constipation which continued into day 3. Days 4-6 there was no bowel movement and my daughter's stomach was rock hard. After her crying at the top of her lungs I gave up on the organic formula and switched her back to her previous formula. Within 2 bottles she had 3 bms. Her stomach may have evened out if we kept her on it longer, however I could tell she was hurting and did not want to try any longer.<br />FYI: Amazon was great and issued a refund so it was worth a try, it just didn't work out for us
