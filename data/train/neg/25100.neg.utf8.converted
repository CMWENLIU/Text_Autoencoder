We just bought a package for our lab.  The only thing in her diet that has changed was the one dentastix she consumed and the diarrhea I've had to clean of my carpet makes me very unhappy.  Our opinion is the dentastix caused it.  We won't be buying this again and would not recommend them to anyone.
