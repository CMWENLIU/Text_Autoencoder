This sweetener although highly expensive $9.99 for a tiny bottle tasted like the real thing. I used it on my low carb pancakes. Within the hours I had horrible stomach cramps and was very gassy. I thought it might be the pancakes but I used the syrup to sweeten something else. Again with the Gas Pains, I read reviews online that others suffered from the same problem due to the sugar substitute that is utilized. The bottle is around 80% full and will never use it again.
