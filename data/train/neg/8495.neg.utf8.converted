This is the third product by this company I have tried.  First was the one with the chimpanzee on the label.  Fine chocolate, but alas no chimpanzee flavor.  Then the one with a bat on the label.  Can you guess the outcome?  Again, the chocolate itself was good, but no flavor of bat!  So fine, I figured since trees are stationary and not moving like chimps and bats, maybe third time is a charm.  Perhaps there is some sort of exotic Brazilian wood flavor in this chocolate.  So, I bite into it..and what do I taste?  Chocolate and mint!  Now who knows, maybe the mint leaves was lugged about by some native in the rainforest.  But really now, a forest is the trees!  Even if the mint was grown in the Amazon, that's not what I expect at all!  I want this chocolate bar to taste like honest to god wood!<br /><br />Well, I was fooled again.  Chimpanzee chocolate bar, no chimp flavor.  Bat chocolate bar, no bat flavor.  Rainforest chocolate bar, no tree flavor.  So again I am forced to give an otherwise quality product one star.  It's a shame, if they would stop their false advertising and just advertise this as a mint chocolate bar, I'd give it four or even five stars.  I'm not normally a fan of mint but I did like this chocolate bar.  Or would have if it had tasted like a tree!
