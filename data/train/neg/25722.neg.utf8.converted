Whenever I am in a store that sells your product- especially General Foods Internationl Coffee Cafe Francais - I must buy it for my daughter, Michelle.  Michelle doesn't drink brewed coffee as I do, only drinks Cafe Francais.  That is until you changed the formula.  I bought her the new Cafe Francais and she was so disappointed.  The flavor is different and I must say that even I could tell the difference.  Is the old formula ever coming back?
