This rates so-so. It tastes like mineral water with chocolate syrup.<br /><br />The pros:<br />No salt<br />No calories<br /><br />The cons:<br />Little flavor, I mean..fudge? No. I don't even think the flavor is heavy enough for me to use it as a mixer with vodka, which is how I usually dispose of my least-loved diet sodas.<br />No caffeine (though I could see how for some that might be a plus?)<br /><br />If you want chocolate, it's seriously worth it to get 70% or higher dark chocolate and quench your craving. Sometimes I eat a couple of my daughter's M&Ms and I want to turn to the bag like some sort of crazy ravenous chocolate eating beast. But. If I go to the kitchen and eat a square of dark chocolate, all that ends. It's done, you know? It's just over.
