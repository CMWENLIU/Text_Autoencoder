We ordered this product expecting to get a Chile Con Queso with a good, cheesy texture and zippy taste.  The zippy taste was there, all right -- but the Queso was watery, not substantial, more like a loose sauce or gravy. Drips off crackers and veggie sticks -- a real mess. We'd never consider buying this product again. Avoid!
