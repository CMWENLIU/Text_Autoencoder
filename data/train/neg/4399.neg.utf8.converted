This is the worst beef jerky I have ever had. It is uneatable. It is impossible to chew -- even my dogs gagged on it! Stick with quality U.S. products and not this cheap South American imported junk. The seller, Wild Bill, doesn't even put any contact information on the packaging to complain to. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RBGEOW">Wild Ride Beef Jerky Cowboy Strips, Original, 16-Ounce Bag</a>. This product is a total waste of money.
