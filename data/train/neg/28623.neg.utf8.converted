I love Amazon, I buy nearly everything I can manage to buy through Amazon, and as these waters are pretty expensive at the nearest local grocery store ($4.50/12 pack of cans (this item)), I thought I would try to buy some from Amazon. I read the description, but I really thought I was buying several boxes of these - Especially considering that they cost about $20.<br /><br />You can imagine my shock and dismay when the UPS man showed up, with a twelve pack. One box of twelve cans.<br /><br />I tried to return it, I could have bought four of these for what I paid here. I've never been so disappointed with Amazon.<br /><br />I love Amazon, I truly do, but the fact that they charged me an astronomical rate for this is most unfair, and the no-returns policy is bunk. I didn 't open the box, I still haven't opened the box. Most expensive cans of water I have ever bought.
