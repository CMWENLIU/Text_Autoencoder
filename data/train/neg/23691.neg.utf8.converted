I was excited to find the Kaia chips, because normally I make my own kale chips and it's somewhat time-consuming. Maybe my homemade chips have spoiled me, but these are just not pleasant at all.<br />First of all, it's not leaves (which I understand would be fragile to package), it's like leaves thrown in a blender to make a green paste that's then dried and cut into circles. It has sesame seeds and sunflower seeds on top.<br />And the flavor (so far tried "cheesy" and "sea salt & vinegar"), well, I can swallow them without getting nauseated, but that's about it. Won't be having them again.<br />I will say in their favor that it's relatively healthy (if high in fat), so compared to potato chips these are better for you. But for satisfying a yen for something yummy -- which my homemade kale chips definitely do -- these are disappointing. And expensive.
