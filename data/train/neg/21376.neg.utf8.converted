Let's start this with Amazon took care of the issue with this product promptly and courteously so FIVE STARS for them.  Now the abysmal packaging and quantity/quality of this product.  Run, stay away, don't think about it, just keep moving along.  Not in a holiday box but in a brown box with a 11"x14" piece of colored paper that can be taped to the front to cover the cellophane. And no little view hole either like the picture.  The brown box it comes in is about 5" deep but the interior brown box of contents is supported by 3" of cardboard underneath. The 2" deep contents box has 1" of scrap paper pressing the contents into the cellophane.  So what is in that 1"x11"x14"?  Not much! 1 packet of hot chocolate for a 6 oz cup?  That's like a shot.  The littlest 3-4 packages of other stuff not worth mentioning but think 1/3 the size of a small kids lunch bag of chips.  The mustard is in a jar smaller than what the airlines serve jelly in. (1 Oz).  The cheese wheel is more cardboard and little cheese.  The knife to cut the cheese came out of some playdooh set.<br /><br />Let's just say this isn't worth $5 and due to the packaging, it can't be gifted without shame.
