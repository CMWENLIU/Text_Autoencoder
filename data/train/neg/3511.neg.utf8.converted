I have a love/hate relationship with Twinings teas. Unfortunately, the two I love best have been discontinued (Vanilla Black Tea and Indian Spiced Chai Tea). Since this tea claims to combine vanilla and chai, I decided to try it.<br /><br />It is remarkably bland and frankly, the chai spices are barely perceptible, whereas the vanilla taste is non-existent. It is not a particularly potent tea either. I also agree that there is an odd, slightly fishy taste to this tea. I will finish the box (I started putting cinnamon sticks in it to give it some flavor), but this was a real miscalculation on Twinings' part. I wrote them about it and they didn't even bother to reply. My guess is I am not the only one disappointed by this tea, and since it isn't exactly cheap, my advice would be to look elsewhere if you want chai tea.
