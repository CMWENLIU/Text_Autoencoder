I tried this stuff at a suggestion of a friend that does not know how to read labels. She told me how wonderful this stuff is and that it has a whole lot less sodium than soy sauce. My husband has high blood pressure so I am always looking for ways to reduce sodium in his diet. We were in the store together and in a rush so I put a bottle in my cart without reading the bottle.<br /><br />As I said, my friend does not know how to read labels as a serving of Braggs is only 2.5 ml (one half of a teaspoon) and it has 160 mg of sodium. If you use it like soy sauce, you would probably use about a tablespoon (15 ml) which has 960 mg of sodium. A tablespoon of reduced sodium soy sauce has 530 mg of sodium - a little more than half of the same amount of Braggs and it tastes MUCH better. (If you want to do further math, 2.5 ml or 1/2 teaspoon of reduced sodium soy sauce contains 88.3 mg of sodium compared to the 160 mg in the same amount of Braggs)<br /><br />I will stick to my reduced sodium soy sauce. It tastes better and it has MUCH less sodium than the same amount of this stuff. My husband and son won't touch this disgusting stuff. I used it for a while putting half this garbage on my food and half soy sauce, but I couldn't take it any longer.  After sitting in my fridge for almost a year, I finally dumped it down the kitchen sink.
