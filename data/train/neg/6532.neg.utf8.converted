I like that this juice is organic but it is weak on the actual cranberry content due to the "blend." Too diluted by apple juice. I can buy pure organic cran juice at my supermarket for less per bottle. Take that, splice with some water, add a splash of orange juice for a nice mix, and you have a better value per ounce.
