Okay so today my sister bought some of these.<br />And so my cousin,her and I had some...and the were really good!!And super sour.<br />So we ate a few and she and my cousin were seeing what color ther tongues were and my sister had dark red inflammed sores all over her tongue!!!And my cousin looked like she had sunburn on her tongue!<br />Now my tongue stings really bad.<br />Otherwise it tastes good.
