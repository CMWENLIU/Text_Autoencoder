I bought several bags of this and signed up for auto-ship based on reviews on the product's website. Big mistake. The pellets / crystals / pearls / whatever do track through the house. And if I step on one, they hurt. So I can only imagine they hurt the cat's paws as well. Dust, dust, and more dust.  When I fill the litter box, there is a cloud. A cloud that I can taste in my mouth. And then, I sneeze. Not so good. I have to cover my mouth when I clean the litterbox.  And, no matter how hard the cats try to cover the solids, it doesn't happen.  So the "aroma" lingers in the air.<br /><br />I opened another bag thinking maybe I had a bad batch, but no. I had such high hopes for this. But, no go. Money wasted, which annoys the heck out of me.<br /><br />Maybe I am expecting too much, but the hunt for a better litter goes on. Overall, there are no "cheap" litters especially for the purpose for which they are being used! I cannot believe it is sooooo hard to find 1 litter that does the following:<br /><br />1)  Doesn't track throughout the house<br />2)  Doesn't create a dust cloud when the litter box is being used (if it's not healthy for me, it surely isn't healthy for my cat that is right there using the litter).<br />3)  Covers up odors<br />4)  Doesn't need a gas mask worn when cleaning the litter box.<br /><br />Like I said, I really wanted to like this litter, but I have to give it a negative review. Sorry!
