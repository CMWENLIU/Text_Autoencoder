Ordered over $1,000 worth of can goods for disaster prepardeness.  About 95% of all the cans had minor to major dents in them.  On phone with Amazon.com now to get this problem fixed.  House filled with boxes and dented cans.  Save yourself the trouble and go to store to buy can goods so that you can inspect them first.  UGH!!!
