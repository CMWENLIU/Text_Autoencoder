I bought these noodles because of all the stellar reviews I read. I am not a picky eater. I eat sugar free, low-carb, low sodium, fake cheese, cardboard-like things all the time and like them. In fact, there is no food that I absolutely don't like or won't eat until now.<br /><br />When I opened the package, the first thing I noticed was the terrible smell. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but it's kind of like joint compound or drywall spackle, or something that is definitely NOT food. I figured it might be the packaging, so I spent a little extra time rinsing the noodles than the directions called for. Smelling them again, I knew it was the noodles, but stayed hopeful that parboiling and sauce would fix everything. I followed the directions, and since I love asian noodles decided to dress my Miracle Noodles with good ole soy sauce. The noodles tasted just like they smelled, AWFUL. However, being the daughter of someone who grew up very poor with little food, I couldn't waste them, so I took another bite. The taste and smell mixed with the texture of rubber bands started to gross me out and make my throat clench. I took a breath and looked into my bowl. I own two cats and thought there was a cat hair in my pasta, so like any other time, I plucked it out; no problem. I took another bite, and noticed another "hair." I picked it up and found that it was attached to a noodle. I poked around the bowl with my fork and discovered these strings everywhere. In fact, you know when you clean your hairbrush and you pull out hair balls with spider-like hair legs? Well, I found a "miracle" hairball happily squatting in my bowl. That was my last straw and I had to stop eating. This wasn't the worst food experience of my life, but it ranks up there. Zero gluten and zero calories is just too good to be true. Don't waste your money.
