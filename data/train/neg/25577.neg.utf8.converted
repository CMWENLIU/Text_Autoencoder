My husband always said that the two greatest inventions were duct tape, and WD-40, and many people share this view. Now add to this gg crispbread!!! Some people say they make great sandwiches with peanut butter, tuna salad, or cheese, I even heard they make good pizzas, so I tried these. I didn't like any of them, but not wanting to waste my money, I decided to try some other ways of enjoying these. They really are wonderful after all!!! Throw them on the pond and they make wonderful little rafts for the frogs to sunbathe on, even baby turtles will enjoy a nice sun bath on them!  Why not use them to repair holes in the barn where the grand children decided to try out the old brace and bit and drilled holes? I know mice chew through wood, but believe me it is going to take them awhile to chew through these! Cigarette burn on your coffee table? Just sand it down with with these rough little squares, {Just finish with a fine sandpaper to smooth out the roughness) and re-stain. Glue a few packs of these together and you have a great bulletin board, and if you don't have enough muscle to push the pins into it, just lay it outside the front door to scrape mud off your boots. I like to keep a stack of these on my night stand in case a burglar breaks in. Fling a few of these at him and if they don't do serious injury, they will at the least hurt enough to send them flying for safety. I am thinking of putting in a new patio, mm, I wonder!!!
