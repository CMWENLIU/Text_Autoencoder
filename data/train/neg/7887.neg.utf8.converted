I ordered these somewhat gingerly after reading reviews on the Timothy brand and the defective seals.  Having my fingers crossed I proceeded to make a cup of coffee this morning with my new K-cups.  I got a bad batch and there were coffee grounds everywhere!  What a mess!  I have the rainforest blend and they work great so it is obviously just some of the blends that are defective.  Amazon made it right for me though because of their unsurpassed customer service, but I will still steer clear of this brand.
