The actual Chestnut Cream itself was wonderful. It is a favorite of my mother's from her home country of France. The problem is not with the product, but with the shipping. The first time I ordered it for her, all six cans were so dented in the box that we were scared to open them. The one piece of packing material,a completely deflated ballon, did not keep the cans from rolling around in a box way to large for them. Amazon did resend us the product at Amazon's expense (best customer service ever!), but once again the bag was nearly flat and the can were very damaged...except one and that one was very tasty though it cost $26. My advice don't buy can goods through the mail.
