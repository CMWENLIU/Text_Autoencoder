I loved these noodles. Found they absorb flavors very well and soften when boiled. However, something did not seem right about the nutritional content. I found a video on YouTube ([...]) and discussion forums that discuss these noodles. It turns out that these noodles are mainly made of sodium alginate, a highly processed derivative of kelp. The kelp undergoes a lot of chemical treatment including some at high temperatures to made this powder, which of course resembles the noodles a lot more than does kelp itself. In all likelihood very little of the nutritional value of kelp makes it into these noodles. It is used in the food industry as a gum, but please consider that you are eating a large amount of it in the noodles. It is not good for people with hypertension and people have ended up with upset tummies. Besides we don't really know what the long term consequences of eating this stuff are. It is unfortunate that they can even sell this product. I was not looking for raw food (which it is not), only something low calorie. Now I also am left with several bags that I will have to throw out.
