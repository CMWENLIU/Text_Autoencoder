It wasn't kidding when it said it included aloe vera pulp, and it's not in minced bits.  This is the chunkiest "beverage" I've ever had.  It really is more like a side dish.  The trend of bubble tea and other bits floating in one's beverage must be to blame.  Just a note to those who think this is an elegant green tea:  If you like pulp, expect to chew.  If you don't, expect to spit.  It's actually quite thick.<br /><br />Initially the flavor is nice, albeit a tad bitter, as a back note.  The acidity of the tea and passion fruit--and I suppose the citric acid--is really strong and quickly overwhelms the fruity flavors.  The tea is also extremely sweet.  19 grams of sugar per serving, which if you read the extremely fine print closely, the bottle is 1.3 servings.  How does that work, exactly?  So it really has 28.5 grams of sugar in the bottle.  That's quite a lot for such a tiny beverage.  Nothing healthy about that.<br /><br />For the expense, I'd choose other bottles teas over this one that are less sweet, more healthy, and certainly less chewable.
