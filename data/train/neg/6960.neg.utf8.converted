As another poster mentioned, Nature's Variety decided to change their formula for their Rabbit food.  I had finally found a rabbit diet that my sensitive stomach kitty enjoyed, however when I got my most recent shipment (I was on amazon's auto-refill), I was surprised to find the kernels were smaller.  This led me to do some online research and I discovered that they decided to mess with their ingredients.  I don't know how pork could possibly give this food a "better flavor" than before, but my cats HATE this food.  I have one cat that will eat pretty much anything, except this apparently.  Now I have a $40/12lb bag of food that neither cat will eat.<br /><br />As expensive as this diet is, I had expected better from Nature's Variety and I am sad to say I canceled my auto-refill subscription and now have to find a new diet.  I can't believe that a company that prides themselves on producing a diet similar to what cats would eat in the wild would add pork flavor to their food.  I can see a wild cat eating rabbit, but not a pig!  Also, it would have been nice to see this new formula advertised on their bag of food - I had to find out on my own that they had been messing around.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />Amazon's customer service is awesome.  I inquired about returning the food, and although they do not take returns on grocery items, they did refund the full amount.  I wasn't expecting a refund, but was very pleased with their customer service, this is why I will continue to do most of my shopping on Amazon.com!<br /><br />I have now tried the Instinct Chicken flavor and, while both cats do enjoy this food, I am still wishing I had an alternative protein source (i.e. rabbit or venison) in case the sensitivity was actually an allergy to chicken (I'm hoping it's just an allergy to grains, as this is pretty common).
