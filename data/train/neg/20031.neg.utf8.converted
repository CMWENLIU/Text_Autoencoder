This was my first experience with this brand of coffee. I was stunned when I opened the package this morning. There is nothing to prevent product tampering. The bag is open at the top and fastened with one of those long wire closures that fastens across the opening of the bag. That's it. I didn't have to cut the bag open with a scissors as you do with some brands. There was no cellophane tape holding the flap down as you see in some brands. Since safety seals became standard on food and health and beauty products after the Tylenol scare, I have never received a food item from any manufacturer that provided no form of sealant to ensure that the product can't be tampered with after packaging. I would not recommend buying coffee from Camano Island for this reason. I will not be buying it again, that's for sure.
