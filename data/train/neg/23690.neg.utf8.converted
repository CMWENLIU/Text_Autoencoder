I am obsessed with kale chip lately so I thought I would try these. They were inedible. I was so dissapointed. I could do wonderous things with Kale Chips but apparently Kaia missed the mark. What I didn't know when I ordered them is that they were topped with what tasted like bird seeds. I tried to give the bag away to several visitors but no one would take them!!! They left a terrible taste in my mouth. The only good thing is that they sent me a free apple fruit roll like they knew they had to make up for the chips.
