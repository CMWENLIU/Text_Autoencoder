My wife has celiac disease and we are on the look out for good gluten free products. I bought this for her based on the 3 reviews written here.  There are instructions for using this mix in a bread machine.  I have tried twice to make this bread in my machince following to the letter the directions on the box.  The bread turns out with a tough crust and a very rubber like texture. My wife said she felt like she was trying to eat an old rubber rain boot. Maybe I did something wrong but from now on  I will stick with gluten free pantry or using my own from scratch bread.
