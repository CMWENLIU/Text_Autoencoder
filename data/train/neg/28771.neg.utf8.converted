Although I like to consider myself open to 'cultural cuisine', I found myself spitting this stuff out - after paying about $6 for it at a international marketplace.  My significant other did the same.  I like salty stuff, and I love licorice, but this was just plain nasty.  Not only was it too salty, but it had a terrible rubbing-alcohol-type flavor that went up to my nose and made me wonder if perhaps the candy had been tampered with or manufactured incorrectly.  I went online and read some other reviews...other people have had similar experiences.  I guess it's one of those acquired tastes that has to be developed early.  Oh, those Dutch!! I love 'em (but hate this "candy")!
