Good powdered creamer but geez Nestle ... have you heard all the negative buzz about hydrogenated oils?  While everyone is moving away from this toxic stuff it seems the Nestle execs are asleep at the switch.  As for D&B Nutrition who is selling this through Amazon - have you found someone actually willing to pay this price?  This 50 oz container sells for $5.99 ($4.99 with an often available coupon) at the big box stores.  How could this seller possibly think someone would pay 4x the price for the same size?  Why bother listing the item for sale at all at this price?<br />I love Amazon but I do wish they would remove 3rd party selling items priced such that they are little more then a waste of space and insult to the shopper.
