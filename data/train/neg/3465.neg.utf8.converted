This is for the hardier consumer, taste wise. If you don't mind the flavor of powdered peas, this one is for you. Good texture, good dissolvability. Price is what you would expect--no bargain but not a killer. There is, however, most definitely the flavor of peas there, and nothing really covers it up. I like peas when they are green and I have to chase them around on my plate. In the form of a vanilla, or chocolate, or coffee, or banana, or blackberry, etc., etc. drink?--naw.
