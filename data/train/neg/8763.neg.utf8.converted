Both my dogs love this product, but until the source changes from China I would recommend giving it a miss. Our precious pets deserve the best, and this is packaged and marketed like it is, but Chinese food products, and pet products in particular are potentially very dangerous.<br /><br />I threw out a half a bag when I read where it came from.
