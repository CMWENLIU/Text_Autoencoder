I contacted the company regarding their claim that the product is:<br /><br />"All Natural" and has "No Artificial Anything".<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found these statements to be no more than marketing hype, as the product is not non-GMO.  Even when the Funley's marketing person responded to my query, he re-stated the claims above, then stated that the product is, in fact, not non-GMO.<br /><br />It is arrogant to assume a consumer's memory is only a sentence long--that we aren't "smart" enough to understand that two statements in a short email are contradictory.  Funley's is another company that has abandoned honesty in favor of trickery in marketing.  While the product may be tasty, the marketing is distasteful and dishonest.  There is nothing natural about GMO ingredients; it's common sense.<br /><br />If you are not aware of the problems with Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO), such as preponderance of soy and corn on the market, please visit your favorite search engine and get started!
