These are the worst composed braided treats I have seen. They crumbled in the bag, they are entirely too thin, and don't last at all. My dog worked through the thickest in the pack in less than a minute. He is a small dog. You'd be better off buying a bully stick or another braided brand. Too pricey for how little use you get out of them.
