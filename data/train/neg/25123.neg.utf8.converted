If KONG were a dog I would rub their nose in this product. I bought this product (locally) to use in the KONG ball (which I bought on Amazon). As soon as I got home I put one in the ball. He went to town. I did love the treat. He did go nuts for the taste. The problem is it made him sick and his vomit stained our new off-white carpet. In the time since we have had the carpet installed he has been sick on the carpet before the KONG incident, and the carpet was never stained. This time it put a spot on the carpet the even the professionals could not get out (the professional carpet cleaner was already scheduled to come to the house and they were there the morning after the dog got sick).<br /><br />The product did not work for our dog, but I know it has worked for my parent's dog. Personally, I did go through two treats before I managed to get one whole treat into the ball. I think if KONG is going to make treat to put into their products (which are designed to be tough and rugged) then the treats should be able to actually go into the product without falling apart.<br /><br />In all don't waste your money. I think there are better treats out there that won't fall apart and won't cost so much.
