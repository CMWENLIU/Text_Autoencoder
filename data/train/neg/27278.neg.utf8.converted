I've been trying to find an alternative to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031O4B16">Magnum Jamaica Blue Mountain Blend Coffee, Whole Bean, 2 Lb Bag</a>, because it can sometimes be hard to find.<br />But Reggie's sure isn't it. It's way to mild, mellow, and lacks any real flavor. Might as well be drinking Maxwell House.
