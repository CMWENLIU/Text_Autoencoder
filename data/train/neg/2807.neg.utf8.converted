Following the great reviews for this coffee, I went ahead and ordered it for the office.<br />Out of 15 people, nobody liked it. We tried making it with less and less grounds a few times and it always came very thick and with a extremely strong chicory (like burned wood) flavor which is obviously and aquired taste, so if you havent tried chicory coffee priorly and you are not sure if you will like it or not, and you see the great reviews from people that aboviously had already tried it and liked it, do not take a chance with this since you will get 3 cans, maybe buy one at the store to try it first.<br />We ended up with extra cans to give away. It is really an aquired taste.
