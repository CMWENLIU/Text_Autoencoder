I am a runner and have tried many "energy booster" nutritional products.  This one (cherry) is my favorite for taste and consistency.  I can highly recommend the product itself.  However, while I am a loyal Amazon.com shopper (too loyal! LOL), do not purchase this product here.  I ordered two cases in anticipation of a heavy race season and they arrived REEKING of cigarette smoke.  The smell was nauseating.  As it was an edible item, it is not eligible for return so into the garbage it went.  Buy locally.
