First, you have to gnaw your way through the "certified frustration free packaging," I recommend a steak knife.  Second, you squeeze one dose into eight ounces of water.  Stir and hold you nose as you drink.  Ok, you don't actually have to hold your nose, but the super sweet flavor will go down a bit easier that way.  Finally, wait for the energy to kick in.  Myself, I tried this four days ago, and I'm still waiting.  Pure gimmick, nothing else.  I'm sure it's all full of vitamins as it says, but it certainly isn't full of energy.<br /><br />On the plus side, it has zero calories, sugar, and carbs, so it won't make you fat as you sit there listlessly.  I also have to say that the squeeze dispenser is pretty cool, and there is no mess afterwards.  Nevertheless, I mixed it into 12 ounces of water, and I could barely swallow the thick, syrupy mixture.  The flavor is overwhelming, and nowhere near pleasant.  Give this one a pass.
