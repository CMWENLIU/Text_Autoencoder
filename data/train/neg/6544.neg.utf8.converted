First, I applaud Wellness for coming up with a grain free formula because I think cats are probably better off not eating any grains.  Also I give credit that they left out the menadione.  Unfortunately though, Core kibble proved to be a bomb in my household.  My cats HATE IT with a purple passion.  Also there has been a dramatic increase in barfing episodes ever since I introduced it (and yes I did introduce it gradually).  I could have put up with the very strong and unpleasant odor it fills my house with if the cats had loved it but given the negatives I am going back to my old kibble - Pet Promise.  Mendadione and all.
