I liked the Issimo cappucino drink, so I thought I would give this a try...the taste is horrible! I've had other expresso drinks (both hot and cold), so I thought I knew what to expect, but this tasted so vile that I could barely finish it. The only good thing I can say is that it definitely gives a boost to the afternoon lag.
