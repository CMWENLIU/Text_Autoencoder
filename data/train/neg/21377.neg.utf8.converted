This was advertised as a 2.5 lb gift.  The total food was 20.12 oz or half of what should have been in there<br />The crackers were stale.  Why include a small jar of mustard that didn't go with anything?  The only decent tasting items were the two (less than an ounce) Ghiradelli candies.  Many of the cheese straws were broken pieces.<br />I consider it to be a total waste of money and false advertising.
