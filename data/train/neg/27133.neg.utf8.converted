Buyers should be aware that these are not plain refried beans--they're already seasoned. Unfortunately, I don't care for the seasoning. It's not terrifically strong, but I don't like it and didn't expect it: I thought I was buying just refried beans. I'd much rather season the beans the way I like them. I generally like Amy's products, and I'm a big supporter of organic foods, but I won't be buying these again.
