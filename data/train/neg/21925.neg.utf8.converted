I can't tell you how disappointed I was in "The Switch"!!!  I thought it would be just like another product called "IZZE", which I really like!  WRONG!  The cans were only 8.3 ounces, and had just as many calories as the larger bottle of Izze!  Except for the Orange and Grape ones, they also tasted terrible!  The Black Cherry one was especially bad! It was like drinking a juice box with just a little fizz mixed in! Both Izze and The Switch are pricey, but you'll save more buying Izze.  It'll save your taste buds, too!
