The description of this item on Amazon says these bags are biodegradable.  According to the manufacturer's website, nothing says this is true.  The packaging does not mention this, nor does any thing anywhere else.<br />This is deceptive advertising.  I paid for an item I did not receive. I wanted biodegradable bags.
