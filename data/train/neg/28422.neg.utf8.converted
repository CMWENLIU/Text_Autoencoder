The "Natural flavor" in this product contains processed free glutamic acid, the active ingredient in MSG.  This and dozens of other terms are allowed to be listed as a cover for MSG.  Manufacturers know we don't want this in our food so they call it something else, something we don't recognize.  In addition, "Maltodextrin" is a synthetically created super-sugar and is very bad for your health.  If you care about your health or just want to avoid MSG, don't buy this product!
