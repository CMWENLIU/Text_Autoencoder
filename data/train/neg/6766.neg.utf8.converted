Beware.  These are NOT the original Neccos!  Neccos went "all natural" in 2009.  Lime could not make the transition, so now there are 7 flavors instead of 8.  And the remaining 7 do not look like or taste like the original Neccos. They're faded in color, and I can barely discern white from purple from yellow from orange.  The flavors are just "off".  Not sure why they felt they needed to go "all natural".  I mean it is candy after all.  And the main ingredient is still sugar.  If you remember and loved Neccos, I urge you to contact them at necco.com and let them know how you feel.  Beet powder and purple cabbage in candy.  Who ever heard of such a thing?
