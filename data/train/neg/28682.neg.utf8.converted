I could not find the ingredient list in the Amazon product description, so went to the Spectrum website.  For those of you looking for olive oil mayo due to concerns with soybean and canola oil in typical mayo, beware that soy and/or canola oil is listed as the first ingredient in this product.  Full ingredient list:<br />Organic expeller pressed soy and/or canola oil, organic whole eggs, organic egg yolks, organic extra virgin olive oil, filtered water, organic honey, organic distilled vinegar, sea salt, organic mustard (organic distilled vinegar, water, organic mustard seed, salt, organic spices), organic lemon juice concentrate.
