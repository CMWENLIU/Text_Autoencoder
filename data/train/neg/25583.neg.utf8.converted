The crackers I received were stale and one package had tiny insects crawling out.  Amazon refunded my money but it was very upsetting and it has spoiled my taste for the crackers. However, when these crackers are fresh they are a very good diet aide.  I used them in the past between meals to cut down my appetite.  They are very low calorie and spread with a little peanut butter, tasty.  Unfortunately because of my bad experience I am no longer able to eat them.
