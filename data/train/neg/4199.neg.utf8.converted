I purcahsed this oatmeal variety pack assuming I would receive the various flavors listed in the picture such as banana bread and cinnamon roll.<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />I get a box with just 4 flavors including 13 packets of original. Who in God's names wants original quater oatmeal via packet? If you are going to deliver pain like that, then ad and description should state so accordingly.<br /><br />Will not be making this mistake again.
