I love Cella's dark chocolate covered cherries, but I couldn't eat these. When I opened them they were a grayish white color and they were melted. The liquid was running out from the foil covering. My hands were full of goo taking out the first one. That wS the end of that. Don't like soft chocolate. Put them in fridge to harden and they turned a white color. Threw them away.
