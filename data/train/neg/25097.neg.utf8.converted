I have bought and enjoyed "Newman's Own" brand products for years.  This however has now changed with their "Pomegranate Licorice".  it may be "all natural" but apparently that also means "No Flavor" and a texture that could pull fillings..<br /><br />The smaller print mentions this is the "second generation" so I presume his kids are running it.<br /><br />I love licorice.  This however is only marginally better than gnawing pencil erasers.  The flavor is bland, with only a vague hint of something that might be called "pomegranate" if you had never actually tasted the real thing.  The licorice was stiff and past "chewy" and on into "stale" and is now sitting like lead in my stomach.  I am actually thinking of getting an antacid to counter this stuff.<br /><br />Save your money. "Newman's Own" made a major miss on this one and I don't think their dad would be proud.<br /><br />If you want a really good licorice, try this one on Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7EIKO">Darrell Lea Red Strawberry Soft Eating Liquorice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 8)</a>
