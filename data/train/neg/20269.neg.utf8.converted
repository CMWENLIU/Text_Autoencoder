I have bought cases of Muir Glen tomatoes and they do taste very good, however with General Mill' s large donation against GMO labeling in California I cannot purchase this product anymore.  I found tomato products from a natural food company that is for GMO labeling plus they are in glass jars so no BPA worries!!
