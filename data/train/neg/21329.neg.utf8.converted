I love Boba, but when I recieved this product- one of the bags the seal was broken and the pearls were desintegrated. When I opened the other bag these also fell apart. The color and texture were not what I had recieved before when I mail ordered from another company. (Can't find them now.)Since I paid alot to mail them, I just took it as a loss. Not worth the time and trouble to mail back. I would not recommend this stuff.
