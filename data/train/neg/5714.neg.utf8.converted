I fed my cat, for the first time, a can of Natural Balance Venison and Green Pea wet food. First thing I noticed was she didn't eat it as quickly or enthusiastically as other wet foods. This morning I woke up to find that she pooped in her food dish! LOL, "Message received!", I thought to myself. Seriously, she has never done this before and has been mad at me all day.<br /><br />I don't think she's ever met a wet food she hasn't liked until this. I'm taking the rest back and will never purchase this brand again. What a shame, their website really got me to believe it was tasty, healthy food. After doing some research, found there are mentions on the web about 2 recalls recently involving Natural Balance and many others with similar complaints about cats not liking the taste.<br /><br />One review I read elsewhere summed it up perfectly, "Even if this food is actually healthy, what's the point in serving it if my cat won't eat it?".
