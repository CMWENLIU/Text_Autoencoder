From the time we discovered this product 2 or 3 years ago at a local store (Costco) we loved the product.  Then discovered Amazon, and the Tasty Bite Lentils was one of their Subscribe & Save items, allowing us to set up a purchase schedule and receive a 15% discount and free shipping, making the full purchase price around $26.<br /><br />Then, earlier this year Amazon removed it from the Subscribe and Save and the prices went completely nuts.  The lowest price on Amazon is now close to $37, and believe it or not, you can pay as much as $89 on Amazon for the identical package!  Is that crazy??<br /><br />Costco stocks it regularly in their stores for $6.99 for a package of 4 10oz envelopes.  So for 12 envelopes (the same ones that you can buy here for $37), you can purchase 3 boxes of 4 at Costco for $21.  That is 44% Cheaper than Amazon, I won't bother to compare with the $89 price on the linked product!  Make up your own mind.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007R9L4M">Tasty Bite Madras Lentils Entree, Heat & Eat, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>
