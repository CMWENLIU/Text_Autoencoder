The first two cases I bought were very satisfactory. I mixed the coconut milk into a shake, along with bananas and cocoa and drank it straight. It was great, very fresh. I could use it on anything: salads, etc. The third case I bought had a completely different texture, smooth and creamy versus the flaky, part solid/part liquid texture of the first two cases. Unsure about it, I put a sparing amount in my shake. Minutes later, my stomach starting to act up. It couldn't digest this coconut milk properly. My wife's stomach's reaction was even worse than mine. (I've also had a similar reaction before with another brand of coconut milk, bought much less expensively at an Asian grocery). So then I looked at the ingredients, and lo and behold, there were at the end: "guar gum, stabilizers." Looking back at the description of this item here on Amazon, I see it says "No Preservatives. No Stabilizers." I also have found from other reviews that people have discovered the ingredients have changed. A once-great product is no longer, and in fact, is not as advertised.
