You look at the box and you think -- a way to sneak in more veggies that no one will notice. As good as that might sound, you have to look deeper at this box and the product inside.<br /><br />I prepared this for my family and I was immediately confused by the nutritional list on the box.  Now a non-veggie pasta from Kraft Mac & Cheese has three servings, this listed only two but to be blunt it easily fed three people.  It also listed only one half serving of vegetables per serving in the box so frankly with one box feeding three of us, it was basically adding no vegetable value at all.<br /><br />The taste was basically tasteless. We expect a certain cheesiness from Kraft and this just failed utterly.  It was salty but not cheesy.  The only creaminess was from the milk and butter I added along with some spice when it proved so bland.<br /><br />I could take a nice tomato and/or spinach pasta and add my own cheese mix to get a product that was tastier and healthier.  My family would eat it and be better pleased as well.  No one liked it in my household.
