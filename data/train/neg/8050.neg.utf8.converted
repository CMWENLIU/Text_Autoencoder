Really one of the worse drink mixes for dieting or losing weight.<br /><br />I bought this from the good reviews and the fact that it was sugar free with only 15 calories (i'm sugar sensitive), but I never read the ingrediants and didn't realize it contains a super sugar (technically its not sugar, but basically it is) Maltodextrin, a sugar like substance with the same calorie base as suagr thats 200% more toxic and creates a bigger insulin response with just 4grams in each packet vs 25 grams in a normal sugar apple cider packet.<br /><br />When I first drank this I knew there was something wrong, I immediatly got a sugar high from just 1 cup, I started to gain weight.  I did some research and discovered that the company used malodextrin in place of sugar, this is 200% times worse. It has a glycemic index of 120 while sugar is only 50-60, it gives a insulin response that is equivalent to eating a quarter pound of sugar, I was crashing at work and eating more for no reason, all from the abnormally high insulin response from the malodextrin.<br /><br />Maltodextrin is so toxic that it will keep your insulin levels high for 8 hours afterwards, basically everything you eat will turn to fat.<br /><br />So yes its lower calorie, but the Malodextrin in it is just telling your body to eat more and turn everything into fat.  Horrible, don't buy if you're trying to lose weight<br /><br />On the positive, if your a bodybuilder this is a great pre workout drink, or marathon drink, as the sugar (malodexrin) will easily be absorbed into your muscles
