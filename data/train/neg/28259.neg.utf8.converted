I had high hopes for this company's line of hair products.<br />The prices were good (meaning cheap) and the promises which were made seemed made just for me -- how exciting.<br />My hair, which is brittle, damaged and fragile would as a result look pretty, I imagined!<br />The first thing which I reviewed was a shampoo. In retrospect, I realize that it simply had little effect upon my hair but was beginning the spiral downward which would continue with all the otehr products I have ordered from this line.<br />The nadir was the horrible hair cream in a jar which I tried right before this product arrived. I had already ordered this product.<br /><br />After I used the hair cream, I broke my hair trying to comb it through and I needed to shampoo it over and over to get the grease out.<br /><br />I know that many people of color defended that product, but unless it was written on the jar that it was especially made for certain hair types of ethnic origin the company did a disservice to all of us.<br />I have never felt so unattractive in my life, as when my hair was broken off and ruined by this company.<br />If you, as a reader of this review, think that I, who was not born yesterday, plan to try this final product which I ordered when I didn't realize what could possibly happen if I used one more thing from this company, you don't know me.<br />I review many things, and I truly call them as I see them.<br />The company selling this makes a perfectly dreadful product to my mind.<br /><br />Sorry for the strong words but nobody messes with my hair!
