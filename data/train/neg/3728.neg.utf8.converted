Have enjoyed Annie's White Mac & Cheese very much, but this microwavable variety is more trouble than its worth.  You must use a very deep & wide bowl to use in the microwave or the water will boil over and you'll be left with very hot, uncooked macaroni in the bowl and a starchy mess in the microwave.  It is much easier to make the conventional variety in a pot!
