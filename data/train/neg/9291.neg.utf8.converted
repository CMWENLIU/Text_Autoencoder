I had read the reviews and so I ordered the Good Seasons Caesar Dressing.  I was really disappointed that it didn't taste at all like Caesar dressing.  I do remember reading that one person said that he/she didn't think it tasted like Caesar, but with all the good reviews, I took a chance.  I am just as disappinted in all bottled "Caesar" dressings as well as in the many recipe's I've tried.  Wish this had been "the" dressing, but sadly, it wasn't.
