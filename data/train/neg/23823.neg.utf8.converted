I was very excited to receive this item and was planning to gift it to a tea lover.  However, the bamboo box was filthy - the sides and bottom were coated in dried mud.  The inside box containing the tea was also dirty.  I was worried the quality of the tea would also be poor and did not want to give someone a dirty present.  And then I realized this gift cannot be returned!  What a waste of money.
