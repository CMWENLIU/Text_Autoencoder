I hate licorice flavor.  Half the teas in this pack include licorice powder in them, which ruins it for me.  Why would you add it to the otherwise lovely, fruity flavors of blueberry, mango or raspberry tea? I'm surprised others find these teas to be weak.  As one reviewer pointed out, maybe they were diluting it with too much water.  I love ginger in cooking, and I even like eating pieces of it in dried form.  But in a tea, you expect a hint of it's flavor, not the full strength of the spice. The ginger tea was just too overpowering to the point of being unpleasant.  Although I like the other teas in this box without licorice flavoring, I would not bother buying this sampler box again to get them.
