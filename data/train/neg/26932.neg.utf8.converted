I adore ginger in every form.  Buoyed by the glowing reviews, I ordered three pounds.  Unfortunately, it was not at all as described.  The first bite was bland and too sugary; the after-taste almost medicinal.  I couldn't detect any spicy ginger flavor.  I tried a couple more pieces and found them thoroughly unpleasant.  The store owner was great, however.  I returned the two unopened bags and he/she issued a full refund.  I threw the third bag away.
