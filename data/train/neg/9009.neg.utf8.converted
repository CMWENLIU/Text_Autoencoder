The Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are a huge disappointment as a new product offering from Nabisco.  The cookies have an awful fake chocolate flavor, and the they are chalky tasting and dry.  There was nothing gooey about the center of the cookie.  It was more of the same dry, grainy taste as the "cookie" part.  And at 150 calories for 2 cookies (which are less than 2 inches in diameter) they are not worth eating.  They have 7 grams of fat in two small cookies, of which 3.5 is saturated fat, coming from coconut and palm oils.<br /><br />I will however, give credit to Nabisco for two things.  They did load the cookies with a lot of white chocolate chips so they certainly did not skimp on that ingredient, and the resealable package is a great idea.  The opening for the package pulls apart from the top, and there is a sticky type substance that hold the wrapper in place once you reseal it.  I would not consider it air tight, but it certainly makes a good seal for the package.  I can not recommend these cookies based on the taste, texture, and high caloric intake per small serving size.  I will not be buying these cookies again.
