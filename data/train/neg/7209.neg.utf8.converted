The first time I ordered this the chocolate had a good cocoa smell. It was reddish (more than I had anticipated), but when I baked it, it was a deep almost black brown. The flavor was amazing. I was instantly hooked, however the second time I ordered it I received a completely different product. The packaging was different, it came in re-sealable bags and the cocoa smelled minty, and this mintyness is transferred over to your baked goods. Moreover, the chocolate flavor is weaker, too. I was not happy about this at all. I will not buy from them again, since they send you a completely different product after the first order.
