I am a great fan of the k cups and have tried many flavors. My husband encouraged me to get this and I am not sure what I expected but it was definately not for me. Had a harsh bitter taste and was only made better by adding sweetner. I had orginally ordered it on subscribe and save hoping it would be a winner. Cancelled the subscription immediately. Coffee is such a matter of taste and one should not be put off trying something new becasue someone did not like it. Others giving reviews loved it so it is a very subjective thing. One reviewer stated it had a chemical taste to it. I may describe it the same way but the bitterness came through strong for me. To each his own... Try it you might like it. The hazelnut is so much better!
