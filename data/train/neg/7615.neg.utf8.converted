The label on the back of the nuts warns that the product is manufactured on shared wheat equipment. I have never seen a "gluten free" product that is processed on equipment shared with wheat. Most gluten free products aren't even in the same FACILITY as wheat, let alone the same equipment!<br /><br />Frankly, I do not trust the gluten free label on this product.
