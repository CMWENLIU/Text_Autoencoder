Love these cookies. They taste wonderful. No trans fat, vegan, Kosher, healthy ingredients. So what's my gripe? If you look at the nutrition label on the back of the cookie package carefully, notice that a serving is 1/2 a cookie. And, 1/2 a cookie is 210 calories (different from the info on the Amazon site, but I'm looking at the package right now -- same product, current package). So, if you eat the whole cookie (I dare you to stop at 1/2. I know I can't! I tried.), you've eaten a 420-calorie cookie. Wow. That's a lot. Sorry to burst the bubble. I take one of these to work every once in awhile to eat for lunch (and 420 calories is a large lunch for me), but that's the only way I can eat them. I bought these not realizing they'd counted the cookie as two servings (which is pretty sneaky, IMO), and relied on the Amazon site info, which needs to be updated to reflect current package count. Great cookies, but if calories factor in for you, beware.
