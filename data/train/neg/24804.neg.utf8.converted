I've previously had this on Subscribe & Save (last year) but the next time I went to order it had been dropped from S&S.  Recently noticed that it was back on S&S again and decided to order it.  I received the order fairly quickly and as usual some cans were damaged. To the point that at least one of them I will not be able to open.  Amazon MUST do something about the way they package this stuff.  I discovered another disconcerting thing.  What I received in the can I would not call Chili, but maybe Chili Soup.  Unlike all of the Wolf Brand Chili I have ever had in the past this product poured out of the can.  In the past I would have to spoon out the chili and beans to get it out of the can.  Wolf Brand has reduced the meat and beans and is using more water.  WB's quality has diminished.<br /><br />UPDATED:<br /><br />Since unloading the case I have discovered that every single can is dented, some worse than others, a couple likely beyond opening.  I also wonder if the contents would be safe to eat.  The drop in quality of the product is bad enough but the state of the delivery is unacceptable. I'll be contacting Amazon about this.  They shouldn't sell canned goods if they can't deliver them properly.  Buyer beware!
