So, I thought I was getting a great deal on this product. My fault I guess for not reading the reviews and just going by the Lipton description: "sweetened with honey". Sucralose ... "Splenda" is the actual sweetener NOT honey. The sickening artificial taste ruins what could have been a lovely product. Splenda is not a natural product, has no relation to honey and along with other reviews - also gives me fierce migraines. For an added kick, these are not available for returns. Shame on Lipton! Last Lipton product I will ever buy!
