I ordered these lollipops because I have numerous food allergies. As with most Amazon food items, it was virtually impossible to figure out what actual ingredients were. I was very excited at the thought of being able to be able to enjoy "candy" again though so I went ahead and ordered them. After getting them, I ate a couple the first night and woke up the next morning congested and with a sore throat. I thought nothing of it other than that it was spring-related allergies. I ate a few in the next few days or so though and had the same reaction. I then read the ingredient list and discovered brown rice syrup on it. I am really tired of companies that market themselves as "organic" and "all-natural" sticking GRAINS into everything! Rice is not good for you - and if you have an intolerance to grains like I do - DO NOT buy these lollipops. I have Celiac disease and my body does better without grains and these lollipops!
