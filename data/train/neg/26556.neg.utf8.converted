I bought these as gifts and was dismayed to discover that the description on Amazon very prominently and clearly describes these as "chocolate covered espresso beans", but this description appeared nowhere on the package itself. On the package, in BIG letters reads: ESPRESSO CHOCOLATE BLEND.<br /><br />I asked the people who I gifted these to what they were like and they told me while they were tasty, they were basically three different kinds of chocolate with crunchy bits of espresso bean mixed in.<br /><br />If you want an espresso/chocolate "confection", these are for you.  If you are looking for chocolate covered espresso beans, look elsewhere.
