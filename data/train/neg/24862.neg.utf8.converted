This is absolutely the worst case of false advertising since Ford said the Pinto was safe and since Chips-A-Hoy said there was 1000 chips in every bag.  This coffee in NO WAY is "chock full" of nuts.  I was hoping to find some kind of nut, but no.  No peantus, no cashews, no almonds, no pistachios, no chestnuts, no nothing.  Rather, it's plain, regular coffee.  And bad coffee at that.  Do yourself a favor, and don't get this coffee, with your hopes up, as I did.  It will only lead to disappointment.
