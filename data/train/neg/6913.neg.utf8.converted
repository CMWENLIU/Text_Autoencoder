I like the flavor of the Corner Donut Shop, but the quality of the K-cup packaging stinks. I get grounds in most cups. Sometimes it needs a lot of pressure to punch through the K-cup. Some of the foil lids don't look centered. Wonder what's going on with the quality control over there...very inconsistent.
