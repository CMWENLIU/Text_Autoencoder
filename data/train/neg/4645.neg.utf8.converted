Good concept, poor execution.  Individually packaged pressed granola with chocolate holding it together.  They are crumbly, messy, and not very tasty.  Don't even think about giving them to your children for a snack... What a mess!  Not to mention, over-priced.  I bought them because I enjoy other Nature Valley products, and had a coupon for a new product.  Will not purchase again, would not recommend.
