Of the 4 packages that I received in my April order 2 were expired in January.  The other 2 expired the following month.  I have gotten Spelt flour from Arrowhead mills before and it was great...totally fine.  But I think with something like millet flour, that maybe not as many people use, they must just package up what they have left on the shelf.  Now I know that even though it is a little more expensive at my local health food store, it is worth it because it isn't old and expired!  YUCK!
