"The pu-erh received was lovely. It was aged, ripe pu-erh that had a distinctive honey taste and smell. Very enjoyable!"<br /><br />That is what I wrote the first time I bought this pu-erh. Though I didn't recognize the maker of the tea, at least the box it came in matched the pictured tea on Amazon. The tea tasted great.  I thought that I would get another- but what arrived was totally different.  Different producer and different quality. I would not buy from this source again, as there is no mention of the producer of the tea and no clear description of the<br />tea, as what area in China that it comes from or year it was produced. The first bing-cha was a good value for the money. I'm not sure I can say the same about the second bing-cha.
