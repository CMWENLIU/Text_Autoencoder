Works well enough, but needs to hold about 10% more so you can actually get a whole pound of meat into it including the inevitable air pockets.<br /><br />Also, I needed to replace one of the nozzles (damaged in the dishwasher) and the part at the end of the plunger that pushes the meat out.  Unfortunately, replacement parts are not available for this item.
