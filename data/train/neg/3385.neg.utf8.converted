I was so happy to see the great review on these pills that I threw caution aside and purchased a significant quantity of two flavors for personal use. I wanted to have extra for passing around to my friends. I eagerly tasted my coffee with the flavored pills; absent of carbohydrates, great for chocolate and caramel lovers. To my dismay, even with two pills, my coffee was still lack-luster. Neither the chocolate nor the caramel tasted like the real thing, just another ho hum imitation flavor assimilation lacking quality for the taste buds. In my opinion, these pills are not worth buying. This is too bad because such care went into the packaging. If the product had half the class the packaging does,I would purchase their product for my coffee shop.
