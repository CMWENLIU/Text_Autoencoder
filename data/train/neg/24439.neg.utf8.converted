I bought this because my son loves Bacon and always asks for "double on the Mayo".  He will eat pretty much anything, but this he couldn't stomach.  It was so gross!  He gave it away, and even his friend who will eat anything can't stand it.  Pretty nasty stuff, made from 2 things most people like.  Beware before you buy it.
