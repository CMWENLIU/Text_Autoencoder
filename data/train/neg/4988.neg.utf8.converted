I was sorely disappointed in this purchase.  First, the box the cans came in was terribly torn - as if it had been previously discarded and then re-used for this purchase.  Every single can was dented in multiple places.  The dents were so bad I had to check each can to make sure that it hadn't filled with gas.  Lastly, each can expires in May 2012.  It's as if the store gave me all their OLD merchandise.  I will never make this purchase again.
