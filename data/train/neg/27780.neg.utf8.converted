I contacted Bob's Red Mill by telephone after noticing that the packaging no longer shows Gluten Free. I was told the buckwheat is sourced from one company, and that enough contamination has started occuring that Bob's Red Mill Creamy Buckwheat can NO LONGER be considered Gluten-Free.<br /><br />The non-GF status is also listed in capital letters on Bob's Red Mill website.<br /><br />Very disappointing to me because I had grown to really appreciate the taste of this cereal--even more so than oatmeal.
