I hadnt realized when I purchased this that is said sold individually. It was to my understanding that you got an assortment of 1 of each of the 3 flavors.  1.99 for a lollipop WOULD have been acceptable, if<br />1. The shipping didn't cost 8 dollars. (How hard is it to put a piece of candy in an envelope.  Seriously? thats 40 cents.)<br />2. The candy was received completely unmarked.  It is a single, red lollipop wrapped in unmarked, clear plastic and its TINY. About the size of a Dumdum sucker.<br />3. It says "choose from 3 flavors" and I did NOT get that option.  I just got a random color.  Turned out to be red.<br /><br />Finally, we decided to try the thing and didn't even finish it. It went in the trash.  It smelled like a hamster cage /pet store and tasted more like concentrated oregano than its advertised flavor.  Over all it was bad in every way.  Don't eat this.<br /><br />I still haven't heard back from the seller, even though I contacted them. Based on the other seller reviews, this seems to  be a common issue when there is a problem.  Avoid at all cost.<br /><br />Bad seller. Bad policies. Bad product all around, no matter who you buy it from. "Kush Kandy" is just a gross, sketchy product in every way.
