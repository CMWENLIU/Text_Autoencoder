First of all, the shipping of this item was VERY SLOW!  I had to purchase additional k-cups from the grocery store because this item had not arrived.  It was a day later than what the estimated arrival showed.  Usually everything I order from Amazon is earlier than expected.<br /><br />Secondly, this coffee did not have a good taste.  It was very weak; as if it had been watered down.  This was the Brooklyn Bridge flavor and after reading some good reviews about it, I was very disappointed.  My husband also commented that he could not drink this.<br /><br />Needless to say, I have cancelled my automatic subscription.  I guess it is true; you get what you pay for.
