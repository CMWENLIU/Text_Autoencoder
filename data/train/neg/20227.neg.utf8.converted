These same chocolates can be purchased at a wholesale store for less then half of the price, before you add in the crazy shipping charge.  I found that out after I had placed my order here, unfortunately.  And when they did arrive, they were completely melted, because the delivery person left them out on the porch.  As far as flavor goes, most people that tried them thought they were bitter.
