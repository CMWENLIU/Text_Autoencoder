I bought these hoping to trap the occasional in home cockroach (ours are quite large) but they're nowhere sticky enough to trap a large one.  I managed to chase one directly into a trap and it took but 10 seconds to work its way right back out - and another one that I placed moved about 3 inches from where it was but had nothing in it.  These will probably work fine if your bugs are small but don't count on it to do anything with the big ones.
