It reminded me of cheap Kool-Aid, and it took about seven shots to get anything that looked like tea, or tasted like it. By that time, the taste of lemon was just a tad too strong to really enjoy it. While the tea flavor was too fake tasting, the others might actually be alright. I'll happily take my real sweet tea over this any day of the week.
