I've been buying this product for years and have always loved it.  There used to be three separate packets - the pasta, seasoning mix and the crouton/cheese mix.  There were bits of dried bell pepper and mushrooms mixed in with the pasta.  I just recently purchased the box and was surprised to see that they had changed it.  There were no mushrooms at all, hardly any bits of bell pepper, and now the croutons were mixed into the seasoning.  Now instead of sprinkling the croutons onto the finished product, you're forced to mix them in to the oil/water mixture.  You can guess the result of that, by the time the pasta is mixed the croutons are completely soggy.  I wrote to Betty Crocker to let them know I was disappointed with the reformulation of the product and they assured me that before making such a change they do extensive testing to make sure the changes will broaden the product's appeal to the customer base.  I guess their taste testers like soggy bits of bread in their pasta salad, however I do not and will not be purchasing this product any longer.
