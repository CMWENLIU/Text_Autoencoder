As another reviewer stated already, this is not labeled 'low calorie' or 'low sugar' so I didn't expect it to contain artificial sweetener. I guess that's my fault for assuming, as this does contain sucralose and has a terrible, artificial sweetener aftertaste. I understand that this taste apparently doesn't bother a lot of people, but I absolutely can't stand it and will be returning this product. I feel that this should be disclosed on the package a bit more prominently than just listed on the ingredients (I bought at Meijer, not at Amazon, where I was able to look at the package before purchasing). I know, I know, I should've checked the ingredients. I wish I would've. I'm only writing this review as a warning to anyone else who may be considering the purchase, but like me, hates that fake sugar flavor (not to mention putting whatever chemicals they use for that stuff into their body).
