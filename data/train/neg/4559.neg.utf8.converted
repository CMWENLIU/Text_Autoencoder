I totally agree with the other reviewer.  I bought this (although I bought it with a Harry & David label on it so it was probably more expensive!) and no one in my family liked it.  It is not hot chocolate - more like what they call "white chocolate".  I thought it would be a chocolately orange flavor, yum.  Neither chocolate nor orange flavor.  Only the color is orange.  A big disappointment, I ended up throwing it out.  The cauldron is cute, but the words around the edge don't come off so it's not really reusable.
