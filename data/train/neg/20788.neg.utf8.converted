I was excited to try the pre-made cornbread mix.  However, when I made it using the recipe on the back of the packaging, there seemed to be WAY too little liquid.  I could barely get them into the muffin pan, and then they just held their shape (didn't spread into the pan).  It seemed to have a decent taste, aside from being dry.  So I tried it again using a different recipe, and substituting the mix for the flour in the other recipe.  That didn't work perfectly either.  I have had much better results just doing it with a recipe and cornmeal.
