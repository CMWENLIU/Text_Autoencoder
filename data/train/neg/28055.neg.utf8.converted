I ordered two of these items and gave them to two of my clients over the holidays! I was shocked when they informed me they couldn't eat chocolate because it was bad!  I'm assuming it was "stale" but it could have been worse!  I did not ask them to elaborate, I was too embarrassed!  Apparently the nuts in the package were OK!<br /><br />This is the first time Amazon has let me down!
