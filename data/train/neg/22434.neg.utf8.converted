I really like Jello Cherry Cheesecake and in the past it went from overflowing with cherries, to having just enough to cover the top, but they must have recently reformulated because there are now so few cherries. You can barely call this cherry cheesecake. It might be called "cheesecake with a little bit of red colored topping and a few cherries" I cut it into 8 slices and each slice had no more than 4 small cherries per slice. It didn't even look presentable. If you are planning to buy this make sure you spend a few dollars on extra cherry pie topping.
