I have no idea WHAT people are raving about..I read all of the positive reviews only a half hour ago and thought for sure I could add to them. Now that I am back and have finished brewing a cup of this tea, I find that there has never been such an on point review! A cup of red hots brewed in hot water is EXACTLY what this tea tastes like- I could have boiled some cinnamon sticks from the cupboard and got the same taste. Where are all of the other flavors? Um, not here in this tea, I tell you that much! I am NOT sure if this has anything to do with this being the decafe version, but I will NOT be buying this again. I got through the cup by adding some agave and rice milk, but  I  feell like I just finished a pack of wrigley's red hot gum...what a hot mess!
