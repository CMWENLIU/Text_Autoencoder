You know, I feel so guilty that I had been feeding this crap to my dog for 3+ years and I admit the only reason I did was because I didn't know any better and it was affordable. Why did I not put 2 and 2 together when he stared getting very dry, flaky skin, itchy paws, hot spots, red crusty sores and on top of all that - ear infections? When I started learning about the ingredients in dog food it really opened up my eyes. This food is a sham. They want you to believe it's chock full of beef and vegetables but it's not - it is full of corn (which is a an allergen), flours, fillers, artificial ingredients, fats and sugar with a little bit of beef and veg thrown in at the end. No wonder my dog was having so many problems with his health! I have since switched to higher quality foods with chicken, lamb or fish meal as it's first ingredient. I highly recommend these brands if you want your dog to thrive on healthy whole foods full of nutrients and flavor: California Natural, Innova, Canidae (the old formula), Merrick and Wellness Core.
