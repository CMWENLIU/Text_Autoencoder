I come from a different country and wanted to send a surprise gift for my Mom for her 75th birthday.  She's been living with my sister in California for almost two years now and I thought I should send her something special and extravagant.  I got these multi-colored tulips in a vase because they earned fabulous, five-star recommendations in the website.  However, what happened was, the courier wasn't able to find my sister's house, waited 24 hours before they contacted my sister, and this time, TO ASK HER TO PICK UP THE FLOWERS from the courier's office.  Anyhow, when my sister drove to the courier's office to get the tulips, they weren't as fresh as their worth -- quite wilted, and didn't even have water picks (those small plastic water containers at the bottom of stems) which could've helped prolong the freshness of the flowers.  This gift cost me a day of my salary.  I hope that next time, not another mother gets this kind of gift that my 75-year-old Mom didn't deserve.
