The description ("Product Description" right above) says that hulled barley is also called pearled. This is nonsense: pearled and hulled are two different things:<br /><br />1. "hulled" is whole grain with only the husk removed<br />2. "pearled" means polished (meaning it's low in nutrients, just like it is with rice).<br /><br />What you want is hulled. What you DON'T WANT is pearled.<br /><br />And so, which kind is this product? Pearled or hulled? Why can't the seller post an adequately informative description of their own product? I'll remove this warning once the product description is corrected.
