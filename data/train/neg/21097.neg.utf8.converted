This is not the product I received.  This is what the picture showed and said I would get.  What I received was the older Jolly Rancher Fruit Chews.  Not the ones in the box but the ones in the long candy bar shaped package.  Those are the old ones and they taste different and have less flavors.  This was a bait and switch, no more no less.  I then had to order them again from a different seller, but had to call and make sure I was getting the new ones, in the box.  The news ones, shown in the picture are great.  They are excellent but I don't like the old ones, which is what I got after being deceived.
