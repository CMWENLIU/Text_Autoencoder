I've ordered this coffee a few times. The last batch I got had changed for the worse. It had no butter toffee flavor that the privious batches had, and it had a bad bitterness to it. I would chalk it up to "just a bad batch", however Gloria Jean's has been unresponsive to my multiple customer service request. When you call, they put you through to a voicemail line that ask you to leave a detailed message. I've done this three times with no response. I wouldn't pay for this product again.
