This was supposed to be chocolate? This was awful. It tasted old, dry, and bitter. I didn't even detect chocolate. I tried 3 capsules to be sure I didn't get a defective one. The date on the box was far into the future so it hadn't expired.<br /><br />I was quite disappointed and don't find this to have any enjoyable taste - coffee or chocolate in flavor.
