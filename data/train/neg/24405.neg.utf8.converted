I love shopping at Amazon.com because they usally beat most store and online retailers in price.  I LOVE starbucks coffee but the price here is Outragous!!  Right now you can go to Wallmart.com and get the same item, for only 13.88. See my copy and paste from website:<br /><br />Starbucks K-Cup Pike Place Blend Coffee, 16ct Online $13.88<br />* This home free item ships free with $45order of Home Free items* Free store pickup today<br />- order online now. This home free item ships free with $45order of Home Free items.<br /><br />You can also get The French Roast, Breakfast Blend, Sumatra and Houseblend all for a Low Price of 13.88.  And Free shipping with 45.00 order.  Sorry Amazon, you lost my Business for the coffee.  I will be purchasing my k-cups from Wallmart. Unless you Lower your prices.
