I've been reading the other reviews and am quite perplexed. When I brewed the first (and only) pot and took that first sip I felt that there must be some mistake, no one would have emptied an ash tray into my tea pot on purpose, would they?  I really had to check for cigarette butts.  The taste of this tea...well, is very interesting.
