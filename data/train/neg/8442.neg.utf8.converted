Consumers can do better for less. Iams is $1.68/pound at the time of this review. These are the first four ingredients:<br /><br />Chicken, Corn Meal, Ground Whole Grain Sorghum, Chicken By-Product Meal<br /><br />Now look at Taste of the Wild Venison, also available on Amazon. That product is $1.59/pound at the time of this review. These are the first four ingredients:<br /><br />Bison, venison, lamb meal, chicken meal<br /><br />Iams lists corn, a grain, and a meat by-product within the first four ingredients. Compare that to Taste of the Wild, which lists bison, venison, lamb meal, and chicken meal. ALL meats, and no by-products. Taste of the Wild is the far superior option. Healthier, more natural ingredients to a dog's diet, and cheaper. Make the correct decision, both for yourself and your dog.
