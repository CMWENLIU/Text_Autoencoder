I ordered this cake and was very excited and anticipating its arrival. But then it came and I opened the box and I noticed on the side there was white power on the side (while it was still in its plastic wrapper) like a rotten fruit but I thought maybe it was just the plastic but then I opened it and took a bite and it was horrible. IT WAS ROTTEN. I was very upset because I bought it in Jamaica b4 n it was good so I called Amazon and they refunded my money. Don't think I will be trying this one again. All the other onces are good including: Chocolate, & Original w/ Walnuts.
