I buy organic cranberry beans in 25-50 lb lots. They are a staple in our household. I had hoped to buy some from Barry Farm, and assumed - from their name - that they grew them. After all, they are a "farm," right? Understanding that some "organic" beans come from China, I thought I would call Barry Farms to confirm the country of origin for their beans. The female who took my call told me that they don't know where these beans come from since they get them from a distributor (so much for the "farm" in "Barry Farms"). I asked if she could give me the contact information for the distributor so that I could ask them directly. Her answer: "no". I asked if THEY could find out from the distributor where these beans come from. Her answer: "no". Thanks, but I'll do my business elsewhere.<br /><br />UPDATE: I ended up buying from Italian Harvest - a dot com.<br />SECOND UPDATE: Italian Harvest no longer has an organic Borlotti/Cranberry bean, so this year I purchased from Purcell Mountain Farms, and am very pleased with their product.
