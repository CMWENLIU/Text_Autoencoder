Junk tea.  20% is twigs and chunks of leaves that aren't even rolled.  First one I ordered came in a zip top bag and was OK.  Not a great Keemun (my daily drink), but okay for my morning thermos on the ride in to work.  It came in a plastic coated paper bag with a zip top.  I ran out and decided to order some more.  The second batch (unfortunately I ordered 3...big mistake) came in plastic lined paper roll-down bags like shown in the image.  And it is junk.  I can't even drink it.  It has no flavor.  Forget the fact that there is almost none of the signature Keemun flavor.  There is almost no flavor at all!  If you want to convince somebody that loose leaf tea is worse than Lipton tea bags, this is the stuff to get.
