When I received these key lime snaps I noticed they were ready to expire.  There is no way we can eat 6 boxes of these in 2 weeks.  They are very good and have a great taste.  I am very upset about this product.  I have never had a problem with any products I have bought on Amazon.  I hope Amazon does something about this. A very upset and disappointed customer.
