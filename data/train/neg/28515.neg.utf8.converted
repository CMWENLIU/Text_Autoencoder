I ordered 3 bags, because they came as a pack. When the box arrived 1 of them was open (I assume because they shipped it via air and the pressure made it explode) and it had spilled all over the box so I had to throw those away. The 2nd bag I opened was stale, so I couldn't use those either. I wasted my money on this purchase unfortunately.
