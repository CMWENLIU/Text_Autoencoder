The product arrived within the designated time but the cool packs surrounding the cheese were no longer cool. Inside was a leaflet stating that if this happens then it's no problem essentially and the cheese is still good which may be the case but I would have felt more assured by this product had it arrived cold. I had no idea how long the cheese was left out (non-cold). Other food distributors can manage to deliver their products still cold, why not igourmet?<br />I was particularly annoyed by this as the shipping for this item was so high.<br />I will not order anything that's fresh from igourmet again simply for this reason.
