I've bought this product from Amazon for almost two years for $20.19 shipped by Amazon as an Amazon Prime product.  Amazon no longer carries it directly and the reseller is charging $44 for the same package plus shipping(down this week from $49 last week).  The cocoa is not twice as good at these prices and I wish Amazon would find a reseller whose price is somewhat closer to the old amazon price. This is a very disappointing message from Amazon to its loyal customers.  W. Grace
