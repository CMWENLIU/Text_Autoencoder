I am a great lover of licorice.  And I don't know what this stuff is, but it ain't licorice. It has a strong ammonia taste, and reminds me more of droppings in a cat's litter box than any sort of candy. I've been told this is just a 'different' sort of licorice, and it's meant to be slightly salty, instead of sweet. But I'm not confusing ammonia with salt. This definitely has a urine odor, and since I've never tasted cat urine, I can only guess this is what it would taste like. Don't waste your money. This might make you ill.
