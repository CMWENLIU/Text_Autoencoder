I personally do not care for this beef stew. My mother and niece absolutely love it. I find the gravy a bit greasy. The meat is not whole pieces, but rather compressed ground hamburger. The potatoes and carrots are what you would expect from canned food. I have been stocking up on Bulk Canned food with an expiration date of at least 1.5 years from date of purchase. You would be surprised at how fast some canned food expires! Yes, the economy is collapsing under Obama and his Communist Marxist agenda. Stock up now. The current price and vendor for Dinty Moore Beef Stew is ridiculously overpriced. Do NOT buy your bulk from this vendor "Huggy's Haven". Looks like they pulled the price out from their #$$. They are double the price compared to any grocery store.
