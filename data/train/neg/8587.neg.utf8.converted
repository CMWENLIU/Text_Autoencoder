This product is not good when compares to the one I brought form Whole Food. My eyes were not dry and the dark spots on my eyes were gone after I took the bottle from Whole Food but the one I ordered from Amazon did not work.  The powder seems to be lighter and floating on top of the cup a lot more than the real one.<br /><br />I think this product is not real becasue my sister and I both took it and it did not work. Her dark spots came back and her eyes feel dry again.<br /><br />Worst of all I want to return the one bottle I ordered earlier, since I threw away the wrapping and they won't accept it back.  They want it to be in the manufacture original packaging and in the same condition as I received it.<br /><br />I hope Amazon can check the product from this company. I love to order products from Amazon.  Please help me to feel good about ordering products from you again.  Thanks a lot!
