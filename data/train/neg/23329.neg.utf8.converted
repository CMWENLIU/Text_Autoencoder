I also ordered this item as a gift for someone dear thinking it was clear glass,it turned out to be polythene. I checked on [...] and they have the detail of their products as &lt;Clean glass and (Pet) bottles>. I just want you to add a little more descriptions to items that are made in different forms. That little detail could help your company save on retured items expenses and increase you credibility.
