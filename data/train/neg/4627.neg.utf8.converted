My dog devoured this stuff like she was starved, so I know she would give this product a 5 star rating. As her owner, the only one can read the ingredients, I give it a 1 star.<br /><br />The amount of soybean, soy flour, soy protein, corn products and wheat is, hands down, the worst thing to give an older dog with a weak digestive system. The product may have all the vitamins and supplements needed for a balanced diet and yes, it does have "gilled sirloin steak flavor", but it's not a good everyday meal for my dog. Also, the poultry by-product meal ingredient just grosses me out.<br /><br />The $9.99 price for 4.5 pounds might also be cost-prohibitive for most dog owners. So, much to my dog's dismay, this is not a product I will be purchasing for her in the future. (Sorry Millie!)
