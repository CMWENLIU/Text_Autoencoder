We used this product for many months only to find out recently that it had elevated inorganic arsenic levels equal or higher than the FDA standard for drinking water.  The company refuses to publish testing results, likely out of fear that they are higher than what the Dartmouth study revealed.  This company is not honest with its customers.  AVOID AT ALL COST.  My daughter will be tested for arsenic shortly - I repeat this company is not ethical - go to their facebook page and see the number of unhappy parents.<br /><br />Do your research and find another formula.<br /><br />P.S.- 2/27/12 - The Canadian version of the FDA has issued a recall on all Nature One products.
