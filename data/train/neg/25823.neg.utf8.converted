Fed these to my 40 pound jack russell/beagle mix male dog.  He got sick and threw up.  He is a tank and can eat pretty much anything.  I had purchased them in 2007.  I put them away in my cupboard and then heard about the recall and never took them out till tonight.  I just wanted you to know that if your dog starts to vomit or not feel right, STOP FEEDING THE TREATS TO HIM.  Bag says PRODUCT OF CHINA.  And is one of the recalled items from PetSmart where I bought them.  Listen to your instincts and stop feeding him the treats at any sign of illness.
