On the Amazon page where these items, the Corn Husks and Masa Harina,  are shown it is stated that they are Kosher.<br />When these items arrived they didn't have the Kosher symbol on the package. I contacted the Kosher agency that supervises this name brand, they informed me that for products from this company to be Kosher, they MUST have the Hechsher, the kosher symbol, of this agency. Because of this I was unable to use these products.
