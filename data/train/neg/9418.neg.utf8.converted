I've been buying raw & unfiltered honey for years, from local market, Trader Joe's, and Whole Food. I seriously doubt this is raw and unfiltered honey. The raw & unfiltered honey I bought elsewhere "ALL" looked whitish and murky. When I used it with coffee, you can see some oil floating to the surface of the coffee. The coffee cup always leaves a oily residue which is not easy to wash even with detergent. I don't get that with this product at all. In fact I don't even need detergent at all. Unfiltered raw honey should have pollen, propolis, wax, and live enzymes rich in nutrient. This honey taste like regular honey except it crytalizes way too easily. I recently took this product to a local farmer and I was told this is definitely not unfiltered raw honey. I also took this honey to a famous honey producer in Delaware and I was told the same thing.<br /><br />For those who wrote positive reviews for this product, please do some search to see what unfiltered raw honey should look like. Some of you got cheated and you don't even know it. Unfiltered raw honey should look like creamy lard, not dark amber liquid that crystalizes easily. This is what Trader Joe's told me.
