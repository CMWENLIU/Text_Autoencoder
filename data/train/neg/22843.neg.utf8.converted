Coffee is fine.  But I won't buy again.  As another reviewer reported, this is not a standard K-Cup design.  Simply a paper filter below a plastic collar.  Shorter than a K-Cup, so doesn't come in contact with the bottom punch.  Water flows through the filter and into the cup . . . albeit at a faster rate than being forced through the small bottom hole of the standard K-Cup.  Do not attempt to brew a large cup, it will be too watery.<br /><br />Twelve servings come packed in a vacuum packed plastic bag.  When you open the bag, all twelve containers are exposed, so you'll need to repackage them in a zip-lock bag if you want to keep them fresh.  They do not fit in the standard K-Cup carousel.
