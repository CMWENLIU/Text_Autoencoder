I don't usually drink energy drinks and I stopped drinking caffeine a little over a year ago, but had a long drive and I was exhausted so decided to give this a try. It worked great for the first 2-3 hours. I had a boost in energy, was more alert and felt fine, but into the 3rd or 4th hour my heart started racing, broke out into a cold sweat and was horribly jittery. When I got home my head started spinning and I couldn't sit down for hours. It was the worst feeling ever. I seriously felt like I was overdosing on a drug. Finally after 7 hours I felt a little better and was finally able to fall asleep, but all into the next day I felt horrible, entire body ached, felt unrested and still jittery. I know not everyone will react the same way, but be careful with this stuff. I did a little research afterwards and found information that suggest it is possible to OD on caffeine and Vitamin B. Maybe the percentages in this drink were just too much for me.
