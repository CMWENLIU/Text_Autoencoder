My cats have eaten this food for years, I usually buy the orange box with the chunk of meat. I sometimes buy different flavors. About two months ago I bought the kind that is chopped up I bought it before a 100 times, but this time my one cat developed vomiting, and then he vomited so bad he started throwing up blood tinged vomit. I was so scared. My other cat got diarrhea. Anyway, at first I thought my one cat vomiting could have eaten something else, it was a guessing game. So in 3 days my cat got well again thank goodness. So time passed and I bought the orange box of food nothing happen. Then last week I changed out to the chopped kind in the light purple box and the same thing; cat vomited so bad I had to feed him honey water to keep his sugars from dropping and keep him hydrated, and my other cat diarrhea again.  It has to be this food and I swear I cannot understand why all of a sudden both my cats get ill from this food unless it's bad some how, certainly they both didn't develop a allergy at the same time, so I bet the food was toxic. I'll never buy again.
