I didn't realize that it had so much artificial color in it and mineral oil. These are things I try to stay away from. However, I have used the product for about a week now. I plan to throw it out.  I really haven't seen any difference other than my scalp itching like crazy and green residue everywhere. I am disappointed that it is not an all natural product.
