We've had several nylabones for our dogs.  They loved chewing on them and the bones seemed to hold up very well--until a piece broke off and lodged in the small intestine of my dachsund.  Since it's plastic, it doesn't show up in x-rays and the blockage wasn't identified until it was too late.  Always supervise your pet when they are chewing anything that can be chewed up!
