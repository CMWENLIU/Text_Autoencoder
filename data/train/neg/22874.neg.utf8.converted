When I got these, I couldn't contain my excitement and I ate about a quarter of a bag.  Scenes from the movie 2012 could have been filmed inside my gut.  There would have been less pressure to make two winning free throws in the NBA finals than for gas to escape my bowels.  After a few hours, I had an EXTREME build-up of gas with no relief.  All I could do was lie on my bed and pray for a fart.  That might sound funny, but when you've eaten something that has basically turned you into the blueberry girl from Willy Wonka, you're pleading for relief.  Well, the farts came and I lived through it but I not only had a visit from the fart fairy, but the sales rep from Montezuma's Revenge stopped by and gave me a FULL demo of their services as well.<br /><br />In retrospect, eating over a pound all at once wasn't the brightest thing I've done (but it also wasn't the dimmest).  If I go back and finish the bag off, I'll probably leave a suicide note.
