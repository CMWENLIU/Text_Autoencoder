The product arrived and it is not as pictured or described.  The Smarties logos visible on the box and the individual necklace packages that are seen in the product picture ARE NOT on the box or packages that I received.  It looks identical except for the absence of the Smarties logo.  The product itself, needless to say, is not made out of Smarties.  A case of bait and switch?  Thank you Amazon for refunding my money!
