Couple of years ago a friend of mine gave me some lichee tea that he brought from China. That tea tasted absolutely wonderful, so when I ran out of it I decided to get it from Amazon. Unfortunately I couldn't find the exact same tea, but I figured that lichee tea from china shouldn't be that different from one another, so I ordered Golden Sail brand Lichee Black Tea. Well... what can I say? the difference is huge. This tea is by no means the real thing. It is a decent black tea and I'll drink it, but it's more on the bland side, it has nothing of the wonderful aroma and sweetness of the lichee tea that I had before.
