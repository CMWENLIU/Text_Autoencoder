I have to assume that since the quantity seems not to be listed this product is pricey.<br /><br />Too bad that Amazon doesnt insist on basic facts about a product in the listings.  Like quantity.<br /><br />It would be super if they showed the percent of adulterants added to the black currants.<br /><br />Maybe Amazon could even insist on a Nutrition label be shown.<br /><br />Would information about food hurt sales?  We read labels in supermarkets so why not here?
