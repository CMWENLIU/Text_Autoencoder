I purchased these nuts based on prior reviews and because they seemed like a good value for my money. Boy, was I wrong!! The nuts were very small with black areas, not all like the picture. They were also tasteless. I would be ashamed to put these nuts into a salad or other dish where they can be seen. And I am sure they would ruin the taste of pesto. The old saying true: you get what you pay for. These nuts are cheap and lousy.
