If I had known this baby food product was made in Mainland China, I would not have ordered it.<br />We refuse to give our baby this product due to the negative publicity plastered all over the news associated with tainted infant formula and other food products made in Mainland China. I own other items made in China but food products are something that I refuse to consume.<br /><br />I went back and re-read the description on the Amazon.com website and did not see a product origin. Isn't there a disclosure requirement for retailers to disclose from where products they sell are made? (silly me!)<br /><br />We both ate packs of the rice crackers while I did whatever research I could on the factory in Guangzhou, China that made this rice cracker. Not much came out of my simple desktop research -<br />1) a letter from the FDA regarding claims on the box: [...];<br />2) import refusal letter from FDA:<br />[...]<br /><br />Funny thing, the rice crackers actually taste good. And, I am still around to write this review. However, in my kitchen, I have six boxes of Baby crackers that I will probably not eat.<br /><br />In the mean time, I will search for and purchase a baby teething cracker made some where other than Mainland China. Maybe I'll walk to a local Wholefoods rather than buy baby products from Amazon.com.
