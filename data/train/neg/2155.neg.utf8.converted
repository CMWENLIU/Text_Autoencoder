I didn't care so much for these crackers.  I know that they are supposed to be better for me, but I suppose I'm a die hard Cheese It fan.  I like the Kashi granola bars because they are definitely healthy and chick full of good ingredients, but these had a weird aftertaste and the texture was a lot like the reduced fat Cheese Its.  I didn't like the flavor and they were pretty bland anyway.  Sorry, Kashi.
