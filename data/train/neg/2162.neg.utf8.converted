There is no caramel flavor here to be found, unless you add your own. The coffee itself is good but it is very disappointing if you are expecting it to taste like caramel. For people who dislike flavored coffee this might be a good choice (though why would those people be looking at this product I'm not sure...) The description has one thing right - "hint of caramel". With this subtle a hint, I don't think anyone would guess it was caramel flavored coffee without reading the label.
