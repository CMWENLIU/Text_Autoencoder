Let me start by saying that I LOVE okra.  I grew up eating okra dishes my mom made and I can't get enough.  I'm also lazy, so when I saw that I could get pre-made okra in a box, I had to try it.  There are a bunch of other MTR boxes I've tried and some (like the pongal) are actually pretty good.<br /><br />The Bhindi Masala was terrible.  First, there is almost no okra in the box at all.  There is an occasional bit of green floating around, but for the most part, the package is full of some dark brown sludge that looks like an oil spill.  Second, you can probably guess why the sludge looks like so oily...the package has a ridiculous amount of fat.  I thought that veggies were supposed to be healthy!<br /><br />Regardless, try some other MTR boxes.  Bhindi Masala is definitely one to skip.  Anyone out there want the remaining boxes from my 10-Pack?
