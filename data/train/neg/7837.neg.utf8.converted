I have recently started composting and have searched for several months for compostable bags that are sturdy enough to last until the bag is full. I have tried a few different brands, and so far been disappointed with bags that begin to break down as soon a bit of food scraps are thrown in, which makes for a yucky clean up at the end of a day or two when the bag is full and ready to go in my compost bin. I thought I had finally found a bag that was exactly what I had been looking for when I received these EcoSafe "Compostable Bags". They were sturdy and well made, and at the end of a couple days in my kitchen compost pail, they had not broken down at all! They were perfect. But, like my mother always said, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. The reason these bags didn't break down in my compost pail is because they are not compostable at all! They don't break down in the compost bin either. I wondered what was going on, so I did a little research and discovered that these bags have no business going into a compost bin. They are made out of plastic and not "green" at all.  They "bio-degrade" into tiny pellets of plastic.  Personally, I do not like toxic plastic in my compost, being absorbed by my fruit and vegetable plants, so needless to say I am once again disappointed and feel that these bags are being falsely advertised as compost bags.
