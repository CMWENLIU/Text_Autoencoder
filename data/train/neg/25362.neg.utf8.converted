Reading the other reviews, I wonder whether I got a stale box! My tea tasted bland and even dusty. I couldn't taste the slightest bergamot. It was like something you would drink when you're camping in the boonies and it's raining and you have no other way to heat up. Like something out of one of those giant yellow Igloo dispensers you see at tailgate parties on foggy November mornings. I would rather drink hot water. After I tried this, I dumped out my mug and threw the box and its 15 remaining organic tannin packets into the compost! Ashes to ashes.
