I found Mountain Zevia undrinkable.  I purchased it as a 6-pack when it was on sale.  I like the Zevia Cola and figured I'd try this since I love Mt Dew, Sprite, Squirt but this stuff is nasty.  I couldn't finish one can and am throwing the rest away.  So far the only Zevia drinks that I've liked have been the Root Beer and the Cola.
