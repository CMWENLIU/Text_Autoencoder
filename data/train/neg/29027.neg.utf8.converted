Being a cinnamon candy nut at Valentines, I was pretty excited to learn Jelly Belly had SIZZLING CINNAMON beans. Figured they would be hotter than the regular cinnamon, which to this Texas taste bud girl just is not so hot.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there's less of a cinnamon bite in these than regular cinnamon.  So if you like hot cinnamon candy, keep looking!<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, February 2009
