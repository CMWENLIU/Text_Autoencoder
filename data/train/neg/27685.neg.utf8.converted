We purchased this thinking we were getting a healthy breakfast alternative. I wish I had read the ingredients first. (my bad)<br />This product is extremely high in both sodium and sugar, a very bad combination to start your day. In fact, it has more sugar than many junk cereals that you find on the grocer's shelf.<br />To me, this borders on false advertising on the part of the manufacturer.
