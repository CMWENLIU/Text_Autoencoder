I purchased this item for my 3 year old, after reading the reviews online.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  I purchased both the strawberries and bananas by this company and BOTH were SOFT, not crunchy...from the very first time I opened the package!  The strawberries came in a two pack, so I immediately opened the other pack thinking the first one was just a bad batch...no, those too were very soft and chewy.  I purchase these (expensive) items because I expected them to be crunchy like the small one serving packs I purchase at Walmart.  Not even close.  Kicker of this all...you cannot return food items for a refund (this was our first time purchasing food through Amazon so I did not realized this until I went to send them back).  Not a good buy...
