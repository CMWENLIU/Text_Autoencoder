The 3 packs of cocoa I had ordered were packed so sloppy that one of the cocoa packs broke during transit.  Needless to say the mess it created in my kitchen when I opened the box.  I sent American Spice 2 emails and complained about the broken package.  Obviously American Spice does not have time for their customers; they never bothered to acknowledge receipt of my emails.  This was my first and my last time doing business with American Spice.
