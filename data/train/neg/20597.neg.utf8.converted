My previous experience:<br />100gram bags, multiple ( 4 bags) from a ( now closed and gone) Japanese Market, priced at less than $6.00 per bag. At the time of purchase, I did see two other brands available ( they were in Japanese, so I really couldn't read them), but they look similar to this one, crushed, so I didn't buy.<br />I own 2 cats: one very easy to feeds-will try and usually eats ANYTHING put down before him/the other VERY PARTICULAR, usually sniffs but won't eat.<br />They both LOVED the bonito I have purchased in the past. Neither will eat the 'crumbs'/dust found at the bottom of the bag without it being mixed with water and turned into a paste.<br />I've been know to sample a little, for a little protein.<br /><br />REVIEW: Look at the photo of this item. Do you see how the product appears to fill the bag? It SHOULD when it is in it's prime. I received my two bags ordered and there was WAY too much air space in the box! The bonito was compacted in both bags. I hope they were compressed, but not crushed, but alas, that was not to be. I usually pull out (kind of with a pinching motion)/pluck about 1/2 cup loosely placed easily. This stuff was so distroyed, it just fell from my fingers because the pieces were far too small to "pluck" from the bag. I wouldn't buy this again now that I spent the time and hunted down a Japanese Market. Or maybe if the store burned down/closed down.<br /><br />BETTER SOURCE, if you can travel there: I have since hunted down a new Japanese Market, Japantown in San Jose, California. I didn't have time to search San Ramon, CA, but I did look in Fremont and Newark area, with no luck. All locations have large populations of Asians [I'm Chinese and yes, I AM using THAT TERM-get over it!] I searched the web for locations, so there might be closer locations somewhere, but I don't know where.<br />I bought multiple bags varying in price and found:<br />LEARNED: Price you pay doesn't matter. LOOK at what you are buying. Dust/Crumbs are ALWAYS bad news. A smaller bag with bigger flakes is more desireable. I paid up to $8 a bag, and STILL found the under $6 a bag better in quality (bigger flakes, less dust). The checkout girl had a cat and SHE RECOMMENDED/suggested the one I and the cats liked best, both in quality and price thing in this case. FYI, I found a 40g bag with narrower slices, blue label, but it didn't seem to taste as good for some reason.<br />BRAND doesn't matter. My original bags appear to be the one pictured, that is why I bought it. I guess they could of been crushed BEFORE SHIPPING or in transit from too much jostling.<br />I hope this helped someone in their quest.<br />End note, buying this DOES beat paying the price for the FAR overpriced stuff at the pet store by far.
