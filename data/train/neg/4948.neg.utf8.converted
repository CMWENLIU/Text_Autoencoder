I was excited to purchase this product because gluten free oat bran has not been available in the US until now...gluten free oats, yes...but not oat bran.  For the past two years, I have been purchasing my gluten free oat bran from Canada and have been very pleased with the quality of the product and their customer service.  However, I thought I would try this company to minimize my shipping costs.<br />I received the product quickly; however, when I opened the plastic bag which contained the oat bran, there was a faint, but distinct, odor that I can only describe as sour milk.<br /><br />I notified the company via e-mail through their website and questioned what I might be smelling and whether I received oats that may have gone rancid.  When I did not receive an answer after a few days, I notified them again and added my complaint of poor customer service.  I received an e-mail and a telephone message assuring me that their oats were fresh and had a shelf life of another eight months.  She further explained that they were raw, unprocessed, unsteamed oats and very nutritious.<br /><br />Okay, I thought, so maybe oats that are raw, unsteamed, unprocessed and nutritious have an offensive odor. I am always open to eating foods in their most natural state.  For a few days, I ate the oat bran each morning even though it had a sour, as well as a sweet taste that I am not accustomed to.  I e-mailed the company again to let them know that the odor and taste did not seem right to me.  I asked if they would describe to me the odor of raw, unprocessed, unsteamed oats; but after a week, they have not responded.<br /><br />So either raw, unprocessed, unsteamed oat bran smells like sour milk and has a sour/sweetish taste or the oat bran that I received was rancid.  I guess I'll never know since they won't describe to me what it should smell and taste like.  Whatever the case, I won't buy it again.  I didn't enjoy the taste, as well as the odor.
