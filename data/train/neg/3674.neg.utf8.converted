By initial appearances, this looks like it could be very good.  Sweetened by honey - good, natural - good, but then take a look at the actual ingredients.  Not much natural about this.  Sure honey is one of the ingredients, but so is sucralose.  I know plenty of people are fine with this or use it as a substitute for sugar for dietary reasons, but I can't stand the stuff.  The mix of different tastes (tea, pomegranate, sucralose) is very unpleasant to me.  Of course tastes vary between any two people and you may enjoy this, but be aware that it does contain artificial sweeteners if that is not what you are looking for.  I have also tried the Mango version and although it also contains sucralose, it is a bit more tolerable.
