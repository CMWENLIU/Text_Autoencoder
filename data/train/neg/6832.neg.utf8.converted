This is probably good organic coffee in whole bean form.  It seems pretty fresh, even for ground coffee, and it's roasted the way I like it, which is medium-light.  The flavor (once you get some, more on that to follow) is mild.  It does have a weird aftertaste, which may be from the pods themselves or from the packaging.<br /><br />Mostly, though, this is a wasteful, expensive way to brew a cup of coffee, and it undoes all the good of using organic, fair trade beans.  It's a packaged coffee inside a package that's inside a package of packages.  This wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if the amount of coffee inside the pod were enough to brew a decent cup, but it isn't.  One pod brewed as recommended doesn't hold your cream and tastes like what you'd get at your great-grandma's house in outstate Minnesota.  You can read the date on a penny at the bottom of your cup.  Brewed according to the directions, this is worse than no coffee at all.<br /><br />Two pods in ten ounces of near-boiling water for 4-5 minutes makes an okay mug of coffee, but you use twice as much packaging and spend twice as much money.  Two stars for the fair trade.  No stars for anything else.
