Please DO NOT BUY THE CANNED FORMULA.  IT CONTAINS BPA!  The BPA is in the inner coating of the metal cans.  According to Similac/Abbott Laboratories, the larger RTF plastic container is BPA Free - just AVOID THE CANS!!!<br /><br />I wanted to pass this information along to other moms/dads.  I am not an activist or someone who believes my child will never come in contact with a dangerous toxin.  But geez, as a society we go out of our way to make sure BPA is not in our baby bottles only to find out the my son is drinking the stuff!<br /><br />If you are like me, I was desperate to find a formula that would not cause my child pain to digest (like my breast milk & other formulas).  Sleep deprived and desperate to get out of the house, I thought the can RTF was a god send.  (Especially b/c my child didn't like the powder.)  I can't believe I have been using this product for 5 months.  SHAME ON SIMILAC!  Words cannot describe how truly angry I am.<br /><br />Every other RTF they sell is in BPA free plastic.  I feel like as parents of children with special dietary needs, we have been prayed on b/c we are desperate & could not use our power of the free market to purchase another BPA free brand.  I am just disgusted.  As a mom, I felt I needed to warn other parents of SIMILAC REPULSIVE AND UNNECESSARY PRACTICE.<br /><br />I wanted to post Similac's website just so you don't think I am some nut.  They conveniently don't list the metal can formula in their list of BPA free products. [...].
