Should have read the reviews on these Haribo Sugarless Gummy Bears before I ordered them. I've always loved the "Haribo" brand, and have purchased the regular ones in nearby retail stores. When I saw these sugarless ones on Amazon, I immediately ordered them thinking that since they were sugarless, they would also be less calories. They arrived yesterday, and after consuming only a few I developed severe abdominal pains within a very short period of time. I had a feeling that the cause was from these gummy bears. It wasn't until I finally read the reviews on this item that my suspicions were confirmed. Since there is a "no return policy", this bag of Haribo Sugarless Gummy Bears is headed to the trash. Yes, I have learned my lesson, and that is to read the "reviews" before I purchase a food item. I hope Amazon will read the reviews for this item, and remove it before any more of their customers suffer from the "Gummy Bear's Revenge".
