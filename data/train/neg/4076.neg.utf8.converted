I couldn't wait to have decaf english breakfast tea k-cups!  I was so disappointed when they arrived because the tea leaves must be too tiny as they end up coming out of the k-cup during brewing and you end up with almost the entire k-cup of tea leaves floating in your tea cup.  YUK.  I am so disappointed.  I wish someone would come up with a good decaf k-cup of english breakfast tea... please!
