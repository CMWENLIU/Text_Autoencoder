I excitedly bought this sauce before I realized that this is a California company posing as an Italian exporter of real San Marzano tomato products.<br /><br />It was simply awful. I paid 7 dollars for a jar of sauce that was no better than Ragu.<br /><br />I usually make my own sauce, but since I 'thought' that I was buying something made with actual San Marzano tomoatoes, I decided to try it.<br /><br />At the same time, I bought their canned tomatoes. Just the worst!<br /><br />If you can't get the real thing, such as La Bella or other real Italian brands, stick wth Progresso.
