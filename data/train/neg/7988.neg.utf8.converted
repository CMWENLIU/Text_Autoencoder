Somehow the marketing giants successfully sold flavored coffee as 'gourmet', though there's nothing gourmet about artificial vanilla flavoring.  The best part for coffee vendors is that they can sell inferior quality beans because the vanilla flavoring will cover it up.  If you actually enjoy the taste of coffee, then get real gourmet beans -- 100% arabica beans that have been roasted in the last couple weeks if not days-- not the cheap stuff that is covered with a sickly sweet flavoring to cover up the burnt rubber tase.  If you like this type of flavored coffee, then save yourself some money and buy a big, cheap can of folgers and a bottle of vanilla syrup.  At least that way the vanilla flavoring won't linger in your coffee machine.
