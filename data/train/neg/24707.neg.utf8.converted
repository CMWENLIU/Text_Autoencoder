I ordered this "caramelo de coca" thinking it was the common candy found in Ecuador.<br />The brand that I used in Ecuador to cure my high altitude sickness was in a light green<br />wrapper with a brand name KESHUA or KESHWA ? The wrapper did not stick to the candy like<br />the caramelos I received in my order that seem like they were wrapped in somebody's back<br />yard or quaint kitchen. The one from Ecuador ( labeled as a product of Peru ) was a pleasure<br />to eat, but the one I received in my order was frustrating to eat.<br />If this firm ever gets the brand I mentioned, I would be happy to reorder as it helped me<br />for high altitude use in Ecuador and in the Northern mountains of New Mexico.
