The changed the recipe from Rich Chocolate Flavor to something that smells like gym socks and fish and has no chocolate flavor at all. It tastes like beet juice and leaves a horrible aftertaste. I had used Ovaltine from the time I was a little kid until they played that dirty trick on long time customers. I will not be buying it again.
