I bought a case of this vegan alternative to fried chicken, then tried cooking it in a variety of styles, methods, and venues--and always it came up short. That is to say it tastes NOTHING like chicken, fried or not. Each of the 5 pieces in a can resembles a flat drumstick, but that's where the similarity with real chicken ends. It tastes more like compressed dough dipped in a beefy gravy, more reminiscent of bland cat food than K.F.C. (not that I ever tried bland cat food). I would recommend passing up this entr&eacute;e and look for something more palatable like...real vegetables!
