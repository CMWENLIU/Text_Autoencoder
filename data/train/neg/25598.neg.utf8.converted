I truly wanted this bottled, flavored water to taste great.........BUT IT DOES NOT!  The aroma is delicious but the flavor is just plain water.  To try to make up for the poor quality of the product and the money I wasted buying it, I tried filling the bottles for reuse with my own filtered water but it just tasted musty, like it was going bad...really bad.  So I ended up just recycling the nice bottles.  As far as flavor goes....there is not any flavor, none at all.  It turns out to be just an expensive way to drink bottled water.  Not worth it by any means.  I don't know how the other reviewers could come to different conclusions but in my opinion....this bottled water is a big waste of money and I will never be buying it again.
