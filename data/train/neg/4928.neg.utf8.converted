nor is this item healthy. first, the 'chocolate' bits here do NOT taste all that good. in fact, they taste like the cheapest chocolate you've ever bought on a whim to satisfy a craving (or worse). second the chocolate bits are heavy and sink to the bottom of the bowl. you won't actually get much of the chocolate in the same spoonful as the flakes. finally, the chocolate is waxy, it doesn't melt in your mouth and it's made with a trans-fat.<br />personally... I'd rather buy, chop &/or and shave a REAL 70% or higher chocolate bar & sprinkle that on plain special k.<br />I guarentee it would be a hell of a lot better & healther then this junk.
