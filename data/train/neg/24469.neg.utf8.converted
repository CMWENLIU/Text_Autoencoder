The reason why I went looking for Lady Grey Tea is because in December Trader Joe's discontinued their Dutchess Grey Tea. This was one of my all time favorites. So I did some research and ended up at this product and bought the 6 pack box. It's NOTHING like Dutchess Grey. Dutchess was deep, dark and flavorful while Lady Grey is bland and kinda watery. It reminds me of 7-up actually. I'm not sure what everybody else is raving about. Anyway, if you feel you must buy it, I suggest just getting the one box to try out first.
