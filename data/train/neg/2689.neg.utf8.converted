This is great if you need to be wheat free; however, it's gross if you like a good flavor.  We loved the cream of mushroom soup and since my daughter had loved cream of chicken before she needed to be wheat free, we thought this would be fantastic.  I cannot even begin to describe the taste.  We tried to pour this over different casseroles and the results ended up being thrown away.  Just not good and you cannot even begin to eat as a plain soup.  Doesn't even begin to taste like chicken.<br /><br />If you want a good wheat free creamy soup for casseroles, try Healthy Valley cream of mushroom.  Just a hint of mushroom, so great for those that aren't fans of mushrooms.
