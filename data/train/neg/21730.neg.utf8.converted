I ordered this tea while purchasing my usual order of Earl Grey & Irish blend. Because I enjoy the others so much, I thought this may be a great discovery.  For me it was not.  It smells like horse hay & tastes (to me) like I would imagine barn shavings would, were I to collect them & steeped them in a tea ball.  I gave it all away (I bought 6 cans in bulk!!)
