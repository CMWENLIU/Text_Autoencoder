Well what a disappointment...the bags in two of the rolls were just tubes, not bags????  I didn't bother to check out all 120 bags, just tossed the bunch.  Good thing these were for cleaning the cat's litter box, it would have been bad news to have been outdoors "scooping" after a dog. Should have returned them but for $7 it was not worth my time.  I will stick to their blue bags.
