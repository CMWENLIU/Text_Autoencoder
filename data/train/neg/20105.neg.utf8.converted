I bought this product and read the tiniest print on the label after chewing the first piece. The label says "Raw materials from China and the USA". I think people should keep in mind that China has a horrible reputation when it comes to health and safety standards for food products. Unfortunately, my 100 count container of Spry chewing gum is now one piece short but is at the bottom of my trash can.
