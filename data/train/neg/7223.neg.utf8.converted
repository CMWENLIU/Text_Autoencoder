For fellow coffee drinkers used to premium coffee shop-style java, along the lines of Peets, Starbucks, et cetera, this is not the same thing. Chances are you'll hate this Gevalia stuff. Doesn't even measure up to McDonalds coffee. Weak, bland, little flavor other than a slightly chemical, synthetic taste. I tried collecting just the first half of the brew, hoping for a little richness or something even approaching a medium roast, and no luck.
