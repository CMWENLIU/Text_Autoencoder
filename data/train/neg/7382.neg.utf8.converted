Tracking app. Indicates item has been received at warehouse near my house. It has been sitting there for nearly two weeks! How do I get it? I can't return it. I don't have it!<br /><br />Days later:<br />When I reviewed the tracking application today, there is a statement saying shipper LOST item. I have received no notice of this fact. There is no process for contacting anyone. How do I re-order? Get a refund? What's going on Amazon.com?
