I tried this hoping for a less expensive alternative to Evo for my three cats. Unfortunately, I got what I paid for. Although my cats appeared to like the taste just fine, after two weeks on this food they developed runny and stinky stool, not to mention they used the litter box a lot more. I recently had enough and switched back to Evo cold turkey. No exaggeration, but 24 hours later I noticed a dramatic improvement. I then dumped the rest of the Before Grain in the trash.<br /><br />I don't know if it's the yeast culture, the potato flour, or both, but one of those top ingredients did not react well with my cats. I volunteer for a shelter that feeds its cats Science Diet and I've never noticed anything this bad. That's why I gave Before Grain one star, as I'd sooner feed my cats Science Diet. If you're looking for a budget grain free food, you can do much better than this.
