I agree with the first commet that this is a dangerous product for your pet. I picked up my dog from my brother's who was watching him while i was out of town and found shards of this bone all over the floor. He bought him this 'treat' thinking he'd be a good uncle, instead my dog has been vomitting and having diarreah for the past 24+ hrs because of this horrible product. Taking him to vet soon. Will update!
