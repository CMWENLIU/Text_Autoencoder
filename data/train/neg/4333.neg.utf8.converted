I was very dissapointed with these so called "Sour Cherry Gummies", as an avid haribo Gummy Fan, I was expecting at least some type of sour taste, instead just overly sweet and sugar coated, not even much Cherry flavor just very very sweet and overwhelming sugar flavor.<br />If u want some gummies that r sour and tangy, try Fizzy Cola bottles!!<br />They still have sugar coating but a very good, not 2 sweet tangy and tart flavor!! Enjoy....
