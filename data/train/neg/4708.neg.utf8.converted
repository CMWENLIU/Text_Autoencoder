Really disappointed about this! Sent the Deluxe edition of this to my GF while she was at work on Valentines Day (14FEB12). They came in the right vase and on time, but none of them had bloomed! The picture looks attractive and nothing like what she received, which was a nice red vase with nothing but green for color! Talk about a let down! (see submitted pic) There was no warning that they would be delivered and take an additional 3 days to bloom........ seriously!! Not a good impression at all. I will call local next time I am out of town and I want to send flowers.
