Buy Post or Kellogg, but stay away from this one. It really leaves a bad taste in your mouth and has very few raisins. I'm not kidding, people, you will not like this ceral. I don't care how healthful it is, it is virtually inedible. I threw away my entire order. Not good.<br />By the way, anyone who says this review isn't helpful and buys this cereal will definitely live to regret that decision. I'm telling you, cardboard tastes better than this cereal.
