I received a 25-count box of Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast that had 3 packets with unsealed tops. In fairness, I don't know if this was the result of poor quality control in production or damage during shipping. My order included a box of Gloria Jeans K-cups which did not have opened tops so I suspect that the tops on the Coffee Peoples cups were not glued properly.<br /><br />One day after voicing my concern, I received a replacement. What great service - I'd give them 5 stars now!
