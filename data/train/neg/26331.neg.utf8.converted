Those posting that these cupcakes are amazing must not know what homemade cupcakes and icing are - the cupcakes are not bad - not very attractive as the one posting commented but that is because I actually filled the cupcakes 3/4th full like the box said and they overflowed.  Would have been better had it said to just fill them half way and make more cupcakes.  However, the icing was TERRIBLE!  Actually inedible and I LOVE desserts and sweets and icing and will try anything but it doesn't even smell like good chocolate frosting.  I followed directions precisely, used all fresh ingredients (bought the day I made them) and I ended up using my own homemade icing with the cupcakes rather than throwing the cupcakes and icing away.  And for the amount of work for the cupcakes, I'd rather make some from scratch - they'd definitely taste better.  Very disappointing since I typically love Ina and have had some of her other box mixes which were excellent.
