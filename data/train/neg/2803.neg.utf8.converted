No stars for this horrible, inedible, stale expensive mess that I presented to my husband on Valentine's Day as an additional gift; embarrassed doesn't even describe how I felt; the worst part, perhaps is their customer service; I sent them an E-mail, explaining my disappointment and requesting a refund-- their website says in huge letters: SATISFACTION GARANTEED! (with a picture of the boss!)-- gave them 4 days to respond, they did not, choosing to ignore the whole thing;  I then called the phone # on their website which turned out to be a bogus number. ( NO SUCH NUMBER!)  Nice company! And I forgot to mention shipping charges, too!<br />I contacted Amazon, who have a wonderful, prompt customer service, and they will make things right for me, as they promised.
