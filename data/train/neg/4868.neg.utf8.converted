I thought I would be economical and buy this 5lb jar. In our apt the dishwasher could use a boost and I heard (and read all the reviews)that a little bit of this added with dishwasher soap makes everything sparkle, etc.<br /><br />I used it once and it left little white specks everywhere and didnt even stop the weird hard water calcium film. I ended up hand washing EVERYTHING that came out of the dishwasher and now Im stuck with a 5 pound jar of this junk. I feel weird being the ONLY poor review, but Im at a loss of what to do. Ha-ha, I guess I can make a billion pounds of home made cheese.
