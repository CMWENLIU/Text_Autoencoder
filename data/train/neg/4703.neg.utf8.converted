I am European<br />and remember this product very well.  I was extremely disappointed.  No taste of licorice whatsoever, only the taste of mint.  It was so soft, it nearly melted in your mouth, instead of being nice and chewy.<br />  I will never purchase the Licorice Mint Caramels from Amazon.com again.
