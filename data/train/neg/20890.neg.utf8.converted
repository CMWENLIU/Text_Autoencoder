After the disaster that was the Rescue WHYTR-BB8 W-H-Y Trap for Wasps, Hornets and Yellow Jackets, I decided to try the Victor Poison-Free M370 Yellow Jacket Magnet Disposable Bag Trap.  The swelling had receded from all of my newly acquired stings and I was ready for revenge.  This had trap had to work - I mean, how could it not?  There are pictures of yellow jackets trapped in the bag on the box!<br /><br />Oh how wrong I was.  I filled the bag with apple juice and bait and hung it on a tree next to my garage.  I sat in wait, watching the bag and waiting for the buzzing vermin circle the bag.  One even landed on top of the plastic rim.  It left, but not before it mocked me by doing a jig.<br /><br />I left the bag up for four weeks with no results.  When I went out to get it I noticed a wasp nest FIVE FEET AWAY!  Yup, this whole queen catcher line is complete garbage.  The nest was approximately 1/3 of the way built and not one stupid worker bee was floating in the bag!  Granted these were paper wasps and not a member of the subfamily Vespinae - yellow jackets, but the nest was already about the size of a softball!<br /><br />I was suddenly inspired and decided to use the bag to take care of the wasp problem.  I ripped the yellow plastic off and dumped the fluid.  I inverted the bag and wrapped it around my hand, like you do when you're picking up dog poop.  I grabbed the nest and quickly folded the bag around the top.  Perfect fit!  I shook the bag up and held it to my face to taunt the now enraged wasps.  How satisfying.  Then I tossed it in my trashcan and wandered off.<br /><br />Unfortunately wasps can actually live for more than an hour in a closed trashcan, as I discovered much to my horror when I tossed out the remains of the Rescue WHYTR-BB8 W-H-Y Trap for Wasps, Hornets and Yellow Jackets.  Oh boy were the wasps mad at me!  Now I know that I have a high immunity to both yellow jacket AND paper wasp stings.
