I purchased this product with very high hopes; a healthy, delicious snack in a variety of my favorite flavors. The reviews were absolutely astonishing, so I figured, what the heck.<br /><br />Wrong, wrong, wrong!<br /><br />Every popchip I tried had a very faint taste and smell of being burnt. Most of the flavors and seasonings are so weak that they don't come close to masking the taste. The end result? They tasted like water with 1/4th as much flavoring added or coke with a tall glass full of melted ice.<br /><br />Worst of all, the taste of burnt potatoes only accumulated as I ate more chips. I could not bear many of these in one sitting, and I hate to waste.<br /><br />There is, however, 1 exception. Barbeque flavor. These had a strong enough flavor to almost completely mask the burnt taste, and actually be quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, there was only 2 of those bags in this box (out of 12), so I still had 10 unbearable bags to consume.<br /><br />I sincerely wish this product was better, but there's clearly something wrong with their manufacturing process. Please don't be misguided by the shocking number of positive reviews.
