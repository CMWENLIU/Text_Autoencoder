Did I get a different product than everyone else??????<br /><br />This stuff is absolutely horrible!  As soon as I opened the box, I noticed the smell was terrible.  And yes, I checked the "sell-by" date and it was fine...My casserole turned out tasting just like that horrible smell, and my whole kitchen stunk all night.  I had to throw my casserole away.<br /><br />If you're looking for GF cream soup, THIS IS NOT EVEN AN OPTION!!!!
