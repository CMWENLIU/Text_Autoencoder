I bought these because another comment said these were better than Jiffy. I think these are terrible and I like Jiffy much better. These don't taste anything like the corn muffins I make from scratch. They don't even taste much like corn. They're just plain weird.<br /><br />Also, another reviewer said that you "just add water," but these require eggs and milk. Maybe that person got a different product which also tastes good.<br /><br />Don't buy these. They're so bad I'm going to donate the remaining packs to a food bank.
