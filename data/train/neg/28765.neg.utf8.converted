I love spicy food, and I add hot sauce to almost everything I eat, but this hot sauce a completely disappointment.<br /><br />The name itself is b...s..., I have tasted more spicy hot sauce than this.<br /><br />Just for anyone interested, the main ingredients as indicated on the bottle are: red habaneros, hot pepper extract, red chiles. However, all I tasted was black pepper, not even a hint of habaneros. It's 2nd worst hot sauce for me (Tabasco is #1 because it is a SOUR sauce, nothing hot about it), because it reminded me of the cheap instant noodle soup bowl (black pepper beef flavor noodle soup) that I used to eat when I was a child.<br /><br />No taste, no flavor, and no aroma. No tonge numbing, no throat burning, and no stomach twisting. Just plain dull heat and cheap taste.<br /><br />Well, money well wasted. By the way, I used 6 drops on my one bowl of steam rice, and the heat didn't even last 5 minutes.<br /><br />The bottome line is:<br />This is NOT a hot sauce for spicy food lover. A good hot sauce makes food tasty with aroma and flavor, this one doesn't.<br /><br />It's like I can make the sweetest cake for you by loading it with tons of sugars, is it sweet? Of course, but is it a good tasty cake? You tell me.
