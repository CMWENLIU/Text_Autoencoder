If you like the aftertaste left in your mouth after you vomit? Then you will LOVE Maca! Not only did this taste horrible but it actually made me sick for hours after trying it for the first time. I felt nauseous and spent a great deal of time in the bathroom afterwards. I am not sure if it was an allergic reaction but it also gave me hives. I tossed the bag out after one serving and though I realize that I wasted money, I would gladly pay double to never have to ingest this again. Yes, it was that bad for me. I really would have loved to add this to my daily diet for the health benefits but unfortunately it had the opposite effect.
