Do your research on this... the main ingredients are chemicals, ie propylene glycol. I got my 4 bottles from Amazon... opened one bottle, squirted some into a tall glass of ice cold water and could not wait... well... EEKKKKK... so gross. It tasted like pure sugar water with a weird aftertaste, squirted some more and finally got the "hint" of tea taste...  You have to squirt A LOT to even taste a hint of tea and when the main ingredients are chemicals (excluding water of course) it tastes like what it is.. A CHEMICAL. I immediately put the bottle back into the box from Amazon, along with the 3 unopened bottles and tossed them in the garbage. While I hated to spend $12+ of my money for NOTHING.. it's my fault, I should have done reviews FIRST. Here's just one I found: [...]<br /><br />The cute bottle and the 0 calories in the commercials were enough to entice me and I am sure this product will make millions from idiots like me who fell for this, but trust me people, SAVE YOUR MONEY. I don't write much reviews, but I just had to come on here because I am trying to go green and avoid as many chemicals as I can for my own body and home and this is just one big giant chemical hidden in a cute bottle with a great commercial. Look up the ingredients, which are NOT on Amazon and do your own research.  Pour a glass of water, squeeze some lemons and add stevia for some lemonade with no chemicals.... Or brew some tea bags, put in pitcher, refrigerate, add stevia for some sweet tea... it will be better for you and taste better than this crap. Lesson learned... Now choose for yourself, if you buy it... remember I warned you ;)
