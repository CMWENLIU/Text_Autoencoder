Not very happy with this one, which really doesn't happen very often for me, since I'm forgiving. Put my faith in an item too soon since there was only one review that was positive when I ordered.<br /><br />However, after receiving my order, I'm finding more and more reviews pop up of how the item was not delivered as presented.<br />I agree, and that's why I checked back. I mean, I understand when the picture isn't the same, but a deceptive product description? C'mon!<br /><br />First off, I'm unsatisfied because I received my product broken up and smashed around in the box with all the brown confetti, rendering it ungiftable without effort.<br />If I wanted to exert effort, I would have gone to the store and gathered things myself & fashioned them into a basket.<br />They did, however, provide me with a "DeliDirect" catalogue, coupon, and random green tortes I didn't order (perhaps added as an apology)....<br /><br />Secondly, I really ordered this for the cheese, for a cheese lover.<br />BUT the cheeses DO NOT come in 4oz blocks as advertised (instead 2oz x 2ea flavor), and they are all PROCESSED CHEESE FOOD. Not cool.<br />This means we get to eat it instead.. did a taste test, it's all plastic same-flavor stuff, but higher quality than Velveeta, if that's a consolation.<br />I will make note of anytime I see the word "flavor" when ordering cheese in the future. Since I saw "Wisconsin" advertised everywhere, I expected the real deal, even if "sub par" but NOT processed...<br /><br />This brings me to the third strike, the meat products were NOT the flavors they said were included - garlic, mesquite, & original.<br />Instead, it was 1 salami, and 2 original summer sausages, one just in the plastic, and one in the plastic as well as a special paper sack?! Was this to trick me into thinking it was a different flavor?<br /><br />Overall, three strikes you're out DeliDirect (ahem, amazon), I hate dealing with complications in mail order stuff, this is lame & means my family "wins" the prize.<br /><br />><br /><br />Main reason I'm posting.... BE HONEST WITH DESCRIPTIONS. I'm sure all of us consumers would appreciate it.
