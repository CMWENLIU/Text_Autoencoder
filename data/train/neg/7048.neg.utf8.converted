What a rip-off!!  You think that you are getting a real K-cup.  What this product is simply stated is a plastic cup with freeze dried coffee inside -- no filter, nothing.  Coffee tastes worse than dirt. Spread  the word on these scam artists... BAD PRODUCT.  I could just buy a jar of crummy freeze dried coffee and pour boiling water over it -- no need to fire up the keurig. Shame on this weasly company.  I am going to work to see that they be forced to label this crummy product for what it is ... then see how quick;ly they lose dissatisfied customers like myself.
