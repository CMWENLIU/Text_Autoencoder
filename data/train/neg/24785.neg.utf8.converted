Okay, so the box sat on my counter for 2 months while I tried to find the time to make this product-- since it's not a quick thing to make pastries from scratch. I was going to feature this product on my blog--where I often give tips on healthy desserts, pet help & relationships. It's the holidays and I finally decided to make the time.  I got out my camera to chronicle this event and gave this my best efforts. Unfortunately, I just wasted 3 hours and lots of efforts on what turned out to be CARDBOARD.<br /><br />First, the company is in Australia, I believe, and assumes that we already know what to do. The directions were minimal and it didn't even give baking instructions--once the pastry was prepared.  It was very difficult and time consuming and the end result was YUCK.  There were many naughty words heard from the direction of the kitchen--and more accurately, my lips.  My husband and handyman were laughing-- right along with me--as I forced them to try them out.  Big thumbs down.<br /><br />* I'm sure a PASTRY CHEF or someone who does this all of the time--might have tips--but for the above average--gluten free baker--I would say, SKIP IT and find something else. I have made a LOT of gluten free products & even developed some recipes on my own--- but never had these kind of issues.<br /><br />I called Amazon and got a refund, they were wonderful and understanding and refunded my purchase. Hope this helps--Happy Healthier Baking!  :-)
