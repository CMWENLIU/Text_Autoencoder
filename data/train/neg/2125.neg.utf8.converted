I too was in love with Callard & Brower licorce toffee.  Gustaf's toffee wouldn't be bad were it not compared to C&B.  It's similar but no where close in terms of flavor.  If you want a product that's as close as it gets to Callard and Brower, try Oatfield Irish Licorice Toffee. With Oatfields, while they sometimes can be a little on the hard side, the flavor is dead on.  I just got a 4.4 lb bag of Gustaf's, and will probably give the candy away.  Very disappointed.
