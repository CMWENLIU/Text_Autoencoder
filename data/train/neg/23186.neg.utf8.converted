i am not sure what thai kitchen did to this product.  i used to buy it and it was spicy and very flavorful.  i bought this recently as i had not made curry in a while, and what a disappointment!  it is not nearly as aromatic nor flavorful as it used to be.  if you want a good curry base that is vegetarian,  try a taste of thai, it is far better! don't waste your money on this bland product.
