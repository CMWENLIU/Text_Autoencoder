I bought this thinking it would taste like a peppermint patty, like another reviewer said. It tasted so overwhelming bad that I literally could not take a second sip. The mint taste is extremely strong. It's almost as strong as drinking mouthwash! And that's exactly what it tastes like.<br /><br />Completely undrinkable.
