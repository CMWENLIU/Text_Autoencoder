I have never purchased chestnut puree from a can before.  I typically make it from scratch but thought I would save some time making my Christmas Torte.  It comes out of the can in a thick brown clump that will need to be broken down.  I added some milk and blended it, otherwise it would remain in clumps.  The flavor is ok but not the best.  I followed through with using this product in my torte.  For those that had my torte in the past...did not finish it.  They said that it didnt taste the same.  For all the newbies to my torte, they didnt know what to compare it to so they thought it was good.<br /><br />I will never use this product and I highly suggest that you do not either.
