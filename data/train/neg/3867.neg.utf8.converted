the reason I am giving this product a 2 is that it claims on the packet that it does not cause the digestive probs that similar products can cause.  For me this was untrue!  I had 2 cups of coffee w/ a spoon and a half of Zero.  This was followed by stomach cramps and a quick short-lived bout of diarrhea.  I get the same symptoms when i eat too many grapes.  Maybe the sugar has a similar composition?<br /><br />The taste was good and I liked the fact that it wasn't as sweet as sugar.  If i hadn't had the digestive probs I would be buying more of this product.
