I bought this olive oil since it was organic, and went through 6 (750 mL) cans on a subscription, but in the end I decided to stop buying it. I bought this oil to be my basic mid-priced olive oil primarily for sauteing. I like all sorts of olive oil -- from soft and buttery to peppery and green. This oil has a heavy woody scent, not as fragrant as other good EVOO in this price range. Sampled uncooked, the oil has mild initial taste, not much olive flavor at all, but not unpleasant, but what I didn't like is its harsh after-taste. It was not good in salad dressings. With other flavorings, the harshness is muted but still remains. In cooked dishes any olive oil flavor mostly disappears. In the same price range, I've had better luck with obscure Spanish or Greek 1 L cans of EVOO from the supermarket.
