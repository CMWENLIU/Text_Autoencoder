Great mustard! have been eating it for over 50 years and have had it shipped to me all over the world while I served in the United States Air Force and ever since.  Great stuff!<br /><br />I now must change my review.....I have loved Nance's Sharp & Creamy mustard since the 1950s and had it shipped to me all over the world throughout  my Air Force career and for 35 years since my retirement.  I cannot tell you how disappointed I was with the last case I received.  The new formula has lost that taste that made Nance's so special!
