Tried making a mojito with just the powder mix, soda water and vodka. Had a really bad, fake, metallic taste, so I tried adding lime and mint. It barely helped. It wasn't really any less effort to use the mix than making one from scratch. The powder also stayed in tiny clumps that didn't dissolve despite vigorous mixing.
