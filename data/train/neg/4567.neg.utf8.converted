There are two Velveeta pasta and cheese dinners. This one, and Kraft Velveeta Original Shells & Cheese, 12 oz. They both use packets of cheese sauce, not packets of powder.<br /><br />But sadly, this one's not that good. It's salty, and the tiny bits of broccoli are few and far between. And with all the sodium (1230 mg per serving compared to 940 mg for the regular Shells and Cheese), it's a long way from healthy.<br /><br />Shells and Cheese is better. It's pure, creamy comfort food that goes down smooth and leaves no aftertaste. The pasta's ridged-shell shape makes every bite taste good, as dribbles of cheese seep into each piece and stick to its sides. It's much better than the broccoli version... and way more yummy (if more expensive) than the regular <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HUI0">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Supermac & Cheese Pasta and Sauce, 6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>.
