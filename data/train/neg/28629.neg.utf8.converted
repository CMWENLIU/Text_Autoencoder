I purchased 5 pounds of this product directly from Barry Farms for my grandmother's recipe fruitcakes.  I was so disappointed in the quality of what I received.  Of the 5 pounds, 2 pounds was of yellow pineapple that was inedible and had to be discarded.  The pith of the pineapple was used rather than the good part of the fruit.  There was no way I was going to use that in these high quality expensive cakes.  Also, there was a lot of syrup in each tub, so I definitely did not get a pound of fruit. I ended up having to replace the bad pineapple at a local grocery store for twice the cost.  I guess I got what I paid for.  I will not purchase from them again.  I just went to their web-site and there is nothing there.  Maybe they have gone out of business.  If this is an example of their product, I'm not surprised.
