I have been an avid fan of these cookies for years.  My family went through dozens of boxes a month for our use, taking to functions as our donation, giving as gifts.  They were a dark, rich, wholesome, deep taste experience.  In May, 2012, I couldn't find them on the shelf in any of our normal stores.  After a few weeks, they were back.  I took them home and opened them and was surprised to find that the inside container was different.  It used to be three rows that ran the short end of the box.  Now it was two rows that ran the long end of the box.  No big deal had that been all that changed.  I took a cookie out and popped it in my mouth expected the same dark, rich, wholesome experience, and the cookie tasted so bad I almost threw up.  It was sickly sweet.  It tasted like a combination between an oreo and a health food bar.  All they did was move to the middle ground where those who like health food bars won't like the oreo sweet taste and those who like oreos won't like the health food bar taste.  They are awful.  And, I'm so sad, because before they changed the formulation, these were the best cookies on the market.  I turned so many people on to them.  Now that they changed the recipe, none of us will ever be buying them again.  They are now the worst cookie I have ever tasted.
