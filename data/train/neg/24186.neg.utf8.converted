I like Green Mtn. coffee; but at almost .70 cents per K-cup get real. I have watched the price climb from a standard of .50 cents (on sale at.40 cents) per cup to today's so-called bargain prices of .68 cents. I know that over a year ago coffee harvests were down but that is over. In fact Brazil has a coffee glut. The price is being controlled by investors just like oil. Do not give in. I say boycott the product until they bring the price down to previous levels.
