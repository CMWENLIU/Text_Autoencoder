I used to love the blue packaged m&m's when they were first released in the early 2000's. Then one day, without notice, the Mars company decided to change the content from crispy to pretzel. For years I've search for the real blue packaged ones only to be upset and angered every time I walk out of a 7-11 and spot these crunchless crimes against humanity.<br /><br />I tried contacting the Mars family by both phone and mail multiple times, the only thing I got in return was a restraining order! This product and company have caused me so much stress that I have developed a brain tumor which doctors are now checking for cancer.<br /><br />Learn from my experience and boycott this godless candy. The normal ones are okay though, they melt in your mouth and not in your hand.
