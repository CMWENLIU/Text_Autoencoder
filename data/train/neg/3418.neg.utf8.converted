I bought this as well as the Pantainorasingh Thai Tea Mix on a quest to save money by making the things I like at home.  This tea is very close to what I've gotten in Thai restaurants, but the price is outrageous...especially after shipping.  I bought these two teas before venturing to my local Asian food market - stupid, I know.  But when I got to the market, I found the price on thai mixes to be between $2.50-$4.  So it's not even the shipping that makes the price high.  It's good, but not enough to warrant paying the extra cost.<br /><br />And if you're looking to make Thai Iced Tea, don't follow the recipe on the label.  I found a recipe online that works out very well - 6 cups water, 1 cup sugar (or splenda), 1 cup tea.
