I had really high hopes for this soup... we love asian foods/soups, seafood, seaweed, noodles and spice.  So it sounded like a perfect combo!<br /><br />I know this review is in the minority, but please remember that it is just my own personal experience and does not reflect the rest of the world, which is why it is "my review".<br /><br />So, I excitedly made a bowl this morning and after the first bite had to force myself to eat half a bowl worth... in a word it was disgusting.  Maybe mine are from a defective batch, but the seaweed & very HOT pepper is all you can taste... no seaFOOD not even an undercurrent.  And now that my throat & mouth are still burning & my stomach is queasy (hours later) I am wondering why I forced myself to eat even that much.<br /><br />I did give 2 stars for the noodles since they seem like they will be good without the flavor packets.
