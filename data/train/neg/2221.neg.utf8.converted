almost expired when I got it!  I ordered like 8 of this to share it with my family out of the country, it will take time for the package to get there, so I figured by the time they can have it, its expired, so there's no sense of ordering this many.  4 package in 1.  It still better to get in the grocery store, so you can check the expiration date.
