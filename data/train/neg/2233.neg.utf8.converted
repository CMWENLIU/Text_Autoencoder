Didn't realize these would actually be coming from GERMANY and that the quantity would be about half a package as the package size I used to buy in the USA. Tasted stale - perhaps because of the things they used in Germany to make the product as opposed to the great things here in the USA. I would NOT suggest you buy this if you are here in the USA. Perhaps its different in Europe, but I can't speak to that.
