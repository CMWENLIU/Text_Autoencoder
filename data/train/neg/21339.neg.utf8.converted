"The bold citrus taste of glycerin combines with the artificial flavors to create a uniquely disgusting cocktail ingredient."<br /><br />Excuse my sarcasm, but this is one of the most disappointing bar purchases I've ever made. Unfortunately, I didn't look at the ingredients until after I purchased the bottle. I had read about Fee Brothers Bitters in an old New York Times article about the rebirth of cocktail culture. Silly enough, I assumed they were artisanal and naturally flavored. The ingredients list reads like a pack of Fruit Roll Ups: Water, Glycerin, Flavors - Natural and Artificial Extracts and Flavors.<br /><br />These bitters taste awful. There's a slight grapefruit flavor behind the awful, overpowering lime (as in limestone, not key lime) flavor. If you want grapefruit flavor in your drinks, this isn't the bitters for you. You should really just buy a bag of grapefruits and spritz a small amount of juice into your drink. I've used this in a couple of drinks, and each turned out poorly. I thought it might give my Negroni a nice additional grapefruit boost, but all it did was poison the drink. It tasted chemically and sour. DO NOT USE THESE BITTERS!!!
