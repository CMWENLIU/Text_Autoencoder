This product is known to give people gas.  I actually counted over a period of several days and each bar caused me to fart 18-22 times from four to six hours after I ate it.  If you live alone or are on cipro for athrax exposure and your intestines are sterile, maybe you can live with that side effect.  Otherwise, it's better to give to someone as a joke than to eat yourself.<br /><br />Other than that, it tastes pretty good if not too sweet.<br /><br />Additional comments 17 months after my above review:<br /><br />First, let me state on their box General Mills had plenty of room to educate about different fiber sources while promoting the variety of fiber products they produce.<br /><br />I had a chance to try Target's generic competitor to this food product and found the same stinkin' results.<br /><br />Using Wikipedia (yes a printed dictionary would be more reliable) I see that the main ingredient of these products, called "Chicory Root Extract", is full of an indigestible sugar called inulin that ferments into gas in your large intestine. Inulin is no doubt responsible for the too-sweet taste of the bars that I mentioned in my first review 17 months ago.<br /><br />Another vegetable containing inulin is the Jerusalem Artichoke for which Wikipedia has the following snippet:<br />Gerard's Herbal, printed in 1621, quotes the English planter John Goodyer on Jerusalem artichokes:<br />"which way soever they be dressed and eaten, they stir and cause a filthy loathsome stinking<br />wind within the body, thereby causing the belly to be pained and tormented, and are a meat more<br />fit for swine than men."<br /><br />Ergo I conclude Fiber One bars are more fit for swine than men. If people knew that in year 1621, why is General Mills putting out an inulin-filled product now? And why in all their biased, pro-fiber packaging is there not a single mention of the gastrointestinal side effects known to effect a large swath of the population for almost 400 years?  Corporate food scientists don't just throw random boxes from the undesirable vegetable dispensary into a stew, and somehow get instant FDA approval and national distribution channels, folks.
