This is a sweet I order every time I see it on menus in the UK - but the canned version is just not the real deal- the topping is runny rather than gooey and the cake is too loaded with strange chewy bits of fruit- if you want to try it I have a couple of cans (ordered in my enthusiasm of finding it online) that I can sell you cheap...not good
