This product is healthy since it contains no hydrogenated oils but gosh darn the taste is awful. it is sour and salty taste and I cannot grow accustom to eating it. Unfortunately too, this tortilla wrap is the only one with 100% no trans fat, every other store brand contains hydrogenated which means there is some trans fat.
