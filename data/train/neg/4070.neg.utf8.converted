I tried to eat this with some saltine crackers, which i like to do with most seafood. But the taste was just how can i put this....disgusting. This "might" be good for crab cakes but eating as is didn't go well for me.<br />If you notice its very cheap compared to Crown Prince Crab Meat and believe me there is a very good reason. This crab meat is imported from Singapore.
