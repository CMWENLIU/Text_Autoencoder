I just ordered this product hoping that Amazon was carrying/shipping their newly BPA-free stock. I ordered many different types of Earth's Best jarred baby foods from Amazon, and unfortunately, the Sweet Potatoes that I received ( April 5 2012 ) were the old stock that contain BPA in the lids. No idea when they'll start shipping the BPA free sweet potato 12 packs, but I won't be ordering these from Amazon for awhile.<br /><br />Note: I spoke with Earth's Best customer service, and they informed me that the lids that have yellow on the bottom side are the ones that contain BPA. The newer, BPA-free jars, which they started switching to mid last year (2011) have a white bottom cap side. FYI, the BPA containing jars had expiration dates of April 2013, whereas my other non-BPA containing jars had expiration dates of fall of 2013, such as November and October.<br /><br />Hope this helps!
