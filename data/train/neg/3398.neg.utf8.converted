I am extremely sensitive to MSG, sulfites, etc. - they give me terrible migraines.  Although this mix says "no msg" it DOES contain sulfites, so if a glass or two of wine gives you a headache (wine typically contains sulfites), then this pickling spice may give you migraines/headaches as well.  This is just an FYI to the folks like me who have to be careful what they eat and drink. The sulfites in this pickling blend are used a preservative, which is completely unnecessary in my opinion.  McCormick simply wishes to ensure an indefinite shelf life for this stuff at the expense of individuals' health.<br /><br />PS - I love to make pickles, jellies and preserves, etc., and to give them as gifts.  If you give gifts of pickles made from this spice, please consider warning the recipients about the sulfites.  Nothing ruins a gift like associating a friend or loved one with a gift that makes you ill!  I speak from experience.
