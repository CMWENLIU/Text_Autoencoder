I've purchased this product twice.  First time was back in 2007, as a birthday gift for my sister.  She loved it.  She sent me a couple ounces to try and I too thought it was great, maybe the best coffee I have ever tried.  I drink coffee but am by no means a gourmet and I don't buy expensive coffees for my self.  I purchased another order (a couple weeks ago) as a gift for my housemate.  I can't believe its the same coffee.  It tastes like the Folgers or Maxwell House I buy at my local grocery.  It has a bitter aftertaste.  I'll be the first to admit I don't know anything about fancy coffee; but when we opened the package the beans looked wet with oil.  We transferred the beans to other containers and the inside of the package was lined with beans stuck on by the oil.  The beans weren't dripping oil but almost.  Is this right for fancy coffee?  Needless to say I am disappointed.
