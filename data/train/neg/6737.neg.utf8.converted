I was very happy to find that this water was available for order. I ordered a dozen and ordered 3 dozen more. My first box was just delievered a half hour ago and the seals were broken on several bottles. Th order was also missing 2 bottles! I suspect warehousing was thirsty??? I even signed up for a monthly save subscriptons to have them mailed to me every month going forward. I  am so disappointed right now!! The other three dozen were shippe to me today but the rep was great in having contacted UPS to return the order to them. He candelled the subscription and told me to expect a refund 2-3 days after the orders are returned to the warehouse.
