Of all the Dolcue Gusto flavors, this is the one I like the least. It's not that there's anything wrong with hot chocolate, it's just that you can do a lot better than this attempt. If you like hot cocoa from normal powdered mixes, then this is a slight step up. But it's not creamy enough! I'd recommend just making your own cocoa at home from scratch. You'll be more pleased with the results. This one's not worth 150 calories.<br /><br />2/5
