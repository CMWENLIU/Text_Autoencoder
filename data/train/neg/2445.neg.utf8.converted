Don't get me wrong, I REALLY wanted to love this as I had read so many great things about coconut water.  I was so excited when my order came.  I had some already in the fridge so it was cold.  After I had a great workout I went to grab my coconut water.  I was shocked at how disgusting the taste was.  I tried it again, I tried it over ice, I tried it through a straw and nothing made it taste palatable.  If you haven't had coconut water before try one first before you buy a case.  My next step is going to try and mix it with a variety of liquors and see if I can stomach it.  Good luck!
