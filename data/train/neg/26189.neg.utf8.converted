Whatever you do, don't follow their instructions for steaming rice. You will end up with a burnt pot of crap.  Secondly, there isn't enough rice in the package for a second try.  Go buy some short grain rice and follow the package instructions for cooking/steaming rice. Then go back to the Sushi Chef instructions for cooling/seasoning the rice. Good thing I spent all that time preparing ingredients for making sushi while the rice was burning. Now I have to go out for more rice.
