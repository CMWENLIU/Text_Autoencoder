I was excited to find a natural sugar substitute when I came across Xylitol.  When I got it, my kids and I made lemonade: lemon juice, water and XyloSweet.  About 45 minutes later, halfway through lunch, I noticed my 6 year old daughter stopped eating her lunch, and she didn't look too good. She told me she didn't feel good and so I put her down for a nap. Ten minutes later, my son didn't feel good either.  Long story short: my daughter got diarrhea, and luckily, because she hadn't had that much lemonade, her diarrhea wasnt too severe.  Unfortuneately for my five year old son, who had a lot more lemonade to drink, he first started throwing up, and then also started having the runs--both at the same time!  Poor kid.  About the time I almost had them both settled down, my stomach was churning, and next thing you know I had to rush to the bathroom, for the first of what would end up being nine trips.<br />In between bathroom trips, I Googled: "Xylitol reactions" and was surprised at the number of listings that popped up.  I found that supposedly about 20% of people that try xylitol will have a reaction.  I think that figure is on the low side because my two kids are adopted from totally different sets of parents.  So when you consider that the three of us have different genetics, and yet we all had a problem with this stuff, I'd say that probably more than 20% of people that try this, will have a reaction.<br />BUYER BEWARE!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ORSIJ4">Xlear - Xylosweet 5lb, 5 lb, 1 bag</a>
