It is too bad this very tasty, refreshing sparkling water has maltodextrin in it.  If you are sensitive to maltodextrin, this isn't for you.  Maybe the manufacturer will sweeten with something less negative.<br />Ingredients on the label are currently:<br />Carbonated mountain spring water,<br />Orange juice concentrate,<br />Citric acid,<br />Natural flavors,<br />Potassium benzoate,<br />Gum Arabic,<br />Sucralose,<br />Green tea extract,<br />Ester gum,<br />Biotin 1% Trit (maltodextrin)<br />Yellow #6,<br />D Calcium pantothenate,<br />(B5)<br />Yellow #5,<br />Vitamin B12,<br />Mannitol,<br />Vitamin D3,<br />Pyridoxine HCL. (B6).......If you are sensitive to:<br />Maltodextrin and artificial colors,  then this product, in spite of its refreshing taste, isn't for you...one can always hope that other coloring agents, and sweetening agents, will be put into this by the manufacturer.<br />Genuinely sorry to have to point  out about the maltodextrin, about which you can find info on the internet; maltodextrin is cropping up in everything these days, but is considered to have negative effects...  There are other sweeteners...good luck with this...
