I ordered this for my step MIL because online it looks like a full size gift box, and several of the other reviewers raved about how great it was so I thought I'd give it a try.  The box is a little on the small side but is decent. Once you open the shrink wrapped box to get everything out it looks VERY skimpy.  I paid almost $70 for it, and it looks like it might be worth $20 if that -- and that's only because of the box.  The "truffles" and "english tea" as well as the "angel candles" all look like they're from the dollar store.  I'm VERY disappointed with this product.
