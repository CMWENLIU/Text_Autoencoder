I've been making yogurt for a few months with much success. So I am not new to this...<br /><br />I normally make yogurt with a previous batch, but I came across this product and saw the awesome reviews. I thought I could perhaps get better results with this starter, so I purchased two boxes. I followed the direction to heat the milk up to 180F and cooled it to 73-77F. I thought cooling the milk to 73-77F was strange as I've always cooled it to about 105F before adding previous bacteria culture into warmed milk. Most of the recipes I have seen online required the milk to cool to 105F as well, so I was a little bit confused. But then I thought the Yogourmet culture was special and therefore has a different temperature requirement.<br /><br />Well, I have an awesome thermos that always keeps the temperature for a prolonged period. I put the milk with Yogourmet mixture at 75F and set it aside for 14 hours (instruction said between 12-15 hours). As soon as I woke up in the morning, I excitedly opened my thermos. I discovered nothing but milk. There was no whey, firmed yogurt, nothing. It was literally how I left it.<br /><br />It seems like I am the only person who has had no luck with this culture. I am sure this company is great and the culture works normally as I can see from the previous reviews. I might have gotten a bad culture pack because it really did nothing for me. I am definitely not a beginner so I know I didn't make any mistakes in following the direction. I will email the company and see what can be done.
