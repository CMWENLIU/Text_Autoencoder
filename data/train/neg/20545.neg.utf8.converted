I am by no means a coffee snob and I can usually handle coffee of lower quality but when I brewed a cup of this Hazelnut community coffee I had a lot of trouble drinking it. The aroma is almost predominantly hazelnut and the smell of coffee is a distant second. Visually the ground is extremely uneven with random chunks here and there. Now for the taste, as soon as I had my first mouthful the first thought in my mind was "vegetables". There is a strong green vegetable flavor to it that I find extremely unpleasant. A friend of mine found that mixing this coffee with another companies dark roast coffee before brewing helped alleviate this problem. I will not be purchasing from this company again especially with so many other great coffee choices out there.
