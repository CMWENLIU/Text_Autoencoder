I use subscribe and save for different varieties of CBD coffee, and this is the first one I've canceled because of poor quality.  This stuff was stale, oily, odorless, and tasteless.  For the price, I would rather have eight-o-clock in the red bag.  If it was worthwhile to return it, I would.  Blech!<br /><br />Maybe they have been sitting in a warehouse for too long or something.  If this is how CBD expects this coffee to taste/smell, then consider this a one-star rating.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWHDNC">Nicaraguan</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWH972">Costa Rican Tarrazu</a> beans from CBD have been exceptionally good though.  I will go back to using those.
