If you enjoy gnawing on rubber tires and the taste of plastic and chemicals, you'll love this product. Otherwise, STAY AWAY. It is truly disgusting. I am a peanut butter fiend and will pretty much eat ANY PB, but this was totally inedible. I was hoping to find something lower in fat/calories, but this is just criminal. I'll stick with my Naturally More and just have a few spoonfuls.
