This isn't a review of the product per se, but a warning about the listing: It says that it comes out to 19 cents/ounce at regular price, and 16 cents/ounce with Subscribe & Save. If this is really for 4 12-ounce boxes (so 48 ounces), then those numbers are completely wrong (too low). With Subscribe & Save, it comes out 28 cents/ounce.
