Wouldn't it be nice if the picture on the box was what you would actually end up with?<br /><br />Don't be mislead by advertising of Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillet Dinner - what you get is yellow mush with little flakes of broccoli dust.<br /><br />The directions and cook times are easy to follow, just wish that they had been more specific with "reduce heat" - to what?  Low, simmer, medium low.  When I opened the package to add the dehydrated broccoli flakes, I knew that disaster was imminent.  This now made the product look like I had just sprinkled ground black pepper on it.  No healthy color to tantalize the brain, so I quickly steamed some "real" broccoli mixed it with the rice and chicken concoction before adding the pouch of cheese.  Now, there was some interest.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised that there was not an overabundance of saltiness but the product overall does have the processed chemical taste.<br /><br />My final judgment is that I do not think that this product will find its way back to my pantry, there was no visual appeal and the taste was marginal at best.
