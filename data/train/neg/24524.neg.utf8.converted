After paying way too much for a product, and then receiving it only to find the box opened from both ends; the expiration date for a large box to be in just 2 months, I am very disappointed. A warning label should have appeared stating that the food product packaging is damaged and the food needs to be consumed immediately. Who would have thought!!! This item has been on the shelf a very long time. I am one disappointed consumer and if I can return it, I will.
