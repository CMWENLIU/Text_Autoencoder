I am using Lipton Darjeeling Green Label Tea for the last 25 year,<br />If you are a real Darjeeling Green Tea user, this is not for you. this tea is cheap tea without real flavor and taste.<br /><br />Real Darjeeling Green Label Tea is very rich flavor tea that one can notice from three feet away.<br /><br />Description (Green Label) you will not find on the package purchased from this seller.<br />You well not able to return this item either since this is a food item.
