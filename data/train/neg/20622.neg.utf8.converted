My son has autism and is allergic to gluten among other things.  I was so excited to see that Rice Krispies had come out with a Gluten Free version until I read the ingredients.  BHT is NOT healthy!  It is an ingredient in jet fuels, rubber, petroleum products, electrical transformer oil, and embalming fluid.  The MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) for BHT says the following:  Do NOT let this chemical enter the environment.  Combustible.  Ingestion causes Abdominal pain. Confusion. Dizziness. Nausea. Vomiting.  The substance may have effects on the liver.  The substance is harmful to aquatic organisms.  When Chex went gluten-free, they did the same thing.  Yes, taking out the gluten is healthy, but adding BHT is not!  I would have loved to have been able to buy my son "normal" cereal, with cute characters on the front.  He would have loved it, but in the autism community, we are trying to get the toxins out of our kids, not put them in.  I will continue to be a Erewhon Twice Rice Cereal customer.  At over $4 per box, the price is steep, but I know the only ingredients my son is ingesting are organic brown rice, organic brown rice syrup, honey, and sea salt and he loves it.  Shame on Kellogg's for putting BHT in our children's cereals!
