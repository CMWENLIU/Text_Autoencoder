I've used this product for several years.  Daily habit at breakfast time.  Over the past year, ordering through Amazon from two different vendors, the product (not the shipping) has arrived in poor condition.  Soft and stale for the Oats & Honey (another reviewer found this to be true), crubled and dry for the peanut.  The only one in fairly good shape, but not really acceptable, has been the maple brown sugar. So, I've CANCELLED a long-standing automatic order.  You can only take poor product so long when you must finally give up and move on to something else.  Is it the fault of the manufacturer, or of Amazon, or the vendor?  Does it make a difference - the 'bottom line' is the product is no longer an acceptable product.
