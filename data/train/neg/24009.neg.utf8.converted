These canned hot dogs are not what they are hyped up to be.  After reading all of the 5 star reviews my hubby and I had to try them.  I was nervous to buy a full case off of Amazon so I picked up a couple from a safeway grocery store (the other was the Little Links... completely gross!) for about $9 a can.<br /><br />We grilled them, with great success!  We used a little cooking oil spray and there was no sticking and they held together nicely.  I put mine on a toasted bun with ketchup and relish.  The dog was mushy and not much flavor.  It wasn't THE worst veggie dog but NOT even close to greatest.  They are not worth the price.  Morningstar veggie dogs are the best, these don't even compare except that they are hot dog shaped.<br /><br />If I were building a bomb shelter and wanted veggie dogs in my canned food stash, these would be go to choice.  Otherwise, save your money, try a can from the store before getting a giant amount here.
