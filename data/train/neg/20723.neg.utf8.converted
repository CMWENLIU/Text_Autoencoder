I agree with the other reviewer that this is not very good.  but, that said mangosteen and lychee are very close in taste and texture (we have a lychee tree and occasionally get mangosteen locally... in fact, I have a seedling :)) without looking  I am not sure you can tell them apart 9even fresh) dried, it just loses so much (i wouldn't go as far as accusing them of misrepresentation).  Unfortunatly for those of you who do not live in the tropics (and who may have heard raves about this "queen of fruit") it does not dry well; imagine drying an orange slice.  Myself, I think the mangosteen is a bit overblown ;) nice, but.. inflated. but that us just personal opinion.  Posting this review to say that this is a kind of strange product.  We tried it once when traveling and looking for healthy alternatives for snacks for our kids.  this may be healthy, but it doesn't taste like much.  If you are getting it to try mangosteen, this is not the way to do it. (tastes a bit like cardboard).  My kids gave me some to prove a point after I got it for them without trying it myself.
