The senseo rocks, I love the coffee it makes, but this coffee is bad.  The DE pods make good crema but the coffee is a lot like instant.  The dark is especially bad when making two cups at a time.  Make two four ounce cups if you want a large cup.  Other pods do fit in the Senseo including Archer farms and others available online.  I wouldn't go making your own pods but definitely try some other brands.  If you do insist on sticking with DE, do your best to keep them fresh.  Put them in an airtight container or bag, and put any extra in a non-funky freezer.
