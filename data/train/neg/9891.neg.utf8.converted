This product is not good and varies in consistency.  The taste runs from a faint chemical (much like benzine) to stale, to an occasional nutty flavor.  I bought another brand at the same time to compare: Sweet Gourmet.  No comparison, spend the few extra dollars.  I've eaten about an half cup and I'm tossing the Gerbs.
