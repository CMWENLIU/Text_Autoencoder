I'm a college student, and therefore I thought this product would be right up my alley: energy drink, cheap, bulk purchase. But I've been a bit disappointed.<br /><br />Flavor: Taste is good. It isn't bitter, overly sweet, or anything. These are really drinkable and I'm often kind of saddened when I hit the bottom of the shot.<br /><br />Energy: This is where Red Rain loses stars for me. I don't feel ANY increase in awareness or energy. Oddly enough it makes my heart rate increase substantially, but I'm left still feeling tired. Five hour energy works, coffee works, monsters work, but Red Rain does nothing but put miles on the heart for no reason.<br /><br />I'd steer clear of this product. It's cheap, yes, but it doesn't wake you up or give energy at all. You get what you pay for sometimes.
