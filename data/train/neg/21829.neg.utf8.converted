I love Amazon, but this is probably the first time that I am shocked at the price. Not how low it is, but how HIGH it is! I can't believe the price they want for this case of Friskies cat food. I live in a big city and have my choice of plenty places to go to get my cat food. The price at the local Petsmart is 47 cents (regular price) or 44 cents (on sale). Do you see my point yet? Even if I paid 47 cents a can, do the math .47 x 24 = $11.28! Amazon wants what? $18.94! I do admit that the pate is my cats favorite, as they don't like to eat the shredded or the fillet types of canned cat food. I highly recommend the types of pate that are in this case: the Turkey and Giblets is a BIG favorite with the kitties and salmon doesn't stay long on the plate either! I have seven cats with an age range of 4 months to 16 years old, and all they will eat is Friskies canned cat food and their dry food. I recommend these Friskies items, but you are better off going to the grocery store, Petsmart or even Walmart. I will love you Amazon until the day I die, but I won't buy my Friskies from you. :(
