Don't bother buying a Senseo coffee maker. The coffee is delicious and a cup is brewed very quickly, IF YOU CAN BUY THE COFFEE PODS. No other brand tastes as good. Senseo has mismanaged their conversion to online only selling (check out the Senseo FaceBook page) and promised to have pods available by mid June. It is June 26 and there isn't a pod to be found anywhere. Good-bye Senseo, hello Keurig.
