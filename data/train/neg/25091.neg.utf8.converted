<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XDH6M6">Newman's Own Organics Pomegranate Licorice Twists</a> taste decent but they just don't taste of pomegranate<br /><br />for starters, a bitter after taste some foods leave in your mouth - that came first. I had to chew a few more pieces to get that to go away. That was unplesant<br /><br />second, they taste nothing like pomegranate. They basically tasted like ordinary red licorice. It's not worth the money. don't bother.
