Do not buy this expecting it to taste anything like a brownie.  I am a huge HG fan and she raves about these all the time.  I decided I would bite the bullet and try the mixes.  I made exactly as the directions said.  They aren't super gross, just not super yummy.  They are not very chocolaty, the only part that really tastes chocolaty is the chocolate chips which you have to add.  The brownie itself tastes strongly of wheat. Which like I said, isn't gross, just isn't super delish.  So I would suggest if you want a super yummy brownie and are dieting or on weight watchers, try no fudge pudge, that i what I will be going back to after I use the rest of these boxes.  My kids (3 and 5) who usually devour anything remotely resembling a dessert took one bite and turned up their noses.
