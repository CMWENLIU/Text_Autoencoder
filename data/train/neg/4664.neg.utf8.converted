I recently contacted Amazon and Vita Coco, due to the new nasty taste. I thought I had gotten a bad batch and literally poured all of them down the drain. Amazon was great and sent a replacement free of charge and I received it the very next day. But no luck, same nasty taste. After a little bit of researching found out that they decided for whatever reason to add new ingredients. Why?. Anyways, The taste with the NEW ingredients is nothing more than a mixture of water/sugar/vinegar, and it leaves a sour taste in your mouth. So dissapointed. I cancelled my subscription because it not longer tastes like real coconut water, and threw the second shipment I received away!
