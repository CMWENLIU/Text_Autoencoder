My dog likes these, but isn't able to know any better.<br /><br />The FDA warnings about dogs getting sick from Chinese-made chicken jerky are exactly this product. Maybe its safe, who knows. But I'm sure not going to find out. I'm never buying these again so long as they are made in China, period. I even threw 2 full bags in the trash because of this.
