This is not the Snow's clam chowder I have eaten my entire life.  Apparently, Bumble Bee has taken over Snow's and has changed the clam chowder recipe to such a degree that it is completely unrecognizable from it's previous state.  It has gone from the best canned clam chowder to something that is almost unedible.  Don't waste your money on this. . . you will be very disappointed.
