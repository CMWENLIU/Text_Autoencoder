This water tastes like sewage!!! Don't be hyped into buying it like I was. In going back and doing the research, there is nothing in this product that our bodies need except the water, which you can find in your kitchen. It looks horrible and tastes worse! If you feel you need to drink black/brown water, put some water in a glass, go out to your garden and dig up some dirt to add to it.
