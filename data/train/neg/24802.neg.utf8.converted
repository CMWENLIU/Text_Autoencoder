After reading the positive reviews I decided to try this cereal. I'm not impressed. It's too sweet with lots of sugar. There are 14g of sugars per 2/3 cup serving. Some ingredients like the dried fruit and oats are hard while others like the cereal flakes are soft and absorb milk. If you let the hard parts soften up with milk the flakes turn into mush.<br /><br />Familia makes a lot of great cereals and I'm surprised they let this one out the door. They must think Americans are sugar-crazed Coca Cola addicts. I really like the Familia Low-Fat Musli and suggest you buy that instead.<br /><br />On the plus side this cereal has a lot of dried fruit. It tastes good if you eat it quickly before it gets to soggy.
