I agree with several of the reviews I read.  I have been using my Babycook for only 2 months and was really enjoying making my son's baby food, until I noticed that the water coming from the reservoir was discolored.  I looked inside the reservoir and noticed the black film that several other reviews mention.  Now I am very concerned about the food safety and will not be steaming my son's food with this machine.  I have even been diligent about cleaning it with white vinegar as mentioned in the instruction manual, which obviously did not prevent this probleme.  It also produces a small amount of food, so I am constantly having to make food for my son.  I have not tried to contact the company yet, but will be doing so this week.  I do not recommend this product.
