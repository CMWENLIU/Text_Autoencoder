The product is very good. Best oatmeal around. This vendor is NOT. I've tried to get a response from them about the shipping and they have ignored 4 attempts. I paid for expedited shipping, which was more than the oatmeal, or the same and it arrived about 10-14 days later. They shipped it ground and took my money for 2 day shipping. All I wanted was the difference of ground/2nd day reimbursed to my account. I'll go to Ireland before I order from them again.
