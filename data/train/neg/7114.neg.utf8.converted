I received my order that its expiration date has expired.  This item is a food item and if the expiration date has expired, it should NOT be sent to the customers.  It would cost me just as much to return the item than what I had initially paid for - the item and the shipping charges. Food products that has an expiration date should be checked properly before sending out to customers. I find this a "ripped off".
