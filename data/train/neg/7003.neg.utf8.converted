Boy, do I feel dumb. I heard how peanut butter prices were going to shoot up because of a bad crop this year, and decided to stock up before they did. If I'd done some research before I clicked Buy it now, I would have realized these are WAY overpriced - $5/jar, when I saw them at Target yesterday for about $3/jar. I blame no one but myself - I've gotten so used to prices on Amazon being better than local retailers, I just bought without thinking. My rating is not for the Jif, which I love, but for the 66% overcharge.<br /><br />Perhaps, if prices do skyrocket, this price will actually be good, but for the time being, save yourself about $12 and make a trip to the store.
