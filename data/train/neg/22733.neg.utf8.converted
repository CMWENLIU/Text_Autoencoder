Nothing wrong with the product - I have bought this many times before.  However... it wasn't really clear that the Liquid Nation description of a Double Pack really means 1 bulk bag per the photo.  So for over $50 including shipping you get 32 cups of coffee.  Now that's expensive whichever way you look at it.<br />Shop around and you will find bulk packs of 80 cups for only $2-3 more including shipping.  Shame on me for getting ripped off, I won't be using Liquid Nation ever again.
