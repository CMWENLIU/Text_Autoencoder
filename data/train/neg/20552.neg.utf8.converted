I benchmarked many truffle oils before ordering this one.  I ordered it because it is organic, and the only ingredients listed are Olive Oil and Black Truffles.  When my order arrived, I noted that there was no indication on the labeling that the product was organic.  Also, the ingredient was listed on the label as "black truffle aroma".  Black truffle aroma is a manufactured product, not natural, and is chemically induced by bubbling chemical gases in the oil.  There are no truffles used in manufacture.  I am not an expert on what is "organic", but bubbling chemicals into an oil to induce an artificial flavor does not seem "organic" to me.  Buyer beware!
