This is, by far, the worst tasting cereal we've ever had.  The raisins are fine, it's the flakes that leave the most horrible taste in your mouth, sort of a cross between fake bacon bits and cardboard.  My entire family complained about these, even our 3 year old who will eat ANYTHING, pushed her bowl away after one bite.  We bought some other types of cereal from U.S. Mills and it wasn't very good either, but this was definitely the worst.
