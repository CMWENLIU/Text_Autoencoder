I had to throw out three of the bottles of the batch that I ordered because they contained ground glass.  I noticed it instantly when I drank from the first bottle and the bits of glass hit my teeth. I ran the rest through a filter and even more came out.  Two more had the same problem.  Now I don't know what to do with the rest of it.  I don't know if there was a problem in the manufacturing of the glass, or they weren't stored properly, or if the inside of the bottles got chipped somehow, but to have three of them in the same batch is highly suspicious.
