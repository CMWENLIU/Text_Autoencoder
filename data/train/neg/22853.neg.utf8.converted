I ordered this Carolina gold rice with high hopes, after being raised on good rice in the south.  This was tasteless. After paying $11.95 for a two  pound bag and the unbelievable price of $8.34 to ship it to Washington I was very disappointed.  Mahatma yellow rice is a much better choice and only a third of this price and available in most grocery stores out here with no exhorbitant shipping charges.<br />Don't waste your money on this rip off.
