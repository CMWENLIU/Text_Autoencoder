I ordered Ghirardelle Chocolate Frappe Classico, Double Chocolate 50oz can and Ghirardelli Chocolate Frappe Classico, Classic White, 50-Ounce on December 27, 2010.  It was estimated to Deliver on 1/5/2011.  It is 1/10/2011 and the last notice is that  "A label for this shipment has been created, but UPS does not yet have possession of this shipment. Once we receive the shipment, the tracking status will be updated."  So delivery of product is not timely.
