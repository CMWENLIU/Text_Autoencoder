I was very disappointed when I received my shipment.  First, they were just all thrown in a paper bag, and one of them was damaged.  The biggest thing though, is they did not send me what the picture showed.  The majority of them were from the Holiday collection - spiced eggnog, gingerbread and french toast, and I don't think those are even in the picture!  It's like they put in there whatever is on sale at the stores - I just bought the Holiday variety box at Bed, Bath & Beyond for half off, so I was very disappointed that the majority of the 35 were from that collection.  I won't buy them like this anymore.
