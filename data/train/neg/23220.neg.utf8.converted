I bought this tea because my job was stressing me out and causing a lot of anxiety, indigestion, etc. and I use and love the other flavors of Yogi tea.  Unfortunately, I can't handle the taste of this one.  It's just too strong - almost burns your tongue because it is so spicy.  I normally like ginger but this is too much.
