This comes up on Amazon as being Gluten Free, but as a mom of a son with celiac, I always read the ingredients. This description has malt in the ingredients, and malt is made with barley, which has gluten. These may be wheat free, but not gluten free if the ingredients list is correct. Maybe ingredients changed, but I would not suggest this to anyone on a gluten free diet.
