I've enjoyed Jamaican Blue Mountain from the Amber Estate for a number of years but as its price climbed to at times over $75/lb. I had to look for an alternative.  The description of Reggie's Roast Panama Blue sounded like it might fill the bill, unfortunately, this was not the case.<br /><br />Top quality Blue Mountain coffees are most often given a light, mild roast which allows their nuances to gently fill your senses with an essence I can only describe as honeyed liquid gold.  Reggie's Roast Panama Blue is said to be a blend of Jamaican Blue Mountain and Panama Boquet coffees.  I suspect it contained very little of any Blue Mountain coffee, much less a "blue" from the top quality estates.  I found the roast to be darker than expected and the result was a somewhat coarse coffee with chocolate over-tones that had none of the light, bright honey notes I had expected.<br /><br />It was worth a try, but this coffee just doesn't do it for me.
