The Hormel Compleats that contain sauce always contain a lot more of it than the picture on the packaging suggests.  This variety is no exception.  The picture is very misleading and suggests a much more solid meal than you get.<br /><br />The ravioli are thin and underfilled.  The marinara sauce has an unusually strong flavor, one which may or may not be to your personal liking.  I disliked it mostly because I found it distinctly sweet (the ingredients include sugar and high fructose corn syrup).  As it also contains vinegar, the taste is reminiscent of a Chinese sweet and sour sauce.<br /><br />If you are looking for a convenient, very light snack with a strong and unusual taste, you might give this a try, but I would want less sugar in the sauce and more filling in the ravioli before I tried it again.
