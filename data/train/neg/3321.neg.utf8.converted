It definitely tastes like espresso...bitter and strong. It doesn't necessarily translate to a chilled drink that well, in my opinion. It's good, just not great. If you're really looking for that espresso flavor in chilled form, this is recommended. Otherwise, stick with their cappuccino version...it tastes much better.
