I mistakenly bought 3 bottles of the stuff without tasting it first. This syrup taste like a bad diet drink from the 70's. I guess they just have not been able to duplicate the genuine flavor of sugar. I ended up trying it in coffee as a flavor and it still came up short. Three bottles down the drain.
