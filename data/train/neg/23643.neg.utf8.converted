I bought this product so that I could make a split pea soup with bacon flavoring, but without the meat.  I was wrong to think that a bunch seasoning could imitate the flavor of bacon.  It tastes like ramen seasoning or really salty bacon bits.  The only flavor that was even edible was the Bacon Salt Natural.  Don't waste your money on this product.
