As a nurse practitioner, I've learned a lot about infant and child nutrition. First, you must understand that children under age 2 NEED fats for their brains to develop. Brain matter is mostly fat. If babies and toddlers don't get enough fat, their neurological development will be impaired. Human breast milk is mostly fat (about 50% of calories); while the other half is milk sugars (lactose). Protein is actually a very small part of human milk. Nature naturally has saturated fats & cholesterol in mother's milk for infant mammals, as well as the yolk of egg for baby chicks. In other words, fats, particularly saturated fat and cholesterol are very necessary and healthy for a rapidly growing infant body and brain. That is why FULL FAT dairy is recommended by all doctors for every child under the age of 2.<br />Anyways, in reviewing the nutritional data on this drink, it is very low in calories, especially fat calories. I'd be concerned if parents tried to replace dairy with this drink. A child's brain and development could negatively be affected by not having enough fat. Plus a child would not get enough calories with this drink.<br />Most other countries in the world use milk for their children- not necessarily cow's milk though. I've breastfed my daughter for 1 year, and have now switched her over to goat's milk, which is recommended for children who have milk intolerances or sensitivities. The fats and proteins in goats milk are more broken down, making it easier to digest than cow's milk. If you are looking for a healthy alternative to cow's milk, I'd recommend goat's milk much more over this "rice drink".
