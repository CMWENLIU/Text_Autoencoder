I agree with some of the other reviewers about the Splenda.  This would be perfectly delicious if they didn't pre-load it with Splenda!  Even my husband, who uses Splenda as his sweetener, thinks that they put too much of it in here.  It would make more sense if they left it out altogether so that people may sweeten it as they wish, if at all.
