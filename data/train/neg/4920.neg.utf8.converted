I am very disappointed in this product. I thought this was the same brand of 'olive oil rosemary' potato chip I had purchased (These chips and packaging look the same as others I have purchased.) and loved in the past.... but this product is inferior. I would not recommend this product unless you plan to eat them with sometype of sour cream dip, they are not very flavorful.....
