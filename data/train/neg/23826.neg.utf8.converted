The tea is not quite what I expected. The "flowers" are already opened. Other teas of this type that I have had, have been tightly rolled up and expanded in the hot water to form the flower. That was a let down. The tea its self did have a good flavor. As for the pot, the lid has no catch so you have to try to hold it on when you pour, or it falls off (usually into the cup and splashes). The pot gets VERY HOT and is hard to hold - especially the lid. On the whole, I was very disappointed with this set. I would not recommend it to others.
