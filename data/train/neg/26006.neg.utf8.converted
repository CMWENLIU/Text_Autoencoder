I bought this for my wife because she was looking for a change of pace from her usual mandarin orange spice tea. She was disappointed in that the tea had very little discernible cranberry flavor. Green teas are generally much milder (at least to me), but I had to agree that this one is too weak. I love iced green tea with lemon, but I am not a big hot tea drinker. Since you must buy the 2-pack from Amazon, I would suggest you really consider if you want to experiment. We won't be buying it again, but some might like it.
