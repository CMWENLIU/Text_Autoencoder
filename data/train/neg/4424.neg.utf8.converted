The items came well packaged and in a timely manner.  I am giving it 2 stars because out of the package it had dirt and what smelled like animal excrement on it.  I cleaned it twice before giving it to my dog.  The rack was almost completely black out of the package and after cleaning it myself it was the light brown that they normally are....but it has still retained the bad odor.  My dog is hesitant to use it because of the bad smell.  I have ordered other elk racks before and just be forewarned that this company does not clean the rack before shipment.  Other companies do.  I did not purchase this expecting to have to clean the dirt and animal excrement off it.  I'll be purchasing my next one (which is probably very soon since my dog won't touch this one) from another company.
