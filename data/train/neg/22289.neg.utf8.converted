After two years in my bin, I uncovered black moist compost and...wait for it....UN-decomposed green bags.  What the heck?  "Compostable" bags that do not Compost.  Have returned to putting everything in my compost can and just dumping into the composting bin and then rinsing-out the can.<br /><br />And after some research, you discover that these bags are made from corn; corn that is mostly fertilized in the US from derived petroleum products; great I'm composting and contributing to greenhouse gases all at the same time!
