I have been using Sun Madras curry powder for almost 30 years. It is (or was) the only Indian-type curry powder I have (had) ever used. I tried a lot of different brands over the years, both powder and paste, but Sun Madras always filled my kitchen with a beautiful, round, warm curry smell. I bought this item knowing it was a ton of curry powder, but I always bragged about how good it was to friends and family and they always loved my different curries. I thought I could break the cans up into smaller amounts to give away.<br /><br />Not doing that now. This is not the same Sun Madras I have always used. It lacks the fragrance and richness of the previous cans I have purchased. It is also too salty. I always had to add a little  salt to the "older recipe" powder, but adding salt to the curry I made with this stuff ruined it. I should have known it was different when I put it in the pan. It was not as yellowish-orange as it usually is, more like a grayish color. It also did not release the same fragrance as I was sauteeing it.<br /><br />The back of the can says it is a product of "American Marketing Team, Inc." which may explain the difference. I suspect they bought the rights to the brand name and immediately started adding salt and other cheaper materials to reach some kind of ROI goal.<br /><br />Yeah, I know all this sounds kind of whiny ("Hey, it's only curry powder...") but this is a brand of spice I've had in my cabinet for a very long time and on which I have always relied.  Other cooks out there will appreciate what I'm saying. Now I've got to find a new curry powder.....
