I used this product, previously, when it was called Organic Coffee Bean Eye Cream -- and the ingredients listed green tea as the first ingredient...Now the packaging has changed, but the name of the product hasn't, nor has the description claiming it has green tea...but if you read the ingredients -- the first ingredient listed (which means it is the largest ingredient) shows that it's aloe vera -- and no where is "green tea" mentioned as an ingredient!  Misleading and deceptive.  I'm not so sure it's as effective as the one I previously bought from the same company. Makes me very suspicious and possibly not worth the money.  If I wanted Aloe Vera for my eyes, I can just buy that.
