My husband and I are runners and have tried many "energy booster" nutritional products.  This one (orange) is my husband's favorite for taste and consistency. (It is WAY too sweet for me.  I prefer the cherry flavor.)  We can highly recommend the product itself.  However, while we are loyal Amazon.com shoppers (too loyal! LOL), do not purchase this product here.  We ordered two cases in anticipation of a heavy race season and they arrived REEKING of cigarette smoke.  The smell was nauseating.  As it was an edible item, it is not eligible for return so into the garbage it went.  Buy locally.
