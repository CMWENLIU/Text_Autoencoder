Thought these would taste much better than a standard box mix, especially for the price.  Extremely sweet - both the frosting and the cake.  And the frosting is not the pink color depicted in the picture on the box.  Only very slightly pink.  The cupcakes taste neither like white chocolate, nor like raspberry.  Save your money!
