While this "dinner kit" resulted in a fairly tasty meal (slather anything in Velveeta cheese sauce, and it's going to be tasty), we were pretty disappointed in this product.  The apparently freeze-dried broccoli was a joke!  It consisted of the teeny-tiniest little pieces of broccoli (think the individual little "nubs" from a floret), such that you couldn't easily detect the dish had any broccoli in it at all.  If you want a meal consisting of chicken & broccoli mac 'n' cheese, you would be far, FAR better off buying some plain mac 'n' cheese (we buy the Kraft Velveeta brand cheese and shells often), than steaming some fresh broccoli to add in with some chicken.  Even adding frozen broccoli florets would be a huge improvement over the "broccoli dust" (to quote another reviewer) included in this packaged meal...
