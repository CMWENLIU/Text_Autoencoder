I am a mother who had been successfully exclusively breastfeeding for over three months.  I noticed my supply was getting less and less and was told by a couple  of people said to try this herb.<br /><br />As I said in the title, I really would love to say it worked for me, but after taking this product, as directed, in hopes of boosting my milk supply, it failed to deliver.  I am not saying it may not work for others,  but all it did for me was make me smell like maple syrup, and not in a good way.<br /><br />Maybe it will work for you as it has for others.
