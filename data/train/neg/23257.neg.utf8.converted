I actually had bad effects using this tea.  I was given it by a friend and was unaware of its medicinal properties (so was my friend, fyi).  Within 15 minutes I was starting to get paranoid and less socially apt, and started to feel distant from everything which was going on.  Before long, I was also tending towards depression (which I've experienced before while on birth control, so I caught the signs of it).  I also felt like fainting at a few points.  The effects did go away within about 5 hours.  This was after drinking only a quarter of a mug of it.<br /><br />These are actually the same reactions I had to two different varieties of the birth control pill.  So, if you've reacted badly to birth control, be warned that you may also react badly to this tea.  Or, you may be lucky in that it will not affect you.  Take care if you do try it, and good luck!
