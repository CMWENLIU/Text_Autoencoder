Diet Mountain Dew has been my diet drink of choice for years now, but I've always been weary of the aspartame in it.  Noticed Mountain Zevia and was hoping it would be a new alternative as I use Stevia-based sweetners on a regular basis now for coffee and tea.  Unfortunately, this has a long way to go to be an acceptable alternative to Diet Dew.  It's a very offputting taste, almost peppery and not nearly as smooth as Dew.  I have also tried regular cola Zevia and noticed the same issues.  I tried with ice and without ice and while ice made it somewhat more palatable, it was still not enjoyable to me.<br /><br />There is a lot of erythritol which is a sugar alcohol and may have something to do with the different flavor.  I would love to see a combination of stevia with a small amount of real sugar which would add negligible calories but could perhaps add the kick of flavor needed.
