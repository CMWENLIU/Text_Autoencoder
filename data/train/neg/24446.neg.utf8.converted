As if mayonnaise wasn't unhealthy enough for you they have to add bacon to it now!  And we wonder why the heart disease rate is so high in our country.  In fact, more americans DIE every year from Salmonela poisoning than from swine flu, lightning strikes and roadside bombs combined!  Look it up!  I can't wait to be President so we can outlaw mayonnaise and put the criminals who make it behind bars where they belong and in this instance, THE DEATH PENALTY for wasting perfectly good bacon!!!
