This is for Costa Rica blend. I do not like giving bad reviews but I rely on reviews myself , so I feel it important. Amazon sent me an email about their newest kcups and I was excited to try them. After looking at all choices and description, and reviews, although they were hard to find since most were for the variety pack; I chose the Costa Rica blend. I did not want too bold a coffee and this seemed to fit the bill. After trying two brews with different strengths, this coffee just tastes " off" and like an inexpensive coffee. It actually upset my stomach causing acid, with very little consumed. Specifically, though, the taste is weak, like old coffee;  not smooth or full flavor, and the smell which I noticed immediately-had an unpleasant aroma. Not the great coffee smell we all welcome with our morning coffee. Maybe I got a bad batch but the date was ok and these are new, so I think it's the way they are. I cannot recommend.
