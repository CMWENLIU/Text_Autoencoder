AVOID AT ALL COST - Coffee purchased from AMAZON was received on July 14, 2010 but date on coffee bag indicates it was packed on June 30, 2009 (13 months old).  Anyone who drinks coffee knows that ground coffee becomes stale within less than 6 months and yet Amazon delivers coffee that was packed (per date on package) MORE than a YEAR before purchase date.  Advise NOT to buy from Amazon if you want fresh ground coffee that is NOT stale.  Better option is to buy Melitta from their web site which often has sales at half price (well below Amazon's best price).  Their coffee (Melitta-dot-com) is always fresh direct from their roasting factory and just as good as this brand.  I have had this coffee (Douwe Egberts) before while visiting in England (UK) and when fresh it is great, but can not understand Amazon sending stale coffee to their customers.  I see from the other review that I am not the only customer to receive stale coffee from Amazon.  SHAME on Amazon for sending old food/beverage items to their customers without stating in the item description that the product is very old (no longer fresh).  At least in our local grocery stores they segregate and mark down items clearly stating that the items are near, at, or past their expiration date, letting the fully informed customer make a decision based on ALL known facts.
