After five months of exclusively nursing, this was the first food that I bought for my baby. I usually trust Amazon to offer a good price, and I hadn't done any comparison shopping for this rice cereal. Bad idea!  I paid more than $12 here for my first box, and just today purchased a box at the grocery store for $3.19 -- and that was NOT on sale, just regular price. I think the seller is taking advantage of the fact that many moms will be buying this as their first food for baby, and aren't aware of how these things are priced. It's a disgrace--buy this product, but buy it elsewhere!
