Are the Diamond Walnuts chemically treated. The recent package that i bought from Stop & Shop has a very strong smell from the shell. On investigation I read few articles stating that Diamond Walnut spray Radio Active and Treat Walnuts with Chemical. These Chemicals are CANCER causing and dangerous for health. The Company can refute these charges with a video showing the  complete process till packaging.
