This zig n zag ball, from what i can remember from the advertising, claimed to have self-propelled zig/zag action.  All it really has is a weighted ball inside a larger plastic ball, which occasionally causes the larger ball to veer off course.<br /><br />However, it does not zig or zag for very long, either on carpeting (which the instructions suggest against) or hardwood floor (so if it works great on marble or perhaps concrete, i don't know)<br /><br />I found that if you get the inner ball rolling inside before you let the big ball loose, the zig n zag action is more pronounced, but still not very exciting.<br /><br />However, because of the inner ball, it makes a noise that attracts my cat to it, who uses it anyways.<br /><br />However, it just didn't live up to what was promised.
