Extremely disappointed in the lack of quality for this product.  I ordered two boxes, to be used at a wedding for a candy buffet, and BOTH boxes arrived with every single candy stick broken in multiple places.  Out of 160 sticks (total), not ONE was unbroken.  It is beyond me how a company can ship fragile merchandise so carelessly. Very very disappointed.
