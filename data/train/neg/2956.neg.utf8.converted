I used this product just the other day, April 5. My lawn has been taken over by dandilions and clover. I bought 2 gallons of this stuff hoping my problems would be solved. It says it kills the weeds in 24 hours but 24 hours later, the weeds still looked healthy as ever. I'll give it a few more days to see if anything changes. If not, I'll be highly dissapointed. :(
