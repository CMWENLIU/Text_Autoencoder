This product lists equivalency in drops, yet the packaging is not a dropper style bottle nor does it have any type of dropper applicator. The equivalency is also very wrong, it is not nearly as sweet as it labels itself to be. It also has a bitter after-taste that I have not had with other sucralose based liquid sweeteners.
