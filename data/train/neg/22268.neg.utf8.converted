My carob chips arrived in one big ball-totally unsuitable for use. If you plan on ordering these carob chips during the summer months, I don't recommend it at all. The company (Barry Farms) does not provide proper packaging to assure this particular item arrives as it was packaged originally. While I ordered directly from the company I cannot speak for shipping from Amazon. But my guess is that the same thing would happen since Barry Farms supplies Amazon with the items to ship out to the customer.
