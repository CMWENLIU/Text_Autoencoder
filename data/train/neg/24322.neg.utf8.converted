Very disappointed in the condition of the Eight O'Clock Italian Roast I received. Coffee tasted very stale. I didn't expect to receive short-coded product from Amazon. Due to the poor flavor, I threw the coffee away and will think twice before ordering coffee from Amazon again. Amazon should only sell FRESH coffee!
