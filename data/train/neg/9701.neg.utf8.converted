A short background on the eating habits of my two cats, one is super finicky and the other cat will eat just about anything. When even my non-picky cat wouldn't touch any of it, I knew something was not right with this food. They refused to eat any of it. I like the premise behind the food, all natural and grain-free, but I am going to have to go back to the prior food my cats like. Hopefully my local animal shelter can make use of the food for their cats, if they even eat it.
