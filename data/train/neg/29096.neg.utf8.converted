This sauce has a nasty bitter flavor. I have no idea where all these people are getting that it tastes good, it doesn't. If you use it as a sauce it is just horrible. The heat level is not very high either, don't let anyone try to fool you on that. Oooh, let's capitalize on the ghost pepper craze. Whatever. This is weak sauce, end of story. I like the other products from Dave's but I say give this one a pass.
