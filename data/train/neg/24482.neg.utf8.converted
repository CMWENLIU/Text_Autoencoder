Silly me - I thought 60 containers meant 15 of each of the four types of cereal.  Instead, I got 22 of the plain Special K (my least favorite of the four) and only 4 of the Kashi (the one I really wanted).  I'll eat them because I paid for them and they are convenient but I won't buy this "assortment" again.<br /><br />Unless you're a big fan of Special K, don't bother.
