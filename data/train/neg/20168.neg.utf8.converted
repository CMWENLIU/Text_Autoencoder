I ordered this product last year and it was very good. This year when I received, it tasted different in a BAD way. Da Vinci must have changed their recipe since last year. Now it has an artificial after taste...like when you spray perfume or cologne and it gets in your mouth. Has a perfume taste and even a perfume like smell. Revised recipe must contain too much of the aromatic spices and/or artificial spices. To Marketing and Research people at Da Vinci....If it ain't broken, don't fix it....a lesson Starbucks needs to learn. I will NEVER buy this product again. I have more than 3/4 of a container left which will be thrown out.....
