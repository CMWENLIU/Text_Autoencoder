I use hot water to dissolve powered milk and froth for cappuccino.  Reconstituted nonfat dry milk usually produces a lovely thick froth.  THIS product goes into solution only after brisk whisking. A portion of the product just clumps!  It is difficult to find organic dry milk...I'll keep searching.
