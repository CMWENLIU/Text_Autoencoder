Definitely a few things I agree that other reviewers noted:<br /><br />1) Small loaf - only really makes a 1 lb-er even if it gives instructions on a 1.5 loaf<br />2) Rise problems - my boxes don't expire until 2012 but I still had rise problems. A friend from the culinary school nearby said it might be because there is a lot more whole wheat in it (a good thing for the body, not as good in the bread maker). As noted in another review, baking it in the oven really did make a better and higher loaf.<br />3) Butter is best - tried oil and butter and butter is definitely better.<br />4) A little more salt - I added an additional 1/2 tsp of salt and that seemed to help with the rise as well.<br /><br />It's a great backup for when you're out of bread flour or yeast but I still think the best bread machine recipe from allrecipes.com (subbing in 2 cups of flour, 1 cup whole wheat) makes for the most delicious and closest to store bought I've seen thus far.
