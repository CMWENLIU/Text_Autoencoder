I am not sure why this product comes up under Halal & Kosher but the company has check at the back, if in the ingredients it says contains gelatin, if its beef gelatin, its okay, but if its pig, or pork gelatin, its haram. but if it only says gelatin, then call the number at the back and ask them for yourself!<br />5/28/2011: After confirming with Kraft Foods Canada, the Gelatin in these marshmallows are indeed Pork based, so if you eat Halal or Kosher, please be sure that order the right product before you buy it.
