I found this only average for making falafels. But then I read about  the company, OSEM, based in Israel--and decided that our American products, FANTASTIC and CASBEH, both of actually better quality, will get my future business. I'll have fewer carbon footprints with not having OSEM boxes transported  1/2 way across the world, and won't be giving money to Israel, a country which continues to snub international laws and disobey countless UN resolutions.<br />By the way, I say this as part of a Jewish family.<br />  VM Feldman
