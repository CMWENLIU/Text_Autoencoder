This product is not easy to find so we were excited to find it and anticipated it's arrival.<br />Unfortunately, what we received was a case full of product that was past it's expired date.<br />We contacted the company, by email (as that was the only way listed).<br />After a few days they emailed back with a phone number to call.<br />On that call they told us they could send us additional product, but that those dates were out of code as well. They blamed the manufacturer and took no ownership. They did not offer any other solution - no offer to take it back, no offer to refund our money.<br />This was a disappointing conclusion for us.<br />Selling product that is not in code is not only not acceptable, it is not honest and I believe against the law.
