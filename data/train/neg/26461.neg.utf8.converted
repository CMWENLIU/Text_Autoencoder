I've only tried the Mojito flavor and was somewhat disappointed. It starts off well; no real alcohol flavor or smell (so it's safe for work-- ha!).  The problem is the unpleasant aftertaste.  It took me a couple of minutes to pinpoint a toothpaste flavor as the skunk in the rose garden.<br /><br />I'll finish the rest, but won't buy it again.
