<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KB89EY">Floral Honeystix - Wildflower - 100% Honey - Pack of 50 Stix - Honey Sticks</a>Please note that these honey stix are small, mini-stix, not full size.  In my opinion, they are not worth the $10 price tag because per ounce they are ultra expensive. They are packaged in a small plastic baggie and not suitable to give as a gift. You can find other types of honey at a better price.  If you are a fan of the honeystix, check local beekeepers in your area for honey sellers.
