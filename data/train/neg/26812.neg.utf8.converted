This review isn't for oats in general but in this particular posting for them. The price on this is outrageous. While there is no difference in oats in general (Quaker is just the same as any store brand) I understand if one must have Quaker; however, this is not the venue in which to do it. These oats are so overpriced as to be offensive. The same size box sells for $7 at Sam's. As one poster recommended, you would be better off buying them at the supermarket than on here. Better yet, just go to Sam's and pay less than half!
