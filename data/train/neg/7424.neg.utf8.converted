I really tried to like this stuff, I tried about 20 pieces (different flavors) and I had to spit them out they were so gross. The texture is soggy, the flavor is weak (can't figure out what most of the flavors are supposed to be), and there's this terrible, lingering aftertaste that's something akin to Pine-Sol - you know, the floor cleaner. I love salt water taffy, but this stuff was inedible. Don't waste your money on this!
