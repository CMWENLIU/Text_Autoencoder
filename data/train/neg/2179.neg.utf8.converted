This item was a part of an order that had two other items, each from different sender. I received the first two within a few days, this one never showed up. When it was already a few days late I had an order number so I checked where it was to see why I haven't still gotten it. It was delivered. To San Diego, California. I live in SLC Utah! OK. Just a mistake, no problem. I emailed the company and they gave the shipping number to check where it is because they sent it. First of all, they gave me a wrong number, luckily I had mine saved from when I made the order. When I copy pasted the delivery to Sand Diego info and asked them what is up with that, I never got the reply back. I tried again a few days later asking do they intend to resend this item or will they give me a refung....still no replay. This is not a lot of money, but it pisses me of that I ordered something through Amazon and the company is doing this. I will most definitely never order anything from them again, and today I am contacting Amazon to see what they can do about it. it isn't the money, it's the principal!
