While I don't often post reviews, I feel compelled to for this product as it was such an incredible disappointment. I was a food writer and food editor for a number of publications for many years and am happy to invest research time into selecting the right products, especially when you are buying multiples of a single item. This broth had some excellent reviews, and I find it hard to believe that the reviewers had tasted/evaluated the same product that I purchased as the broth tasted watery with little real chicken flavor and had almost an artificial flavor to it. While it may be organic, there is none of the savory warmth most of us would associated with even a somewhat watered-down version of homemade broth. I actually found that to use it, I had to prepare a "side order" of Better Than Bouillon chicken flavor to kick in some semblance of real, hearty chicken flavor. What's interesting is that perhaps this experience comports with a number of blind tastings of organic and free-range poultry wherein the organic and free-range birds often came up quite short on flavor as much as we all would like to think the flavor would be better from a purely philosophical perspective. When you also add in the price premium, I would say this is not a product that I would recommend at all.
