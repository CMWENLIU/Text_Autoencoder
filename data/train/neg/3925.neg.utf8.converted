I was a big fan of raw chocolate, in fact I have ordered from Navitas for their cacao powder. However, I have recently found out that cacao powder has the highest source of THEOBROMINE which a neurotoxin. Having cacao powder on a CONSISTENT BASIS has been shown to cause tremble, sweating, nausea among a list of other side-effects. So essentially, you are harming your brain when eating chocolate. You might be very surprised to learn of these side-effects as I was myself but please do your OWN RESEARCH and you will come across same conclusions.<br />Even the natives in South America never used cacoa as supplements. The fresh fruit from that comes from cacao plant(aka theobroma plant) is what the natives eat and use for making drinks. The fruit is harmless but it is the seeds inside the fruit, which are used to make this powder or any chocolate, that are extremely harmful.<br />I have heard Carob is an excellent alternative.
