The size of the "new and improved" bar is less than half the size of the packaging.  In each package is now a one to two bite-size bar.  Ridiculous.  My non-celiac child actually likes these, but my celiac son dislikes the "new" bar, and I was buying them for him.  The size of the bar is about half of what is shown on the box.  Total rip-off.
