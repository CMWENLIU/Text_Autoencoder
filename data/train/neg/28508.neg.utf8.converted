I made the mistake of purchasing this bag on Amazon's "Subscribe and Save" deal, figuring it would be a good deal. Lesson learned. No returns allowed on "Subscribe and Save;" I learned that important point after the product arrived.<br /><br />The garbanzo beans were filled with bug holes and many of them are eaten away by beetles or whatever species of insect they are, still crawling in the plastic bag. How can someone clear this product for sale? Thee bug holes are clearly visible through the clear plastic bag and there is a pile of bug eggs/larvae/garbanzo dust at the bottom of the bag. Very disappointed. As if the bug infestation wasn't bad enough, many of the beans are also shriveled, meaning they won't re-hydrate properly. The beans also have a generally unfresh odor, as if they were sitting on a warehouse floor for months (which they probably were).<br /><br />I will not be purchasing any products from TASTE Specialty Foods again. Clearly, quality is not a hallmark of this company. Be warned.
