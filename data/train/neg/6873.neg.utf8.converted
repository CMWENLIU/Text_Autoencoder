I was looking for another dark/bold coffee. From the description, Fuhgeddaboutit sounded like it would be a nice change from previous purchases of Jet Fuel, Fog Chaser, and Black Tiger - all of which are terrific coffees. Very disappointed because this was neither dark or bold. I shared some of the k-cups with coworkers to get their opinion and the most positive response was that it tasted "funky", at least more positive than "tastes like paper".<br /><br />Sorry, this one didn't cut it...
