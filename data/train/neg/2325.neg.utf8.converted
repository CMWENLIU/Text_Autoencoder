I do not understand how anyone with actual working tastebuds can stomach this drink. I could barely swallow it without gagging. It made me nauseated and left a nasty taste in my mouth for hours. Just makes me cringe, shudder, and shake thinking about how it tasted. Reminds me of the reactions of infants when given their first taste of something sour like a pickle. The willies will get you!
