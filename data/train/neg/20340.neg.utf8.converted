Friends of ours recommended this soup.  What a disappointment.  It is a an unmemorable  cream soup.  The picture on the can is misleading.  If you look at the picture you would expect it to be full of chunky goodness.  Instead you find a cream soup which is condensed and when reconstituted is a notch below the famous brand name Cream of Mushroom.  There is no chunky goodness.  As a matter of facts the only chunks you might find are parts of the soup which have fully not blended.  Might use it in recipes that call for a cream soup.  Certainly expected more at over $3 a can.
