I have never written a review for any product, but I always read reviews of products I'm not sure about.  I had to throw these noodles away.  I followed the directions on the package as written.  The smell was terrible.  I cooked them and then added them to pasta sauce.  I ate several bites trying to like them.  Finally, I gave up and threw the rest of my dinner away.  My stomach was upset for the rest of the evening.  I threw the rest of my order away as well.  Just thinking about the way they looked and smelled makes me nauseous.  Don't waste your money.  If you're wanting real pasta just eat skinny for a few days then enjoy the real thing.
