I really wanted this to work so I sided with the 60 some-odd positive reviews as opposed to the 30-ish nays & purchased this when my daughter turned six months. Well, two months to the day I started using the BB (today she is eight months), the blender function stopped working. It will still steam, but not blend. Also, day one some of the plastic curved pieces on the bottom of the container broke off (but it still functioned), and the unit has been leaking the brown/black fluid for a while. I just disregarded these issues because I really wanted it to work. Romanticizing the all-in-one factor and all....<br /><br />I of course recycled all the packaging so I don't know if Amazon will take it back. Sounds like BB customer service is a waste of time too. AND I even took the unit apart this morning and the belt is turning just fine...<br /><br />So, all I can do is warn other parents - do not buy this machine! It's not worth the trouble for the few weeks of service it provides. I really don't understand why it's so difficult to make a quality product when you're charging this much for it.
