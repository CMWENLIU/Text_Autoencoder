From reading other reviews, this white mocha mix seemed to be good if you like Starbucks white chocolate mocha. However, I did not like it at all. It does not taste anything remotely similar to Starbucks white chocolate mocha. As another reviewer pointed out, it is pure sugar. It does not have a chocolate flavor or a mocha flavor. I can't really describe the taste, but it basically tastes like you are drinking sweet milk with a subtle hint of chocolate.
