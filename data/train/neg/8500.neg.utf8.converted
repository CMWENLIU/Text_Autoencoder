You see the picture of this? Well, what I got were tiny dried up odds and ends. I don't know if this is normal for this product, but I expected them to be like the picture. It had way too much sugar, probably because the pieces were so small. They were not nice and square, they were much smaller and mostly triangle, and nugget shaped. I bought them mainly to use with some red onions and cook them with steak. But it would probably be too sweet, as small and sugary as they are.<br /><br />UPDATE: I emailed the seller and they told me they switched companies and the new company was not selling the squuares pictured on the bag and that is why they were smaller. I don't know. But they refunded me. Good company to deal with, anyway.
