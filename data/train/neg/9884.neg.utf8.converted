If you are looking for a tea storage box, and happen to stumble upon Amazon's subscribe and save page on two leaves and a bud tea presentation box, please note that teas are included, even though Amazon specifically says "Two Leaves and a Bud Bamboo Presentation Box (Tea Not Included)". This is a problem, as if you don't like the box, you cannot return it. And, in my case, bamboo box is poorly constructed and edges are not properly put together (gaps, rough edges, low quality construction). Definitely not what I would consider a presentation box!<br /><br />And, if you are wondering about the product dimensions (as they were not listed on the page, but provided by one of the reviewers), here they are (in inches):<br />- outside dimensions: 15 3/4 x 7 x 4 1/4<br />- inside sections: ~3 1/2 x 3 1/4 and true to the picture, there are 8 sections<br /><br />I can't comment on the tea, as I haven't tasted it yet.<br /><br />PS. Yes, I did think it was strange for Amazon to offer subscribe and save on a bamboo box.... But there was nothing on the product information to indicate this was anything but an empty box! And, I have seen stranger things :)
