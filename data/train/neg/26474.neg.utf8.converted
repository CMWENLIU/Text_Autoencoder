The product arrived in a timely manner, thanks for that. Otherwise, I am quite disappointed. It sure looks nice on the product description page, but don't be fooled. I expected some sort of slab bacon similar in texture to a store bought bacon package looking like the photo. Not so, 99.9% pure fat, barely hints of "meat". I was planning on using this bacon as seasoning for pea, lentil and bean soups, but it's completely unusable and ended up in the garbage. Not worth it.
