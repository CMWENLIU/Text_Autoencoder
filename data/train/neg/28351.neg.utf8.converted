WHILE RICE IS A FOOD STAPLE THAT, IF STORED PROPERLY, CAN STAY NUTRITIOUS AND SAFE FOR CENTURIES, THIS WAS NOT A LEGAL TRANSACTION ON THE PART OF THE MANUFACTURER, AS THEY CROSSED OFF (OR AMAZON CROSSED OFF!!!) A<br />JANUARY 2007 EXPIRATION DATE!!!!!!!!!!!! BEWARE!!!!!!!! FORTUNATELY, I TRIED THE PRODUCT, AFTER CAREFUL INSPECTION, AND THE VACUUM SEALED BAGS SAVED THE FRESHNESS AND WERE NOT TAINTED WITH INSECTS, ETC. - THE FLAVOR WAS GRATIFYING - THUS 2 STARS...
