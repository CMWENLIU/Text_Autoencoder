Simply awful product if you are familiar with Sunsweet or other domestic brands.  I don't really care if they came from Al Sharpton's basement, they taste stale, colorless, not tangy like an apricot... OMG.  I write a lot of positive food reviews here and there is nothing to say about these.  I suppose if you were a very dedicated veg that you could mix them with some normal Sunsweet apricots and get them down.  I'm going to find a way to use them as a door stop.  Save your money, there's lot's of other brands of apricots on here including Newmans Own.
