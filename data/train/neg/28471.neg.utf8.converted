I bought these several times for my mother.  The first time she loved them and I ordered more when she ran out.  The second time about half the batch tasted fresh, but the other half was dried out.  I hadn't ordered them for a couple of months, then she decided to try one more batch.  This batch was the same or worse than the last, mostly dried out.  I bought one box to try from the store and they were fine, so it must have something to do with the age of the product.
