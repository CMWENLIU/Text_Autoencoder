I purchased this syrup in a store, not on Amazon. It sounded nice however I did not do my research on agave syrup before hand.<br />Read up on this sweetener first before purchasing it, don't just assume that it's natural or raw. I'm not an expert so I'm not going to preach/teach, but go online and look it up and decide if it's right for you.<br /><br />It has a mild, sweet taste. Like a mild honey and caramel flavor.<br />I think I'll just stick to local honey.
