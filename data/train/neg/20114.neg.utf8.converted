I was excited to find this product at Sam's Club.  I purchased it with plans to make cold chicken salad with it.  I opened two cans, drained the liquid and added chopped celery, salt, pepper and mayonaise.  This has to be the blandest food I have ever tasted.  No matter what I did, I couldn't taste the chicken.  The cans came with recipes for cooked chicken dishes but I can't imagine that the chicken has any more flavor cooked than it does cold and straight out of the can.  If you love good chicken flavor in your chicken salad, buy the chicken and cook it yourself because you won't get it with this product.
