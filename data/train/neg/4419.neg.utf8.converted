The box says the flavor has been "improved" which is a shocking claim in light of the absolutely digusting flavor and appearance of this pasta. Besides rice flour, it also contains rice bran, which I guess is supposed to give it a texture closer to wheat pasta. Well, it doesn't work, and it also gives the pasta a disturbing beige hue and a truly vomitous taste. My two year old and I spit it out almost simultaneously. The baby ate it, but she also eats lint, so what does she know.
