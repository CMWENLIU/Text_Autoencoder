Claim Jumper restaurants use Helen Grace's Fudge Topping on their Mud Pie dessert. I had this dessert recently and liked the fudge accent so well I decided to buy some. Unfortunately, my experience at home was that the Fudge Topping out of the jar tastes different from the topping at the restaurant, it's far sweeter out of the jar. It also seemed to be of a different consistency. The Fudge Topping out of the jar, even though it started out warm and smooth, froze instantly into unappetizing globs on top of the ice cream. I'm not sure what the explanation is for these differences, although I suspect Claim Jumper somehow tweaks the topping before serving it. At Claim Jumper on top of their Mud Pie, it's fabulous, but at home, out of the jar, this topping was a disappointment. Helen Grace does offer refunds though and their customer service is excellent, and that's why I gave them two stars.
