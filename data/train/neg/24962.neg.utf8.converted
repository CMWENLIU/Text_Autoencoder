On a recent trip to Holland I had the opportunity to experience<br />your excellent Senseo coffee.  I liked it so much that upon my return to<br />Seattle I immediately checked for the machine's availability in the<br />United States and was thrilled to find it at Amazon.com.  Last week I<br />bought the Senseo machine along with four boxes of medium roast<br />decaffeinated pods.  I also received one package of regular medium roast<br />and one package of mild roast with the Senseo machine. <p> To my horror all of the coffee I received is a very poor<br />substitute of the Douwe Egberts coffee I enjoyed so much in Holland.<br />The coffee that was delivered to me is weak and tasteless.  In fact, to<br />get halfway decent coffee I have to use two pods for one four-ounce cup.<br />This is unacceptable not only from the point of view of expense, it also<br />limits the use of the machine to one four-ounce serving at the time.  <p> I request that you provide Senseo coffee machine users here with<br />the same quality coffee you sell in Holland (at $16.99 for a four-pack<br />of pods it is more than twice as expensive here, which I'm willing to<br />pay only if the coffee is of the same superior quality).  Starbucks is a<br />huge success in this country because it sells real coffee, not some<br />watered-down version of the real thing.<p> Until I receive quality coffee to substitute for the poor coffee<br />I now have, I will tell my friends, neighbors, colleagues and anybody<br />else who might be interested not to invest in the Senseo machine.  In<br />the meantime I would be happy to return the coffee to you because I have<br />no use for it.  Please let me know when and how you expect to remedy<br />this situation.  If I do not hear from you within a week or so I will<br />return the Senseo machine and the remaining unused portion of the coffee<br />to Amazon.com for a full refund.<p> I look forward to hearing from you.
