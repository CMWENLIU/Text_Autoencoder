This coffee tastes fairly good for sugar-free decaf, but its first two ingredients - which are present in the largest quantity -  are very unhealthy for people's cardio-vascular system: PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED COCONUT OIL, CORN SYRUP SOLIDS.<br />One would think that at the price General Foods charges for it, they'd manufacture something that people could drink a few cups/day without worry. It seems they pay more for the pricey metal tin, than better ingredients. I would not mind at all buying the coffee in a nice bag instead.
