There are bugs in the tea bags. Now, these aren't the 'organic' bugs you find in your garden when you plant veggies. These are the bugs that dig into expired produce. There are about 4-5 bugs in each bag. If you want some protein boost while relaxing before you go to bed, this is the product to buy. Also, the tea bags aren't made from organdy. It's some sort of plastic/polyester. I burnt a bag and it melted, turned black, and glued onto itself. Horrible, unethical company.
