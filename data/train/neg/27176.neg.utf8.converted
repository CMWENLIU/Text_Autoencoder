My office has been using a Flavia Fusion machine for a number of years now, maybe longer. During that time, we ordered our coffee from a company in North Carolina that sold us Flavia brand coffee. It was perfectly passable, and we never received any complaints from our guests.  Recently, however, Flavia suspended their name brand production and out-sourced to a company called "Alterra," which none of us had ever heard of.<br /><br />I am convinced they are either selling us coffee that has gone bad, or that is absolutely of the worst possible quality. It is difficult to belief that what they have sold us can even be called coffee. It is sour, flat and frankly painful to drink. Needless to say, we've thrown out our old Flavia machine and switched to a different model.  We've probably invested $75 in coffee that we are throwing away without any hesitation.<br /><br />To the folks at Flavia, and especially at Alterra: you aren't fooling anyone. I hope you don't trick anyone else into buying this junk. You should be ashamed.
