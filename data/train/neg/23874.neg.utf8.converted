The actual product is great...I guess, as my cat loves it. However, the package was badly damaged and I had to throw out six cans that were crushed open. Some lackey at the warehouse either didn't care or thought it was funny to ship a damaged product. I would say I would buy again if things were made right; they were not, so I won't.<br /><br />Edit: I tried again because my cat really loves this crap and none of the cans were broken still some dents, but meh... Packaging much improved.
