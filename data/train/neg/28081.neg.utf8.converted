Very disappointed in this product!  NOT Yam--it is Potatoes.  Item description states "all-natural" pounded Yam.  Here is from back of package:  "Ingredients: Potato Granules (dehydrated white potatoes, mono and diglycerides, disodium dihydrogen diphosphate, sdium bisulphite & ascorbyl palmitate), Potato Starch, Shortening, hydrogenated soybean oil, corn syrup solids, sodium caseinate (milk derivative) sodium silicoalumionate, dipotassium phosphate, Yam Flour.  Notice the Yam is listed LAST, not first!
