Not going to lie - I got these due to the packaging. Hey, I had money left over, so why not get a nice high quality brownie mix too?<br /><br />For a little bit of background, I love to home-bake and I'm the kind of guy that enjoys waking up to a nice breakfast I prepare for myself. I have a deep respect and interest in appreciating quality over quanity. Granted I'll get the cheapo brand for a lot of stuff, but when it comes to something I don't regularly make (like Brownies or Pancakes) I'll totally go up a notch and either buy the nicer brand or get good quality ingredients to scratch-cook it myself (with college and work though, I only do scratch cooking now if time and patience permits!).<br /><br />However I was pretty disappointed by these. By far, at about $4.68 per box at my local store, this was the most expensive brownie mix you could get on the shelf (keep in mind you still need to have all the other ingredients including the oil, eggs, butter). I'm a huge fan of skipping fillers and keeping to the good stuff so I tried them out.<br /><br />Unfortunatly, these brownies bake pretty dry. The moist fudgy/cake-like taste you expect from brownies was totally absent and their texture is closer to a thick gingerbread more than anything. They taste noticably worse than even the 99c brownies you can buy, and the wheat-nature of the brownies doesn't seem to enough of a saving grace to warrant an insane $5 price tag per small box (I love whole wheat, I only buy whole wheat bread and enjoy wheat pancakes). Mind you they don't taste bad, but they simply aren't what you'd expect out of a $5 box of brownies.<br /><br />As far as health goes, for a fraction of the price, you can easily scratch-cook your own brownies using coco and whole wheat flour for a fraction of the cost. As a matter of fact, that's pretty much what the ingredients are for this - so if you are a fan of wholesome no-bull baked goods, you're better off just making it yourself. And seeing how easy brownies are to make, its not a major inconvenience to do this either. If I am going all out on buying a dessert mix (what this brand is priced at), you might as well put the tiny amount of extra effort to combine the coco and flour yourself. If I am in the mood for no-frills, then I can get a better tasting experience just buying 99c brownies (even if it uses white enriched instead of whole wheat).
