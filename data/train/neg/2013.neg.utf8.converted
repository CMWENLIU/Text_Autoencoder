I called Kellogg's to see why Special K red berries has the natural preservative but Special K blueberry has the killer BHT.  The women who answered wasn't helpful and didn't know why. She also seemed annoyed with my question.  I won't even give my dog food with BHT why would I feed my family a cereal with BHT.  Why don't these company use the more natural and safer preservative like tocoperol etc?
