I purchased the Kona Joe "Peaberry " coffee in late December, 2009 as a Christmas gift for my husband who loves Peaberry coffee from Kona.  Upon opening the sealed bag of "Peaberry", the fragrance was stale, flat, and didn't smell fresh or anything like "Peaberry".  We brewed a pot of it and found it to be both stale and bitter in flavor.  It was so bad we didn't want to even finish the cup.  The inner sealed bag of this "Peaberry" coffee was UNLABELED???  The outer cloth bag which was removable was marked "Peaberry".  Were we given another coffee instead of what we ordered? We have not brewed any more of this awful stale, bitter coffee since.<br /><br />Very Disappointed
