Planters has recently (3/2009) switched to "Sea Salt" and touts this as an improvement. I've bought and loved their cashews for years, but the last couple of cans were so awful tasting and smelly, that I have dropped them from my shopping list. They taste like sea weed. Nasty! Planters, have you lost your minds? The old ones were 5 star rated for years. I would give them less than one now, but that was the lowest I could pick.
