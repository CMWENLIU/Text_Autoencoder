Like the writers of many other reviews I read, I got a disproportionately high amount of plain Special K - around 30 of my 60 bowls.  I got no bowls of the Kashi cereal.  The net weight of a bowl of plain Special K is 1.5 oz, whereas the other cereals weigh in at around 2.5 oz.  Special K is also the cheapest cereal to make of the four, making it extremely suspicious that many shipments of this "assortment" seem to be unbalanced in its favor.<br /><br />I'm pretty upset that I purchased a "4-cereal assortment" that ended up containing only 3, and an undesirable mix of those.  Be warned; based on the reviews here, you're likely to have a similar experience.
