I finally bought this from my closest natural foods grocery market after looking for it a long time. I actually drove out of my way to pick up some of this stuff. I wasn't expecting a lot because 128 calories a pint? That's unheard of!  I couldn't wait to get my hands on this "ice cream". When I got it, I actually paid $15 for 3 pints. That is completely ridiculous, but I thought it might just be worth it. When I got home, I pulled out my spoon and took the first bite...not quite as what I had expected. Its very weird tasting, not like ice cream at all. I took a look at the nutrition label, and what really caught my eye was 9g of sugar per half cup. That's too much for being that bland tasting. Also, the nutrition label is WAYYYY off on here like said in a previous post, pretty much 2x more the calories. Don't waste your time or money.
