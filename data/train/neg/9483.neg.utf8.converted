You get a good number of the treats, even thought they are still pricey.  They are very soft, and quite a few were pretty squished, though the treats are soft enough you could likely mold them around the pill if need be I suppose.  As for the cat... he gobbled up the empty ones in seconds.  He eagerly gobbled up the one with the pill as well, only as soon as he bit into it and discovered the pill, and out onto the floor it went.  He did like the treat enough to lick the treat off a bit though, leaving the soggy pill behind.  Another empty he ate slightly hesitantly, and for a wonder the next with a pill actually went down the way it was supposed to.  Yay! I thought, no more struggling with pills.  The next time though, he bit into the treat and found the pill again.  In fact, he'd deliberately nibble at it, uncovering the pill.  After that, when I tried again, he started to refuse the treats at all, even without a pill.  In fact, he'd gotten so distrustful so quickly of the hidden pill trick, he even distrusted any soft treat for several days after and I had to resort to crunchy ones as his reward for swallowing pills.  It's too bad he seems to chew his food rather than bolting it. (hiding pills in food never worked for him either) I think if he didn't chew, they might have worked better.  As it is, we now resort to a routine.  He gets fed, then picked up and carried to a particular chair.  He gets sat up to recieve the pill, pill goes in, and he's rewarded with treats as soon as the pill goes down.  After several times of the routine, while he doesn't come running for it, he settles down and stops struggling and running away right after.  Rather, he looks about eagerly as if to say, "where's my treat?  I'm supposed to get a treat now you know."  At least the pill pockets were useful for that much at any rate!
