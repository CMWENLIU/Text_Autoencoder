I am beyond dissappointed!  After trying these in December, I decided to order a whole case!  It took over a month to get here...and now I know why.<br /><br />They taste like some VERY VERY watered down coffee - mixed with DISHWATER.  Yes, I would have to say that these are now the WORST coffee candies I have ever had.  If you happen to have any made in 2006, you should savour them because that's the end of them.<br /><br />I just scraped off the new label so I can tell you the original ingredient list: Sugar, glucose, milk powder, coffee extract, coffee flavor, vegetable oil, salt, caramel.<br /><br />If your first ingredient is Glucose Syrup (tapioca)...then put them right back where you found them.  You will be wasting your money & insulting your tastebuds.
