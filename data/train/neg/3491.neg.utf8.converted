To like this product you really have to NOT expect to taste an actual noodle. There's no dough taste, no noodle texture, etc.<br /><br />The "pasta" part really only comes from the fact that they're cut into noodle-like shapes but that's where the similarities end. Do not listen to any of the reviews that tell you this tastes just like real pasta- it doesn't. At all.<br /><br />First off you need to not be sensitive to what the noodles initially look and smell like. When you open the bag you will be hit with a horrible smell that I'm told is the water it's packaged in more than anything else. If you drain the noodles and give them a quick rinse off in cold water you'll get rid of the smell pretty quickly. Also, the noodles themselves look and feel like squishy, raw calamari right out of the bag. That and the smell certainly doesn't help get you hungry but again, rinse it off and you'll get rid of the smell.<br /><br />After that you really need only drop the noodles into some boiling water for a minute or two to cook them and you're good to go so really the longest part of preparing the noodles is boiling the water and/or cooking whatever else you plan on adding to it.<br /><br />The best way I can describe the texture is that its like the pink pieces of ginger you get with sushi but obviouly without the same flavor. The noodles themselves are relatively bland so theoretically they should take on the taste of whatever sauce you cook it with but I didn't find this to be true. It's a weird texture, to be sure, but the noodles don't have much of a taste on their own so I can't really say the taste bad.<br /><br />If you're a vegetarian or a vegan who is used to eating "strange" things, tofu, etc then you might love this product as it definitely has that kind of feel to it. If you're a pasta lover this is nowhere near as good as real pasta and if you're a low-carb dieter looking for a way to cheat and get a pasta fix I think you'll be disappointed with it. Still, they're relatively healthy and relatively inexpensive so they just might be worth a try if you're looking for a pasta alternative just be warned that it doesn't taste like pasta.<br /><br />I would never order this in a restaurant and I won't be purchasing them again but if I went to a new girlfriend's mother's house for dinner and she served these up I would be able to eat them without a problem :-)
