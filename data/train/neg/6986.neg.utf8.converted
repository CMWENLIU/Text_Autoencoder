My daughter likes it but she's never had the real thing...taste too much like root beer barrel candy which is horrid in my opinion.  Real Sassafras tea, the kind my Grandmother and I made by taking the bark of a Sassafras tree and boiling in water which makes a reddish, fragrant and pleasant tasting tea is much better tasting and nothing like what Pappy's taste like.
