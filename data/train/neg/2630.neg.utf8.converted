At a time when the city was working on an old (by U.S. standards) water main just beyond my front door, and the water ran sandy instead of clear, I poured a pot of this, made with my last bottled water, down the drain.<br /><br />My little southern city has a few good tea sommeliers, and having had them offer Pu-erhs to me in very recent history, I'm here to tell you this is bad tea.  It's one note when it's actually liquid--molasses; then, with an overpowering smell of dead fish before it gets to your nose, this is nothing short of gross.<br /><br />Maybe I got a bad batch.<br /><br />For reference:  I'm a foodie by dint of food intolerances and, ironically, having to cook a lot in order to afford to eat out.  My favorite commercially available teas are Twinings' Oolong and Prince of Wales.  As pedestrian as that may be, at least they're not rotten.
