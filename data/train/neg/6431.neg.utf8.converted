I remember the first time I tried a Lindt 70% bar, when I visited France as a child.  My parents bought several to bring back to the States, and they were cherished and eaten slowly.  I've enjoyed them as a special treat ever since.<br /><br />Sadly, that era has ended.  The "new recipe" is a shadow of the former Lindt chocolate.  It tastes like pretty much any other standard dark chocolate bar -- none of the crisp, vibrant, complexity it used to have.<br /><br />I guess all good things eventually come to an end...too bad.
