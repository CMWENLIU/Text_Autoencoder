I suppose I shouldn't have ordered these during the summer, but I did.  Since they were not to be shipped for several weeks, I assumed (yes I know) that shipping during August would be taken into consideration by the seller.  It wasn't.  While there was a little cushioning material around the box, there was no insulation at all and no markings on the outside of the box that it should be protected from heat.  Since the Mozart Balls are loose in the box, they melted into a variety of non-spheriodal shapes and the box itself was saturated with cocoa butter that was originally part of the candy.  Removing the foil is akin to untying badly knotted string that has been soaked in water and then dried.  The taste reminds me of Moon Pies.  Maybe in the winter months these are worth while, but I will stick to Reber in the future (each ball in an individual compartment and shipped with cooling packs in the summer).  Thank goodness these weren't a gift!
