I bought this fondant because the previous buyers gave good reviews. I have worked with fondant before and I have never had trouble putting in on the cake. The fondant was not manageable. When i finally got it on top  of the cake it would start stretching from the sides. When I tried to make figurines out of it and it would just fall apart.
