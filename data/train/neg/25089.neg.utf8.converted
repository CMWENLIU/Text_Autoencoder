I do like licorice.  I do usually like Paul Newman products.  I feel that they can be counted on to be quality products.  However this product was not to my taste at all.  Nice packaging.  Licorice was fresh.  Perhaps a different flavor would be better.  I like pomegranates, I just don't care for the taste of this product.
