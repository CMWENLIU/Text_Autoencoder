Each package comes with 8 milk creamer discs and 8 chai tea discs, making a total of 8 drinks.  You use the creamer disc first, then the tea disc.  Tassimo recommends that you run the brewer through a cleaning cycle after making a milk drink (you don't want to spoil your next non-milky drink).<br /><br />I love Chai (or spiced) tea with a little sugar or honey, so I was really looking forward to a Chai Latte made with my brand new Tassimo Brewer.  Boy was I disappointed!<br /><br />I don't see it in the description, but the tea contains sucralose (that's the sweetener in Splenda).  While I generally avoid artificial sweeteners in general, as I don't like the taste, I do make some exceptions.  It's possible to use them and have an enjoyable flavor if the flavors are balanced.<br /><br />They aren't in this Twinings Chai.  There is definitely too much sweetener.  I would prefer that they err on the side of not enough sweetener---after all, everyone has their own preferences, but I can always add more, I can't remove what's already there.<br /><br />The balance between the milk and tea was also off and the milk has a decided reconstituted dry milk taste to it.  Not my fave. ;0)  Between the sweetener overkill and the milk, it was hard to even tell that this was spiced tea or tea at all.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing again.
