I just received this product on Wed Jun 1, 2011 and was extremely disappointed and disgusted. My brother and I tried the powder in milk, then added cinnamon and vanilla to attempt to hide the flavor, but it was extremely grainy, did not mix well at all, irritated my throat, and tasted absolutely horrific. I tried once more to drink it mixed with water, which I did successfully while holding my nose until 5 minutes later when I almost threw it up. I ended up throwing it out in my backyard. This was $28 wasted as fertilizer.
