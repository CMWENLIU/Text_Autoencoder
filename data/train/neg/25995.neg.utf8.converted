Ok quality, stadard basmati rice - But packaging is a problem. Comes in a hessian bag which is totally unnecessary - The plastic bag within the hessian (which holds the rice) was mostly open when the rice arrived (meaning that the rice was open to the air). The rice had taken on a smell from the hessian (which changed the taste even once it was cooked). The hessian smell was stronger than the usual (lovely) distinct basmati smell. After 2-3 weeks of storage the rice started to go stale and developed yellow/brownish patches on some grains.
