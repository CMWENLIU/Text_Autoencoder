I bought the vanilla bean extract but I was very disappointed to find that it has a stronger alcoholic flavour to it than the actual vanilla flavour. The extract was also not as thick as the other extracts I have used. I have not tried the vanilla bean paste of this brand and maybe that is of a better quality than the extract.
