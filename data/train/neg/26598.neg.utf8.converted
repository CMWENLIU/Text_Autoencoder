This product is so watery. I cannnot believe they are calling this 100% juice.  What a shame!  I am cancelling this order.<br /><br />What surprises me is that Amazon carries such product without testing?<br />I tried a different brand (genesis) and it is some much better but it was expensive which is why I tried this one.<br /><br />I even sent an email to the company Dynamics with no response.
