Sodium phosphate is a preservative.  So these are not chemical and preservative free.  That's the part I read, but I should have read more carefully.  I didn't realize it was in there when I ordered these for my cats.  One cat ignores them, but my other one loves them.  But sodium phosphate causes me terrible migraines so I stay away from it in my foods and medicines.  Even a little bit has a bad effect on me.  This makes me very wary about giving it to my cat.  The salmon has no marinade and therefore no sodium phosphate, so I'll get that one again.  I wish the chicken was more pure.  I don't do many reviews but I thought I should point this out in case it makes a difference to anyone else. I'm always looking for healthy food for my cats and dog.  Not sure this is, with that chemical in it.
