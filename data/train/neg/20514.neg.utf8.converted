I would give these zero stars if I could.  Your basic fat American may be able to taste the blueberry through the other additives, but I cannot.  And they play hell with my blood sugar.  These are very dangerous for people who have diabetes and if you eat enough of them you will probably get diabetes.<br /><br />And do you really think hiding the "High Fructose Corn Sugar" behind an acronym makes them "All natural".  In a more enlightened age you would have been busted for false advertising.<br /><br />Why can't Amazon offer at least one unsweetened selection of dried blueberries?  That way those of us with blood sugar problems or who want to avoid them could find something healthy to eat and the rest of your suicidal customers can do their thing.
