FYI:  These tasty-looking cookies contain fish.<br /><br />If you aren't vegetarian, none of this will probably matter to you.  Nor should it.  If you are vegetarian, read on . . .<br /><br />This product kept coming up in my recommendations here on Amazon so, when I spied it at Global Food, I picked it up.  Being vegetarian, I'm used to checking the ingredients of any new product I try.  I was disappointed to find that these cute 'lil mushroom cookies contain fish oil, so I can't eat them.  Too bad, considering how much everyone seems to like them.  I think it's kind of a bummer that I keep seeing fish oil used in cookies when there are other options that would make a product edible to a greater portion of the population.  I found a similar Korean product from Isong called "Choco Biscuit" which is pretty good and made with vegetable oil (although, unfortunately, it is not available on Amazon).  Who knows if it actually tastes the same, though.  Sigh . . .
