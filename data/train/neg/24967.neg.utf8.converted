When I was about 7 years old my best friend and I tried a dog biscuit, it was a taste I vowed never to repeat.  I  served these with a lovely vegan dip, then saw the expression on my husbands face.  He told me to taste one, I was mortified it was the same flavor and texture of the dog biscuit from so many years ago. My friends were in mid chew no turning back. Tiny box, big price and major embarrassment.
