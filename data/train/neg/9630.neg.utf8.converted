Bought a unit for my 80 year old Mother at Christmas. Great for a month. And the pump started making noise. Got so bad she had to turn it off. Emailed the company and they sent a new pump out. That one lasted another month. Noise could be heard all over the house. Emailed company again. No reponse. Called several times. Customer service got back to me and said they had a batch of faulty pumps from China and new ones were arriving the beginning of April. They had been redesigned. One would be shipped by the 15th of April. Its now June 4th and nothing. I have left several messages with customer service. Hoping one of these days someone will call me back and take care of this. With the kits and shipping this cost me over $200. And I am unable to return it since almost 6 months has passed. I should of returned it right away.
