When I read the description, it said it was sweetened with honey. I didn't realize that just because it says on the box that it's sweetened with honey, doesn't mean it isn't sweetened with an artificial sweetener also! The company is clearly trying to mislead consumers by pretending it's somehow "natural" because it's sweetened with honey and doesn't contain aspartame, but the truth is that it has sucralose. I personally do not like consuming artificial sweeteners and I think it is ridiculous that this company is trying to mislead consumers.
