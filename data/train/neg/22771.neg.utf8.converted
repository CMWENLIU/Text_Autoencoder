I was a little disappointed by the taste of these sprouts.  I love alfalfa sprouts and radishes, and also I like zesty salads like arugula, but the flavor of these sprouts didn't live up to my expectations.  But the biggest disappointment was that most of what I think are the fenugreek seeds but could be clover didn't sprout(I don't know what either seed looks like but I do know what alfalfa and radish look like).  They remain rock hard despite being soaked for almost a week, so in every forkful I bit down on what felt like little pebbles that almost broke my teeth.  I have 4 bags of these seeds that I can't use unless I want to end up toothless.
