Got these steaks as a Christmas gift. Four steaks for 90 bucks could be worth it, but in this case it's a scam. They market these as a quality of beef you can't buy in stores but that is simply not the case. There is very little marbling in the steaks and they are Choice beef at best. But let's not forget that Omaha refuses to actually use a USDA rating for their beef. They just use fancy words to make it sound like you are getting amazing steaks when in reality if they were that amazing they would be prime cuts and labeled as such. Take my word for it and go with a company that offers USDA Prime steaks, there are plenty if you just google it. Also, last time I was at costco they actually had a good selection of Prime strip steaks at a price that is cheaper than these. The only reason I did not rate as 1 star is because 3 of the 4 steaks I received had a larger portion of filet than you typically expect with a t-bone. Still, find the prime and stay away from this low quality but well marketed beef.
