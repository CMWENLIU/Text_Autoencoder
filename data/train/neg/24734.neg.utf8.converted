Although Amazon has this cereal (nature's path hemp granola gluten free) in the "gluten-free" specialty section, the manufacturer does not consider it to be gluten-free due to the presence of oats that are non-GF certified. I'm sure the cereal is quite good, but because I assumed that Amazon was careful in assigning items to the gluten-free list, I bought it and now can't eat it. Please be cautious when purchasing "gluten-free" items from Amazon and always check with the manufacturer if in doubt. Amazon, please take note of this and make the correction! Enough already!
