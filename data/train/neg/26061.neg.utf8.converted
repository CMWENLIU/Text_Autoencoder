I have ordered this product in the past and been quite pleased with the quality; since we are dairy-free, I use a lot of coconut milk.  However, my most recent order has revealed that this coconut milk is not what it used to be.  It is watery, the coconut cream portion is hard and can't be whisked into the milk like it should be.  There is NO way you could use this coconut cream portion - it is anything but creamy.  I am so disappointed, and now I'm stuck with a whole case with limited useability and have wasted my money.  I just canceled my subscription to this item; I will not be ordering it ever again!
