I ordered this basket for my brother-in-law who was recovering from a recent heart attack.  I did a lot of research on "heart healthy" baskets and chose this one b/c it sounded like what I was looking for. When it was received, they found that most of the products were loaded with sodium.  There was a bottle of V8 juice that had 700 mg of sodium.  The doctors recommend no more than 1500 mg of sodium per day - so this one bottle of juice is 1/2 your days allowance! I received a notice from Amazon to rate the product.  I rated it poor, then got a request to please contact the seller before completing the rating, to see if they could resolve the issue.  So...I emailed the seller and said that I was disappointed in the basket, and that it was certainly NOT heart healthy and asked if they have anything else that actually was.  I asked if they could send something else and that they should not be advertising as "heart healthy" when it is not.  They returned my email saying that they didn't accept returned product. (I never said I wanted to return the basket).  They also said that the description of the basket never said that it was low in sodium and that they have to put products in that have sodium b/c the low fat ones don't have as much flavor.  Oh brother!!!! Heart Healthy products are supposed to be low in sodium!  I'm pretty sure everyone knows that!  Geeze.  They said there was nothing they would do for me and were sorry for the misunderstanding.  This is a poorly run company. Terrible customer service. Misleading product and I would never order from them again.
