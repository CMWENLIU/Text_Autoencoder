Meow Mix is one of the cheapest brands of cat food widely sold in supermarkets and convenient stores.  Unfortunately, it's trash; mostly low-grade corn and soy with some chicken byproduct meal and beef tallow (low grade fat) for flavoring.  It's cheap for a reason.<br /><br />My sweet cat that I just brought home from the shelter was raised by her previous owner on Meow Mix.  She sheds like crazy, which should resolve now that she's receiving real food.
