I haven't had my Keurig for long and thought this coffee sounded wonderful! It smells fantastic when it's brewing as many have mentioned. This box came the evening before I was to take off on a long car trip. Early in the morning before my departure I brewed a cup of this and took off. A few miles from the house I took my first sip and about threw the mug out the window. The aftertaste is not pleasant, it's syrupy and awful. You need a chaser to drink this coffee. Be prepared or just don't buy it in the first place! There are so many good kinds of coffee for the Keurig don't waste time on this one.
