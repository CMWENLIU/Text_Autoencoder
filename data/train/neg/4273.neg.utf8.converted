Manufacturer refused to admit problem with their capsules when it doesn't work.<br /><br />Problem:<br />1. 1/3 to 1/2 capsules ends in very dilute coffee/dirty hot water<br />2. seal by far not perfect<br />3. foil cap not reliable peforated<br />4. used capsule compartment becomes overflow hot water compartment and sometimes overflow<br /><br />Since the manufacturer says the problem is not theirs, I tried many permutation to make the capsules work, including:<br />1. filling grinds to different level, full to not-so-full<br />2. compacting grind to different degree, from no compaction to hard compaction<br />3. using 1 or 2 rubber seal<br /><br />Results remain unreliable. When it works it works great. That's about 1/5 of the time. 1/3 of the time it is acceptable, the rest of the time I wasted the coffee and money on the capsule. In the end, it turns out to be more expensive than the nespresso capsules. Not worth the effort and frustration to get a cup of coffee nicer than nespresso's own only for 1/5 of the time.
