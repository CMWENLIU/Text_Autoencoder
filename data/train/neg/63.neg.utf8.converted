This was my favorite stevia product and I had it on subscribe and save until I queried customer service about NuNaturals GMO use.  Yes, NuNaturals uses GMO products.  SO, I've canceled my subscribe and save order and am now using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL3U0">Stevita Stevia Clear Liquid Extract, 3.3-Ounce Container (Pack of 3)</a>.
