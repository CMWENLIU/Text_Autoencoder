I bought this in an Asian market for half this price listed, but I wound up throwing it away after not being able to stomach the stuff. I've tried a few different types of matcha powder and unfortunately resorted to this as a substitute for my daily tea until my next shipment came in from Japan. It's downright awful. That picture on the bag is what a higher quality tea looks like, the actual product turns out to be a muddy looking green. After my bad experience trying to use it in hot tea, I tried putting this in smoothies, baking with it, using it in icecream, nothing would take away the bitterness. I kept adding less and less matcha powder to my recipes, but the bitter taste was there if there was any hint of green tea flavor.<br /><br />Just save your money and buy some real matcha powder. Don't convince yourself that you're enjoying it just because you so desperately want to enjoy matcha green tea. It isn't your fault if you've tried this and don't like it. If someone gave this to me for free, I would politely refuse it. No way I'd re-gift something so terrible unless I hated the person!
