I'm a fairly frequent consumers of various types of bars as snacks -- I do a lot of running and they always seem like a good, easy way to fit in a mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack without having to walk to the cafeteria at the other end of the building.I think of myself as having a fairly high tolerance for weird protein bars and "food products," but the Raw Revolution Cashew and Agave Nectar bar seems like it might be a bar too far over the edge for me.<br /><br />Obviously, this bar is not competing with the typical chocolate-covered energy bar, because the wrapper is covered with references to "organic," "live," "raw" etc.<br /><br />I bought one of the Cashew and Agave Nectar bars out of a vending machine, and it was kind of unusual compared to my typical Cliff Builder bar, or Zone bar, or regular Clif bar. First, the 2.2 oz bar itself is pretty small, especially given the fact that that little bar contains 290 calories. Second, it's pretty oily. It felt almost slippery when I opened the package. The bar itself is a block of tannish brown with small lighter chunks that are evidently cashew bits. It is firm, but soft. None of these are showstoppers for me, just different.<br /><br />However, a major difference appears when you start to eat it. Energy bars -- across the board -- are often criticized for being candy bars masquerading as nutritious. Yes, they may have good-for-you ingredients, but eating a couple of them a day delivers a LOT of calories and carbs. So I often break one in half, and have part in the morning, part in the afternoon. When I opened the Raw Revolution bar and saw how small it was, I thought, "Oh, great, 290 is on the high end for a bar like this, and I'll want to eat the whole thing because it's so small." Not so. to me, this was RICH. So rich, I almost had trouble eating more than a couple of bites.<br /><br />The list of ingredients is amazingly short: organic cashew, dates, agave nectar, almonds, sprouted flax seed. All "100% raw."<br /><br />I guess the target audience is more interested in the ingredients and preparation than in the taste. I found it okay, rather bland, but with sort of weird bitter after-taste (I think that may be the dates) and after-texture (may be the bits of sprouted flax seed suspended in the date substance). And although it isn't bad, the excessive richness of the thing keeps you from having another bite very quickly, so you just sort of sit there and ponder what's going on in your mouth, not all of which is expected, or necessarily pleasant. It's a bit sticky/chewy, but again, not in the way a bar with caramel or corn syrup would. Probably better for you than those things are, but unusual, and to me, off-putting.<br /><br />In the end, I don't think I'd buy another one of these. It wasn't horrible, but I didn't like it all that much.
