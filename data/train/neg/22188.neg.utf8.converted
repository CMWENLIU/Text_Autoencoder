When I bought this product, I had no idea of the ingredients.  The first ingredient is sugar and the second is some kind of hydrogenated oil.  I hadn't read the ingredients until after I made it.  Honestly it is delicious but I knew this was way more than just coffee!  I gave it away to t he friend who had recommended it to me!  It is only 70 calories she said!~
