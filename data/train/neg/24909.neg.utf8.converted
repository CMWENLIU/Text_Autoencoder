I wasn't overly happy with the flavor of these, but brought them to work in case someone else would like to try them.  They weren't overly impressed either.  BUT then I found out the ones I purchased in December carry expiration dates of February of this same year.  I can't find a way to complain to Amazon yet, but I will! They might have tasted better if they were fresh.
