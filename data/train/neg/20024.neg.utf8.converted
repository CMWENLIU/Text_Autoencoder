I don't know how this ended up in my cupboard but it did so I made it.  This is less of a chicken helper and more of a chicken hindrance.  Seriously just throw it out and have plain chicken.  Honestly I don't understand how this made it to market.  There must have been some clerical error that allowed this product to make it to store shelves despite (surely) having failed focus group trials.  I'm stupefied, really.<br /><br />Furthermore, the directions are poorly worded and leave out the step for adding a seasoning packet.  This has to be an accident.
