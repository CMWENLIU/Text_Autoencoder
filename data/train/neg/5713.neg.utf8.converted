Natural Balance needs to improve their quality control! A few months ago I opened a can of the Venison & Green Pea canned food and found a piece of flexible plastic cooked into their food. Needless to say I was surprised and notified the manufacturer immediately and sent the can back to them (at their request); they assured me that they have the highest standard of quality control and that this would not happen again. I was given a replacement can as well as coupons and an apology for the incident. I continued to feed them the canned Vension & Green Pea, but lo and behold, a few months later and we're experiencing the same thing! This time there was a big piece of green plastic in the canned food. I will be notifying the manufacturer again and sending the can back to them as before (hopefully they can test to see exactly what happened), and I will no longer be using this product.
