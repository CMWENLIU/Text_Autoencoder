I had really high hopes for these, but I tasted them and so did another family member, and have come to the conclusion that these are horrible tasting.  Not the texture I expected at all... just tiny little flakes with little, but bad, flavor in it.  I am not fussy at all with my foods, I'll eat about anything but these, I need to give away or feed to the birds.  Sorry,1 star.  I would still be up to trying other varieties though...
