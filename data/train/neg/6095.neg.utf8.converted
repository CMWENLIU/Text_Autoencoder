I found these in a local market a while ago, and fell in love with them, but hadn't been able to find them anywhere in person for a while.  Saw that they were available on Amazon, and ordered a 12-pack.  What arrived is completely different from the product I bought in the store.  The ones I bought at the store were firm but chewy, even-textured, with a nice fruity flavor.  The ones that arrived are crusty on the outside, soft on the inside; the crustiness really makes it hard for me to enjoy the flavor.  I feel bad for wasting food, but I don't think I can stomach these.
