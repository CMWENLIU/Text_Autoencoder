Having used Urbani Truffle Oil I am probably spoiled when it comes to others.  I purchased the La Tourangelle from the local supermarket.  It seemed like a good deal at the time but when I got home and opened it, the smell was pale in comparison to Urbani.  There is NO comparison.  The (lack of) fragrance from the La Tour was like smelling the remnants of an old truffle bottle.  The headiness from the Urbani is unsurpassed.  To the point where when it comes to purchasing another oil, I'm a little gun shy.  I am not interested in spending  [...] bucks on up to have something be sub-standard.<br /><br />Bottom line, don't waste your money, stick with something that really gives your well deserved food the headiness of the real truffle.  Buy Urbani!<br /><br />[...]
