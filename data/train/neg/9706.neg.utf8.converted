I fed my cat Iams Weight Control for 3 years before she died of stomach cancer.  In that time she only lost weight when the cancer started.  Her coat was dull and rough.<br />That experience led me to research feline nutrition both online and by talking to animal nutritionists.  If you read the ingredient list in Iams Weight Control, you'll see that most of the first few ingredients are corn and other grains.  Cats are carnivores and need a high-protein diet, not a high-carb diet.  The extra carbs are stored as fat.  If you have an overweight cat, steer clear of Iams and go with a high-protein, low-carb, grain free premium food.<br />My two young cats eat a variety of high quality food.  I feed them 3-4 times a day and they are at a perfect weight.  Their coats are shiny and soft.  You can feed your cats a lot better food than this.
