A powerful, chemical aftertaste that rendered anything I tried it on/in - cereal, coffee, tea - close to inedible.  I've found that the other artificial sweeteners are palatable, but this stuff is pretty dreadful.  And if you read about it, it's no better or worse than the others despite their claims that it comes right from the garden and is made in a cottage by granny and some elves. As well, I would submit that some of the rave reviews are corporate plants - seriously, look at their list of other reviews.  Most importantly, despite the "green" website for Truvia, it's manufactured by Cargill.  Last I looked, Cargill was a giant corporation that converts field crops into industrial products.  Go ahead and try it but know that you were warned.
