The shipping weight of this product is listed as 4 ounces, but it's not even close to that.  I thought my $24 was buying me 4 ounces of tea, when in reality my $24 was only buying me a little over an ounce of tea.  It's my fault for not knowing at the time that 30 grams is equal to only 1.1 ounces.  But, I think it's misleading of the seller to over-inflate the shipping weight, and then list it in ounces, to suggest you're getting more tea than you really are.  I was also taken in buy all the comments stating that this tea is a "great value."  It's not at all a great value.  It's $24 for a little over an ounce of tea.  DoMatcha 2nd Harvest Organic at Whole Foods is a much better deal at $40 for nearly 3 ounces (it's not "ceremonial" but it blends perfectly and tastes better than this brand.)
