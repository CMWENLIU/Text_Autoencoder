I ordered and received these walnuts in January 2011.  The expiration date on the packages is December 2012.  There's not much flavor to these walnuts.  If you heat them up, the flavor is only somewhat there. If you're looking for flavorful walnuts, the kind that when you open the package there's a burst of rich walnut aroma, these are not for you.  I just wonder whether there is a correlation between loss of flavor and loss of nutrients. I'm giving these two stars because the price was very inexpensive.  I paid $28.39 for 6 lbs.  I would not use these to cook or bake anything special. Stick with buying fresh walnuts from an open bin in a store with a lot of turn over where you can smell them, maybe even sample them, before buying.  They will, of course, cost more, but they will taste more like walnuts.
