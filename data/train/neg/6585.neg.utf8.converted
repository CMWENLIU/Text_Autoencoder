Have the people at Betty Crocker ever heard the saying. "If it ain't broke,don't fix it"?  The orginial Potato Buds were the best instant potatoes on the market.  That changed when Betty Crocker changed them!  Now they are lower than the bottom of the list!  They are so awful I threw them away. They are too nasty to eat! Please bring back the old style Buds!
