It will never be as nice as fresh pesto, but I find the flavor of this pesto paste comparable with other pestos I've bought in jars.<br /><br />The tubes are very difficult to use, however. I bought them imagining that the pesto would squeeze out smoothly like toothpaste, allowing me to dispense just the right amount for each dish and leaving no mess behind. Unfortunately, the tubes are metallic and hard to squeeze smoothly. After the first few squirts they don't want to dispense anything at all. I have had to cut the back end off of each tube in order to get the pesto out. At that point, of course, it's like dealing with an ice cream cone when you've bitten the bottom off.<br /><br />Unless you want to spend a lot of time cleaning up a mess of green oil, I suggest choosing a pesto that comes in friendlier packaging.
