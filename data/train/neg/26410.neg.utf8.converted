This item is packaged in a cardboard box. That means the Jelly beans are packaged loose in a cardboard box from Jelly Belly factory. This leaves them open to moisture and going stale. When I received my jelly beans they were very stale along with the texture of having been wet or subject to some sort of moisture. They were pretty much all stuck together and swollen along with being stale. I would not recommend purchasing this product. They needed to package them in some form of moisture resistant plastic packaging.
