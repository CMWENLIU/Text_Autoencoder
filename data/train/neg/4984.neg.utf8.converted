I have bought quite a few of these and other of Enjoy Life's bars in the past.  I'm planning on curtailing my consumption of them since: 1) I received an empty, but sealed, box  2) There are quality and consistency problems.  (e.g.  bars with debris or other food material on them; bars of varying sizes; inadequate or sloppy packaging)  3) varying quality of customer service (e.g. was supposed to receive a coupon for the empty box, but haven't etc.)<br /><br />They are, however, a very convenient snack.
