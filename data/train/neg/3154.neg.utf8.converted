If you liked Tazo Black Iced Tea in the past - you may not like it anymore.  My wife and I have been buying Tazo's Black Iced Tea for several years.  It was the best iced tea we ever found, and we enjoyed it immensely.  Recently we ordered two more boxes from Starbuck's through Amazon.  When we brewed the first bag, something wasn't right.  The taste was bland, not at all like every other time we had it.  We tried a second bag, and it was bland as well.  VERY disappointing.  My wife Googled and found on another web site that Tazo changed the formulation of its Black Iced Tea.  It is a flop in our opinion.
