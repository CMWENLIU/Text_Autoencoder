You want to remove the sugar from peanut butter not the fat. And honestly this tastes bad in comparison.<br /><br />Roughly 50 percent of the fat in peanuts is monounsaturated. Unsaturated fats can help lower LDL cholesterol (the "bad" cholesterol) levels in the blood without affecting the HDL cholesterol ("good" cholesterol). Research shows that people who eat a greater percentage of monounsaturated fats lower their risk of heart disease, asthma, Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, and even depression.<br /><br />Just buy the natural kind and avoid the additives.
