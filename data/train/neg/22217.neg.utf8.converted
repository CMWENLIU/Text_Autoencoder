These are not the same as the Italian pine nuts, nor do they taste the same. You can tell the difference by the shape- the 'real' pine nuts are elongated, while the Korean stone pine nuts have a wider base. These taste oddly metallic, and are packaged in China, which gives one doubts about the quality and safety of the product. While these may be much cheaper, they are not worth it. Look for pine nuts from Italy, Turkey or the US and be sure they come from the correct tree species!
