The product description says 16 count discs, but the package only has 8 servings (one milk disc+one chocolate disc=1 6 ounce serving). Our family found the taste to be mediocre (at best). I agree with those that suggest any decent powdered mix will match its taste (and at a lower price point). Skip it.
