I am disappointed since regular wheat thins don't have MSG, but this variety does.  I need to stay away from MSG, since I get migraines.<br />I am sure Nabisco can find a way to make a flavorful cracker without MSG.<br />These crackers have a very strong taste, and I found that the taste stayed in my mouth for a long time.<br />I prefer the original, unflavored wheat things.
