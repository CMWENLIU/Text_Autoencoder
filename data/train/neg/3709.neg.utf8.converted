Are you kidding me???  The 90 positive reviews must be the owners relatives.  This is the worst gluten free product I have ever eaten. It is dry and it is mealy.  The only way it was marginally tolerable was to smother it in chocolate icing.  My wife told me to complain to the company and I told her I didn't want them sending me any free product.
