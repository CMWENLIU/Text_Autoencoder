So looking forward to receiving this as I am unable to find it locally, but the jar arrived already open (the seal was halfway removed & the jar was leaking) & the lid had been TAPED closed with packing tape as if I wasn't supposed to notice. Eww.<br /><br />This seller CALLED ME AT MY HOUSE this morning!  I don't know how they got my information since this was fulfilled via Amazon & the seller should not have had anything to do with the transaction other than receive the funds.  They called to ask me to take down my review (though they did graciously ask if they could send me another jar of Tamarind) but this was seriously creepy, not to mention a violation of Amazon's rules.<br /><br />When I leave a review, it is for the item that I ordered.  This item (& transaction) deserved 1 star.  To ask that I remove it would be disingenuous.  To call my home is downright scary.
