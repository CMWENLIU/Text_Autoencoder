I tried these as a cheaper alternative to the Roland anchovies I usually buy (those were out of stock).  The tins arrived bulging, and burst when opened.  The contents smelled vomitous.  Amazon shouldn't sell this unsuitable product, but until then you had best heed this and other negative reviews.
