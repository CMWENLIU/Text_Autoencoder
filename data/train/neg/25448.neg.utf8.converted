I think that the Tabasco folks tried sincerely to make this a good sauce: the basic idea was to mix a high-quality Worcestershire with Tabasco.  It should have worked, but I just think they misunderstood the things that make the classic Worcestershire so appealing.  Maybe they just opted for smoked anchovies or something, but this sauce has an unpleasant smoky, almost bacon-y undertone to it.  I've tried it again and again, hoping I'd get used to the difference, but in the end I had to chuck it in the trash.  From a man who has ordered and enjoyed multiple gallon jugs of Tabasco Regular and Habanero Sauces: this one is just not a winner.
