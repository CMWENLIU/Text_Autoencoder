I love Muscle milk and the idea of it with Oatmeal sounded right on track.  The stuff does not mix and is too sweet.  Real oatmeal with Muscle milk over it would be great, this stuff is awful, and it's 300 calories.<br /><br />If I wasn't so lazy, I'd return them.  I'll mix it with a shake to gag them down.
