This is my third pop-tart purchase in the last few months. I am always on the look out for good deals on the large boxes of poptarts and am glad to have found them on Amazon. The first two came in great condition... package was intact, pop-tarts in one piece. The reason for the two stars for this transaction was due to the shape of the pop-tart box. Someone in shipping must have played soccer with this box... it was all torn up, holes on each corner of the individual boxes (you get three boxes). You open up the boxes, and inside are the boxed poptarts that when you open the top, you can set it in your pantry and pull the individually wrapped (2 per package) just like you see in a convenience store. You can't even use the box for display to hold the pop-tarts, it's that banged up. And of course, with the boxes destroyed, can you imagine what the poptarts looked like?? Crumbs everywhere. Very disappointed.
