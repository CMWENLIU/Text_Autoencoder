If you're going to use it up quickly, it's ok, though the flavor is a bit weak (I had to triple the quantity for coconut cake I baked a few months ago).  Discovered (while cooking a coconut pudding today) that all coconut flavor has vanished from my properly-stored bottle.  No dates of any kind on the label, and I know I bought it 8 months ago for that cake.  Will be trying another brand!
