Wrong info. under Product Features. It claims each bag contains 3.5 ounces. I received my box of 36 bags today, and every bag is only 2.9 ounces. So, instead of the 126 ounces claimed, they only send 104.4 ounces total. The difference is 7.44 ounces, or enough for another 2.57 bags of popcorn! It would also be nice if one could call up the Nutrition Facts of food products on Amazon - then I would have known O.R.'s Natural has 300mg of sodium per serving, compared to O.R.'s Light Butter at only 190mg of sodium/serving. Calling Natural "Simply Salted" implied to me less salt, and so I find it misleading. Posting Nutrition Facts would eliminate ambiguity and make things clear for customers.
