I was hesitant at buying these shiitake mushrooms at first knowing that they were from china.<br />I reasoned with myself that since they were organic that they had to be okay.<br /><br />When i fry them in oil or butter there is such a horrible chemical smell, like ammonium, that it is unbearable to eat, no matter how you try and disguise the flavor, the mushrooms taste like they were preserved in ammonium. When i put them in a soup base, that same horrid chemical aroma is still there.
