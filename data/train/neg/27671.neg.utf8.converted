I was enchanted by the packaging design only to be disappointed by the taste.  If you are a true cookie connoisseur then these aren't for you. First they are individually wrapped, something that always seems wasteful to me. Yes, I understand that it keeps them fresh, but there are other solutions.  Also the images make them look larger than they are.  They basically fit in the palm of your hand.<br /><br />If you are looking for something similar to a Kashi cookie I would try these.  If you are looking for something on parity to a homemade cookie, don't count on it.
