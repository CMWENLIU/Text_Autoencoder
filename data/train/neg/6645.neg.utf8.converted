Amazon just cancelled the 1L 2-pack of this good oil via subscribe & save @ 18.71 for my last shipment. That is 67 oz's of oil. Now it's 51 oz's for 22$ in subscribe & save, that is an increase from 0.28$ per OZ to 0.43$ per oz -- about 30% increase in price. Not anywhere as good a deal as it was before. This is good middle of the road, organic olive oil, been using it for last 2-3 years. But it's getting way to pricey for what it is.<br /><br />Maybe it's not Amazon - maybe it's the supplier price increase -- but it is a sad turn of events.<br /><br />Just read a bunch of articles about how low olive oil prices are hurting europe -- sounds like gouging to me.
