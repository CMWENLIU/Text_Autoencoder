This is only a box of beans! It has no chicken or corn or any other necessary ingredients to make a soup except a spice/condiment pouch inside the box! In fact, the instruction tells you to buy your own chicken, tomatoes, corn, okra and others to make it a soup. The image and title of this product is tantamount to false labelling and advertising. Who needs beans to make corn and chicken soup???? This is like just a recipe you are buying and nothing more! The other soups from this company turn out to be more of the same! Don't be fooled.
