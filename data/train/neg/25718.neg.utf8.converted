I am really saddened by the decision by General Foods to "reformulate" what used to be the best of the boutique coffies they marketed.  The rest of the product line is so sweet they are like drinking hot chocolate rather than coffee.<br /><br />Here's a clue, if you want to drink hot chocolate, then drink hot chocolate, not instant coffee.<br /><br />Sad to say, I will no be buying any more of these now universally syrupy sweet coffees.<br />What a terrible disappointment.
