I got to Amazon's page through a link from a Google Shopping page for a case of 12 containers of salt.  I failed to notice that the 12 containers that Google Shopping had promised had dropped to 1 container on Amazon's page, and the $9.99 price didn't do anything to stop me believing that it was a whole case that I was buying.  To add insult to injury, the shipping on 1 single 3.75 oz container was another whopping $8.99, for a grand total of $18.98, which works out to over $5 per ounce of salt.<br /><br />Again, it was my mistake, but you can easily find a whole case of salt on the web for what I paid for 1 container.
