Our labrador has an iron constitution. She has eaten a broad variety of food (and other strange things that she finds under bushes on walks from time to time), and has been like a machine producing the solidest stool for the last 8 years (I've actually bragged about this...something you too might be prone to do if you live somewhere where you must pick up after your dog with little baggies). This food, however, has turned her into a a diarrhea fountain. Not to mention that we can no longer allow her to wander into our room at night...the stench of her gas will wake us from the soundest sleep. While this has been unpleasant for us, I simply feel like we've been torturing her poor belly with this "premium" dog for for the past three weeks. We've tried to hold on for half a bag, but I'm changing back tomorrow. AVOID THIS FOOD!!!
