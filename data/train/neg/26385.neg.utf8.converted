<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00164V0VW">Kraft Italian Salad Dressing, Fat Free, 1.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 60)</a><br /><br />Big mistake, I am stuck with 59 packets of these horrible tasting salad dressings.  Kraft has a decent rep when it comes to items like this but they really missed the mark when they produced this item.  Horrible very salty taste perhaps because it is lite dressing, although I have tried other Kraft lite salad dressings and they were not bad. Does anyone want to buy 59 packets of italian dressing?  I will more then likely wind up throwing these out unless someone in my family decides to try them and likes them.
