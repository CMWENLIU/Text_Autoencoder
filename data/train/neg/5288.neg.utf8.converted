Do NOT buy this product.  Although Amazon is showing the Classic Hazelnut flavor, they are shipping the regular Hazelnut flavor.  The regular flavor is terrible and tastes like 1/2 peanut butter.<br /><br />I wish Torani would stop messing with their flavors and/or test them with someone who can taste.  This tastes nothing like hazelnut.  It tastes like some kind of sweet chemical caramel flavor dominated by an off peanut butter taste.<br /><br />If you want the REAL hazelnut taste, look for "Classic" Hazelnut.  Unfortunately, you cannot trust Amazon to ship you the right version.  I have purchased this several times in past years, but now I receive the regular Hazelnut.<br /><br />This is just like the Caramel versus Classic Caramel debacle I experienced with Amazon last year.  If you use the subscribe and save, you will really be screwed because ALL grocery items are non-returnable.<br /><br />I suggest you buy at a local grocery store to be sure you are getting the CLASSIC Hazelnut flavor.  Hopefully, in 6 months and enough customer complaints, Amazon will fix this.  They also need to fire their Torani rep who keeps supplying Amazon with the wrong product or is "helping" by switching to new formulations.
