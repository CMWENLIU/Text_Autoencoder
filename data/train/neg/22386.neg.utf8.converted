I was VERY excited to order this Barney Butter after reading about it in a magazine, and I loved the idea of the individual packets.  However, I was extremely disappointed to find that the almond butter was rock hard and dry within the packets, with a little bit of oil at the bottom and no possible way to mix the two together.  When I sampled it, it was like chewing on rubber.  I ended up throwing the entire box into the garbage.
