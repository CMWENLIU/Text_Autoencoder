I was compelled to write a review to steer people away from these overpriced and lousy tasting bars.  I am someone who loves the taste of green foods, and takes Green Vibrance and wheatgrass every morning.  But these Green+ bars have a rather vile taste, with a complete lack of texture that disintegrates into glue in the mouth.  Sure, the ingredients list is impressive, but the taste makes them a chore to eat.<br /><br />Steer clear and try the Larabars or Pure Bars, which actually taste wonderful, have less calories, and maintain a vibrant texture from start to finish.<br /><br />These bars are bad....And I like healthy green foods.  Take my word for it.
