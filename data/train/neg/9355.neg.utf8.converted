I expected these burgers to be better from the reviews. In the package they look great - fresh frozen with great deep red color. One good thing is that the do retain their size/shape after cooking. But the reason is because they are very lean so the fat doesn't cook out. The huge downside to that is fat = flavor. These were very dry because of the lack of fat to keep them moist and juicy. Unforunately I bought 20 burgers so I have a lot to eat. I will not buy them again.
