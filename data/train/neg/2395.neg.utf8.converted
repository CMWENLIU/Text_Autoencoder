If you know what real Dutch processed cocoa is, you probably won't like this.  This may use a traditional method somewhere in its production, but it is nothing like the reddish-brown loveliness you get with the 'real' alkaline-process cocoas.<br /><br />DO NOT get this thinking it's the genuine article.  If you want strong flavor, this will certainly do, but if you care about true chocolate flavor, avoid this like the plague.<br /><br />Hershey's used to make an authentic Dutch processed cocoa I can't find any more - it had a silver label.  If they still sell it, get that instead - it's very good and as reasonably priced as their other cocoa products.<br /><br />As far as flavor goes, I put this well below their normal powdered cocoa.
