I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas. It arrived in a Ghiradelli box ONLY - no outside packing. Great thing SHE didn't answer the door when it arrived! however, in the end it made NO difference. The box looked like it had been opened and retaped shut - it was actually ripped in several places and the tape was NOT neat. Add to that the fact that the bar was broken b/c the packing was completely insufficient for a fragile item like this PLUS the fact that it was inside the box in a plastic bag that was ripped open! SOMEBODY enjoyed the chocolate, but it certainly wasn't my daughter. I do NOT blame Amazon for this - they actually credited me the full amount AND gave me an additional credit since I will never be able to find this again at the sale price I bought it at. But SHAME on Ghiradelli - I can see they did an amazingly bad job on most of the orders. I will NEVER order from them again now, seeing how this was handled. Really - who ships something like that without extra packing and bubble wrap to ensure it arrives whole????
