Thought I'd try this as a cheaper alternative to the expensive prescription diet my vet recommended.  Researched further & added canned food, cranberry supplement, & water fountain.  No problems so far & feel much better that my cats are back on their meat-base food.  This stuff even smells bad.  Was worried since a Purina brand & I normally do not buy any of these poor quality foods, but tried it.
