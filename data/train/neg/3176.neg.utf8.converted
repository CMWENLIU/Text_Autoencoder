These are in the now common ziploc type bags but they arrived leaking and Amazon issued a refund.  I have been using Bob's Red Mill brand milk powder in the white loaves I bake but I  worry about bovine growth hormone in all cow pproducts in the USA so I ordered this brand.  I use Organic Valley for fresh dairy and it is much better than regular supermarket brands.<br /><br />gme
