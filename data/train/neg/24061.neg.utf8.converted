I purchased these 240 bags of tea for my life partner, who is very fond of Earl Grey tea, actually we both are. This product is bland and little to no aroma. Seeping it longer does not help. I do not know what dust in a tea bag would taste like, but it's most likely close to this. The reason it is getting one star is his polite quote "At least the water was hot."
