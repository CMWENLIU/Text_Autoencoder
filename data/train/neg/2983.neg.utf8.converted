Somebody handed me one of these at a picnic, and it looked interesting -- basically, it was like eating jam that had been left on a plate and dried into a concentrated and gelatinous lump of  -- well....  So I looked at the box the next time I went to the store.<br /><br />Here's what it's a lump of:<br /><br />--Grapes From Concentrate,  THAT'S OKAY WITH ME<br />--Sugar,  ALSO OKAY WITHIN LIMITS<br />--Maltodextrin,  ANOTHER SUGAR<br />--Corn Syrup,  ANOTHER SUGAR -- THE MOST UNHEALTHY OF ALL THE SUGARS -- SO UNHEALTHY THAT THE USA IS THE ONLY --THE ONLY -- THE ONLY -- FIRST WORLD COUNTRY LEFT THAT HAS NOT BANNED IT'S USE IN FOOD.<br />--Pears From Concentrate,  OKAY -- 1 MORE ACTUAL FRUIT<br />--Partially Hydrogenated Cottonseed Oil,  BASICALLY 1 STEP FROM PLASTIC, AND CONSIDERED AS BAD OR WORSE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH THAN TOBACCO<br />--Carrageenan,  COLOR<br />--Citric Acid,  PRESERVATIVE<br />--Acetylated Mono and Diglycerides,  WHO KNOWS<br />--Sodium Citrate,  ANOTHER PRESERVATIVE<br />--Malic Acid,  ANOTHER PRESERVATIVE<br />--Xanthan Gum,  HELP KEEP THE PLASTIC FROM BECOMING BRITTLE<br />--Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid),  CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT -- AND ALSO A PRESERVATIVE<br />--Locust Bean Gum,  AGAIN, MOISTURIZER FOR THE PLASTIC<br />--Natural & Artificial Flavor,  ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR?  AREN'T WE TIRED OF THIS BY NOW?<br />--Potassium Citrate,  SOUNDS LIKE POTASSIUM AND CITRUS FRUIT -- BUT IT'S NOT<br />--Color (Yellow 5, Red 40, Blue 1)  COLOR, COLOR, AND MORE COLOR -- ISN'T FRUIT PRETTY COLORFUL ALL BY ITSELF?<br /><br />So fruit -- which is already colorful and already sweet, is puree'd with enough sugar to kill ants, then dosed up with preservatives so it has a half-life of 200 years -- AND they throw in partially hydrogenated fats (which are so bad for your that they have been banned in several states and countries around the world -- and will be banned by the rest before it's over) -- and what have you got?  Something nobody in their right mind would eat and call "fruit".<br /><br />This is not fruit -- it's candy.  And as candy -- it's not even good candy.  Why not go for a piece of real fruit followed by a bit of REAL 60-75% chocolate made with REAL sugar.  Chocolate has the highest concentration of anti-oxidents on the planet -- so many that it has a naturally ultra-long shelf life with no zero- none- nada- not-a-bit of preservative or partially hydrogenated anything.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but I've just about reached the end of my patience with these monolithic companies that market empty calories laced with poison under innocent sounding names and cute, brightly colored boxes with cartoon animals on them.<br /><br />And don't be fooled by anything that says "Zero Grams of Trans Fat" --if it has partially hydrogenated oils in the ingredients list -- then they're splitting hairs with the labeling laws.  Partially hydrogenated oil IS Trans Fat.<br /><br />If they make the portion size small enough that 1 portion has less than .5 grams of partially hydrogenated fat (even if the portion size is only 4 grams of the food)  -- then they are within the law to lie to you and advertise their product as having 0-grams of trans fat!  Can you believe it?  Whatever happened to the spirit of the law?<br /><br />Money happened.<br /><br />If a portion size is 4-grams, and each 4-grams of a 180-gram box contains .4-grams of partially hydrogenated fat -- that means the box could contain as much as 18-grams of TRANS FAT.  It's a con.  It's a lie.  It's trying to pass a lie that falls within the letter of the law off as the truth.  I've actually read boxes where the serving size was 2 crackers -- little tiny crackers -- that together weighed less than 9 grams.  That's less than 1/3 of an ounce.  Who is that supposed to be a serving for?  Barbie?<br /><br />And if you buy these things and feed them to your children -- then you're buying the lie because it's easy, pretty, well marketed, sweet (no kidding) and without a shadow of thought or conscience.
