The Salmon Shreds are our cat's favorite (he's a picky 17 year old veteran).  Our local Walmart doesn't have this flavor so I usually get it at the expensive grocery store around the corner.  I was thrilled to find it cheaper on Amazon.  However, even though it's the same brand, same flavor, and not expired, he will hardly pick at the food from the ordered cans.  Thinking that perhaps he got tired of the Salmon Shreds I just bought a can around the corner for comparison, and he's really chowing down.  So perhaps the flavor of the ordered cans changed because they underwent some drastic temperature change, or maybe it's a different batch - don't have a clue.  Just wish I hadn't ordered 2 cases at once.
