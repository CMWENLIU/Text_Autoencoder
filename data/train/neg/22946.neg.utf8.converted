I have used the Subscribe and Save twice for the Prime Filet Friskies quite happily.  I looked today, and the purchase price is now DOUBLE, making each can OVER A DOLLAR--$32 +/- per case of 24.  This is truly poor ethics/business practice on the part of Amazon.  I am incredibly disappointed and I hope this serves as fair warning to those who have yet to notice the 125% jump in price since last month.
