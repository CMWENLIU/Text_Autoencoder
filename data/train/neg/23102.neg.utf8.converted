After searching to find the bean with MILK chocolate and paying extra to get it here before Christmas I open the box and find that they are in fact DARK chocolate.  Clearly states Milk chocolate in the description.  Now its too late to resolve the issue before Christmas.  No phone numbers to call so that customer service can overnight what I ordered.
