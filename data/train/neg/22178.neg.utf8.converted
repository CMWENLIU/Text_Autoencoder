I got a bottle of these bubbles for my brother and his wife, who have two very active indoor kitties. They looked at the bubbles for a few seconds, and soon walked away. They just didn't care. I also picked up a bottle for our cat, Jerry, who is indoor/outdoor, and loves chasing everything that moves. We opened the package near him, and he was very interested when he caught a whiff of the catnip, but he's scared of the bubbles. He even went outside to get away from them. I think he's pissed.
