I was so excited about GF rice krispies!!  I had a handful out of the box and, while the texture was a tad strange, overall, the taste wasn't bad.  UNTIL I poured a bowl and added milk.  The rice krispies almost instantly turned into mush and had the texture of bread soaked in water..... so gross...
