Not only did several jars break, but they were apparently broken for so long that the food that had spilled all over the other jars grew mold. Mold everywhere! Really disgusting and smelled terrible. I won't trust Amazon to ship these baby food items.<br /><br />Update: Apparently this is a huge issue with EB via Amazon. If you look at other reviews for other EB here you'll see that the USDA has been alerted about the spoiled and moldy EB baby food on Amazon.
