This is my very first review - I thought these were genuinely terrible. I like Larabars; I think the Cherry Pie variety tastes good. But these? Overwhelming orange oil/ zest flavor (it tasted just the way the orange essence smells) and zero chocolate flavor. If you haven't had these yet,  buy an individual bar before buying the box. I now have 15.9 of these bars and will *not* eat them.
