I'm a huge consumer of sardines and decided to order these since they received good reviews. They pale in comparison to the fresh-taste and soft-texture of Wild Planet brand sardines. Those also come with lots of liquid/oil etc in the can which happens to be BPA-free. These are dry and pasty and have very little fluid in the can. Also, I followed the link here from the Crown Prince website which advertises these as being packed in BPA-free cans. However, when they arrived I realized they weren't. I contacted Crown Prince about this and they basically said that amazon is selling an older stock in BPA-coated cans. I'm annoyed that they'd place a link on their site to "order now from amazon" and then when you order it is not the product advertised on their website. In my opinion, that is a very poor response from the company.
