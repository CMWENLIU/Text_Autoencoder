The bottle says "No MSG" but this is actually false advertising.<br />1. In the US, companies are only required to list MSG on the ingredient label as MSG if it is a pure form of free glutamate.<br />2. It is true that this product does not contain pure MSG.<br />3. Many of the ingredients listed contain VERY high levels of MSG (free glutamate), and are included BECAUSE they contain MSG.<br />4. Both Disodium Inosinate and Disodium Guanylate are also included, which are pretty expensive to add, and are only added because they enhance the effects of MSG--they do nothing else. If Kernel Seasons really did not include MSG, there would be no point in adding these other additives (and it would be much cheaper not to add them).<br /><br />Some people choose to eat foods with MSG, and that's ok.  White Cheddar used to be my favorite Kernel Season's flavor before I learned how to read ingredient labels carefully.  If MSG doesn't bother you, go ahead and buy this if you want.  My husband is severely allergic to MSG, though, and when we were first learning to avoid MSG, labels like this caused him to be very sick.  Why not just remove "No MSG" from the package instead of misleading people?  This is really an unethical practice.<br /><br />I felt very disappointed and mislead when I discovered this.  Don't just take my word for it; go learn about the ingredients on the list.
