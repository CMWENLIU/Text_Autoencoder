Amazon has this item in the gluten free section, but it is NOT GLUTEN FREE.  And you can NOT RETURN the item.  Amazon needs to fix this immediately.  No buyer should be given incorrect information and then made to keep the product that is not what it was sold as.  I make several purchases a month from Amazon and this is the most disappointed I have been with a purchase.
