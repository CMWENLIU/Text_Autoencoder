I bought these hoping to make it a staple in my family's diet.  When we received them, we noticed that Eden Foods has a disclosure on the label (not included in the Amazon description).  It says that the beans are processed on the same equipment as wheat.  I do not feel safe using these beans in our family since we have gluten intolerance/sensitivity.
