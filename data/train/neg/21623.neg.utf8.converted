First, I have to say, my dogs love this treat. I like that it has the sweet potato, but that was until the FDA started warning about chicken treats from China. Chinese produced chicken treats, like Kingdom Pets, are causing kidney failure in dogs.<br /><br />Kingdom Pets has yet to test, or release test results of their product.<br /><br />I'd avoid any chicken or other dog treats that come from China. This isn't the first time Chinese based pet products have caused a problem.
