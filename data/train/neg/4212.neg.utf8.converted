I'm giving this a one star because obviously there is a problem with the packaging seals on this product. The only reason I order is that I don't have time to go buy these at a local store which is about an hour from my house--thus ordering makes sense. Except that when my shipment arrives there are 3 packages out of the 6 boxes that are leaking. I open up the box and there is a terrible stench. Spoiled coconut water smells awful, especially in the 100 degree summer temps we've been having. So I unpack the boxes, and pour out the spoiled contents because of the smell, and then go to Amazon to try to report that 3 out of the 6 boxes in the package were damaged. Well, it looks like the only option is to return the package or request a refund. I need the other 3 boxes that were not leaking, and can't find an option to report this to anyone. Then I read the other reviews for this product and note that I'm not the only one whose experienced issues with leaking during shipment. Since there doesn't appear to be a way to be credited for only the items in the shipment that were leaking, and keep the others, and I would have had to get clean boxes and repack the horrible smelling boxes in new packaging to ship back, I just decided to keep the undamaged ones, and to let others know. I won't be ordering this size again in the future, and will just make the one hour trip to my grocer that carries the larger size and then buy locally in bulk next time.<br /><br />Note: if you try the product it is really good, but the packaging leaves a lot to be desired.
