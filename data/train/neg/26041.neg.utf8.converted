What I was expecting from this was 16-20 different types of coffee. What I got was 7 spicy eggnogs, 5 mudslides, 6 hazelnut and a lot of "limited edition"  Christmas favors that I have seen on clearance many places for $5. I did not get what is expected and will not buy this "company" again. I read they fixed the variety grab bag problem 6 months ago. I assure you it was not fixed. It was nothing more than leftovers. I was very disappointed. DO NOT LET THE PICTURE FOOL YOU!
