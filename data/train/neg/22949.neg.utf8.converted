We were eager to try this product, in a household with one diabetic and more than one person trying to lose weight.<br /><br />This product is intended to take the place of pasta or rice (depending on how it is cut) and is really a pretty decent substitute. Some people are put off by the appearance or odor when the package is opened, but you'll find after you rinse with water that there is really no odor and it is perfectly bland. It derives its taste and smell from whatever you add to it. In texture, it's more chewy than pasta, a bit hard to bite through and easy to choke on. Again, this can be overcome by choosing a kind that's been pre-cut into small pieces. As a substitute for pasta, you may not do any better than this.<br /><br />And now I must come to the reason I titled this review "use with caution." With one exception, everyone in my household liked this product but had severe stomach cramps within a couple hours of eating it. We're pretty hearty and not inclined to have easily upset tummies or food allergies. We liked this product and wanted to use it so we gave it several tries, but with the same result each time - severe stomach cramps within a short time after eating. We eat other foods that have a high fiber content with no difficulty.<br /><br />So - I wouldn't suggest avoiding this product, because many people eat it without a problem. I do recommend that you try it with caution and don't order a lot of it until you know that you're able to tolerate it.
