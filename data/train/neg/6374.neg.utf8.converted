When you first receive this basket you think wow this looks great.  However once you open it you start to realize how not great it is.<br /><br />1.  The most weird thing about this basket is that they items have been repackaged.  There is a box of carmel corn the cover made it look like it was a fake version of the item.  When you open it up you are even more suspicious b/c the caramel corn is inside a wheat thins box! huh? many of the items are similarly repackaged this way.  I would never send someone a basket that is so obviously homemade instead of a legit company.<br /><br />2.  many of the items were so small.  Inside was a tiny box of jelly beans, a one serving of peanuts, cashews etc.  I am use to seeing in baskets a can of nuts not a single serving snack travel pack. Also some of the items were a little strange to me - German hot mustard in a green tube...it didn't seem to match the caramel corn, jelly beans, nuts and crackers.  There was a package of sausage but still...<br /><br />3.  never heard of the brands -- now this could just be me.  these may be very famous brands and people know them all over the world.  But with the suspect packaging I thought the food itself was also of a lower class.  After tasting the items such as the caramel corn - which was stale, Hit cookies which were blah an oreo is better, and the malt shop taffies not very tasty, my disappointment just grew.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product to anyone.  you could build a better basket on your own or go with a well known company.<br /><br />**EDIT**<br />after I wrote this review Black Mountian now ig4U sent me a new basket.  It was packaged so much better.  It didn't look scary fake like the first one did.  I appreciate the company's effort to make right something that was not good.  I think that a person would be ok sending out their new and improved baskets.  I still stick to my original post that I think the food items were boring and not names that people would know but they tasted fine this time.  I change my star rating to 3 stars.
