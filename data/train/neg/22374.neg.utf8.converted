I switched my two boston terriers (one is 16 pounds and the other is 24 pounds) to Chicken Soup over a 10 day period.  I noticed they had considerable gas, but assumed it was a temporary condition from switching to a new food.  Once they were only on the Chicken Soup, they had diarrhea, black and tarry stools.  I immediately switched them back to Science Diet.  I contacted the company and asked if they knew what could have casued this digestive upset - they responded that the numerous protein sources were probably the cause.  So maybe boston terriers don't do well with this type of premium dog food.  I would recommend you purchase a small bag first, in case it doesn't work out.
