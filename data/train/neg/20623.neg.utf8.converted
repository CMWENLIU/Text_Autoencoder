I was thrilled to see Kellogg's coming out with a gluten free version of Rice Krispies...that is until I saw that they were going to be made with brown rice. That is the absolute first mistake. They should have just followed suit with the way General Mills altered all of their Chex cereals and replaced the malt with molasses. I decided to give these a try just for giggles. Well I can say that I am very disappointed and I now have four boxes of Rice Krispies that are going to waste. The texture is just like all of the other brown rice cereals out there -- hard and burnt-tasting. Kellogg's, you can't be using brown rice to make Rice Krispies, it just doesn't work! I have yet to try these in Rice Krispie treats, lets hope the marshmallows and butter mask the flavor. The texture is nice for a few minutes until the milk gets to them but then its like eating paste. With the evolution of gluten free foods it is so much easier to get gluten free versions of traditional favorites to taste like the original. Gluten free consumers are no longer willing to lower their standards -- PLEASE Kellogg's, take a cue from General Mills and make this cereal gluten free without changing the recipe entirely!<br /><br />Update: I tried making Rice Krispie treats. I was sure to add extra marshmallows to mask the toasted flavor. They were pretty decent I will say but I'm still disappointed that I now have 4 boxes of cereal to make Rice Krispie treats with, hopefully I can use the boxes before they expire.
