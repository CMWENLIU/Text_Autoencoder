A friend gave me some of these bags and I thought they'd be great alternative to plastic for pet waste. Unfortunately, two out of three bags end up unusable due to tearing. I try to handle them as carefully as possible, but I haven't perfected the art of detaching a bag from the roll without ripping. Then I have to open it and put things in it, which only increases the chances of damage.
