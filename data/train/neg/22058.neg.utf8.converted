I got these drink packages since I don't have time for breakfast in the morning and I'm always in a rush.  These drinks tastes very artifical which I expected.  The fullness that the other reviewers claim is more like bloated-ness.  On an empty stomach these drinks will make you bloated for several hours until you have some real food, and they also make you very gassy all day.  I gave it to other members of my family and they experienced bloated-ness and gas.  I don't know if I will finish my bulk pack from Amazon, but I will not purchase these again.
