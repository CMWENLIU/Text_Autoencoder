<span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:13 Mins<br /><br /></span>Since I can't attach a photo to my review, I decided to take a video of my 8 year old son opening one of these bars so you can see first hand how small they are in comparison to a small boy's hands.<br /><br />I purchased these for my son who has celiac disease.  We were incredibly disappointed on the packaging and size of these bars.  Based on the size of the box and the picture on the front, we expected full size bars - not a tiny gummy square.  Most of the packaging is air.<br /><br />My son does like the taste of these however.  The packaging just seems misleading and they seem to be way too expensive for what they are.
