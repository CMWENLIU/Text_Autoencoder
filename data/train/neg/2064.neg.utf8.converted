nice organic seed. Will need to order a larger quantity next time to try to get the costs down a bit I'm still somewhat new to wheatgrass so learning lots and lots.  Craig<br /><br />Update: I have since noticed lots of bugs in the seed. Since this is my first experience I am not sure if this is normal or not? Does anyone have any experience with this? Would love some feedback?<br /><br />I have pictures if anyone wants to see them...
