The worst coffee I ever bought. As soon as I opened the bag, I know what a terrible mistake I made buying three bags of cheap coffee. It smelled foul, it expires within 1 month of purchase, and it definitely contains more than just grounded coffee beans (leaves, branches etc). But I still tried to brew the coffee, I brewed one with a french press, terrible taste. And then I tried to brew it with a Moka, still terrible. So now they are where they belong, the garbage bin. I don't know if my three bags of coffee all happened to be outliers, but I just cannot agree with the other reviews.
