This is definitely the worst, most horrific imitation of pho I've ever had. If you have eaten and enjoyed a delicious bowl of pho in a restaurant, beware. This tastes nothing like what you're used to, or looking forward to. It stinks, and tastes overly salty and rancid, though I know it wasn't, because I bought another jar of it from a shop and it was just the same. If what you're looking for is a way to make pho at home, my suggestion is to either take the time to make the broth from scratch, or abandon the idea and go to a restaurant. This is absolutely not worth your time or money.
