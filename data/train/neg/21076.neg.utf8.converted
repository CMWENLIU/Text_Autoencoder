The discription of this product is very misleading, the opening line is<br /> Java One French Vanilla OOH Pods, 14-Count Pods (Pack of 6)<br /><br />It leads you believe that you are buying a pack of 6 boxes not 1 box.<br />  Also in the discription they list the different flavors of coffee you will be receiving...<br />  I beleive they actually have the wrong info with this item!!
