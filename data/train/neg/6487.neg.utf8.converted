Ordered this item as I am a diabetic.  Decent tasting but absolutely indigestible. Caused major gastrointestinal distress.  Found hidden behind the fold a very subtle understated advisory that some individuals may experience a "laxative" effect.  Excuse me but this was way beyond "laxative" and lasted more than 18 hours!  This could replace the pre-colonoscopy medicine Miralax. Wait I might be on to something here! At least the the pre-op procedure would taste good.  I subsequently went back to the site and looked at the customer reviews and learned I am not alone in this experience.  Amazon needs to clearly advise customers of this potential in their product description.  Until they do I would hope they refund people who buy it  If you decide to try it after reading this, have a book and a roll handy and don't leave home.
