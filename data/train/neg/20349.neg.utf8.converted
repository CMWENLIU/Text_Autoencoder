Organic freeze-dried corn is a wonderful snack. I eat it instead of tortilla chips. Organic freeze dried corn tastes great and I usually eat it right out of the bag.<br /><br />Organic freeze dried corn has a light, airy texture that practically melts in your mouth. It has a fresh taste that reminds me of sweet corn right from the garden.<br /><br />Freeze-dried corn can also be added to your favorite recipes. And it will remain fresh when stored for long periods of time.<br /><br />But Sensible Foods Organic Sweet Corn, at several dollars for 0.75-Ounce, is way overpriced.<br /><br />Check out "Organic Just Corn" by a company called Just Tomatoes. Amazon sells it now. The product is just as good as this one and you get about 5 times as much for the price. The quality is as good or better IMO.<br /><br />Another option is Now Food Non-GMO Freeze Dried Corn -- but that is not organic. It tastes great, but I prefer organic.
