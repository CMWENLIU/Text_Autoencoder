So I dump my bag of wheat into my existing half full wheat bucket and find the package littered with what seems to be little black seeds of some sort- definitly not wheat!!! Not bugs- but perfectly shaped little black balls.  I have looked for an answer online with no luck...I tried calling the manufacture and the office was closed- I have yeast proofing on the counter that I now have to dump- and my good wheat is now mixed in with the "bad".....so basically I'm out of dinner, and money.  Only alot annoyed at this point.<br /><br />***Okay this is an add on to the original post- Looks like it's something called smut balls.....a dried fungus ball.  Not toxic- as far as I can see.  But still is considered an unpure grain.  I don't see why I should pay top dollar for less than quality grain and that I paid for weight with these included (i'm guessing 4-5 lbs worth mixed in).  I could sit and pick out millions of these tiny things or just figure out how to get a refund (p.s....i have no idea how I'm going to repackage it for the return).  I will not be a return customer of this product unless it is shown to have improvement.
