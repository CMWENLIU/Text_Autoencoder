I was hoping to surprise my kids with a Brazilian Easter eggs, but when my order got to my house, the eggs were melted. Instead of getting a Easter egg, a got a ball of melted chocolate. I don't know what happened, but I know I had to trash the two disgusting ball of melted chocolate. I also know how disappointed my kids were. I didn't returned it because I knew it wouldn't worth it. I hope for the next buyers that the seller gets a better way to have their chocolate eggs delivered without melting, I myself won't be buying it ever again over the internet.
