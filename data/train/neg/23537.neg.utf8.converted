Always trying to give holistic, natural healthy treats to our dogs, but this product has the words "Made in China" in tiny letters. Our dog became ill. Vet suspected poisoning, tested for and found that the liver was failing. At autopsy, poisoning was verified. 4 other dogs were also sickened by this product. Be very careful. Trust treats made in China and you are taking a huge risk that no one wants to take with their beloved pet.
