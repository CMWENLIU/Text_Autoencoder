Like another reviewer, I've been on a search for a less expensive coffee to replace my Starbucks addiction.  This one doesn't even come close... seems weak no matter how much I use per cup.  Tastes like bad coffee at a roadside cafe.  If you are a fan of Starbucks or Illy, look elsewhere as this will be a big disappointment to you.
