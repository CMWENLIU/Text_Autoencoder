Amazon Notified me Diamond Naturals was being recalled due to Salmonella in the Food. Great, I'm glad they told us; yes, a month after we bought the food, but luckily, our dog hasn't gotten to it yet. Diamond Naturals says they will give you a replacement Coupon if you mail them the UPC code off the bag. But what if you do like us, and always dump the food into an airtight container to keep vermin out? Presto-Chango! NO UPC CODE. And What do you do if you also Mix your food with another (higher end) brand? There's 60 bucks worth of dog food there that we now have to throw out. Fantastic. What do you do? Well you contact Diamond Naturals, tell them exactly that, and they respond, by saying "If you don't have the Bag, when in doubt, throw the food out. Since we value you as a customer, we're going to give a coupon for more Diamond Naturals, Just cut the UPC code off the Bag and send it to us." ....Really? Hellooooo? Testing...is this thing on? So you email them back, pointing out again, that it's not possible to send them something you don't have, and again asking... "Hey, what about the other food that's ruined too? I have the record of buying them both on the same day from Amazon."  What happens next? Apparently Nothing, No Response, Zip. So, You dump the food in the trash, scrub out the container, and his food bowl just in case, and belly-ache about it here. And end up at Pets-Mart buying a different brand and hoping your dog doesn't get the runs because of the sudden change.
