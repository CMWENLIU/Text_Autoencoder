My kids are very disappointed that I no longer buy Ovaltine. It costs more, there is less product, more sugar and less nutrients. I have 3 boys and I started my oldest, who is now 8, on Ovaltine ever since he started on milk. It was great to have something for him that I could count on for nutrients when he was a pickyeater. Now we are no longer an Ovaltine family unless they go back to the old formula.
