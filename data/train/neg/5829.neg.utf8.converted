I love iced tea - a refreshing, calorie-free, healthy drink.  I have tried other flavors in this line, including tropical (herbal) and lemon black tea (looks like they eliminated this flavor from the product line) and was satisfied enough to try the peach black tea flavor - yuck.<br /><br />While not totally undrinkable, it does not taste like black iced tea with peach, more like a bouquet of artificial flavors with fake cinnamon flavoring, like the one you taste in "hot" cinnamon candies.  Find a good hot tea and go through the trouble of chilling it with ice because this is simply disappointing.
