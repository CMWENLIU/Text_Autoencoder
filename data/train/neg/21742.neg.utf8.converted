I am writing this after having eaten this soup for lunch.  Something has gone terribly wrong here.  I have enjoyed this soup quite frequently in the past.  Until fairly recently, this soup has been consistently good.  The taste was correct, just the right amount of sherry, and enough turtle to  satisfy my normally generous standards.  This last serving has prompted me to search the Internet for the source of the problem; no turtle and far too much tomato.  As I have alluded to earlier, this is not consistent with the past history of this product.  Something has gone very terribly wrong here...
