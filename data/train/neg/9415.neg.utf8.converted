The picture on the website shows the package that lists "organic ginger" as one of the ingredients. However, the ginger snaps that I received have a slightly different packaging from pictured and there is "ginger powder" instead of "ginger" as one of the ingredients.<br />The picture and the description should be updated - I would not have purchased these had I known about the change in ingredients.
