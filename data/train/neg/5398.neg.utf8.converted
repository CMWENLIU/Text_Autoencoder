As another person noted, this is basically instant coffee.  When finishing your brew, you will note that the kcup is completely empty....much like one of the hot chocolates.  The box states: soluble & microground coffee.  I gave it 2 stars because the taste is not terrible.  It is stronger than most American instant coffees and resembles the instant coffee I have tasted while in Italy....however, it is still instant and should be better referenced in the product description.
