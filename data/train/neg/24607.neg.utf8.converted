Just purchased two cans of Jennies coconut macaroons. Opened one can and detected a different taste. Checked ingredients and was shocked at the addition of evaporated sugar. I'll be taking the other unopened can back to the health food store. I am thankful for the many years enjoying Jennies coconut macaroons, but will be learning to make my own now. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1MHY">Jennie's Coconut Macaroons, Peanut and Gluten Free, 8-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)</a>
