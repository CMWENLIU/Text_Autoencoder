This product shipped quickly which was the highlight of this experience.<br /><br />When I opened the shipping box, I found a zip lock plastic bag with all of the sticks contained loosely within. There was no labeling at all on the bag or in the box. If you are like me you like to know the product information especially country of origin, preparation method, and manufacturer.  The HPD information states that these sticks come from free-roaming bulls, but, who knows what I received. The smell of the product is sickly sweet and fairly pungent.<br /><br />What was most disappointing though was the size of the sticks. An average size is about 1/2 inch in parameter. Many are around 1/4 inch.  Only a few are close to 1 inch.<br /><br />My cocker spaniel plowed through one of these sticks in about five minutes.  Hardly the distraction that I intended.<br /><br />Typically I purchase Cadet 12" bully sticks, cutting them down to 4 inch sticks.  Cadet sticks are wide, have very little smell and contain product information. My dog takes about 30 minutes with these. Going forward I will order the Cadets.
