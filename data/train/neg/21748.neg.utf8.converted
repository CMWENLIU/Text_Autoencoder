I used to buy this stuff by the case since I lived in Georgia and it was hard to find. Have not had any on a few years, but this current version is absolutely HORRIBLE! Do not waste your money for you will be very disappointed by this sham of a "snapper soup". Bookbinder's (or whoever owns the rights to the name) ought to be ashamed of what they did to what used to be a very good product.
