I love chocolate and have had some of the best.  I feel pretty naive to believe I could have gotten anything like that for $17 for 2 pounds.  These were old and waxy.  They were white with age, the dark chocolate that is, and just awful.  I took a bite of a couple different kinds and they all were not edible in my opinion.  Even ghiardelli is better than these!
