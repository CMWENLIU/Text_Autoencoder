This self-described "delicious" superfood tastes horrible, close to stagnant pond slime would be my guess.  I tried adding stevia and it was still undrinkable.  Don't fall for the high rating because you can't return it.  I'm going back to Go Greens even though it's more expensive.<br /><br />~ Ken Baumbach, author of Mayageddon 2012 and The Heretics' Power
