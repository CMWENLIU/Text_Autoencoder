This is the second time that I have order a case of these beans.  The first time a couple of the cans were dented.  With the order that arrived yesterday 11 of the 12 cans were dented.<br /><br />All the packaging was intact with no crushing on the box.  11 of the 12 cans were dented - some horribly.  It is clear to me that the seller is providing seconds - which are then being passed along.  While they MAY be safe - I don't want to take that chance - and they were not advertised as "scratch and dent" type item.<br /><br />Update:  Contacted AMZ as item not eligible for return.  They told me to keep or throw away the dented cans and they sent me a replacement case in 2 days.  All cans in good shape on replacement.<br /><br />Great product - the glitch was somewhere in the order filling process.  We will continue to buy this product.
