I can only get a little comfort in the fact that I wasn't the only one that missed the fact this is INSTANT coffee!  (Who would buy instant coffee in a K-Cup?  Not me - at least not knowingly!)  Having said that, I can't really rate the flavor, since I never (until this morning) drink instant coffee - but the double-sized cup I brewed this morning paled in comparison with my normal real K-Cup coffee.  The other 22 K-Cups of this *stuff* went right into the garbage can!
