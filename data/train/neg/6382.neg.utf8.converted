I really thought the reviews were mixed because some people just don't like coconut water, so I ordered this.  It is NOT good at all.  In fact it has weird smell to it.  It is in my refrigerator, but I think I will have to throw them all away as I cannot get myself to drink it.  I did drink 1/2 of one mixed with orange juice and it didn't taste bad, but just thinking about that weird smell makes me not want to drink any more of it.<br /><br />I have bought other Vita Coco Coconut Water in the past and loved every one of them.  I should have passed on this one.  It really isn't drinkable, in my opinion.
