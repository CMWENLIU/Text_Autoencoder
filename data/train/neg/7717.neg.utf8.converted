This cake looked beautiful, in the photo online, and I couldn't wait to get it! It came on time in a good container to keep the item frozen, but when I opened it and saw the cake I was very disappointed. The cake, in the photo, looks like on the top that it has a lot of frosting but it was flat and didn't have much at all. There was very little white chocolate shavings on the sides of the cake like it said that there would be. There was suppose to be a flower in the middle of the cake but there were none. This was a birthday cake and it was suppose to have "Happy Birthday" written on the cake, this also was not there. Now for the taste... It was the worst cake I ever tasted! It was suppose to have buttercream frosting but it wasn't buttercream at all! I really don't know what it was, maybe a whipped cream, but even if it was whipped cream it was awful! The cake was moist but it too didn't taste real well. I thought that maybe it was just me but when my husband took a bite, (I didn't tell him that I didn't like the way it tasted), he almost threw up!!!!! We threw it out. The customer service was nice and they tried to get me to agree to another try at the cake or for them to send me out something else that they have, but I wasn't going to take the chance again with this place. So they said that they would refund my money.
