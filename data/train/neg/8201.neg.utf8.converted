I put two tablespoons (two-thirds of what the package describes as one serving) in my morning oatmeal the day after I received it.  It turned the oatmeal an odd greenish-black color, but I did not find the slightly herby taste at all unpleasant.  I felt great for a couple of hours, and thought I'd found a good way to add more protein to my largely vegetarian diet.<br /><br />A little over two hours after I ate breakfast, I started to feel very warm and then became violently ill.  I had chills for a few hours afterwards and spent most of the afternoon resting and gradually starting to feel better.<br /><br />Since I didn't eat anything else new and no one around me has had similar symptoms, I can only attribute this to a very bad reaction to the hemp protein powder.  No one else mentions having such a reaction, so it may be too unusual for anyone else to worry about.  But please, if you're going to try this product, start with little and make sure you can tolerate it before trying a full dose!
