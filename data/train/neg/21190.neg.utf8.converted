I had high hopes for this, and other variations from Hodgson Mill, so I bought 18 boxes at the same time I purchased our breadmaker! First I realized that I had to set the crust setting on "light" to not get a nearly burned loaf (maybe a breadmaker issue?), but even then the missus and I agreed that each of the three varieties we bought were rather tasteless.
