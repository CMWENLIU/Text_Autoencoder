I ordered this plant and I can't even beleive you're allowed to lie like this and get away with it. The item description clearly states that the plant is supposed to be a 4yr old that is 8 inches high and in a 10 inch pot. This is not my plant at all, its about 6 inches if that and in a 6.5 inch pot. I can't beleive I paid $32 for this plant. There is no one to get in contact with to return it or ask WHAT IS GOING ON?!?! I don't understand why you say you will give a plant that is completely different from what I received. I am very unsatisfied with my plant and even more with your bad service, no one anwsers my emails or questions. If anyone can help me, my email is chanteldionne@hotmail.com
