Where does this milk powder come from?  Bob's Red Mill grinds flour in the Northwest but many of their products are "packaged" at their location but are not made there.<br /><br />This buttermilk powder did nothing for me.  It didn't make a better biscuit or waffle and it made my loaf bread less tasty than if I had used regular milk powder.  This wasn't a successful product for me and I still have not finished the first package.  I won't restock it when/if I run out of it.
