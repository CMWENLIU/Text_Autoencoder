Based on the positive reviews and the organic certification I gave this a try. The taste is very sweet, which from the reviews, I expected. The texture is rubbery or plastic like, not at all like the real jerky I used to get in the south out of the jars in the truck stops. It may be organic, but it tastes like organic rubber to me.
