Please be aware, that the people who originally owned SILK have sold the company to the $11 billion company Dean Foods.  They refused to participate in the recent Cornucopia study and refuse to divulge where they get their soybeans from (China).  Soybeans from China do not meet the stringent controls you need to determine if they are a) organic and b) not GMO (genetically modified).  The prices did not go down when the quality of their soybeans did, and they are secretive and defensive of their product.  Better to support American soy farms and products, for example Eden Foods.  I will never again drink/eat another Silk product. (I couldn't give zero stars, so i had to give one).
