my boyfriend is from California and complains that he can not get Italian Dry Salami in Wisconsin.  So as a surprise I ordered him this salami.  (the customer service, was remarkable)  When the salami arrived it was still very moist, so we hung out to dry.  About a week later my boyfriend - eyes aglow - cut it open and was extremely disappointed at how much more fat there was in this salami than the ones he remembers or the ones his brother occasionally sends him.<br /><br />he ate the salami.  but he said it was, eh, nondescript.  About two weeks later his brother sent him dry salami, and he cut it open for me to see.  The salami should be dry right away when you get it, and he was right there seemed to be a lot less fat in the second salami - and it had a lot less greasy taste.
