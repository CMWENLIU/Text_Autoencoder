My first thought when I saw this product was "Yum.  These look good.  I'll order some."  I am ALWAYS looking for a healthy, lo-cal treat.  My next thought, after reading the description was "Why would anything sold with the name 'thinkTHIN' NOT tell you the calories in their description?"  Wouldn't just about anyone who is looking for a healthy, nutritious treat want to see the nutrition information?  Come on, people!  What are you hiding?  I will certainly NOT order these until I see more information, be it here or somewhere else.  Maybe the nutrition labeling is here, and I just don't see it, but it should be front and center.
