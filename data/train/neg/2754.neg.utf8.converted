I wouldn't have believed it, but in Googling for a cause of the recently acquired bitter aftertaste I've been experiencing, I found an article about pine nuts causing this, and it's even being called a syndrome, which can occur a few days after consumption.  One writer suggested the culprit is pine nuts from China, which these are.  I hope the taste will be gone by Christmas, after which I hope to try making pesto again with Italian pine nuts, or see if I can find some grown closer to home.  I suppose this could be some form of allergy, but just in case, I thought other pesto enthusiasts would like to know.
