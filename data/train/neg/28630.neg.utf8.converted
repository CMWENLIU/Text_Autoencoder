I love Nylabone products, but I don't like this one!  My dog loves to chew, and Nylabone makes great products.  This is the worst one.  After chewing on this bone for a while, the little red "plugs" or pieces come out.  This posses either a potential choking hazard, or a possible obstruction for a dog.  I will continue to buy Nylabone products, but this one is dangerous!
