I love Kashi products. I think they taste great and the health stats are sublime. It is with great pain (literal and figurative) that I rate this a 2-star product. I must be in the minority, but about 2 hours after eating any of the Go-Lean cereals I experience pain inducing intestinal gas (farts). Google it if you don't believe me. If this didn't turn my stomach into a pressurized cannon, I would easily rate it 5-stars. It's healthy, tastes great, can be found on sale for the price of regular cereal, and Amazon has it for subscribe and save. Unfortunately, I am one of the seeming minority who will have to stop eating this after making the connection to it's terrible gas inducing powers.
