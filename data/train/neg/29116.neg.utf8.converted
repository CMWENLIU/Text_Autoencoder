This product tastes terrible and it also tastes NOTHING like actual coconut water. Anyone who has ever lived in a country where Coconuts actually grow would be and IS utterly offended by this product. It seems that people will buy anything that is prepackaged and overly process as long as it claims to be all natural. Save yourself and your bodies by not eating/drinking "natural" foods bought in a package. The truth of the matter is that anything that is actually authentic has not been processed in factories and put on a shelf.
