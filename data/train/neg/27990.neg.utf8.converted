Okay, we all know that American chocolate (Hershey's, Nestle, etc)is waxy and therefore pretty flavorless. European chocolate is not waxy in general, it melts in your mouth and the flavor is so much better. These truffles used to be European style and they were my absolute favorite, but now, THEY ARE WAXY!!!! What happened? Is it because they are being mass produced? Is it because they think Americans LIKE waxy chocolate?!!! Do not buy these truffles.
