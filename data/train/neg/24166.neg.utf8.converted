When I got the the pods i thought they were "fake" made by someone other than Senseo.  The pods were loosely packed and would not set level on the pod holder resulting in week coffee.  The pod also did not have the senseo logo printed on the pod.  Calling cust service they changed how the pods are made and some are still out untill they are phased out.  Sucks!  The new pods are packed better but you still need to place then carfully r the coffee is weak.  I would not buy a large pack.  Stick with the single pack so you don't wast money having pods that dont work
