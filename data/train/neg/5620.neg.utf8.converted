These snakes seemed like a nice present idea for the gummy candy lovers out there, and they look pretty cool, but should be advertised as a toy not an edible item.  This candy is tasteless and is the toughest/hardest gummy item I have ever tried. It is much cheaper than other gummy items its size, but not worth the value.
