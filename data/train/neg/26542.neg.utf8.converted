These noodles took a long time to arrive, and I was surprised to discover that they were made in the USA.  My surprise because they tasted awfully stale to the max and the flavor packet was pure salt no flavor what so ever.  The stale taste stays in your mouth for the rest of the day as well.  The packages did have an expiration date printed on them of June 12, 2009.  I was very disappointed - I cannot really see myself purchasing these again
