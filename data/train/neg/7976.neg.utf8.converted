I cannot believe the price of this 27 oz. French Vanilla. This size is equal to three 9 oz. cans which in the stores (Wallmart, Target, etc.) are about<br />$3.15 per can.  This, at the MOST, would make the 27 oz $10.00 ish.  Bulk purchasing is suppose to be cheaper too.  What gives here?<br /> I drink this coffee every day and have looked for this size for years.  Finally  it several months ago at a discount grocery chain for<br />$5.19. Go figure!!  Amazon really stinks on this deal!
