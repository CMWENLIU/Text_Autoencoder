Since every single can arrived dented (unusable), I have no idea how this stuff tastes & am waiting on Amazon as far as returning/replacing it. Their policy is "no returns," but since this arrived as damaged as it did I have to hope they'll fix it. By the way, the box it was shipped in looked fine... the cans within it (shrink wrapped in plastic with an Amazon "ready to ship" sticker) did not. So, the damage clearly happened before they were even boxed up rather than during shipping. The same goes for another case of canned goods I received today and I'm expecting another case tomorrow... hopefully that 1 out of 3 will be usable. These cans should have been checked prior to being boxed up for shipping, though, and that is Amazon's fault.
