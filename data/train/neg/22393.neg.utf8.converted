I am one of the very upset customers who used to LOVE these energy bars! They were the best on the market and I would go through several boxes in couple of months. It is almost impossible to find great tasting and healthy snack bar that has only 162 cal., but my last order was a big surprise! Jump from 162 to 240, much more fat and carbs- WHY? The company should really think twice before such a drastic change without warning!<br /><br />I am truly hoping they will go back to the original version and if you have the same opinion please call the number on the package and let them know!<br /><br />Thank you
