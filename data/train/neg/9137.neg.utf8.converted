My dog is finally on to me. She's long given up PB on her pills, and has learned to spit out her pills that are wrapped in nitrite free deli meat, causing me to waste quite a bit before she gets it down.<br /><br />Looking for a cheaper alternative, these seem great, but the ingredients are not conducive for optimal health, especially a dog in our situation that has cancer.<br /><br />wheat flour, corn syrup, wheat gluten, vegetable oil should not be on the consumption list for a sick dog, let alone one for cancer. Sadly, my search goes on.<br /><br />Chicken, glycerin, wheat flour, natural flavors, dried corn syrup, corn flour, wheat gluten, chicken liver meal, vegetable oil, lecithin, brewer's dried yeast, potassium sorbate (to preserve freshness), methylcellulose, ascorbic acid (source of vitamin C), mixed tocopherols, vitamin E supplement.
