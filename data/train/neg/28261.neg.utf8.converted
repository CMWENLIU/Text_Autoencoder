After a careful review of the Amazon page, I could find NO mention of mineral oil as the first ingredient in this product.  I do not use mineral oil on my hair, thus I will not be using this product on my hair.<br /><br />While the ingredients listed on the Amazon page sound good (i.e., "a rich blend of shea butter and natural oils, including vitamin E, sunflower, coconut, almond, soybean, argan, and palm"), mineral oil is the main, unlisted, ingredient.  If you want mineral oil for your hair, it's easy to run down to the local pharmacy and pick up a bottle.<br /><br />Not for me!
