Although labeled as 'naturally flavored sparkling mountain spring water', this product lists no fewer than 17 other ingredients beside water. Some of those ingredients seem decidedly suspect, and, at the very least, totally unnecessary: food dyes Red #40 and Blue #1.  Various groups and agencies here and abroad have expressed concern about risky side effects from using these dyes in food.  In any event, nothing good can come from them. The list of ingredients also includes two different gums, sucralose, and potassium benzoate, also questioned by consumer groups. I fail to understand why a product being touted as a healthy drink can contain so many weird ingredients.  I hope the company behind "Ice" will respond with an explanation here.  In any event, I won't be ordering "Ice" again unless it is entirely reformulated to remove the useless items.
