After reading all the great reviews, I ordered the product. I guess most people just love a very sweet waffle which is why so many people buy those worthless sugarary breakfast cereals. I cannot understand how the product label says 0 grams of sugar and yet, have most of the ingredients being sweeteners. As far as being a healthful product, all you are getting is white flour loaded with sweeteners which is bad for anyone trying to stay away from high glycemic foods, those which flood your blood with glucose and forces a fast insulin rise. Of course, adding syrup just adds to the flames. This product simply gives you lots of empty calories which adds weight. I would suggest the many higher grain mixes that are available and which adds some fiber to your diet and does not give you an insulin rush. By the way, they taste just fine.
