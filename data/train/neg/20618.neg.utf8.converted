I didn't like the thickness or the flavor, compared to another protein powder that I was used (Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Vanilla).  Perhaps this is the nature of all meal replacement shakes--not sure.<br /><br />Easy to use/carry, mixes well (no lumps), and mixes with water (rather than requiring milk)
