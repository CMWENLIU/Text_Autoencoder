"Simply Asia" bought out "A Taste Of Asia" prior to 2006.  Since then the product has been morphing into HIGH fat, HIGH salt, less fiber, and less 'real' ingredients.<br />Here are the stat's from the back of 3 'period' boxes:<br />Original product that I came to love: Total Fat .5g,  Sodium 395mg, d.Fiber 3.5g., sugars 8g(along with only:palm sugar, tamarind juice, soy sauce((soy, salt, sugar)), shallot, pickled radish, garlic, soybean oil, salt, chili powder).<br />2006 new mfg. box: Total Fat 1g, Sodium 720 mg, d. Fiber 2g, Sugars 20g.,<br />2008 box: Total Fat 3.5g, Sodium 1010mg, d. Fiber 1g, Sugars 20g.,<br />SO WE NOW HAVE 7X THE FAT, OVER 2.5X THE SALT, 2.5X SUGAR & ONLY ABOUT 1/4 THE FIBER.<br />I will no longer buy this product, and will choose noodles and a ethnic jar sauce separately.  Even if you don't have a prolbem eating higher salt, fat, and sugar, please know that they are tools used to stimulate your appetite, which drives up obesity in the long run, and may not be just added to save the mfg. money. It's a double-win for them.
