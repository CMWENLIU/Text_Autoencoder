One of the favorite places that I frequent when we can afford a nice meal is the The Pungent Moon in Trenton. Besides their steaks and macadamia-encrusted tilapia, one of the best things about the place is the heavenly coffee they serve with their fine desserts. The coffee is actually one of the main reasons we go.<br /><br />But one night we were there enjoying a meal and we asked for coffee with dessert and we got served this rancid stuff. I almost spit out my first sip all over the table and had to run to the bathroom because I was gagging. I made it back to the table (barely) and asked the waiter what in the wide world of sports happened to the coffee.<br /><br />He said that they were filming a television commercial for Folger's and they were secretly replacing their coffee with Folger's to film people's reactions to the coffee switch. Needless to say I didn't get to be in the commercial. It wouldn't have been very savvy marketing for Folger's to show some guy gagging and making a beeline for the bathroom after tasting their coffee.<br /><br />I don't know where they got those people in the commercials to rave about the coffee because there wasn't anyone in the restaurant doing it. Most people didn't have my reaction but a lot of them were making faces like they'd just smelled a dead octopus. It was a dirty trick. You'd think Folger's would have bagged this idea for a commercial seeing people's reactions but I guess they found some schmo to say he liked it. Someone wanting to be on TV, go figure.
