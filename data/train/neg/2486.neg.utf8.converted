So, what happens when Coca-Cola gets involved in a perfectly good all natural tasting drink with all natural ingredients and no big plastic waste? It gets industrialized of course! This tastes like some number crunchers worked on lowering the price per unit to boost the profit margin and marketers worked on bottle material and bottle shape with a test group until it scored a good percentile and voila, you get a processed liquid in a plastic bottle. One of their biggest problems with all of this was that their original customers' palates had only experienced pure CW, so we all knew better. We were used to the good stuff and then our dealer got greedy and cut our coke, I mean our coconut water, and they lost alot of buyers to others dealing the pure stuff. Now I buy ZICO in the 33.8oz tetrapacks. It's the pure stuff.<br /><br />Knowing that ZICO sometimes reads these reviews I'm wondering out loud here if someone inside ZICO, with a sense of taste, just HAS to be saying "I told you so" ever since this version was released. If so many customers hate it you just know that someone inside ZICO must have hated it too. Whoever that discerning person is has since been acknowledged I'm sure...
