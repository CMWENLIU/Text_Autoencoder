These cherries are very tasty, but the organic part is the apple juice they are sweetened with, not the cherries. You would not know this  looking at the label.  For this I give it one star for misleading labeling. Cherries are a fruit typically found to be extremely high in pesticides.  I don't want to give inorganic cherries to my family.
