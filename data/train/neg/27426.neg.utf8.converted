After scanning the shelves of grocerie stores for the last 10 yrs I finally decided to order a can online. Better than starbucks. Howard Schultz is a scum bag for selling our basketball team. Better coffee and dont have to give my money to a scumbag. Thats a WIN WIN situation.---------------------Backstabber!<br /><br />I should have recieved and tested it first. This coffee was terrible. Must have been a different roast than what I had years ago. oops sorry. I guess starbucks will remain a guilty pleasure.
