My daughter and I are on low carb diets.  She purchased this product as an alternative to peanut butter.  Don't make the same mistake.  It is unfortunate we cannot assign a negative number of stars.  She sadly bought the Peanut Butter Raisin variety as well.  I hate raisins, and I'm not stupid, so I didn't make the mistake of trying that one.<br /><br />This jar of congealed chemical matter is, by far, the most disgusting thing to ever have passed my lips.  On the plus side, it has no carbs, no calories, no fat, but it also has no protein, peanuts, or nutritional value of any kind.  It does have sodium.  I can only describe it as peanut flavored fluff.  No, not fluff, more like the gel-like substance in an air freshener.  I don't know what's worse, the flavor or the consistency.  To be labelled Walden Farms is purely scandalous.  It indicates to me that some ingredient within was perhaps in the vicinity of an actual farm.<br /><br />The most positive thing I can say about this is, it will be fun to see the expressions on our friends' faces when we get them to taste it.
