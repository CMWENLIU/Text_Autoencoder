Product is fantastic, a delicious and healthful snack. BUT read the description carefully - even though it sounds like you will be getting a box with 7 packs in it you will only receive ONE pack. This happened to me with this item in another size (ad offered 12 cannisters sold as one pack - I got one cannister of almonds for $20.86). Contacted Plexsupply and told them I felt that either there had been a mistake or their ad was misleading - A $20 order and they only offered a $5 refund. Thankfully, Amazon refunded my purchase in full and I see that particular item is no longer listed. If you buy these, verify the quantity first. Better yet, buy them from a different vendor on Amazon.
