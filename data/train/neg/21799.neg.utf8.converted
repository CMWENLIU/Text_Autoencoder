During a scooter tour of the southwest (Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizon), a group of us decided to try one of the 5 hour energy drinks (I think I had the Berry 1.93 ounce, regular strength).  I have to say that I was one of the unfortunate few folks who experienced side effects so dramatic (extreme heart rhythm interruption, loss of vision, numbness in the arms and hands, etc.) that I will never try one of these drinks ever again.  The impacts to my heart (I typically have great blood pressure and heart rate from years of exercise and road bike racing/riding) were so over the top that I had no patterned rhythm and I ended up in the emergency room after passing out from a huge drop in blood pressure.  My vision became blurry and eventually tunneled, and the EMT squad who responded to the 911 call (we initially thought I was having a heart attack) could not get any regular heart beat for about 15 minutes (and this took four baby aspirin and a nitro pill).<br /><br />Interestingly enough, other members of our group who also tried the 5 hour energy drink experienced a nice rush of energy and felt great, others in the group basically stated that the mixture tasted like dirty water and had absolutely no effect whatsoever.  I guess this basically tells me that the ingredients (at least for this brand of energy drink supplement) really react differently for everyone.  I did notice that the drink provides a warning about not consuming more than two in a specific period of time.  For me at least, the bad reaction was enough to warn me away from trying these ever again.
