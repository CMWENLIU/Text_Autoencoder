The new Sweethearts are here.<br /><br />Yellow is now lemon instead of banana.<br /><br />Green is now apple instead of lime.<br /><br />There is no white heart.<br /><br />The pink one, formerly cherry, is now strawberry.<br /><br />The purple one almost tastes like the old one (medicine), but not exactly.<br /><br />There is a blue one and it tastes like chemicals.<br /><br />The taste for all of the flavors ranges from 'soap-like' to 'chemical-infused'.<br /><br />Why mess with a classic?  Nothing was wrong with the old flavors, but this new candy is too horrible to eat.  I could not finish the bag.
