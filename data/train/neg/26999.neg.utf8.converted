I purchased a box that was not a double pack at a different store entirely and the crackers taste like they're made of burnt toast scrapings.<br />Ever had toast and had it charred in places? Ever not scraped the burnt bits off?<br />These crackers taste like that.<br />Not even Nutella made them edible and I threw away the entire box because I just cannot figure out a way to make these even the slightest bit palatable. Too bad too, I wanted to like these and have a great gluten-free crunchy cracker!
