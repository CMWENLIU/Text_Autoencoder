This product is aweful and if I could, I would give it NO stars.  Big Train Chocolate Mint syrup takes no more like chocolate mint then say...motor oil.  It smells aweful and tastes even worse.  The initial out of bottle smell actually reminded me of alcohol/liquor.  The syrup is a complete and total disappoinment as well as a waste of money.  Amazon should be ashamed to sell this product.
