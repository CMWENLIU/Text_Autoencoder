I don't know if the people giving this product rave reviews have had little exposure to other coffees or what but this is not the best coffee. I am disappointed in the aroma and flavor, I have had much better ground coffees right off of the grocer's shelf. Now I'm stuck with a 32 ounce bag of coffee beans I don't enjoy. I wish I had listened to the negative reviews. Live and learn.
