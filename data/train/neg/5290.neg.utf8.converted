I can't wait to finish the bottle of this so I can rid my pantry of it. Of the 4 flavors I've tried - coconut, mango, caramel and hazelnut this one tasted the worst. Coconut is probably the best, in terms of delivering a good flavor with minimal after taste. I have been using this in tea primarily.
