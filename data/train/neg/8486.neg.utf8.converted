it's so unique getting the scoby that it's not even in the packaging and i don't care what the reason is. you can't show a picture and then the product that<br />i'm paying money for isn't in the packaging. i came to my senses since you can by a scoby for how much? i like to be fooled and maybe you do too. so please go<br />blow 45 dollars on a glass jar to then be told of some free claim for a scoby. no thanks.
