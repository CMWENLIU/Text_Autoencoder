Unlike the other "Think!" products, this one is smaller, has a bland taste, and has a partial sugar coating. This is the first product I've bought from them that I regret purchasing. It's particularly disappointing since the company is supposedly using this product to raise money for cancer research. If you're going to sell one of your products to benefit people with cancer, it's adding insult to injury to choose one of your worst products.
