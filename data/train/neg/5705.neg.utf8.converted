I don't know how anybody can say this tastes even at all close to starbucks white mocha sauce. It has a really bad artificial after taste and is not rich and buttery like starbucks white mocha. My husband and I both drank this equally and he agreed that it was not worth a second purchase. If you really want a good white mocha, go with the ghiradelli sweet ground white chocolate powder. Now that is fabulous and tastes exactly like a starbucks white mocha. This torani white chocolate sauce is just plain bad, we had to almost plug our noses to get it down.
