I am on a mini mission to tell people how horrid this Newman's con Queso tastes- we just threw it out.  Don't buy it.  I'm not sure what it's made if, but it ain't cheese folks.  How could a guy that I've always respected put his name on something so awful with proceeds going to charity?  Hello- you have little proceeds with products like this!  I am hoping that this product is an aberration and not the norm.<br />We did not buy this on amazon (where I frequently shop), but here's a forum where people who care can ensure others of their experiences- just sayin'.
