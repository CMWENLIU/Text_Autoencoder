It's tough to review a food product since we all have different taste preferences.  So, I focused on how this compares to Splenda since it is made by the same company. I use Splenda exclusively, as a way to control caloric intake.  I like the "taste", and find it comparably sweet to sugar without an aftertaste (such as Equal and Sweet N Low have for me). Most importantly, I use Splenda because it has no aspartame, which I am allergic to.<br /><br />Nectresse also has no aspartame, but unfortunately, I found it to have an odd and very noticeable taste.  I'm not sure if this is the monk fruit, or the molasses, but it is distinct.  It was unpleasant and downright wrong in iced tea (I dumped a glass made with it), so I decided to try it in plain Greek yogurt. I normally add 2 Splenda packets and a scoop of sugar free jelly to my yogurt; I did the same with the Nectresse.  The odd flavor was still noticeable, though not unpleasant with the jelly - just different.  However, I also found that it wasn't as sweet.  I think another reviewer may be right - this is more "fruit" sweet, with a hint of tartness, than "sugar" sweet.  The Nectresse comes in thicker, foil-lined packets like the Splenda Essentials do. I find these inconvenient.  You can't easily shake the product to the bottom of the bag to open, and it's not as easily opened either.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't bad, per se, and could be an alternative for those who do not like Splenda but need to avoid aspartame.  I would hazard a guess that those who prefer Splenda will not like this.  I will finish the sample package I was sent, as the taste isn't as off-putting in fruit based items like herbal tea or yogurt.  But, I wouldn't buy this, regardless of the price.
