I was excited to try it and assumed it would be REALLY GOOD! WOW! Was I wrong! It is INSANELY overpriced and tastes SO AMAZINGLY NASTY! Who in their right mind would put this DISCUSTING stuff on the market! It's not the color that bothers me, as one review suggested, BC it tastes exactly the same when blindfolded! We did a blindfold taste test and EVERYONE identified the NASTY metallic flavor-like chewing or sucking on dirty change! It is NOT thirst quenching at all AND to top it off the whole alkaline gimmick is ridiculous! I'm a scientist! I knew that buying it, but I thought it might be a tasty water drink like other tasty water drinks! NO WAY! STAY AWAY! BLK is FOUL!!!!!!!!! REALLY FOUL! Didn't anyone taste it before putting on the market?????? I wouldn't give this to even my least favorite person to drink, as NO HUMAN deserves being subjected to BLK! RUN AWAY FAST!
