As you might expect from the world's most annoying athlete, another awful ad campaign.  Disgusting.  "Sell out" is probably one of the most overused phrases of the past 20 years, but despite this, Mr. White still continues to find new and creative ways to ruin his credibility and appear more and more like some sort of bizarre caricature of his own fame.  Maybe Sal Masakela will chew whitemint; count me out.
