I bought this for my 10 year old cat because it was listed on all of the consumer reports as the best and most natural litter you could buy.  Yeah.  Well apparently a great deal of cats are allergic to the oils in pine.  So what happens?  They stop eating, stop drinking water and stop pooping.  I am very worried my cat will now suffer lifelong kidney issues due to this.  It isn't just me either.  Since this happened I have talked to several other people, including my Vet who say this is a common occurrence and that Feline Pine is the worst thing you can do for your cat.  If you are anything like me you love your cat and you try to do right by her.  SO AVOID THIS PRODUCT.
