I saw all the negative reviews but decided to try this bread anyway.  When you first get it, it looks great.  It's soft and smells good.  It behaves as slightly thicker white bread.  However, once you go to eat it, the problems begin.  It absorbs all moisture in your mouth and is so tough that it's like eating meat.  You can hardly tear the crust with your teeth, and then you end up with what feels like a sponge in your mouth.  It takes forever to chew it, the whole time it's tasting worse and worse.  When you finally swallow it, it's like you ate a cue ball.  I had to drink water while chewing multiple times just to keep from choking.<br />I would definitely not recommend this bread, and instead would recommend one of the Health Express breads.  I got both on the same shipment and it was definitely the winner compared to this bread.
