I found the pasta to be not taste as well as other brands I have tried such as Schar.  The taste of the pasta altered the taste of my mac and cheese  so much my kids and I noticed a big difference. Normally my family can not tell a dish is gluten free when I have used other brands.  The dogs enjoyed it!  live and learn.
