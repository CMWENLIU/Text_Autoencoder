While brewing, this coffee smells wonderful.  But it is the weakest coffee I've ever tasted that was made by me.  I prefer a medium to strong cup of coffee and so put in the same amount of this coffee that I do for other coffee.  First pot was like drinking water.  For the second pot, I doubled the amount of coffee I had put in for the first pot and it was still too weak.<br /><br />I'll try mixing it with a stronger coffee, but I fear I'll just have to throw this coffee away.<br />Stay away from this brand if you like your coffee to taste like coffee.
