I wish I had read the description a little more carefully, though I'm still not sure I would have gotten it--I received a bunch of packs in the mail, but the picture makes it seem like there will be variety. No, I got a bunch of packs of the same food--maybe one for kittens, but the rest were the same flavor. Well, I have one cat. I don't need seven "trial" packs. I need one. I was hoping for seven different flavors or types. It was disappointing. Maybe the description could be a little clearer; I'm just not sure why anyone would need seven bags of a trial! In any case, I ended up just taking all of them to an animal shelter, and they were happy to have 'em.
