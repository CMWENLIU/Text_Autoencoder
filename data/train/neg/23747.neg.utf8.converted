These are VERY dangerous for your dog.  When eaten, these bones become very chewy and sticky and act like glue.  Luckily I was supervising my dog with this treat because she started gagging suddenly and had a handful size ball of sticky chewed busy bone stuck to the top of her mouth and she was trying to remove it with her tongue and was gasping for air also.  I immediately dislodged the chunk from the roof of her mouth with my finger but I shudder to think about what could happen if you take your eye off of your dog when he/she is eating one of these.  The overall sticky consistency when chewed is very hazardous and could cause your dog to choke very quickly.  I would recommend supervision at the least or don't even risk the chances of harming your baby with these horrible bones.  Yes they taste great to the dog but it's not worth it IMO.  If I helped 1 dog owner that is wonderful.  Thanks for reading.
