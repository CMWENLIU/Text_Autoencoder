There's a problem that the cans of "WHOLE segment mandarin oranges" advertised ARE NOT what arrives. Cans of SEGMENTS arrive AND the ingredients list BROKEN segments. To add insult to injury over half of the case of cans are dented. It looks as though they came packed from the factory TO AMAZON that way. The boxes from neither AMAZON nor the vendor were beat up.<br /><br />AMAZON Customer Service sent out a replacement overnight, replacement had the same problems. Called Customer Service so the situation can be corrected at the source.<br /><br />I do not use dented cans.
