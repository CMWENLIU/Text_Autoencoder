Unless you are very gullible and easily conned into trying something new based on false advertising claims you won't even bother to try this fancy bottled water with black plant scum added to it. Listen...<br /><br />"So, black water marketers have taken the sciencey angle to target the new age and organic folks and the alternative medicine subscribers. All bases covered! But wait, they also appeal to real housewives. Jacqueline Laurita on Real Housewives of New Jersey says, "Scientists called it [fulvic acid] the miracle molecule because it's so small." She added that drinking blk. water would make your hair, nails, and skin glow and could also help with hangovers. Wow! I bet it cleans my car too. What doesn't it do?<br /><br />Black water has a dark side, for sure. It's a gimmick. Once you learn the sales pitch used to market useless dietary supplements or overpriced, overhyped food stuffs, you can begin to understand sciencey market-speak pretty easily. There is much of it in the organic aisle of the supermarket.<br /><br />I can't conclude that any of us needs fulvic/humic acid supplements, and there currently is no evidence I have found to support that the "miracle" fulvic acid does anything to benefit your health. I would predict that the oddness of the black water products and the price, combined with no observable benefits to the consumer, will likely result in this fad fading away. But give them a prize for their stylish, sciencey black marketing."
