First off, I realize slim jim groups all their reviews together. I dont have a problem with their other products just specifically this slim jim flavor, Zesty Garlic.<br /><br />To begin, I absolutely love garlic and put it on literally everything I eat. I also love slim jims. So I figured why not order a box of these! Fast forward a week when the box arrives I eagerly open one of these bad boys to see how it tastes. My initial and only reaction was absolute disgust. For lack of a better words, these slim jims taste like feet. More specifically, feet with a slight tinge of garlic. I wasn't able to take another bite, not to mention the small piece I had left my breath smelling like dead fish.<br /><br />I'm hard pressed to believe that anyone at slim jim HQ had actually tasted these before putting them on store shelves and online. Now I have 17 sticks left, and I honestly wouldn't even dream about giving these to my worse enemy.<br /><br />All in all, I've done many stupid things in my life. But, spending 40 bucks on a box of feet jerky definitely ranks as top 3.
