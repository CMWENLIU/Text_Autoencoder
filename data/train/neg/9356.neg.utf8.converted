I sent this as a gift for someone away for a week for the holidays.  I paid EXTRA for it to arrive on Dec 26th. That's strange in itself. They sent it on the 23rd and it sat out for three days until the person arrived on the 26th! Then they could not ship a new one till the 30th when the person was coming home.  Terrible customer service. Beware as a gift!
