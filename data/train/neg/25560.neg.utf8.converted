I read some reviews about this tasting better than Suchard and was excited to try this. What a DISAPPOINTMENT! it was weak, some of the syrup sticks in the disc, it did not have a good taste in my opinion. Also as previously stated the portion is very small. I ended up doubling the amt and adding in milk discs and needless to say it ended up one expensive drink. I'm sticking with the Suchard which is pretty darn good.
