My first Amazon preview AND how strongly NEGATIVE i feel about manufacturer deception.<br />The claim that each cannister has 50g of coffee is pure fiction and is actually more like 25g if not less!Upon opening my first can the coffee was way below the halfway mark, and the second... In effect I got less than 25g of coffee.The fact that no one has called the maker out on this fiction really surprises me and I intend to correct this anomaly.After buying this item, I wanted to buy the "Africafe Instant Coffee Large Tin - 250 Grams" (it was already in my cart) but due to this deception I would advise anyone to not buy this product.<br />Since I opened two tins, in all good conscience I will not return the items: but by the same token I will not buy this item again. one star or less for manufacturer peddling fiction.
