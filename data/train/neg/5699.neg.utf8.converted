I was so excited to try this "healthy" fruit beverage and couldn't believe it when I looked at the nutritional information about it--SUGAR!  EEEEK!  While this is probably better for you than a sugary soda would be, it's definitely not the epitome of healthiness for your beverage choices out there.  Why include any sugar at all in it when we have such health ailments as obesity, diabetes, and the like all linked directly with sugar consumption.  It's a nice try, but remove the sugar and it's probably gonna be okay.
