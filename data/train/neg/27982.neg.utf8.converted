I'm sorry to say that what I thought was a phenomenal deal was a misleading item description. I thought the price was too good to be true, but possibly they were on clearance, so I double checked the description which said "48 pieces in a display box"<br />Apparently to this seller that means 1 individual lollipop. I was willing to pay the high shipping because i thought two large boxes would be coming, instead a 5x7 padded envelope shipped for !$7.49! Ridiculous!<br /><br />Description as in listing<br />:<br />Product Features<br />Chewy Caramel coated Green Apple Lollipops.<br />48 pcs in a display box.<br /><br />Seller please provide better information in your listings in the future. Can I get a full refund including shipping????
