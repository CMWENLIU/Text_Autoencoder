I agree completely with the previous reviewer--this licorice does not even come close to the usual quality of<br /><br />Haribo candy.  This stuff is dry and hard, and it leaves your hands sticky with waxy grease.  And the flavor--what little there is--is just weird: kind of a fake floral.  NOT recommended!
