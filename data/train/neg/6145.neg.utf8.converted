I normally don't write reviews, but do read them because I value others opinions.<br /><br />This product was pretty consistently recommended, and I have a different view and felt like others might like to know it.<br /><br />I am a pretty avid Greens First user, but I am also open to trying other products that have the same benefits at a cost savings, and so that is what I was looking for.<br /><br />Overall, the product is okay and comparable in nutritional value.  However, this product has little taste!  I guess that is good compared to some green products, but compared to Greens First this is not a pleasant experience.  Greens First actually makes me look forward to my greens each day.  Those that thought this product tasted good and was minty should try Greens First if they want a real taste treat.<br /><br />For me, this product just didn't cut it.  I immediately dropped my subscription after my first can.
