It's been a few months since I've had Kona K-cups so I figured I'd get a refill. As others have mentioned, Kona coffee is the least acidic blend of them all and the flavor is great.  I placed the order at almost $1 a cup and when I opened it, the package says 10% Kona Coffee Blend.<br /><br />WHAT?!?!<br /><br />Look, I get that Kona beans are hard to get these days and the demand for coffee globally is up.  However, if you're only going to sell 10% of this cup as Kona beans, then either make that knowledge public, and up front, or lower the price of these cups back down to 60 cents a cup. Don't make us pay a premium for only a hint of the beans.
