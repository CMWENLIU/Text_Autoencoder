Beware buyer... 1 star is 1 too many. You cannot return this item, so when I received my package, the shipping box will filled with ground coffee, inside the plastic bag that held the 3 bags of coffee also had ground coffee in it, and for the bags of coffee itself?  There was more coffee in the shipping box and plastic bag than in the 3 coffee bags themselves. You can't return this item, so you are stuck with a mess and to rub insult into injury...it's Mid February and the expiration date is May 12, 2012.
