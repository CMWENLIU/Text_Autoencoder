I've tried this and tried the similar product by Nestle, and this one just doesn't dissolve well, it leaves big lumpy clumps along the inside of the cup as you drink it, and too much sediment in the bottom. I was pretty sad I ordered this and happy to go back to the Nestle version, which I drink every day.
