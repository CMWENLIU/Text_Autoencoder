Just would like all parents to look carefully at the ingredients of skippy. Don't be fooled by the marketing or the bright colors on it. Read the ingredients. Roasted Peanuts, Sugar, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oils (Cottonseed, Soybean and Rapeseed) to Prevent Separation, Salt. Sugar is the #2 ingredient in this stuff! Cottonseed oil??? The seed oils aren't even in their natural state: they are hydrogenated which means that they are the equivalent of saturated fats (not polyunsaturated which one could argue might be beneficial). Can you say heart attack in a bottle? Before you go saying this is "Great for kids" think about whether you really want your kids or family eating this crap. Maybe it's cheap, but the doctor bills down the road won't be.
