If you have a Bunn single cup coffee maker that uses the Senseo coffee pods don't buy this.  It's way too big and no amount of trimming will make it small enough.  I read the part about it not fitting other machines but assumed that was written back before there were copycat machines.  The Bunn uses the Senseo pods and they fit quite well.  It would help if the description gave the dimensions of the product instead of the packaging.
