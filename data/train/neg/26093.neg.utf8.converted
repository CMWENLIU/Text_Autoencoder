This bully stick that I had purchased was listed at 36".  I had bought 15 of them and not one of them where that length. The "mondo" tiltle would not be accurate either, the sticks were very thin. I have a great dane and he went through the first stick I gave him in an hour.<br />I had purchased bully sticks from the web site valuepetsupplies.com that were also 36", and the sticks were all that length or longer. The sticks were thick and the quality was far better than the Merrick. The company sells grass fed beef bullies and it is a family run business. It was also cheaper and FREE shipping as opposed to Amazon which was not. So, better elsewhere.
