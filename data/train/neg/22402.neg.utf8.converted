I was excited to try this pasta (along with a few other products from the same brand). I opened the box and out came about a dozen grain weevils along with the pasta! DISGUSTING! I don't know where these products are being shipped from but the warehouse must have a pretty serious infestation. I don't think I'll be buying dry food online ever again.
