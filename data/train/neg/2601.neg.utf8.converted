OK, this is a great price on organic vanilla extract, normally it would cost twice, maybe even three times as much.  But, it is not orgainic!  Look carefully at the picture.  The label for the Frontier organic vanilla is red at the top with the word "Organic" written on it.  This bottle has a label that is gold at the top with the words "All Natural" written on it.  The left side of the orgainic bottle has the USDA orgainic seal on it, this bottle does not.  Without the certification seal, a product is not certified organic.  The bubble-wrap that the bottle comes in has a white label with the words "Frontier Organic Fair Trade Certified Vanilla Extract", on it, but anyone can make one of those.  Since Amazon refuses to refund my money, not because I am late, but because for some undisclosed reason this vanilla is "not eligable" for return, I am stuck with it.  Don't let this happen to you!!!!
