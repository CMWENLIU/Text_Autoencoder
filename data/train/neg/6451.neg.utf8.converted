This coffee has a very bad, bitter after-taste.<br /><br />It's not really bold per se, either.  It's basically a morning blend light roast, but just made too strong.  A bold ought to be a darker roast in my opinion.  This coffee is for people who have lost their sense of taste.<br /><br />I feel bad throwing this coffee out, but once I tasted the Newman's organic decaf (smooth and tasty), I can't go back. The only hope for this coffee is that it will compost.
