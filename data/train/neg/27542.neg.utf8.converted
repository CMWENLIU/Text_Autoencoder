I used to happily feed these to my pugs, but the last time I found a dime-sized metal shard in the bag.<br />I was very disappointed because my dogs loved these treats.  I will be switching brands.<br />I emailed Merrick customer service, including photos, but they refused to contact me.  I have filed a report with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)<br />I'm not one of those crazy people who wastes time filing reports (I have never done that before) & writing negative reviews for no reason.  I am very concerned with the health & well-being of animals (especially my own) & I believe this product poses a threat.
