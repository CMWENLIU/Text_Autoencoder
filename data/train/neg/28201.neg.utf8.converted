One of my dogs has allergies and can't have any food or treats containing meat products.  So I thought purchasing VeggieDents was a logical choice and bought then on three different occasions.  The 3rd bag not only contained the Chews, it also contained small white WORMS.  That was upsetting enough, but I didn't notice the worms right away and had given my dogs these chews 2 separate times.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer,and Virbac wanted the bag sent to them to do an investigation.  I sent the bag back expecting a response.  No response, but I received a new package of VeggieDents in the mail.  This was over 6 months ago.  I called Virbac on several occasions, but no one knew about the bag of worms and chews.  No investigation either.<br /><br />No more VeggieDents for my dogs!
