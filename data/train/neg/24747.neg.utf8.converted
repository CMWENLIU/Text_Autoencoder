I found these at a local pet store but my cat won't play with them at all. She just stares at them like they are aliens from Mars. Some of the best things in life are free (sort of). Here's a tip to save you some money. Pull the ring off your milk container or orange just container and flip it off the counter and watch your cat go wild! My cat loves 'milk rings'. Her all time favorite toy above anything I have purchased that is an actual 'cat toy'. We have them all over the house.  Bottles of vinegar have a nice wide loop to pull off too. My kitty loves them because they fit so well under anything she can bat them under (like the furniture or the refrigerator).
