I thought this Hormel's Compleats Beef Pot Roast was just awful.  The meat was dry and tasteless.  And the potatoes and carrots were just as tasteless.  So far, the only Hormel Compleats I thought had any redeeming qualities was the chicken and stuffing or potatoes.  I will NEVER buy any of the others ever again.  Not only do they contain ingredients that are down right BAD for everyone but they are just disgusting to try to eat.  Again....I gave my remaining units to the local food bank but I did feel bad about doing that.  DO NOT buy these...they are just too awful to fully describe....ughhhhhhh!!!
