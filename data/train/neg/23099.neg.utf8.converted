How can the manufacturers, whoever they are, be so proud of this product when it is teeming with MONSANTO'S GMO's corn and soy?  These foods are unlabeled and untested, harm the environment and cause food allergies, among other things.  They could use organic and feel proud and not add to the guinea pig food experiment going on in this country with these GMO's.<br />GO ORGANIC OR DON'T SHOW UP IN MY KITCHEN!!  The Hari Krishnas should be ashamed of themselves!
