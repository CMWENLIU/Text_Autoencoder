So far my dog wont even touch this. I bought her the cheese and bacon bone and the peanut butter and she isnt giving them the time of day. If she changes her mind i will edit this to let everyone know. Also, these smell really gross and fake. Im kind of happy she doesnt like them as of now because of that.
