I'm not sure of the intended age range of this product, but I've seen similar products marketed as baby food and figured that this product, having no added sugars, was essentially the same thing. I gave some to my infant (who has been eating solids for about 3 months now and was formerly introduced to all ingredients individually) and he was loving it and I was also enjoying the convience of the product until I noticed him starting to drool blood! I quickly took the package away and saw that he had some pretty good cuts on his tongue from the sharp edges on the packaging. Ouch!<br /><br />I think this is a great idea for a nutricious convience snack but something definately needs to be done about the sharp edges. Who want's 'paper cuts' on their tongue?
