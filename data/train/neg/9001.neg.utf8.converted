Dont be fooled.  This is only a 16 oz container, but by the looks of the picture it appears to be a gallon.  With that being said, this stuff has absolutly NO TASTE.  Dont waste your money on this junk.  The best flavor I have been able to find is the stuff from Wabash Family Farms, Butter Flavor Topping in the yellow Gallon size container.
