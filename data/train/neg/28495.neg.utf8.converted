I used to think this stuff was the best coffee around. Until I started trying various other brands, and grinding my own.  To which, I came to realize that at best, this stuff is average.<br /><br />Slightly above the canned stuff in the grocery store, thats it.  The other reviewer is right, it is "Nutty" in flavor, so you really need to love nuts or this one will turn you off. Secondly, it is fairly light roasted.  We tend to have more enjoyment from medium-dark to dark roasts.  This one doesn't have enough kick.<br /><br />This is a blend, which isn't really a good thing for coffee freaks. I tend to like beans from specific regions in the world, so blends really mess up my taste enjoyment.  Blends are generally for people that aren't too serious about Coffee.
