White trash, indeed. The Slim Jims of the same size in the canisters were great - salty, dry, chewy - the way I like my pepperoni stick snacks.  These were moister and almost gross.  I'm hoping I can get rid of them when friends come to visit, drink beer, and watch football, but I'm not eating any of these.  Probably just as well.  I won't reorder this box.
