In principle I like lard.  It's rich in mono-unsaturated fat, and the dangers of saturated fat have been greatly overstated and over-hyped -- it may not in fact be harmful at all.  This comes in a neat, tidy package and doesn't need refrigeration, but the problem is that it's been hydrogenated in order to have a nice, firm, even consistency, and hydrogenation can't help but add some trans-fats -- something nobody should be eating at all (barring a few found naturally in fat from ruminant animals, which are very different in structure from those found in hydrogenated fats, and seem to be beneficial to eat).<br /><br />I suspect that the levels of trans-fats here aren't way high -- the hydrogenation is probably just enough to make a firm, consistent product -- but I'd rather avoid them entirely.
