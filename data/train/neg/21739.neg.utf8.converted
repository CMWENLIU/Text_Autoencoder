Have tried many coffee's in this price range, some local, some from amazon and other places.  Read some of the reviews about this and decided to try it.  Did not like it, always had a very bitter taste to it, no matter how I tried to grind it.  I prefer a smooth coffee, as I make it strong to begin with, and this is not it.  If you like to use flavor additives like creamers and such, then this would be fine.  But if you enjoy actually tasting the coffee, there are much better out there for the same price.  I finally have settled on a Kona blend sold on amazon that has given me what I was looking for.  Would not recommend
