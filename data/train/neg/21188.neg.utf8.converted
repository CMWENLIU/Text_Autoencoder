howdy y'all,<br /><br />i've made this bread twice now and i will be giving away the rest of the boxes. [*sigh ...*]<br /><br />it cooks easily and smells wonderful while it cooks. i was dang nigh drooling.  unfortunately the caraway is all that i can taste. STRONG caraway. the comment by another reviewer to add more caraway simply proves that people can be really, REALLY different. [*grin*]<br /><br />made it with vegetable oil once and with olive oil. the olive oil may have changed the flavor but i can't tell thru the vastly overpowering taste of caraway.<br /><br />rated a TWO cuz i was expecting rye with a bit of caraway, not caraway with lots of caraway and a bit of caraway to go with the caraway.<br /><br />if you like LOTS of caraway - as one reviewer seems to - you'll pro'ly like this bread.<br /><br />i wish they made a version with the caraway dialed way back. i rather like rye bread.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee
