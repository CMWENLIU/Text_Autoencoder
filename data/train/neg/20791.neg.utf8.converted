It's hard to believe the 5 star reviews for this cornbread mix.  I should have rated it zero stars.  All I can say is these people must not have ever had good cornbread.  The taste is bad, the texture is worse.  I threw away the pan of cornbread after my husband and I each had a piece. I used the next package (I had bought 3)for turkey dressing and ended up throwing it away.  To prevent the possibility of wasting even more ingredients on another recipe, I just went ahead and threw the last unused package away.
