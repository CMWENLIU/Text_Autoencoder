This item is normally delicious...However, the item was shipped out of date by World Trade..It was stale and oily...I returned both Pub Mix Tubs to Amazon...Amazon's return policy and easy axcess is awesome...I ordered it directly from the company itself later that week (UTZ)...Inquired about the dates on the items and was told (by UTZ)that date is the best sale by date...This date was a month old when rec'd...Not Amazon's fault but, the third party who had it in stock...All dates should be checked before it's sent out to consumers...Good business and common sense...Amazon, you still rock...Not your fault...Thank you
