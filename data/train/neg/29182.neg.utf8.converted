Stevia in the raw contains saccharine, which is most commonly found in Sweet n' Low, which has been linked to bladder cancer..."The actual warning reads:<br />"Use of this product may be hazardous to your health. This product contains saccharin, which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals."<br />Note that this warning was removed in 2000 by the US Congress (not by the FDA) after heavy lobbying by the saccharin industry.<br />Further research was then done on saccharin, because the FDA wished to ban saccharin outright but the food companies fought this (successfully). The National Cancer Institute ran studies in the next 2 years and found that saccharin was indeed connected with bladder cancer. People who drank only 2 cans or more a day of diet soda had an increased risk."<br /><br />Stevia by itself is one of the 'healthiest' low cal sweeteners on the market but when mixed with things like saccharine - I mean you might as well just use sweet n' low. The only pure stevia brand I have found is SweetLeaf Stevia - it is not as delicious and most certainly has a bit of an aftertaste, but I have gotten used to it since I have a blood sugar problem and can't consume sugar. My advice is that unless you physically cannot handle sugar, a small amount of raw sugar is much better for you than all this artificial crap. Just be smart about the stevia bandwagon everyone is jumping on, because pretty much every brand out there is just some other sweetener mixed with stevia and then sold as 'healthy'.
