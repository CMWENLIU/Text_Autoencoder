This product imparted a horribly bitter taste to the beverage I tried it in. The powder tasted bitter also when I tried it alone in order to isolate the culprit--basically to ensure that another ingredient in the beverage or an interaction with another ingredient was not causing the bitterness.  Attempts at exchange or refund were ignored.
