This is absolutely the WORST condensed soup I have ever tasted!  I used it to make another recipe, and as soon as I opened the box, I was disgusted by the smell.  I thought perhaps the "sell by" date had passed, but it had not.  I should have just thrown it away and tried to salvage my recipe some other way, but with GF ingredients, these are expensive "experiements"!  My recipe tasted awful, my whole kitchen smelled like this soup, and I can't get the taste out of my mouth.<br /><br />This product is horrible.  I can't believe it actually made it past their quality assurance dept. and onto the store shelves.<br /><br />If it was possible to give it negative stars, I would!!!!
