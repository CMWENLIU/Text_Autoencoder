Wow, what a complete and utter waste of my dollars.  I bought this along with the caramel frosting packet.<br /><br />Pros:  It did mix well, there was enough space left on top to stir and the powder did dissolve nicely.<br /><br />It was very easy to spread and swirl.<br /><br />Cons:  The texture was almost stringy/rubbery.  The taste was horrific without anything. It tasted like a gooey marshmallow having a bad day.<br /><br />We added the flavoring and it did not help.  The strange texture, flavor and now with the added caramel, it was simply disgusting.<br /><br />While the idea in theory was intriguing, the product failed completely in its execution.
