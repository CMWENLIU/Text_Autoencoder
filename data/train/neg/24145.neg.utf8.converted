There are other fruit in a pouch items that are far superior to Revolution Foods.  This is pretty much high priced applesauce as it is mostly apples.  I like the other brand named after the certain rabbit that has a cotton tail.  Anyway, this is really good and wholesome as there is nothing but fruit, but, it is mostly applesauce and I can get that at the local market for far less.
