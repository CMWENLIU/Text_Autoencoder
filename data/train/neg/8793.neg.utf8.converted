I love real (i.e., English) Heinz baked beans.  However I have to give these a low rating here becuase I just received a case of 12 cans and they were so badly packed they were rattling around in the box.  When I opened the box, 5 of the cans were so badly dented and I will have to throw them away.  One of them was leaking.  I know I could return them but that is too much trouble for $10 worth of baked beans.  I can't find anywhere else on the Amazon site for leaving this kind of feedback for the seller/packer, so I'm leaving it here.<br /><br />I will still love the other 7 undented cans.
