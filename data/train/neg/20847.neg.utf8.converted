The final ingredient on the box is sucralose, but after a serving of this, I'd have thought it was the first ingredient. The first sip is fine, then the sour/bitter aftertase sets in, and completely overwhelmes the tea and spices. If you're not averse to things like Splenda/aspartame/sucralose and all the other names for the chemicals that are fake sugar, then you probably won't object to this. I on the other hand, regret my purchase as a waste of $10. Practically undrinkable.
