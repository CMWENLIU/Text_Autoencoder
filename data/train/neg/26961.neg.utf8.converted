Reading older reviews is a trip down memory lane. This decadent delight WAS a favorite. My wife and I would squirrel this away, hiding it from the amazing sniffer of our 12-year-old daughter, this was a treat we looked forward to with great anticipation. Then sometime several months ago the packaging changed. Well, at least we thought it was JUST the packaging, but to our horror, that was not the case. Ghirardelli tossed aside the recipe of our beloved chocolate and went with a new recipe that was dreadful. Gone was the aroma and texture we'd come to love. And the raspberry seeded filling that gave honor to the oft-disaffected raspberry was just some gooey-jell fake with no tribute to the old favorite as it became nothing more than a distant memory. Suffice it to say that after the weeping and rending of cloth, we won't get fooled again. Bring back the old stuff, Ghirardelli, else we shall turn our passions forever to the Lindt in our pockets!
