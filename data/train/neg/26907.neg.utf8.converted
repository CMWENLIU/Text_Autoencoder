I was so excited to find a processed sugar substitute that I quickly bought a couple varieties of this product. I put it in my morning coffee in place of my splenda and I just could not drink it, I had to toss my coffee out. The aftertaste was just soooo bitter. I tried to combine it with sugar to see if I can take the bitter edge off of it, but to no avail. The aftertaste will take a lot of getting used to if you decide to try this product.
