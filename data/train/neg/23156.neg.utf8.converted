The texture is like jell-o pudding and the flavor might be a poor semblance of a butterscotch-scented magic marker. It's gross. I thought artificial flavor had developed - the Extra gum dessert flavors are remarkably accurate - but Walden Farms evidently doesn't have the same R+D budget as Wrigley.<br /><br />I don't generally mind low-cal alternatives... but this is disgusting.
