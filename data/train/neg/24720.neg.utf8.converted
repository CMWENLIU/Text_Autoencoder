Rather than chocolate with a hint of bacon, this bar tastes like bacon with a hint of chocolate.  It may satisfy rabid bacon addicts, but the flavor of the bacon with the chocolate just doesn't work.  You can taste the greasiness of the bacon through the chocolate, and it's not good. Rather than an aftertaste of chocolate, you get an aftertaste of bacon with chocolate overtones.
