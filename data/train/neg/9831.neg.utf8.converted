After several issues including cracked nipples, poor latch, problems pumping, and a fussy baby I decided to start to ween at 3 weeks. By the time she was 4 weeks old I was down to two nursing sessions a day and supplementing with formula for the rest. Then, as I healed and felt less stress about nursing the whole process got easier so I decided to try to increase my nursing/pumping sessions and decrease her formula intake. Unfortunately, by that point I could only pump 1/4 ounce per breast and she was easily taking in 3 ounces per session with the bottle. I ordered a case of this tea and took the recommended dosage for 2 weeks without success. Then I tried increasing the dose to two bags at a time, 4 times a day. You do have to take the time to steep it corectly (10 minutes, covered). I saw minimal results after increasing the dosage which could have also been attributed to increasing the number of pumping sessions or additional water intake per day rather than the tea. If you're used to herbal teas you probably won't mind the taste too much. It's rather nice with a bit of milk and honey added in. It does smell faintly of black licorice, but I never noticed it in the flavor. After I finished off the case of tea I tried fenugreek capsules and saw a bit better improvement in supply (an additional 2-3 ounces per day). I can now pump about 4-6 ounces a day (up from a total of 2 ounces a day when I first started) while I'm at work and I nurse her at the start of every feeding at home. I still need to supplement with formula since she'll now take in between 4-6 ounces at a time at 3 months old. I wish I was one of the lucky ones to see an increase of 6-8 ounces per feeding/pumping session, but I'm happy that I was able to bring my supply back as much as I have. Now I'm combining Blessed Thistle with Fenugreek to see if I can get any additional output. 15 pills a day has been challenging for me, particularly since I'm not the best at swallowing them. I'm trying to hang on to my supply, as low as it may be, as long as I can though. So, for me it's worth it. Definitely give the tea a try if you're having trouble with supply, but just know that it has such low doses of the herbs that it isn't effective for everyone. If you don't have success with the tea it's worth trying out fenugreek and blessed thistle too.
