<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO">Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla coffee</a> isn't all it's cracked up to be. You can clearly smell the vanilla when you open the bag but..... brewing destroys it<br /><br />After I brewed a pot, Could not smell the vanilla nor taste it. The Vanilla was gone.<br /><br />Save your money. There's no vanilla flavor, just vanilla scent in the coffee grounds fresh out of the bag
