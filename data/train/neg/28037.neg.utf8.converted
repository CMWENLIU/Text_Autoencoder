Say what you will about Vine reviews skewing too much one way or the other, this was just disgusting. The "nutrition" aspects aren't bad--they're not good, either--but the flavor is something that I can't live with. My wife described it as "watered-down [children's drink with a mascot that breaks through walls]", but adding more to the water just made the solution taste more "fake" and unpalatable.<br /><br />If you dig the flavor, though, you'll get some good B vitamins and caffeine, so I guess this would be good for someone on the go that needed a lift.
