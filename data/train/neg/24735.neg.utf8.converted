The ad shows a picture of three packages with the caption "80 bags per pack."  I thought I was buying what was in the picture, three 80-pack boxes.  Silly me.  I should have known it was too good to be true. If I had scrolled down to the product description I would have known it was ONE box.  Oh well, fool me once, shame on me, ....... you know the rest.  BTW, the tea also arrive one day later than my two-day Prime membership promised.
