This honey was quite unlike anything I had experienced before. The flavor had a pervasive bitterness to it, unlike any clover honey I had tasted in the past, and I could only describe it reminiscent of extremely over-brewed tea. It made me cringe. Its odor also had a certain disagreeability about it; there was sweetness, yes, but it was accompanied by a faint chemical smell like that of petroleum.<br /><br />Pieces of honeycomb could be seen suspended throughout the honey, which I suppose at least tells you it is authentic, but they are not very pleasant to bite into... like a sticky yet dry piece of shoe leather---impossible to chew through.<br /><br />Avoid this product.
