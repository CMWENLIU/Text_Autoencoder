These spices are tasty and make for a nice gift. However, this product was not shipped in a gift box but instead as 6 tins packed loose in a padded envelope. I will need to repackage them before giving them as a gift. I also ordered individual tins as other gifts, and the company sent the wrong flavor. After three emails, the last of which was unanswered, I've given up trying to get what I ordered.
