Yes, PoP more than doubled the price of this tea after Dr. Mehmet Oz talked about it's health benefits, but the high-quality Pu-erh teas found elsewhere cost several times more, and for good reason.  Prince of Peace can barely get away with calling this Pu-erh because it is of such low quality.  If you really want to enjoy an exquisite cup of Pu-erh, try the higher quality loose or cake type Pu-erh.  It's a little more work to brew properly but the benefits and superior taste are well worth the cost and your time.  In a pinch, you can brew the tea leaves in a drip coffee maker.  When the brewing stops, carefully lift out the coffee filter with the wet leaves, tie it closed with a piece of string and hang it over the side of the pot so the packet is in the tea.  Steep it for 3 to 5 minutes on the heat plate of the coffee maker.<br /><br />As for the health benefits, I've never experienced such dramatic results so quickly.  The second day after I started drinking a better quality Pu-erh tea my high blood pressure was gone and so was my expensive prescription!  I was absolutely amazed at the fast results and an added benefit is that it is the best tasting tea on the planet.  I have never found any tea that has the natural sweetness of Pu-erh and the exotic, earthy taste is almost intoxicating.  I expected something this healthy to taste awful or, at best, tolerable but the opposite was true.  Some of the other health benefits may take longer to become obvious, but even if my lowered blood pressure is the only benefit that results from drinking this tea, I will be overjoyed.  If you've never tried it, do yourself a favor and shell out the bucks for the high-quality Pu-erh.  If you are drinking it to loose weight or burn fat, try brewing a 6-cup pot using equal parts Pu-erh, white and green teas.  They are all beneficial to your health and will help you attain your weight loss goals faster.  They taste great together too but you can drink them separately if you prefer.  Then drink a cup or two of chickweed tea in the afternoon to help remove the toxins from your colon.<br /><br />I wanted to give this product one star because of the low quality, but since it is Pu-erh and the taste is acceptable, I am giving it two stars.  If you want to try the better quality Pu-erh, buy a package from rishi-tea.com or teagarden.com. I like the option of buying different sized packages of tea offered by rishi-tea.com.  I also recommend the brewing instructions video on YouTube by Doctor Tea.  Try the real deal and you won't mind paying more.
