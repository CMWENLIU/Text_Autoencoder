"New Recipe" turns out to be an imitation of a bad dark chocolate. When I opened the package, I was not struck with the aroma of good bittersweet chocolate. When a piece hit my tongue, it conjured up memories of awful aftertastes of many bad milk and some dark chocolate. The nasty aftertaste never actually materialized. Still, Lindt should be worried.<br /><br />So I looked at the ingredients. First on the list is chocolate, some unknown, pre-made chocolate. Shouldn't the first ingredient be cocoa powder or cocoa something? Lindt started making chocolate in China some time ago. Are they churning out this "New Recipe" with "Made-In-China" chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter and so on? By the way, the 85% cocoa bar's ingredient list also starts with chocolate, followed by cocoa powder, sugar... At least it contains enough cocoa powder to fool me for a while. I suppose it could be worse: Lindt could have substituted partially hydrogenated junk for cocoa butter.<br /><br />I just bought Trader Joe's Swiss 72% cocoa Dark Chocolate for $1.99. It smells and tastes right for me. Its color is just a shade lighter than Lindt 70%. Ingredients: cocoa mass, sugar, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, Madagascar vanilla. I can see myself sticking with this one until something better shows up or returns.
