Dehydration is the process of removing water.  Thus, it is impossible to have dehydrated water.  The directions say to dissolve the capsule in a bowl of hot water.  Why not just drink the bowl of water and not waste your money on the worthless capsule.  I can't believe that Amazon even allows this to be sold on their website.
