Just an FYI for the doglovers out there.....per my Vet, each of these chew-sticks has 300 calories each.  That is probably why she called my dogs "obese" on their last check-up.  You'd never know that because nutritional info is not put on the bags like human food....there are much lower-calorie chew sticks out there and they do put their calorie count on the bag (the new ones I buy are 19 calories each....BIG DIFFERENCE)<br /><br />The boys have lost 3 pound each since we dropped the Dentastix a day habit!
