This product isn't that impressive as far as taste goes. Yes, it'll do what you need it to do for drop flowers, shells, rosettes, etc. But you could just as easily buy meringue powder (dried egg whites) at the supermarket and add it to a regular can of store icing or even homemade buttercream for a much better taste. If taking a Wilton coure, they try to sell you their entire catalog of products, which would explain why this is recommended for the class. It tastes like Crisco-y vanilla. I'd be embarrassed to use this on a cake or cupcakes that I am serving to people. It's really not a pleasant taste.<br /><br />If you do want to buy this for a Wilton course or another reason, buy it at Michaels, AC Moore, or a local baking supply store. I love Amazon--really, I do. But this is listed at nearly $9.00 here. At Michaels it's less than $4.00 (use a coupon and it's a little more than half that). At a local baking supply store, it was $3.29 plus tax. I have no clue why this is so ridiculously overpriced here, and I'm annoyed I actually could have bought two or three at Michaels for the price of ONE here.
