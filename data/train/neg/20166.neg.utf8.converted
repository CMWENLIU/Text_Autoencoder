If you read the ingredients it is not JUST Monk Fruit.  The first ingredient is Erythritol then SUGAR!  TOTALLY misleading.  Also if you google this product you will learn all the side effects.  Better to use something that is REALLY natural.  The clue about this product is that the makers of toxic Splenda are behind it.
