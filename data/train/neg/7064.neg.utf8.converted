I'm of Asian descent, a serious tea drinker, and a big fan of anything citrus.  I wanted so badly to like this tea.  I bought a single box on sale from my local grocery store to try out first, as I didn't want to commit to a whole case from Amazon right away.  Boy, am I glad I did.  We try to choose organic whenever possible, but this tea has the overpowering aroma of lemon Pine Sol. My coworkers are laughing and concurring as we speak.  One down, seventeen tea bags left to go... Maybe I'll save it for the next time one of us comes down with a cold.
