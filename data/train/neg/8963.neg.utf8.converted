I'd keep these on hand for emergency food prep only, the exact situation we faced (snowed in, couldn't get to store). Luckily, we still had power during the snowstorm so we made the product as instructed.<br /><br />One tip here: remember that microwave ovens all cook at different temps and speeds, adjust cooking time accordingly. This should be gooey and not hard as a rock. We had two packages and had to test one before finding the right cooking time.<br /><br />The taste: Totally disappointing. While we all wanted a sweet treat, this barely met our needs, providing only calories and some energy, making me qualify it as suitable for "emergencies only". As far as providing a taste of sweetness, yes, this was fine. However, it fell far short of the "warm delight" promised by the cover photo and title. There was a decided hint of preservatives and some unpleasant flavors, creating an unsatisfactory culinary experience. No one expects a microwave mix to be high cuisine but this was barely palatable.<br /><br />We don't have gourmet standards by any means but this was not liked by anyone in the family, although the adults managed to eat our portions. The kids? Forget it.<br /><br />However, although I couldn't find them here, we DID try some mixes during the snowstorm that exceeded our expectations. One was Better Homes and Gardens Chocolate Chip mix. If you can find it, get it. It not only came in a lovely container but included the bonus of a year's subscription to BH & Gardens for only $5.00,  a bargain rate (optional, not required to subscribe to buy mix ). The mix in container cost $5.99 so we felt this was a better use of our money, leaving us with a reusable and microwavable container and tasty cookies for the $5.99. If we wanted, we had a monthly  magazine for another $5.00. You do the math and conduct a taste test and I think you'll agree that "warm delights" aren't so delightful. Just a thought.
