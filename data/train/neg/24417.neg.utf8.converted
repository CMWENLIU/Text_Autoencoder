I looked all over the package before I bought these to see if they were raw or toasted. Since it didn't say "toasted," anywhere, I thought they were raw. They are not! They are toasted and are shriveled and dehydrated because of it! Raw almonds are nutritious and delicious and plump. These are dry and chalky and small; they are wrinkled up like raisins, and are slightly chewy instead of healthfully crunchy.
