My wife is unable to chew gum with cinnamon or mint flavoring. Spry green tea gum is one of the few products that doesn't irritate her mouth. She agrees that the flavor doesn't last long but finds chewing the gum satisfies her desire to much on fattening food.<br /><br />Update: Nov. 2010 - Amazon changed to a new supplier, and the product they shipped was stale.  So, hopefully the supplier and Amazon will make sure they ship the fresh version of this product, not the old leftover stuff.  I change my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars because of this.<br /><br />Update: April 2011 - Our last order is so bad that my wife is going to toss out.  Unchewable is the term she uses.  There is clearly some quality control problem in either the manufacturer, storage, or shipping of this product.  Now my wife is going to try and find an acceptable alternative.  I have changed the rating from 4 stars to 2 stars, although the most recent batch is 1 star.
