I grew up getting jelly rings from the dept store candy counters, but they are increasingly hard to find.  I ordered these hoping they would be the same, but they are not.  These are a dark chocolate (I'm not a fan of dark chocolate), and even taste a little old or stale.  The raspberry filling is not as sweet as I expected either.
