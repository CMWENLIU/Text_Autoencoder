I am having to throw this piece of junk out after having it for just over a year because they won't service it because the warranty is up and there is nobody in my area who can. This is the second time it breaks. The first time they fixed it and made me pay the shipping charges... which ended up to be expensive because I had to buy a box and all the packaging materials too! But now it broke and there is nothing they will do! Terrible product and even worse customer service!
