As of 9/22/2010, this is not yet resolved.  AmericaRX, seller of this item, placed the wrong photograph of this product (it is now a different image).  It took many months for them to give us a shipping label to return the item and they have not given us a refund.  Amazon is not helping us since they said the date is passed the period where they can assist us even though we've called the number multiple times and made many notations on our account.  AmericaRX asked us to "hold on" and "not return our item", they gave us an odd $6 refund, which makes no sense...come to find out, they did this so that the period passed where we could not make a comment on the Seller Feedback. Please spare yourself the pain and pay a few extra dollars to a more honest vendor.<br /><br />Item(s) Subtotal:  $88.98<br />Shipping & Handling:  $17.84<br />  -----<br />Total Before Tax:  $106.82<br />Sales Tax:  $0.00<br />  -----<br />Total for This Shipment:  $106.82<br /><br />ORIGINAL EMAIL TO AMERICARX VIA OUR AMAZON EMAIL ACCOUNT:<br /><br />Return to Sent Items<br />Inquiry from Amazon customer Ailene Michel<br />From: Ailene Michel<br />Sent: Tuesday, March 23, 2010 9:02 AM<br />To: AmericaRx<br /><br />I have not heard from your company since my last email on December 10, 2009.  This is my follow-up email.<br /><br />To re-cap, we received formula that did not match the image of the bottle on your website.  This image is the product that we wanted and expected. This is a very big disappointment as we spent a lot of money on your product and shipping and had to wait a very long time just to find out that it is not the product we wanted.<br /><br />Your company has already apologized and confirmed the incorrect product image and now you are asking us to pay for the shipping on the wrong product that you sent us. This is wrong and unfair.<br /><br />We have requested that Amazon re-open the A-Z Claim.  Before that claim is closed, we will need a FULL REFUND to our account.<br /><br />We DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY WE WERE GIVEN A SIX DOLLAR ($6) CREDIT on our Amazon.com account when we should be receiving a FULL REFUND as well as A SHIPPING LABEL for us to return these incorrect and unwanted products to you.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Ailene
