I added this to my grocery wishlist as an Amazon recommendation which popped up after I had added something else. I really should've taken a minute to look at the product page, or to realize what would happen before it was too late and someone bought this for me:<br /><br />Nearly HALF THE STUFF IN THIS THING HAS PEANUT BUTTER.<br /><br />To which I am deathly allergic.<br /><br />Peanut allergies are fairly common, so why the hell is half of this thing peanut butter crackers? I can see putting 10 packs of peanut butter crackers in here, maybe 12, but TWENTY?! WHY?!<br /><br />Let this be a warning to people with peanut allergies -- AVOID this product. You'll be stuck with a massive pile of crap you can't eat.
