Previous orders for this item just as I can buy at grocery.  Same great quality.  This time the first case arrived with many individual packages open, oatmeal spilled out.  Came in white box instead of red and labeled "not for retail sale" (red boxes do not say this).  Amazon resent another case, with my instructions to not send it if it were the white boxes (there is very little brown sugar/maple flavoring in the packets - unlike red packets).  Amazon sent the white boxes again.  I wrote to them but never heard back about my complaint.<br /><br />I have been ordering from Amazon for some time, but will not order this product again as it is inferior to the real deal.  I'm unhappy with Amazon's customer service for the first time, they dropped the ball on this order.<br /><br />If I could submit with NO STARS I would.
