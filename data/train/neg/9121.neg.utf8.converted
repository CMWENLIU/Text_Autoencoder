This is a collection of 6 "hot" sauces that only cost about $1-$2 individually.  After adding shipping, you're paying at least 50% extra.  You can get 4 of these at Food Lion: Cholula, Bufalo, Tapatio, & ElYucateco.  All of these are mild, ElYucateco is a little hotter than a jalapeno, the rest are weaker.<br /><br />Skip Bufalo all together.  I've found 2 varieties, both were bland, and you might as well just pick up some MILD Tostitos or store brand salsa.<br /><br />Cholula, Tapatio, & ElYucateco are worth trying, but don't waste you're money here, unless you really can't find them in a grocery store.  Be sure to look around, my local store has all of these in their Mexican section, however they also have other hot sauces in Condiments, Asian, & Produce.<br /><br />Also, this set should most certainly NOT be given to a real hot sauce lover, they'll have very likely already tried them.
