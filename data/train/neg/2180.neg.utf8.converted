I thought this was such a great deal until I received the package--4 partially broken bags with the flour spilling everywhere. When I cooked with it, it tasted bitter like poison, which is a sign of rancidity for millet flour. I looked at the expiration date and it was within a month. So I had to throw all the bags away.
