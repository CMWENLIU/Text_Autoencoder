In general I love using xylitol and erythritol -- it is a great sweetener and a healthy alternative to sugar and artificial sugar substitutes. But when I received my order of erythritol from this company, it had a very strange smell. Too nasty for me to use the product, so I called for instructions on how to get a refund. When I asked where they got the substance, they said from China. This had me worried. I was not sure where the rest of their products came from, but they did confirm some of them do come from China.  I was concerned about product contamination, not knowing why the product smelled as it did.<br /><br />I ordered a great variety of items including the candies from them.  But when I called to voice my concerns about some of the products, they were very rude and negative on the phone and even hung up on me at one point. I would not order from them again, especially since NOW foods has a better product and wonderful customer service.<br /><br />(Note:  their xylitol apparently comes from the US.  I don't know why the erythritol is not, but this information is from their own representatives.)
