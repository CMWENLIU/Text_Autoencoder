Use with caution. When my baby was 5 weeks old I noticed that my milk supply was decreasing. I was taking 2 pills 3 times a day for about a week when I started felling really sick. I head strong headaches, I was weak and I had problem with breathing. My baby had a cough and was spitting up milk. She could not swallow, the mucus in her mouth was very thick. I learned from my doctor that fenugreek has very dangerous side effects: it can cause asthma;  reduces blood glucose levels which means it is not right for diabetics; promotes menstrual flow and can make yor menstrual cycles abnormal. I spent money on pills, teas, drops and my milk supply did not increase at all. I can breastfeed my baby only once a day now. I am happy with what I can give her although I see clearly that she hates formula. I give only one star because the manufacturer does not warn about side effects the product can have on mother and her child. I bet they know the pills are used mostly for the purpose of increasing breastmilk supply, yet they do not care about us.
