I bought what is advertised as a 14 oz. bottle and is priced accordingly. I received 8.5 oz bottles. After notifying the supplier in an email of this problem and offering suggetions to fix the problem and also a phone call that has not been returned, I have not heard from the supplier concerning their error and no offer of assistance has come forth. This is exactly the type of supplier that should NOT be on Amazon.
