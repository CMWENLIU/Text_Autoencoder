I completely agree - I have used many Equal-substitutes in the past, but this stuff is nasty.  We used it on cereal and in tea, and it leaves a rusty after-taste in both applications.  Want to ruin some nice oatmeal?<br />Also be advised that Amazon considers this a "Grocery" item, and as such it is NOT returnable (which I found out too late).  No reason to even try this stuff, IMO.
