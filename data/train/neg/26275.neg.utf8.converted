I had hoped these oives would be similar to those I usually get in Mexico.  Unfortunately they're not. These olives don't taste like they are stuffed with anchovies, they don't look or taste like they are stuffed with much of anything.  The olives themselves are pretty good, but if you are looking for real anchovy stuffed olives, look somewhere else.
