As a migraine sufferer, I have to be very careful around MSG. After reoccurring headaches and unable to pinpoint the cause I discovered the misleading claims on the Lawry's seasoning salt. "Natural Flavor" is MSG! It was giving me headaches. I stopped eating it and headaches went away. Thanks a lot Lawry for trying to hurt your consumers!
