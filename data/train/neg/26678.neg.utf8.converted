I had seen Annie`s advertised along side of kraft for years but never  took the leap until recently and now I wish I hadnt.  First off the overall portion size is small and they use a very small pasta shell (it has to be seen to be believed). You get more pasta not to mention much bigger pasta shells in the Kraft mac and cheese version and personally I think they taste better despite not being organic.  Perhaps if youre just buying this for children this might suffice but if youre looking to eat this as a meal or even as a side and there`s more than one person and/or you have even an average appetite I`d look elsewhere or just plan on cooking two boxes.  As far as flavor is concerned and the final product... I followed the directions and mixed the recommended amount of milk with the powder cheese mix and it came out more like soup than anything even closely resembling mac and cheese.  Not sure what they were going for here but I definitely dont get what all these 5-star reviews are about.  I even tried adding a few slices of kraft cheddar and it still was soupy.  Then I substituted margarin for milk as some other reviewers had suggested and although it was more palatable (only reason I didnt give it one star) I was still very disappointed.  There was hardly enough cheese for half the shells muchless the entire box.  Maybe if they used larger shells and gave you a lot more of the powder cheese Id consider reviewing it again but given the portion police state we live in I doubt either will happen.  In conclusion, if you like eating mac and cheese like u do your cereal in the morning then this version of annie`s is for u, if not, try Kraft (not the powdered version) and youll be much happier for having done so.
