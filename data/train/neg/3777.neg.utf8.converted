I have seen the commercials for this product on tv, and so, I was excited when I saw I could try it for free on Amazon Vine. I was not at all happy with this product.<br /><br />First, when I received this product, it had a plastic bag over the top. But it was completely open on the bottom and not sealed on at all. As a result, about a 1/3 of the shampoo leaked into the envelope.<br /><br />Second, I tried this product for about 5 days. I really liked the scent of this shampoo and was anxious to try it. But this shampoo is extremely thick and goopy. It is very hard to rinse completely out of your hair. Even though I was only using a quarter-sized amount at a time, this product left my hair very dull, heavy, and greasy looking. my hair is very thick and I have a lot of it, and it does tend to be oily, so I don't typically use conditioner. After several days, this prodct made my hair look like I hadn't washed for a while. Needless to say, I have stopped using this product and gone back to my old shampoo. I was not all happy with this product and wouldn't recommend it.<br /><br />However, I let my mom try it and she just loves it. She has a lot of hair, but it is baby fine. Her hair tends to be flat and doesn't have much body. She said that it makes her hair feel a lot more full and soft. So results seem to depend on your hair type. If you fine hair, I would recommend giving this product a try. However, if you thick hair, I would recommend skipping it.
