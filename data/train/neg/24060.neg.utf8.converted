I have had at least one cup earl grey per day for years and my fravote was always The Bigelow Earl Grey, this was first time I purchase them from Amazon, I'm not sure if the color of packing makes any difference, but the package arrived was sliver not gold. The tea was very weak and aroma is extream light, NOT at all the Earl Grey I expected.  Will NOT order this product again.
