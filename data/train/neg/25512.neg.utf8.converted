I paid a good price for the ChurpiChews because they were advertised as being hard (they were) and long lasting (they weren't). The product packaging says the ChurpiChew is a unique "long lasting treat" handmade in the Himalayan highlands.  My two dogs finished theirs in about 45 seconds longer than it would take them to eat a milkbone biscuit.  Translated: less than 60 seconds.  I will concede that their packaging also says "Dogs Absolutely Love Them" which mine did. I hope my two Labs savored each chomp because that's the last $16 I'll ever spend on this product.
