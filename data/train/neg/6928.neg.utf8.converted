These pine nuts are a product of China.  Had I known that I would NOT have purchased them.<br /><br />Why?  These Chinese pine nuts leave a distinctive and extremely unpleasant metallic flavor on the tongue which lasts for as long as two weeks depending on how many are eaten.<br /><br />Being a raw foodie, I use a lot of pine nuts in my raw food preparation, so it didn't take long for me to isolate the food which was causing the terrible, disagreeable reaction on my palate.  The nuts are expensive and I thought I was getting a good value with Azar but as it turns out, since the Azar Chinese pine nuts are not edible for me, they were a tremendous waste.<br /><br />Perhaps not every body will have the same reaction as I but I thought I must still flag a warning about Chinese pine nuts.<br /><br />I should add finally that I do NOT have any problems with domestic pine nuts or Italian pignolias and I much prefer them, especially if they are organically grown.  The flavor of USA and Italian grown pinenuts is far superior.  The metallic issue seems to come up with Chinese pine nuts only.
