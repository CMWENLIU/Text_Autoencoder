This salsa looks and smells repulsive. As other reviewers have stated, it is definitely reminiscent of both vomit and vinegar. Gross gross gross. And it doesn't taste of a thing like cheese! I would never buy again - I've only eaten more than one bite of the stuff because I'm quite hungry at the moment and I hate to waste money. But I can't wait to brush my teeth and get this taste out of my mouth.
