This product is not meant for a person with thin, light-colored hair, no matter what type of processing you've done to make your scalp or hair dry, frizzy, or brittle.<br /><br />The first issue I had with the product was that there were no directions. I'm sure a more product savvy person might be able to intuit exactly how much to use and when to apply it (in the shower? on wet or toweled hair? on dry hair? before or after using a blow dryer?), but I had no clue so I tried it various ways. The end result was the same: greasy looking and matted hair with no body. I tried on both wet and dry hair using a pea sized amount massaged through my shoulder length hair, and I tried using a few drops in water and spraying it on. I tried smaller and smaller amounts. The only time there was much to see besides oily was when I put a smidgen just on the ends of my hair. But the product is supposed to be for dry scalp??<br /><br />I do like the smell, and I guess I thought this was going to be more a "hot oil treatment" as I typically have used in the past, but it's not. My advice to the product maker would be to target the advertisement directly to whomever this product works for (I have no clue but it's not for anyone with my type of hair), and to provide some instructions on how much to use and when for best results.
