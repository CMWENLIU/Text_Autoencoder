Two of the six packages were beginning to mold, but not even close to the expiration date.  One other package was visibly torn.  I was curious to see if any of the packs were still sealed air-tight, so I placed them in water. Five of the packs were exposed to air with small opening around the seal.  I imagine that they burst somewhere in their travels from changes in altitude/pressure.  I cannot vouch for the actually taste of the product as I did not eat them.  The silver lining: Amazon has GREAT customer service.
