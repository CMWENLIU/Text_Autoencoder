How can you make peanut butter taste like GRASS?? OMG!!! We bought this in high anticipation of eating the "whole pint" How WRONG we were...It doesn't even have the consistency of what anything frozen is supposed to be. Seriously, go outside, cut some grass, then eat it with a piece of ice. BAM. You have now tasted this Artic Zero flavor for FREE, flavor being a high exaggeration of a descriptive term! ugh!!!
