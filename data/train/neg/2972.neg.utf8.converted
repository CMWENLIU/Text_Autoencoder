Why would someone decides to package glass jars of $11 a piece in the box in which they ship books(you know those flat "boxes" that have just a flap for a top and the bottom). Box showed up with  "Received Unsealed" stamped all over it. Two jars leaked out, one because metal cap got dented other because seal got broken and cap unscrewed.<br />It is so sad that even though shipping and handling charges double the price of an item it still arrives damaged when fulfilled by Amazon.<br />Just a note:This product is great which makes me even more furious that I have to send it back. We love Nutella as well but unless they switch from using palm oil I won't be feeding it to my toddlers. After it turned into thick paste in my 3 years old stomach which made him throw up all over himself in the car I'm very careful with products that contain palm oil.
