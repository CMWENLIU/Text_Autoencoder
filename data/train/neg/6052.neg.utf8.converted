I cannot review how well this shampoo works on the hair as it arrived in the mail with all of the shampoo leaked into the mailing envelope. I will say that if you are sensitive to products with strong fragrances like I am, this is not a good choice. It is heavily scented. I also don't recommend ordering this product through the mail as the pop top popped open and there was not packaging or shrink wrap to secure it shut.
