I picked this up on a whim. My thought was to uses a very small amount as a sort of snack for my dog before bed.<br />I do this with my cats, too. I give them each a very small amount of a dry cat food that is low on the nutrition scale,<br />but high on the cat  junk food scale. I had been giving my dog an oatmeal biscuit or two each night. When I saw this<br />I thought I would try it and give him the same sort of treat as I do the cats.<br /><br />First of all, he loves it. He practically kisses my feet when I give it to him. It has an odd texture, in my opinion. Sort<br />of similar to a handful of raisins, not quite dry but? And Duncan gobbles it up and clearly wishes for more. I have a<br />fairly spoiled dog. Due to health issues, I cook for him every week. He eats cooked fish, beef or chicken with rice or pasta<br />peas, and some supplements. So if I ever do give him dog food in any quantity at all, it is a very high quality, not so yummy<br />as this ( apparently) dog food. So I am very concerned with what is in the food he is given. I see no problem with a tablespoon<br />or two a night for my 70lb dog, but I would not feed this as his sole diet. The nutrition value is very low, which is usually the<br />way it is with the food dogs like best.<br /><br />So, I really wanted to give this a higher rating since he likes it so much, but since I am writing this for dog people who are<br />surely interested in keeping their dogs healthy as well as happy, I had to go with two stars. Now, as a treat, or an occasional<br />meal, I see no problem with this. Dogs enjoy junk food, too.
