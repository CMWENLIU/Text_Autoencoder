I have a Lavazza Cuisinart machine. It came with Lavazza pre packaged pods. I liked the way it worked so I ordered more here. The new Lavazza pods did not fit my machine. They are a smaller diameter and thicker. They dont work. The bad thing is there is no sizing number or code to tell what pods fit what machines. This is a non returnable item so i am stuck with them at my expense. Since there are obviously different pods for different machines wouldnt you think that there would be a number or color code stamped on them?
