I eat a considerable amount of popcorn every week and it's almost always Redenbacher.  I like the brand.  BUT this product is dreadful.  First, it's salty. Waaay too salty. Secondly, it's pretty greasy.  Not buttery mind you, but greasy.<br /><br />And it gets worse.  On top of those drawbacks is the fact that it smells awful.  It has a sort of chemically odor and what's really odd... it does not smell like popcorn.  You know how microwaving popcorn will make people come creeping out of the woodwork looking for a handful of fluffy corny goodness!  Not with this product.  Heck, my kids won't eat it.  And after experimenting to see if the second bag was as bad as the first, I threw out the rest of the box.<br /><br />THE SKINNY:::<br />I've reviewed over a thousand products and given less than a handful 1-Star. I'm adding Orvilles "Natural" popcorn to that elite list because its just gross.  I despise it and fear to feed it to my children because of the unattractive smell.<br /><br />Stick with Orville's Butter or Lite-Butter or Tender White or one of the flavored types.  They taste good and the smell good.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />upset mom/blogger
