If, like me, you want to buy Melissa's pine nuts, described as being from Italy, because you have had experience with "pine nut mouth" - where you get a bitter, metallic taste everytime you eat or drink anything for about 2 weeks after consuming pine nuts from China -- beware.  The packages I received are clearly marked "product of China."  I have contacted Amazon requesting a refund.
