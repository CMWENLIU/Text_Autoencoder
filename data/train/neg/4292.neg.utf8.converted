This is way too sweet and artificially fizzy.  Somehow the pasturization process took out the goodness of the real Kombuchas. I've found that GT's Synergy is one of the best.  It also contains raw Chia, an outstanding energy food. Watch out for others, like this Wonder Drink, that try to use the same words and imitate the quality companies that produce Kombucha the way it is meant to be drank. Find one of the GT's Kombucha products and compare for yourself.
