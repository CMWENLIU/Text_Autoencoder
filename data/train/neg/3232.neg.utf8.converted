I was in Peru some years ago, and brought back 2 boxes of Coca tea.  It was packaged like 100 count boxes of Lipton, (as is the Windsor).  It was much stronger than the teas I have bought on Amazon, and I wonder if the Import Quality print on the box designates a weaker strength than what is available in country.
