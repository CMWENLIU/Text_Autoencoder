As a rule, you should always check the fine print of anything you buy and not the BIG BOLD LABEL that says ALL NATURAL or FAT FREE or NO ADDED SUGAR. The marketing strategy was not for those who are looking to buy the creamy, easy to spread peanut butter nor for those who wants no partially hydrogenated oils in their PB. But it is for those who wants "All Natural" those who thinks they are just buying all peanut, all healthy, no saturated fats PB.<br />Others are saying they dont care whats in it as long as it's creamy and tasty and their kids love it but this review is not about the taste. We already know that Skippy products are tasty and creamy and yes my kids loves PB for breakfast. Im sorely reviewing about product labelling. All Im saying is theres nothing special about it. They could have just said, its PB without PHO. But again, it's all about strategy and consumers like us really needs to educate ourselves.
