Very disappointed.  I went by the picture and description.  I should have read the reviews.  This is not the same as someone else stated.  It has creamer with partially hydrogenated oil in it.  I don't want that stuff. I wanted the same as what is in the can that looks the same. Won't buy this again - doesn't even taste close to the other stuff.
