The rave reviews for Carbon's Golden Malted Pancake & Waffle Flour are a mystery to me. This pancake mix is mediocre. Nearly all of the rave reviews have come from people who use the mix to make waffles. The few who have made pancakes have found the mix to be very disappointing. Although this mix is called "malted," it lacks malt (or any other) flavor. The pancake texture isn't particularly good either. If you live in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, or Kentucky, go to your local Meijer grocery store and buy their brand of malted pancake mix. The malt taste and fluffy texture are far superior to Carbon's, and the mix costs less than half as much. If you don't live in one of those states and are primarily interested in making pancakes, use Amazon to order <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB03SE">Bruces, Mix Pancake Sweet Potato, 24-Ounce (12 Pack)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OEAGCO">Heidi's Cottage Classics Oats n' Apple Pancake Mix, 12-Ounces (Pack of 6)</a>, both of which are unique and much better for pancakes than Carbon's. I haven't used Carbon's mix to make waffles, but I'm guessing that the rave reviews are due to the texture, since flavor is lacking. Carbon's mix is a very fine powder, similar to cake flour, and apparently this results in a better waffle (though not necessarily a better pancake). Since Meijer's mix is also a very fine powder, it would probably also make great waffles in addition to delicious malt-flavored pancakes. Don't let the hype fool you into thinking that Carbon's mix is something special. It's good but not great.
