I make a lot of soups and also often use chicken bullion when I make beans or sauces.  After getting disgusted with not being able to find one without "Salt, MSG..." as the first two ingredients on the label I turned to Amazon and found this.  After receiving it today and making a sample cup of broth I have to say I'm really disappointed in it.<br /><br />First of all, there's no "chicken" in the ingredients at all.  The closest we have to anything animal is "CSC shortening" -- I don't know what that particular product is but much of the time shortenings are trans-fats which are extremely unhealthy for you.  The last ingredient listed is "Other Spices" which is often a codeword for MSG.<br /><br />Basically, as far as I can tell from the product list and taste of the final product this is a jar full of tumeric and celery and onion powder.  When you use it to make broth you end up with a substance that's the same color, opacity, and viscosity as orange juice and that tastes not at all of chicken broth.  It also has a film of semisolid granules floating at the top that have the consistency of those little orange fish eggs you sometimes find on sushi (my guess is that it's either the shortening or poorly dissolved celery powder) that would have to be skimmed off of any soup you made if you wanted people to actually eat it.<br /><br />The next two products I will try in my search for a low/no sodium chicken base is Herb Ox's Sodium Free Chicken Bullion (which potassium cholride as a substitute for salt and monoammonium glutamate as a sub for MSG, an imperfect solution to just leaving them out) and if that doesn't taste good then I'll probably end up with the "low" sodium Better Than Bullion chicken stock paste product, which I know at least tastes right even though it still has an awful lot of salt in there and is much more expensive than regular bullion.
