This has to be the worst tasting stuff ever. So excited to find something peanut-buttery that would not harm my diet that I took out a spoon as soon as I got home. It went right in the trash! I was so disappointed. Now I am going to try PB2. Hope I have better luck... My thought when I threw it out was on what planet did the people in product development think this was a successful product. I guess they are counting on fools like me thinking calorie-free PB would taste good. Definitely they are only counting on one time only sales.
