I used 3 drops on my long, thick, color treated, hot styling tool used hair and it made my hair look like I poured oil all over it. Its so gross and the fact I used almost nothing in the amount of hair makes me think that it is not a good product. It also made my hair feel dry and stiff after I put it on my damp hair and took a while for me to be able to comb out before drying.  It smells wonderful however but I wont use it again.
