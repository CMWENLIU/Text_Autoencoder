Warning - the reviews below apply to a previous recipe which used Cinnabon cinnamon - I agree it was fantastic.  As of March 2012 the one they're selling (at least in the stores) has changed.  This one is not nearly as good - it's still a mild (not candy-store) cinnamon but nothing special - definitely not worth the inflated price being charged here.  They may still have a few old ones left but if you're reading this much beyond the date of this review and are looking for the old formula you want to be sure to confirm.
