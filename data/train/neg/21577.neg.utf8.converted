I'm not nearly as taken with Orbit's Fruitini gum as I am with some of their other flavors.  Some of their flavors are fantastic, and Orbit gum generally has a nice consistency to chew, but there's something off about this flavor.  I'm pretty sure the culprit is the whitening agents.  Not all Orbit gum claims to whiten, but this is one of the flavors that does, and I think you can taste the whitening agents in the gum.  This gum does taste like fruit, but there's a weird undertone- what I suspect to be the whitening agents.  My advice would be to try a stick before committing to a whole large pack, or go with one of Orbit's other flavors- I recommend the Sangria and the Melon-Mint.
