For all of the good that it will do, (probably none), I have been to the Nescaf&eacute; web site to complain that this product is no longer available in canisters. The taste of this coffee is excellent, the price in these packets is prohibitive, and it is very inconvenient to use these packets at home. Please go to the website and complain.<br /><br />I am sure that Nestle has done this from greed alone. This way they can charge much more for less product. Of course, the claim is that this is the way the customers prefer the coffee to be packaged. Yeah, right.
