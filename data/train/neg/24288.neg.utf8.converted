These are okay for a mass produced product frim a factory.  Nothing spectacular.<br /><br />Ordered direct from the company's web site. Faced w/ 3 confusing choices: ship & deliver ASAP, ship whenever, deliver in time for Christmas. I chose the first thinking it was the fastest. My items were not delivered until 12/27. When I contacted Swiss Colony, they said, "Too bad."<br /><br />Next time I'll get real petit fours shipped from an actual bakery.
