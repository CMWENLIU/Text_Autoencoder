Let me tell you in plain english.  I received the driest coffee imaginable when opening the package.  It was dust once ground. The taste is some thing you would find at a roadside dinner 250 miles from civilization. I wasted $25.oo plain and simple and will be throwng the rest of the 4-3/4 lbs. in the compost.
