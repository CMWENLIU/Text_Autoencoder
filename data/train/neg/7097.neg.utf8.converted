There's a sucker born every minute.. and I am one.  lol  I had no idea how much Red Hot candies weigh, but evidently it's more than my original estimate.  Although the bag is only 7 oz, the image of the item appeared to be a larger, so I ordered and paid $7 (or $1/ounce.  When the bag came I was shocked at the size.  This is similar to the boxes of candy you can buy at the movie theater (those are 6 oz, this is 7oz.  Since Amazon doesn't allow returns on grocery items, I'm stuck with a small and expensive bag of candy.  Buyer Beware.
