I was very happy with this product at first, as it solved my little dog's skin problems. Now, almost 2 years later, my dog has developed really bad cough allergy. I have solidly confirmed the food is the root cause by stopping & trying it again. I just want to mention that this is a 2nd time we have to discontinue dog food after years of use, due to newly developed allergies.
