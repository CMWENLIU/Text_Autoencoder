I went away from my holistic, raw diet ways when my cat had constant vomiting. She's an 11 year old DMH, who's brachycephalic. This is total crap. The ingredients are horrifying! If you care about nutrition, and know what byproducts are and what grains can do to your cat, I strongly urge you to avoid any food containing them, not just RC. For the same price as RC you can get higher quality Wellness Core, or Alpha Cat by Natural Balance, even Before the Grain has better ingredients.<br /><br />My cats are all back on raw. Turned out to be a beef allergy in the one, NOT, as the vet said "getting sick from uncooked meat." I didn't realized lions grilled their meat. Blood work is back to her typical perfection.<br />First five ingredients make up the majority of the contents, keep in mind this is before its cooked, after cooking, meat weighs less and falls down the list.<br />Ingredients:<br />Chicken meal, brown rice, rice, corn, corn gluten meal, chicken fat, chicken, natural chicken flavor, pea fiber, rice flour, rice hulls, wheat gluten, dried beet pulp (sugar removed), soya oil, sodium silico aluminate, dried brewers yeast, fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), anchovy oil (source of EPA/DHA), calcium sulfate, salt, potassium chloride, dried egg product, choline chloride, DL-methionine, taurine, Vitamins [DL-alpha tocopherol acetate (source of vitamin E), L-ascorbyl-2-polyphosphate (source of vitamin C), niacin supplement, biotin, riboflavin (vitamin B2) supplement, D-calcium pantothenate, vitamin A acetate, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), thiamine mononitrate (vitamin B1), folic acid, vitamin B12 supplement, vitamin D3 supplement], sodium tripolyphosphate, tea (green tea extract), Trace Minerals [zinc oxide, zinc proteinate, ferrous sulfate, manganese proteinate, copper proteinate, copper sulfate, manganous oxide, calcium iodate, sodium selenite], L-Carnitine, preserved with natural mixed tocopherols (source of vitamin E) and citric acid, rosemary extract.
