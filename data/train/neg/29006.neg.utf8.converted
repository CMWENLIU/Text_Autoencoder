I received my order and haven't tasted the sauce yet -- it's probably just fine -- but it's clearly not two 17-ounce bottles of sauce: it's two 12.7-ounce bottles ... almost a third smaller. I know this doesn't seem like a huge deal, but c'mon, I'm already paying through the nose for this stuff, don't rip me off even more.
