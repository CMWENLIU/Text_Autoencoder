I have loved Pecan Sandies for many years.  Since late 2008, they didn't seem the same - either I changed or they did.  My family agreed there was something wrong, we exchanged some at the store, bought a few weeks later from another store... they're different.  They used to be kind of buttery soft and 'sandy,' but now they're cruncy hard and the flavor tastes like something was left out.  I was hoping it was a bad batch, but now it seems like my favorite cookie is no more.
