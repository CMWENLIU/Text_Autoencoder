People taking this product should be well aware of its side effects. This product left me with horrible dizziness that lasted well over 72 hours. I also had the worst headache of my life while consuming this coffee. I consider myself a healthy young man, I workout 4 times a week, run and live a pretty athletic lifestyle. This product literally had me down for the count from my normal activities for about one week. Before taking this product please consult your physician and discuss the potential side effects as it relates to your current health. While reviewing any changes to my diet or reactions to any medications, the only change was adding this product to my diet. Once I eliminated this coffee from my diet, the headaches and dizziness subsided. However, the product still remains in your system for quite some time as I still experience slight bouts of dizziness during the first few minutes of my day.
