With a whopping 18 grams of sugar, this cereal ought to be banned for anyone with high blood sugar, hyperglycemia or diabetes.

I've been to the dentist twice -- in order to get repairs done due to consuming this -- let's call it what it is -- breakfast CANDY!  My dentist entirely arned me off of consuming this garbage.<br /><br />"Oh, but it's so good for you!  Those whole grains!"  Hogwash.  It's got more sugar than protein.  There are much better foods for the (non-hypocritical) health-conscious person.
