Bush's Best Baked Beans 8/165 oz cans:  This order was a joke!  The carton holding the cans had been opened and was then retaped.  Every can in the case is dented, even the ones on the inside.  It seems that damaged cans were collected, put into an opened carton, re-taped, then sent on to me.  Shame on you Amazon shippers; you should not be working there.  What a gross inconvenience!  What a horrid thing for any customer to receive!
