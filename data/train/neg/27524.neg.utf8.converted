The first time I bought this bread, I was trying to recapture a tase and heat achieved with a friend's "habenero relish" and some bread machine bread. I missed. That's a good thing.<br /><br />For one thing, "no bread machine required." I could whip up a loaf in just about an hour. Next, the habenero powder was even hotter than the fresh bits of habenero from my friends garden. There's a caution there - after the first loaf, I stirred all future loaves with a rubber spatula instead of by hand.<br /><br />I mean, let's face it - sooner or later you'll be tempted to rub your nose or eyes, and did you manage to scrub every last particle of habenero powder or solution off? I didn't, I guess.<br /><br />It was fair bread, especially shaped into muffins, nothng to write home about. But the heat added by the powder package was phenominal, perfect for dipping into chili or salsa.<br /><br />The killer is the price. I've bought maybe twenty AKBB mixes all told, at Amazon or elsewhere, and I won't be buying another unless the price is cut in half.
