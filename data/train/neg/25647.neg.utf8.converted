I got this as a gift from Amazon from my sister.  What a big disappointment!  My poor sis was so embarrassed by the quality of the items she went to Bath and Body Works to supplement it.  It needed more items like shampoo, bath oils or even bubble bath.  A body scrub with the two loofahs would have been nice.  I could have done without all the aromatherapy stuff they put in the CARDBOARD "basket" - really, for $40 bucks?  Cardboard?  Overall, I'd rate this a poor buy and I would never give it as a present - well, maybe I would if they priced it at $5.00 and it was a Secret Santa gift!
