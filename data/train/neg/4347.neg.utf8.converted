I ordered this bonsai tree for my daughter-in-law because she listed it on her Amazon wish list as "highest" for this Christmas 2005.  The order came in record time, three weeks before Christmas so I set about babying the tree each day by following all of the directions to a tee!  I sprayed it and watered it  exactly as the directions stated and I placed it in a sunny well lighted area and the temperature in our condo was never below 65 degrees and that was only at night while we slept. Nonetheless, after two weeks, still a week before Christmas, the leaves began to curl, turn splotchy and fall off. I was very sad about this because the tree had looked wonderful when it arrived and it was very well packed.  But, by the time Christmas Eve arrived it had only about half of its original leaves.  We are now waiting to see if the tree does better at my daughter-in-law's home since she is very happy to have it and she'd love to keep it...she is going to try to nurture it into a healthy life.  We'll see...  M. Buchanan
