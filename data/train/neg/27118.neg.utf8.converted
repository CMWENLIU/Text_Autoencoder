I grabbed these because they were on a stand close to the cash register, they were gluten free, and I was hungry. I adore lentils and I love cucumber and dill. They sounded perfect.<br /><br />In my hurry I forgot to check the ingredients. As soon as I opened the bag I realized my mistake. An overpowering odor of sour cream, a flavor I find repugnant, greeted my nose. I tried one just to be fair, but all I could taste was sour cream with a hint of dill. The texture was unpleasant too--foamy--kind of like one of those biodegradable foam peanuts had been flattened out and crisped up.<br /><br />The offending ingredient, as far as I can tell, is buttermilk. I understand why chip makers put this buttermilky/sour creamy flavor in their ranch and sour cream & onion chips. I don't understand why it's in so many others, nacho cheese, cheddar cheese, cucumber dill. About the only safe flavor anymore is salt & vinegar.<br /><br />I wish I could get my money back because there is no way I'm going to eat these and I'm pretty sure my family won't like them either. Too bad I didn't happen upon the sea salt flavor that everyone seems to like, because these were pretty terrible.
