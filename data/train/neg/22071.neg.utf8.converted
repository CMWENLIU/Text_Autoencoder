My sister worked at Starbucks, so I used to get their unground espresso beans for free on occasion.  I have a pump espresso machine, but only a cheap blade grinder, which should tell you that I'm only about mid-range on the coffee-snobbery scale.  That said, I prefer the starbucks espresso to this, in spite of the drastic difference in price when I buy it retail.  Again though, I'm not one of those people who examines this stuff overly much.  I only know what I like the taste of.  In fact, I only drink it in lattes.  4 shot lattes, but lattes none the less.
