I buy products online based solely on reviews of different products. I figured if the majority approve of it should be just fine. About 98% of the time, this is the case for me however, with PepPod this is NOT the case.<br /><br />PepPod comes in a tablet form and dissolves in your cup of water. The directions on the packaging give you an option to tailor your flavor from strong to strongest. Strong is 16oz of water, Stronger is 8oz and Strongest is 8oz of water. None of this is listed on the online description. According to the reviews and the product description PepPod is not like any other energy drink. You get a burst of energy naturally; no jitters, jittery feeling, racing heartbeats, and a crash after it wear off. It also has 81mg of caffeine and says on the packaging that if you are "sensitive" to caffeine maybe you should consult with your physician.<br /><br />I made sure to try it when I was tired. I was on my way to my part-time job after already working an 8-hour day and took mine in 10oz to be on the safe side. I was so excited because I have been trying to find something like PepPod. About 30 mins after drinking my PepPod I started feeling sick, nausea, jittery feelings and even more tired than I did before I drink it. I am NOT a caffeine drinker. I do not drink coffee or soda but I wouldn't consider myself sensitive to Caffeine as I have in the past but maybe I am now because I do not drink it now and haven't in years. What I do know is this product made me sick, it was ineffective, and everything it claimed to do it did NOT! To the caffeine drinkers maybe the 81 MG and the other ingredients will not affect you. To the non-caffeine drinkers this will certainly affect you and 81 mg of caffeine is equivalent to a cup of coffee. I will NOT recommend this product to anyone I will be returning it.
