If you're expecting a crunchy chocolatey treat, don't buy these!  But, if you'd enjoy brown bits with an intensely pungent vinegar odor, these may be just the ticket.  Unlike other chocolate nibs I've eaten, these, upon opening the package, greet you with an olfactory assault suggesting ascetic acid was used in their processing.  There was only the slightest hint of chocolate discernible on the palate. Perhaps this was just a bad lot (240111) given the other positive reviews.
