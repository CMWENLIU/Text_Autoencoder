I am a big fan of Coffaro's Biscotti but this is the first variety that I don't care for. I am not sure what the deal is with these, it might be that they taste so dry and crumbly because they are gluten-free which I must have overlooked when I ordered them. In any case they taste, to put it somewhat neutral, "healthy". As if they have the bare minimum of ingredients and are lacking the one that makes them tasty. Since I have no problems with gluten, I will stay away from these in the future and look for the other Coffaro's that I have come to love...<br /><br />A final note: Coffaro's seemed to have disappeared for a good while and I am glad to see them back. One change I do like is that they seem to have made the inner bags much sturdier. They don't tear easily anymore as the old ones did, so Kudos for that.<br /><br />Overall though, I will go back to my beloved wholesome Coffaro's, even if the bag should still tear when one so much as looks at it :-)
