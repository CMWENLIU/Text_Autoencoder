I bought two boxes of pumpkin seeds.  The first one had a date of Nov. 7, 2009.  These were really good and crunchy.  Every one had a nice "snap" to it.  But then I got to the second box, dated Dec. 5, 2009, and they were not good at all.  They had no crunch and were tough to chew.  I keep trying, one bag, then a second one, then a third one, with all the same results.  Very disappointing.  So I decided to call Amazon to complain.  The customer service was great, and they sent me a free second box to replace the bad one.  Well I opened it up, and it was dated Dec. 5, 2009!  So basically the same disappointing results!  I'm eating them just because that's all I have, but I'm due to receive my second shipment, and I'm anxious to see what date they have on the box, and how they taste.  As a side note, I decided to purchase a bag from the store to compare, and it was dated Feb. 10, 2010.  Much better!  So hopefully Amazon will keep sending the freshest products possible, and not boxes that have been sitting on their shelves.
