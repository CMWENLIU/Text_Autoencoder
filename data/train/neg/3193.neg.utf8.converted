I never drink energy drinks. I'm in college and all of my friends drink them like they are water. I never got the point of it.But today it was 2 pm I could barely keep my eyes open and i had class from 3:30 till 9:00. I needed energy and fast. Then the commercial for 5-hour energy popped in my head, "2:30 feeling" I knew some of my friends used it, so I thought why not give it a try. I figured it was small so it wouldn't do that much harm.<br /><br />I drank half of the bottle and within minutes I know longer felt like I was falling asleep. Unfortunately 10 minutes later I was feeling more tired than before. I decided to drink the rest of the bottle. Once again a quick 5 minute burst of energy and then back to exhaustion. Then everything got worse. Around an hour after drank the drink I found myself doubling over in stomach pain and throwing up. It has been 7 hours since I drank it and I feel like I just got hit by a train. Instead of helping me get through class the 5-hour energy made it nearly impossible.
