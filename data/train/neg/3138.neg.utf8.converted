We used this dog food for years until this month.  Within the last year, we have noticed significant variations/inconsistencies in the food smell, moisture content, and apparently the taste.  Our 3 dogs used to love this.  But lately, our one dog won't even eat it - for days!  She will smell it and walk away looking at me.  Within the last month, two of our other dogs did eat the food but within 24 hrs  had profuse vomiting.  The vomiting issue with our 2 dogs combined with the ongoing inconsistencies has caused us to stop using this food.  For a number of years we were very happy.  Don't know what changed but our dogs either won't eat it and/or got sick.
