The Company didn't really mean to send me the bad taste sauce for sure i guess, and the person who ship these to me didn't mean to send me the gone bad sause to me either i am sure, I want to ask the company to check the product more often so customers who expected fresh sauce will not going to get gone bad sause. It was my first experiance ever in my life to receive sause in this terrible condition. Sause has a sour smell and I had to trash all the meat i marinated with this sauce. I was really mad.<br />I hope this dose not happen anyone else again who purchased this sause.<br />*** GOOD NEWS ***<br />is that Amazon Credited the full amount for it and Customer service was really nice and supportive. I thank Amazon Customer Service Care team and want to give them 5 stars.
