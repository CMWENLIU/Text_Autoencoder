I have been looking for gum drops for a long time and was excited about getting these.  I was disappointed.  They do not have the flavors of the gum drops I remember as a kid.  They all had a strange flavor, even the green and orange, which you would think would be pretty universal.  They are way too expensive (shipping is half the cost of the product) to order for the quality and the taste was not very good.
