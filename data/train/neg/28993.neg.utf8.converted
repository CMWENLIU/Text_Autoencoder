If that's what you're going for, then this is the coffee for you!<br /><br />To preface, I'm no coffee snob, but I've had my fair share of good and bad beans.  I took a chance on this brand because of an Amazon promotion, but I don't think I'll be buying any more.<br /><br />Like another reviewer, I knew I was in trouble when I opened the bag.  Characteristic of the beans that I've enjoyed the most is a rich, oily sheen left on the beans from the roasting process.  These aromatic oils are filled with flavor and provide a richness to your brew.  This bag?  The beans looked dry and oil-free.  I confirmed this when I put it through my grinder.  The grinds didn't stick to the grinder and the lid because there were no oils to bind it.  A disappointment!<br /><br />I thought to myself though, that the proof is in the taste.  So I brewed a pot and confirmed my suspicion; the coffee lacked depth and really tasted like coffee flavored water.  Now in case you think that my wife and I like our brews dark and strong, that's not the case.  We're both in preference to roasts on the light-medium end of the scale.  But this is an entirely different animal -- the flavor is just....off.<br /><br />If you're purchasing from Amazon, consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SJHO4M">Kicking Horse Coffee Z-Wrangler Medium, Whole Bean Coffee, 12.3-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a> instead.  When you open those tins, the aroma...it's just out of this world.  The beans are characteristically oily with a beautiful, chocolate sheen. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Z613JO">Magnum Kona Blend Coffee, Whole Bean, 1 Lb Bag</a> is another that I can heartily recommend (though I prefer the Kicking Horse just a tad bit more).<br /><br />Yes, it's more costly, but really, it's a small luxury in this frugal era of "staycations" and still cheaper than buying Starbucks or DD every day.  It's safe to say that I will not be buying any more coffee of this brand.
