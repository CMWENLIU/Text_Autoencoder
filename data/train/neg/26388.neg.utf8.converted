I loved the look of this bar, but it will not stick!  I hung it on a smooth metal surface (clean), hung my cooking utensils on it and 10 minutes later heard an enormous crash as it detached itself from the surface.  I tried several other places and still had the same problem.  Perhaps this is why it has been marked down so low?  If I can figure out how to permanently attach it to the wall, I would say it was worth buying, but right now, I don't recommend it.
