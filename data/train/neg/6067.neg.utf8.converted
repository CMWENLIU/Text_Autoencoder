I was really excited to have a blend of peppercorns.  However, since there is allspice mixed in with these it really throws the flavor off of, well, all of my dishes.  You can taste the pepper yet you also taste a earthy, kind of pungent bite as well.  I even tried picking through the peppercorns and removing the allspice.  It was too late, the flavor is still mixed in there.  &lt;shrug>  Too bad.
