The fourth ingredient in this candy is ammonium chloride. Too bad I didn't read the label before ingesting this product.  It has been several hours since I ate my first and LAST two pieces of this candy and I still have the sensation and smell of ammonia in my nose.  A spicy dinner and a Neti Pot nasal wash did not remove it.<br /><br />This is one of the worst things I have ever had in my mouth (or up my nose...) and I am heartily glad I bought a single carton at a local store before buying a CRATE at amazon.com.<br /><br />I'm a salty licorice lover.  This licorice is very salty, hardly sweet (that's what I expected) but packs an unpleasant and lasting ammonia wallop that I found intolerable.
