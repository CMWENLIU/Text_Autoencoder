I love chocolate with cinnamon in it, and artisan chocolates in general, so i had such high hopes for this product. It disappointed me.<br /><br />First off, it was grainy, in a too-much-sugar way, not a coarsely-ground-cacao-way. If you break off a piece, you can see the sugar crystals glinting in the chocolate.<br /><br />Second, it had almost no flavor. I couldn't taste the cinnamon at all, and the even chocolate itself was weak.<br /><br />It smells wonderful, but tastes like grainy nothing.
