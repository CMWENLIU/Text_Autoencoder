The Bergin Nut Company Dried Blueberries were not tasty at all. We consume a lot of dried blueberries for use as a snack, in yogurt and in our morning cereal, these were a huge disappointment. They were flat and stale tasting. Due to the fact that the bag was not cheap we tried to get through them anyway, still ended up tossing out part of it because just couldn't find good ways to 'disguise' the disappointing taste. To be honest, I have only ordered this make of dried blueberries once, so it could be that we got a bad bag. However, once was enough for me and we will not be ordering Bergin Nut Company Dried Blueberries again.
