Taco Bell's Chipotle sauce is the texture of a weak ranch dressing. Possibly due to this texture, the flavor vaguely reminds me of ranch dressing with some Mexican spices added. It isn't very spicy hot. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the hottest thing I've eaten, I'd put this sauce around 3. It is about as spicy as a typical packaged taco seasoning from a kit.<br /><br />I tried the sauce seperately, on a bit of taco meat, and buried in a taco. I can't say that it ever tasted good, but it wasn't too bad when it was only providing a hint of flavor to the taco. I'd much rather have salsa or any of the great liquid hot sauces available online or at the supermarket.<br /><br />According to the label, it has 110 calories and 11g of fat in a 2-Tbsp serving. The top ingredient is soybean oil. It says "contain milk, egg" in the allergen section of the label.
