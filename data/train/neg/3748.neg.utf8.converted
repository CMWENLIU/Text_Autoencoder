I am from Italy and own a machine from this brand there. The machine over there works. The one I bought here in the USA broke after 8 months. I had to pay all the shipping costs for them to fix it, and they sent it back and it worked for a few more months. But now it broke again and it is no longer under warranty! There is not anyone in the entire state that services it, so I am stuck with a broken $500 machine. Not worth it at ALL!!! Don't buy it, the customer service is awful and the machine is not built to last.
