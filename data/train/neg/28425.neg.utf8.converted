<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H44STI">S-Adenosyl-100 (SAMe) for Small Dogs and Cats by Vitality Systems</a>I order this product for my dog.  My vet wants me to give one pill per day for his aging liver.  When I ordered this product, I assumed it would be 60 pills for the price since I paid approximately the same amount for 60 pills eight times before.  My big mistake was ordering the Vitality Systems company selling the product on Amazon.  I guess I inadvertently switched vendors on this order without realizing this.<br /><br />When I received the order it was 30 pills for over $22.00.  I ordered from the wrong company who cleverly omitted the total number of pills in their description.  (I would also hide this vital info. if my intention was to fool (really cheat) customers!)<br /><br />I know that often Amazon is not very good with providing vital information on products and I often have to go to other websites to find out more about the products I am shopping for. (A good number of times they  lost my business when other websites selling the same product had a similar price with less postage costs.)<br /><br />There should not be certain companies who omit things that other companies selling the same product state up front.  Amazon needs to have more uniformity in displaying the products they handle and/or sell.
