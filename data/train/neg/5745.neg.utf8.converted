I received this order damaged, with most of the chicory gone from one of the open bags.  The other bags were sealed, but were not full.  So I paid for six 12 ounce bags and got about half of the amount that I paid for.<br /><br />Amazon did not respond to me about this problem, and they did not make restitution nor did they allow me to return the product!  Bad Amazon!  I am really disappointed!  To make matters much worse, I had also ordered the french roast coffee version of this and it never arrived, yet Amazon charged me to ship it to me and to return it to them even though I never received it and I never sent it back!<br /><br />What is going on at Amazon!!!  Why are they stiffing excellent customers??
