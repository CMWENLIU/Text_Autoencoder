I had been using another type of eco friendly garbage bag, but they seem to be unavailable from all sources, so I ordered these instead.  They are not very strong.  They don't have handles, so they don't stay in place very well.  With the other brand of bags we were able to take out three full liners from the kitchen cans at a time.  With bio bags we are lucky to make it to the herbie with one...they need to be gently removed and then held on the top and from the bottom and walk fast and hope they don't leak.  These are less expensive than the previous brand used, but are definitely an inferior product.  I think I'll keep looking for a better eco option.
