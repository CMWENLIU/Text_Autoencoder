I wish I had know that this product was changed in a very significant way. We were buying the freeze dried liver for training treats. It was real liver, diced into small pieces that were easy to transport and carry. The product now, with the misleading description of "ceter cut", is processed liver that has been stamped out. It is soft and extremely crumbly, and is reduced to powder in my pockets in no time. Comparison of the empty container with this new one showed no difference at all except for an adhesive label placed on the cover over the old one. I called the company to ask about the product change; the rep explained they changed the product to the processed one and said customer feedback indicates people don't like it. She said the regular, natural liver is still made, and is available at a national chain pet store, but not on Amazon. She kept apologizing, and was unable to explain to me why a correct description is not on the container; at this price, I would have appreciated a coupon toward the regular product at the pet store, since I have a 3/4 tub of the crumbly stuff that I can't use. I wish Amazon would carry the "old" product also, with an accurate description. Based on what she said, that is the product with the customer following.
