False advertising on the box. I bought a 7 oz. box showing off a gorgeous picture of beautiful holiday striped candy. I opened the box to find five pieces of plain ALL ONE COLOR ribbons of candy: Yellow, green, white, orange, pink, and. and one single piece was orange and white. Plain boring Lollypop flavors. Plus the orange solid and the orange with a white stripe were exactly the same orange flavor.<br /><br />Where were the gorgeous waves of mixed bright holiday colored ribbons as the photo on the box shows off? This is not what I expect when I spend money on ribbon candy. This company pretty much has had the market cornered for years, and years ago used to put out a good product of beautiful candy. Like everything else these days, it's been dumbed down to plain and boring. The only thing that looked like Christmas candy, was the ribbon shape.<br /><br />When I was a kid I remember my mother buying ribbon candy and they looked like the box photo and had rich flavors like the above, but also spicy flavors of wintergreen, peppermint, and anise and hot cinnamon. The current boring lemon, lime, orange, weak cinnamon, and an indistinguishable flavor in white ribbon, are not worth the money. Buy a cheap bag of suckers and save your money.<br /><br />If they still make other flavors they should package 12 shorter ribbons of mixed variety instead of 6 longer ribbons of common lollypop flavors.
