Sometimes when my husband talks about his childhood and things he liked way back then - he mentions licorice allsorts.  So I was excited to be able to buy him some of these treats from Amazon.  Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed in the quality of the product.  The candy was stale and looked and tasted "old".  We picked out a few edible pieces and kept the rest in a tin for a while but then ended up throwing it out because we knew it would not be eaten.  Shortly afterwards I was in Home Goods and found very fresh and nicely packaged licorice allsorts for a great price.  We love Amazon and buy almost everything from this site - but the licorice allsorts were not a success.
