LOOKING TO GAIN WEIGHT? I wasn't. My favorite smoothie to order is the PB and Strawberry, but they use this product. After 2 smoothies 2x week for two weeks, that's what 4 cups total. My weight has gone up! I'm a size 4, 5'6, 119 lbs. I'm a fitness, health freak, so when my weight goes up, something is wrong! What is it, then? SOY. Anytime I have eaten soy, my tush, thighs, and hips grow rapidly. Soy is a phytoestrogen, a plant estrogen. Women, like me, will put on pounds (around the ovaries: hips, thighs, tush) when consumed. Clifbars are a no no for me, too. This 'magic' low-cal low-fat 'peanut butter' is half soy! I am taking my organic PB to the smoothie shop, so I can have the real deal. The fat in the peanut is good unsaturated fats, why would you want less? Also, a tip. If you would like to feel great, and lose weight fast, try eating according to blood type! I went from 132 to 119 in two weeks! Google it!<br /><br />Ciao!
