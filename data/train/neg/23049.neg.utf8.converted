In early 2010, I noticed the product's Healthy Choice Label had been updated with a revised product photo, showing bigger chunks of ham and vegetables. Unfortunately, the soup was also reformulated to include huge pieces of tasteless ham and way too many big chunks of potatoes as the main vegetable.<br /><br />I confirmed with the manufacturer, ConAgra, that the soup had been, indeed, reformulated. I told them how disappointed I was with their "improvement." They sent me a coupon for more of this rubbish.
