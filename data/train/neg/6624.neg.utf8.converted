This is the second time to purchase rio Rancho bowls... we liked the flavor so well...however on both occassions bowls were broken... the first time 3out of six... this last time five out of six... so broken we just had chips!...<br />While many would say..is it the manufacturers problem.... the question is..how do other companies package shells without breaking...<br />No company website and no response from a written letter sooo I would say I am done with rio rancho... they are now called rio raunchy in the way they handle client complaints..<br />parker ..stillwater ok
