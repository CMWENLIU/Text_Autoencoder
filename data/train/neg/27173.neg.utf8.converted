I ordered based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews and the quality of other Kashi products I tried.  Regrettably, I was misled.  Mr. Baker's review is accurate and his 2-star rating is generous IMO.  Despite the flavorful ingredients listed on the package, this product is dry and extremely bland.  The only discernible flavor comes from the chocolate chips.
