I've been ordering Justin's from Amazon for well over a year now and the past month I've gotten bad batches of Honey and Maple Sugar Almond butter. It taste like the almonds are burnt, and the color of it is brownish red, much darker than normal. Kind of like comparing the outer skin of an almond and the inner nut colors. Best Buy dates are 3/8/12. Be on the lookout. I sent my product back to Justin's to check out.
