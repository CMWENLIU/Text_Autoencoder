I purchased this product which was fulfilled by Amazon.  I have written three notes about the "invalid" code I that came with my jar in order to procure the scoby that is part of what I purchased but must be shipped separately.  I have gotten no responses from anyone.  Someone is not minding the store.  It shouldn't be this difficult.  Besides taking two weeks to ship, what I have is of no use without the starter scoby, and I have no idea of how to get it at this point.  Kombucha Brooklyn doesn't even list a telephone number on their website.
