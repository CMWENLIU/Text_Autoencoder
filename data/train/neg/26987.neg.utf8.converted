Like at least one of the other reviewers, I also had severe problems with the gum sticking to my dental work. I found this gum to be impossible to chew because I have ONE crown on a molar.  The entire piece of gum stayed solidly stuck to the crown the whole time I was trying to chew it, forming a gum-coating on that one tooth.  I am sure that I can find someone to take this pack off my hands, but unfortunately, this one piece has been enough for me.  Other than that one issue, the gum seemed good and I think it would have been ok if I didnt have a crown.  :(
