These were my absolute favorite, but my most recent batch lost the honey for evaporated cane sugar.  Even my 3 year old noticed the difference in taste.  Little does he know the loss was not just in the taste.  Please Jennie's tell me it is temporary.  I cannot believe Arnold would make that decision.
