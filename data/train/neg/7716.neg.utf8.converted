I love Amazon, and they are always very competitive so I am shocked at this outrageous price for this product. Any search engine query for this same brand, product, and flavor will bring in much better prices, around 50 cents a cup. For 48 cups, Amazon's $39 price tag is just over 81 cents a cup!  I buy other k-cups from Amazon, but not for this flavor/brand.
