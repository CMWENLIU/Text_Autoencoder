I usually like Kitchens of India items but this one is a waste. Perhaps it the difficulty in packaging cooked rice or whatever, but I haven't found anyone with a good (non-frozen, Indian food) rice entree.<br />Having said that, one package of this is 580 Calories and 50% of your daily recommended saturated fat intake. Its greasy-spicy and I think the only thing I can do with the other 5 packets is to add one packet at a time to a batch of rice in the rice cooker.
