I should have read the reviewers' comments before making this purchase.  When the label states "Pure Vanilla Powder", to me that means just that.  Nope.  As you will see after your purchase when you look at the jar, it has 2 ingredients.  The first is Maltodextrin, and the second is Vanilla Bean Extractives.  It tastes very good but you have to use a fair amount since it's been cut rather severely.  The manufactures of this product should be honest and indicate that Maltodextrin is the primary ingredient.
