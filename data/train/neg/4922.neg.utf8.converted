I am a huge Special K fan. Especially Red Berry, but at heart I am a chocoholic. I was so excited to hear they had a chocolate version and I ran right out to try it. It is your average Special K flakes but with the addition of "Chocolate Pieces". The problem is they leave a horrible waxy coating in your mouth because of the poor quality chocolate. I am sure this is because it has to stay healthy but I would rather have a Fat Free Chocolate Jello 100 calorie pack then deal with the feeling it leaves in your mouth. So back to red berry for me!
