I order this prodcut to make a graduation favor with and needed them to be in their original shape.  Many of them had obviously melted in shipping and were squished and broken.<br />I realize it was summer and they are chocolate, but I have ordered chocolate from other companies before who alway had some type of ice pack in the box.  I assumed this would be same.  There was no ice pack or any attempt at keeping the chocolate from melting.<br />The order did come when expected, but not how expected.
