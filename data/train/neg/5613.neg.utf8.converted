This is naturally sweet and tasty, but doesn't taste like real coconut water.  Tastes vanilla-y as another reviewer has said.  This product would be great for those who don't like the taste of real coco water and want a masked taste.<br /><br />I have tried all major brands -- Zico, One, and VitaCoco.  Zico in the tetrapak comes closest to tasting like the natural product (not the Zico in the bottles, which tastes great but contains additives -- when a manufacturer changes packaging claiming improved, you can be sure something major has changed).  But I have received 2 bad cases of Zico so am leery to order it again.  Both bad batches were on sale, so beware of coco water coupons -- company may be trying to ditch stock.<br /><br />VitaCoco rates about B+ -- sometimes has a pulpy taste, like they scraped too close to the coconut shell when they extracted the juice.  The one time I tried One, I didn't like, but a friends swears by it so I should probably try again.  So I guess for now, I'll order VitaCoco by the case.<br /><br />ps.  I grew up in a tropical country and drank a LOT of coco water right out the shell.
