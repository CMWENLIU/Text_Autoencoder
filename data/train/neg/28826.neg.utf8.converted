I ordered this product on 11/18/10 just got it today 11/24/10. Upon opening these 3 boxes the expiration date is 11/24/10.<br /><br />After calling the vendor and being on the same hold mode for 10 minutes, a rep Adina got on the phone. I provided her with every detail I had. She advised me to take a pic & send it to them. I told her I would not feed my daughter anything expired and she told me she would. Rep told me I could find their e-mail address on the packing slip rather than being professional to give it to me herself. (Probably feeding HER kids expired food as she told me she would) digusting!!!<br /><br />To say the least, I know that when I hit the send button when I e-mailed her 3 pics of the dates AND my packing slip, I will not get a replacement of it. I don't feel that this young, inexperienced young woman, should be representing/selling a billion dollar empire as Amazon.<br /><br />Needless to say, I do expect what Adina promised which was a replacement of the muffins, and quote "you can keep what you have, I don't care". As a business woman, I remained composed and mature.<br /><br />If it isn't from Amazon direct, be sure it is a reputable company. Next time I'll just go to the supermarket for this item!!!<br /><br />Perhaps Natural Health Shoppe can give a course of proper customer service to their workers. Take a lesson from Amazon reps, they are wonderful.<br /><br />Disappointed from Brooklyn!!<br />Melissa
