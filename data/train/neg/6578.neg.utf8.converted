I bought this rice (for $9.98)expecting to receive 10 5oz bags for the price.  The same thing in most stores cost $1.50 max.<br /><br />Luckily Amazon gave me a full refund (even though you are not allowed to return food).<br /><br />I would not buy this product via Amazon again. I'll just get it from my local story for 1/8 the price. a couple weeks after I bought this product the company lowered the price by 50%! Ha!
