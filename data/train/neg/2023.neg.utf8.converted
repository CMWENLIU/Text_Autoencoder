Unfortunately, I didn't see the other reviews warning that the image falsely advertises brown cubes and am now stuck with 4 boxes of white cubes that I do not want. Not happy. Amazon, or whoever is the supplier, needs to change the photo so that it correctly displays the white cubes.  I feel like the victim of a bait and switch scheme!
