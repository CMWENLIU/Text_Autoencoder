the tree is like a twig!! it is so small.  so not worth the money. i ordered another bonzai tree from another company and it was so much better.  this is a twig they stick in the ground.  if it wasn't so much trouble i'd return it.  IT'S NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE>  not even remotely close to it.  i don't write too many reviews but this has got to be one of my worst purchase.
