The broth itself is great. the packaging and delivery are awful. While I had a case delivered, 3 of the boxes were damaged in shipment and we ended up with chicken stock all over the place leaking. Not worth it, better to just buy at a warehouse store than in bulk where shipping can easily damage the item.
