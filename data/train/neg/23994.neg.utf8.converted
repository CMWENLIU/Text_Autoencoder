I bought these a while ago but did not have a chance to cook them until now. I decided to make porcini mushroom lasagna for Christmas, and, what do you know, had to scrap that idea after trying to rehydrate the porcini. To spare you from the unpleasant details, "infested" is quite inadequate to describe the extent of it... What I should have done is rehydrate a few right away and return this garbage back...
