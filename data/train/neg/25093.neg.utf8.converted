I was sort of excited to try these because licorice is one of my favorite sweets & I'm always eying up new flavors to try out. This just sort of seemed a natural fit for me as far as a vine review goes.<br /><br />The good thing is that the texture to these are pretty good. It's nice & chewy without being too chewy or too soft. It's a happy medium, although I do recommend that you try to get these as fresh as possible since I can't imagine trying to eat these when they've a little old or have been exposed to air & not stored properly.<br /><br />The bad thing is that these just have this funky aftertaste to them. The basic taste is fine enough. It doesn't taste like pomegranate & normally I'd be OK with this since candy often labels things "watermelon" or "strawberry" when it doesn't taste anything remotely like the fruit. Since this is supposed to be mostly organic & natural, I really expected it to taste more like actual pomegranate. Then there's the occasional weird aftertaste these have to them that's somewhat unpleasant. I can't really explain it but it's not a taste that I'd really care to have in my mouth.<br /><br />One thing I do want to mention is that out of the 11 ingredients in this product, only 3 are organic. That doesn't bother me much, but I know that there are some people who get irritated at how some labels mention "organic" but only a small part of it is actually organic. At that point you really can't call the product organic since it has non-organic product in it. (There's no USDA organic label on this anywhere, if you were wondering, which can only be put on if a certain percentage of the product is organic.) Note that this product didn't have "made with organic ingredients" on it, just "made with organic sugar". The people who label watch for organic products will know what that means. I mention all of this because I know some are very picky about product that have organic anywhere on it.<br /><br />Overall I wasn't really that enthusiastic about this product. It wasn't horrible but I can safely say that I probably won't be buying any of these in the future. I might & I stress *might* try one of the other flavors, but that'd only be if the price was right.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Updated to say that I won't be buying any of this in the future. The licorice I ate later is really making me feel a little gross. Like another reviewer said, it's just sitting there like a pile of lead & is giving me some pretty bad indigestion. If you have a cast iron stomach (which admittedly mine isn't as strong as it once was but is still pretty good), then you probably won't have a problem with this. This has to be the first licorice product that has remained unfinished in my house ever.
