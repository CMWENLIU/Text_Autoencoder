Since my family loves Spam (fried for sandwiches) I thought I would try this product for a change of pace. Not sure, really, what I expected but was not sold on this at all. Did not have the taste of regular Spam but did not have the taste of roasted turkey either. Not sure what it tasted like. I proceeded to prepare it as I always do for sandwiches....heated up a non-stick skillet and sliced the product. Now I realize that this product is leaner than the regular Spam, and having said that I know now that I should have sprayed the skillet with a non-stick spray such as Pam. The product stuck to the pan like crazy and I was not able to fry it up evenly. This gave the procuct a mushy texture that was not pleasing. If you try it make sure you spray your pan first to avoid the sticking. Again, while eating it I was trying to figure out what it tasted like......still not sure. Had origianlly gotten this on subscribe and save but I thinkl I will cancel and just remain with the old standby..the original.
