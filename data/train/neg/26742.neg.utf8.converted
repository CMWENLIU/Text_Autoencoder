My dog loves Newman's Chicken and rice organic dog food, which I have Amazon ship every 2 months. She also loves the Happy Hips brand of treats. I was excited to see Newman also offered treats, so I tried the Salmon and sweet potato. Unfortunately, she does not like this product, probably because it is in biscuit form.<br /><br />Now I somehow have to make her eat these over the next several months, even if I have to grind them up and put in her regular food.
