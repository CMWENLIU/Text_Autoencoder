Ordered two packages.  Each was supposed to have four bags.  One package was opened and one bag was missing.  Whoever boxed the two packages must have been hungry and helped themselves to one.  In addition, they were overpriced.  I see them at the checkout counter at WalMart for $3 a bag.  Do the math.
