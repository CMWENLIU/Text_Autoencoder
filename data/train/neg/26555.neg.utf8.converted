When added to coconut milk/fish sauce it just makes it tastes like spicy coconut milk. The flavor it adds is minimal. It would make it disgustingly spicy for a sweet dish if I put enough of it in to actually make it taste like panang.<br /><br />Ingredients: Garlic, chili, sugar, onion, lemongrass, dextrose, salt ....<br /><br />the most used ingredients aren't exactly exotic, and the other stuff probably is in low enough quantities that its overpowered by the strength of the garlic chili and onion. It either has too much salt and sugar or too little of the special ingredients that makes panang panang. Do not buy this junk.
