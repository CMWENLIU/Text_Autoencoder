I ordered these snacks because I had tried the apple cinnamon kind and loved them so much. The apples were crispy and delicious and the nutrition information was very reasonable with low calories, no fat, and high fiber. Based on the strength of the apple snacks, I went ahead and ordered the bake-dried mangos. And because I love mangos, I ordered a lot--35 dollars worth to be exact.<br />Imagine my dissapointment when I finally got the snacks and they were nothing like the apples. Instead of being crispy and light, they have a tough leathery texture that is completely unappealing. Worse, they have a strange, bitter aftertaste that lingers in the mouth after you eat some. No one in my house wants anything to do with these extremely nasty snacks. Even my son, who loves all kinds of dried fruit, won't touch them.<br />What a waste of money! I will never order from this company again. Buyer beware.
