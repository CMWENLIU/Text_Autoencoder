The product is fine. But the description is misleading. Each package contains "40 count," that is, 40 filters. But this is not a "(Pack of 12)," as you would think from the description, from the price reduction (from $23.88 to $1.93), and from the shipping weight (4.20 lbs). It's just one box of 40 filters. And you'll pay, as I did, $11 for FedEx to bring you this one box.<br /><br />Soon after I submitted this feedback, I was issued a partial refund of $7. Product description still needs correcting, but at least customer service was responsive.
