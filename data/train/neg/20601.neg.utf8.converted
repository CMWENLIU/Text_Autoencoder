I purchased this for my husband because he likes the name brand Ideal which is made from xylitol.  This isn't the same as Ideal.  The texture is different and it has an aftertaste.  It tasted like and the texture also reminded me of Truvia which I do not like at all.  If you like Truvia (made from the stevia plant) then this will work for you but if you are looking for something comparable to Ideal (xylitol) this is not for you.
