I have fed BB for 3yrs and right now I have my yorkie at the vet with Kidney stones and not that long ago I lost my 4yr old Yorkie to kidney stones the vet said it was poor diet well all they eat is BB so I googled BB cause kidney stones and I was shocked at what it brought up !!!!! I have 3 Yorkies left and they will be removed from this killer food asap ..to me it is not a fluke as I said all my dogs get is BB so do your research...
