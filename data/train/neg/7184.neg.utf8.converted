We got this Vanilla coffee hoping it would be a good coffee. Hubby brews the pot as one of those lovely breakfast in bed scenes. Smells good as it's perking in the pot. I smell the cup when he places at my bedside table. I cannot describe exactly what I was tasting...Perfume...Chicory...something not so good. Down the drain it goes. Thinking we might need to make it stronger....maybe it will taste good this time??? NOPE. Down the drain. Rinse pot. Add our usual Starbucks Beans for the next pot in anticipation of a good cuppa and it still tastes like the awful vanilla. I've had to send the pot through its clean cycle now. Tomorrow we will try our regular beans again and hopefully we won't be reminded of that awful vanilla.....
