The bully sticks were otherwise fine, except the tons of MAGGOTS in the package.  Seriously.  Gross.<br /><br />I don't know what kind of quality control failure leads to a bunch of maggots eating the bully sticks inside the package, BUT safe to say I now consider this brand to not be of the "Finest Quality" they claim to be.<br /><br />Won't be purchasing this brand again.  Didn't even bother with a refund.
