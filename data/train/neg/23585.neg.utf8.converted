I was eating Earth Balance Natural Peanut Butter for a while, but couldn't resist jumping on a Skippy sale. The taste is by far completely different compared to the Earth Balance. Reading the ingredients on the Skippy jar, I realized there was added sugar and hydrogenated oils. I admit, I have a sweet tooth, but the amount of sugar added here must be used to cover up the filler. You're getting less actual peanut butter and more oil and sugar than other brands. I really liked the taste of the Earth Balance much better as Skippy tasted like candy (which is prob why kids prefer it). Pass on this junk food and ween yourself off the sugar intake. I'll use this to fill the Kong toy for my dogs.
