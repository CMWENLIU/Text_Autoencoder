There's nothing wrong with Earth's Best baby foods if you're looking specifically for a wide variety of organic foods and are willing to pay more for that option. However, if you're looking for the best deal monetarily, Earth's Best is rarely the best option. When I saw this large package deal on amazon and looked at the weight listed (11.1 lbs), I did some math and thought I'd be getting 6 oz jars, putting these on the pricey end, but reasonable enough. However, the package I received -- two flats of 12 4 oz. jars of baby food -- had each flat labeled 3 lbs. I'm not sure how two 3 lb. flats become 11.1 lbs, but the result is that I ended up with far less baby food than the weight implied.<br /><br />If you're a regular Earth's Best user and are willing to shell out the extra money for organic baby food to be delivered to your door, this is probably a fine product for you. If you're a mom like me who's looking for ways to cut costs, this isn't one of them.
