I don't get these other reviewers, but at least I know I'm not alone in that my wife also did not enjoy this product...<br /><br />1) There is no lobster in this soup and the flavoring is listed as an almost last ingredient - crab seasoning is listed much higher.<br />2) This tastes NOTHING like lobster and is a salty, flavorless mess. I love lobster as much as the next person, but this didn't even resemble lobster flavor.<br /><br />I'm not a picky eater and neither is my wife - but this soup was just not good at all. I've only tried one other Nong Shim bowl, the Spicy Chicken, and that one was pretty good. But the best one (by far that I've tasted so far) is the Gourmet Spicy Picante. It doesn't come in a bowl, but this soup is like night and day compared to the bowl soups. The flavor is better and the noodles are thicker and better tasting.
