Bought this to ship overseas to a long time cheese head. It looked like a good deal and liked the variety. When I received it though, I was surprised. The size of each cheese sample is only 2 oz and about 2-3 bites for someone. The sausages are only 5 oz each. About 4-5 bites. I then noticed something that was disconcerting and that was each cheese sample is labeled "Pasteurized Process Cheese Food"!!!<br /><br />There is no self respecting cheese head that would eat cheese food in lieu of the real thing!<br /><br />Try something else
