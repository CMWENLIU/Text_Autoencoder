I had been getting this product on subscribe and save for over a year.  The first couple of shipments had great quality.  The food was in half inch squares with a thick gravy.  With the middle shipments the food was cut in little slices but still had a thick gravy.  The last shipment the food was mush with running gravy.  I cancelled my subscription.
