I bought twelve of these a year ago.  I was VERY happy with these lamps since they give out such true sunlight.  The carton says that they should last for 5 years, assuming 3 hours of use seven days a week.  My usage pattern is just that.  But then they started burning out - four are done with already, in less than year.  Given how pricey these are, I am just not happy that these last just around a year.
