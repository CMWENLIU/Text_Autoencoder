As Ginger is good to settle a stomach and, when I eat a Larabar Ginger Snap or a few Ginger cookies, it seems to satisfy my hunger, I had great expectations! I tried this cold and hot. I got a BLAST of Ginger heat in the back of my throat (expected) but no residual Ginger after taste,just an odd taste from the sugar (we use very little sugar so maybe just me). I had hoped to satisfy hunger but it doesnt seem to do that at all & seemed to MAYBE upset my stomach a little. Packaging quality & content uniformity is very good & dissolved quickly. I will be throwing the rest away partly because it is made in China and I am nervous about food items from there.
