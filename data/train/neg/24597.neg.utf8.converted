Roland Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce have a strange and unpleasant, vaguely chemical taste that is hard to describe, slightly metallic, perhaps an artificial smoke flavor or dried spices.  Roland doesn't generally manufacture their own products but private-labels those from other manufacturers and I have to wonder who cans these.<br /><br />Other brands that I have tried like San Marcos and Casa Fiesta are much better and cleaner tasting.  My advice is to buy one of those brands or at least try one can before committing to a case of these if you haven't tasted them.<br /><br />Besides this fatal flavor flaw they are pretty much the same as any other chipotle in adobo, nice whole peppers swimming in sauce, smoky and addictive to people who like to eat hot peppers.  They will squirt when you bite them so I usually cut them in half in the kitchen.<br /><br />Bottom line, I have been using them in recipes where they lend heat and the flavor will be buried but I can't eat them with chips or use them as a sauce on top of anything because of the flavor and I won't be ordering them again.
