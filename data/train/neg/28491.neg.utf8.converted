People who take candy seriously are a vulnerable group.  So why name a straightforward candy "nerds"?  It seems like you are poking fun at your supporters.  Especially for the sour ones (which are I think the best), the conventional thing would be to call them something like "McGillicutty's" and have a picture of a scowling Irishman.  The candy itself is just going to be sugar, corn syrup, stabilizers and some flavoring--the name is what gives you a sense of what it is.<br /><br />In general, the Wonka lines have been a depressing experience.  First, no one should have been so cynical as to use the name "Willy Wonka" for real candy.  It's like Fruit of the Loom having "Thomas Jefferson" briefs.  And I'll get back to that.  But second, the candy has consistently been uninventive, third rate, and with no particular appeal.  All it does is drag W.W.'s image into the ground as opposed to it being an inspiration.<br /><br />And as we all know, Wonka is now actually a part of Nestle's.  Now as someone previously in the candy business, I have to say that Nestle's main-line and high-quality line products in the candy/chocolate world are pretty good.  But as a company, Nestle is a nightmare--poisoning pets, starving babies.  If Nestle owned the real Willy Wonka factory, the Oompa-Loompas would turn out to be slaves.  I just can't understand a world in which Nestle owns the right to put out low grade candy and call it Willy Wonka.<br /><br />Willy Wonka represented the dream of doing good, being a child, and being honest.  That was why Charlie got the factory--because he precisely wasn't the kind of guy who would go far in Nestle's.  I feel like in this product, Nestle is basically saying to Charlie, "you're a nerd!  Maybe you can work in the tech department programming the payroll computers!  But you sure as heck can't run the factory and we're not interested in any of your spacey ideas!"<br /><br />And one last thing--if you're my age, you've probably had to listen, more than you wanted to, to the song "Nurds" (the spelling was "charmingly" wrong) by the Roches.  Now if there's one thing you don't want associated with your candy product, it's roaches.  Animal contamination is always a real threat, and it's often not taken seriously enough.  So, Nestle, when you were done with your ethically-dubious activities in the third world, you somehow chose a name for a candy that would both spit in the face of Charlie Bucket and make the consumer queasy.  Who's running this show? [15]
