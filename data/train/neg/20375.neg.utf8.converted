The popocorn itself was exceptional, among the best caramel corn I've ever eaten.  Unfortunately, the shipping is another matter entirely.  The contents of my box were a sticky tangle of torn bags and melted caramel.  This happened not once but twice.  Out of a total of 12 bags there was one that was salvagable.  Amazon's return policy is terrific, but if something can't be delivered then it shouldn't be sold.
