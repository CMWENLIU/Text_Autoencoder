I tried to make a big batch of this and it was a complete failure. I've made Casbah brand falafel for years and NEVER had a problem.  I followed the instructions properly, but when the "balls" were put into the hot oil, they completely fell apart.  The "beach sand" comparison made by another reviewer was bang on.  I tried to salvage the mix I had made up by making little patties and frying them in a skillet, but they fared no better.  Made a good faith effort, and got inedible results.  I'd love to know how anyone else followed their instructions and got them to hold together.  I bought a bulk amount and have lost my money.  I'm SO going back to Casbah.
