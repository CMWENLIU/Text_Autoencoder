When I think of Chicken Pot Pie I drool over the chicken and vegetables and pie crust along with the delicious gravy.  Now take all that away and add FAT noodles instead.  That is what is in this terrible soup.....just fat noodles.  It does have a nice flavor but I soon realized that, after not having a migraine in over a year, it was this soup that caused me to have a migraine for two days.  The large amount of 'yeast extract', in other words MSG, that is in it caused my migraine.  How can an ORGANIC soup have such an artificial chemical neurotoxin in it and still be considered organic?  I will donate the remaining cans to the food pantry and hope they like 'noodles' and MSG.  I will never purchase this soup nor this brand again but be my guest and give it a try.  I think you'll regret it though.
