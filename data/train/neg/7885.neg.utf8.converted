The description of the product says "breakfast blend" so I expected something that would actually provide a bit of a caffine wake-up... but when you actually receive the box you find out it's also described as "mild." (Had I known this, I never would have ordered this to start with.) When you actually taste it, you find out "mild" is a vast overstatement -- the "coffee" tastes like warm brown water with no character whatsoever. Since none of the 47 K-cups remaining (there are 3 coffee drinkers here -- all agree it's not worth a second cup) can't be returned, guess I'll save it for company who really don't want any coffee but are interested in how the brewer itself works.  Then we'll throw out the end product.
