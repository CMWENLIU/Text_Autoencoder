I have bought sticky traps like this before and though they don't seem to catch hoards of the little buggers there are at least a few in there. After two weeks of seeing a cloth moth or two flying around my closet every time I go in there the trap still has not one moth in it. Maybe the attractant or sticky was too old on this batch.
