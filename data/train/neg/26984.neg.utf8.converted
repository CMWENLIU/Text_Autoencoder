I was excited to try this from Annie's. I love some of the other items they have and was expecting that quality. My experience was only so-so. This kit is called Cheesy Lasagna and the picture on the box certainly seemed to fit the bill. What I got was something brown and not really cheesy. It tasted okay but I agree with another reviewer and would consider this more of a hamburger dish. I'll continue to try some of the other Annie's products but I will not purchase this one again.
