Walden Farms seems to be a really hit-or-miss company. Some of their products are downright DELICIOUS (see: their pancake syrup) but some are absolutely disgusting (see: this product). I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking to simulate caramel taste, texture, or flavor--in fact I wouldn't recommend it to ANYONE, at all, unless you like the taste of chemicals. This stuff made me sick to my stomach after ingesting only a tiny amount. Go with the syrup instead!
