I purchased a Saeco Coffee grinder/maker the end of Sept 2011. It is now running continous w/o being able to turn off the grinder -- I called and found out that Saeco was bought by Phillips and they are NOT honoring warrantees on Saeco product but if I go through lots of hoops they MAY issue a refund in 3-4 weeks if they can process my order?????
