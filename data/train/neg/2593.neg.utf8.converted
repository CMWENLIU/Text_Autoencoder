A local grocer recently had a display of various flavors of these bars. I read all the labels and was surprised to find that most of them said that they contained between only 82 to 90 percent raw ingredients.  I'm trying to keep 100% raw while I (hopefully) recover from an illness, so the only flavor I purchased was the one that did not say it was less than 100% raw- the hazelnut chocolate.  I was very pleased that it was delicious and satisfying. I intended to make it my breakfast five days a week during my commute, and perhaps see if I could buy cases of it.<br /><br />Then the first box arrived today. The top of the box read "90.6% raw."  I was surprised and disappointed that I had missed that on the label in the store. Concerned that I was losing cognitive function, I went to my garbage box of non-compostable-nor-recyclables and found the wrapper from last week. I examined it carefully and it did not mention that these contain 9.4% cooked ingredients. I opened the box that had just arrived and saw that the bar labels were the same as last week: no mention of non-raw ingredients.<br /><br />Note their legal disclaimer on this site:<br /><br />"Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product."<br /><br />-- They may want to add that you should also not rely on the info on their labels.<br /><br />I don't recall seeing the 90.6% figure on this site last week. I don't have evidence that they didn't have it posted here, but as you can see from this review I'm a pretty obsessive reader of info about the things I eat.<br /><br />In sum:  Their labeling is misleading about the raw content of the hazelnut chocolate bar. At the very least, given what I've experienced and what they seem to feel they need to place in their legal disclaimer, I don't believe this brand is worthy of the trust of the people I care about just yet.  I hope very much that changes, and that I can buy their products in the future. For now I'm boycotting until they are more honest in their labeling and less disingenuous in their branding.  Hopefully, eating raw will help me to live to see that day.  Godspeed, Raw Revolution.
