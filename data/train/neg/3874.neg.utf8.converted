It leaked so bad the UPS delivery guy did not even deliver -they said that they will send it back to Amazon directly. (It also damaged other goods packed in the same box!) I ordered a replacement. The second one leaked again! This time UPS delivered it (to let me see for myself?) It was BAD. I did not want to return leaked oil so I tried to use the leftover but NO mist came out - only big drops! It is much cheaper to buy regular canola oil in bottle than a "mister"  that leak and give no mist.  Will not buy this product again.
