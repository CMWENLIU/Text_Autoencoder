coffee, is wifey and my favorite hobby we utilize most of the known ways of preparing it and we scour the net and shops for the perfect bean.  i recognize that most of our likes come from what we grew up tasting and drinking, so our coffee tastes are compared to folgers or butternut, however we have made an effort to expand our coffee palettes over the years.  that said i prepared the coffee using a Vietnamese coffee filter system and it was not drinkable, i tried using the chemex system which usually yields a mild result and still no good. french press, nope.  next step is a cold brew which often makes the worst and cheapest beans drinkable, if that doesnt work, i'll give the can to my brother in law, he will hate it but not admit it because he thinks he is a sophisticated drinker of exotic coffees i give him all my nasty beans. lol.<br /><br />i watched a program put on by illy on creating good beans (actually my favorite espresso bean is lavazza super crema) anyway they talked about a bean they called a 'stinker' thats a bean that if it finds its way into the blend will ruin the blend.  i have found beans like that they have a cheezy smell to them. it could be possible that my can of trung nguyen had many 'stinkers' oh well, do keep in mind that when it comes to taste, whether its food, recipes, or coffee and its infinite varieties of preparation, what makes me gag, may be another persons absolute favorite.<br /><br />try it for yourself, one can wont break you, if you dont like it you could use it to sepia stain your black and white photographs or i'll give you the address of my brother in law.
