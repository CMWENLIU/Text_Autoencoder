After our father died, my sister inherited Duke, our dad's 4 month old orange tabby kitten.  My sister kept him for over a year, but decided she couldn't keep him anymore, so in 2010, I grudgingly adopted him.  (I'm sentimental and couldn't let a cat that once belonged to our dad end up in the hands of strangers.)  I am a rabid dog fanatic.  I like cats, but don't have the same enthusiasm for them that I do with dogs.  I never had a feline companion of my own, so Duke became my "starter cat".  Well, I turned out to be lucky.  Duke is not the hide-under-the-bed-and-hiss kind of cat.  He's adorable, funny, affectionate, and loves Slappy, my elderly German Shepherd mix.  He's definitely a keeper and I love him to pieces.  He's three years old now, and he's stuck with me for life.<br /><br />So, being that Duke is my first cat, everything is a learning process.  I thought that semi-solid, extremely smelly poop was simply a variation of the norm for cats.  I was feeding Duke Before Grain, pretty much since the day I got him.  Duke liked it and had no problem scarfing it down.  (The little fattie will eat anything.)  I liked the quality ingredients and the lack of filler grains.  Meanwhile, his "Litter Box of Horrors" was a nightmare to clean.  The stench was overpowering.  Duke would do his business and the poop would stick to his legs.  I had to throw him in the shower several times a month.  Eventually, I had to follow him around the house with baby wipes after he used his litter box or else he'd leave stinky poop stains on my floor, couch, bed, or carpet.  I simply figured that since he's fat, he couldn't clean himself well.  I never attributed it to the food.  Why would I?  I assumed I was giving him the best.<br /><br />Last year, he was treated for a urinary blockage caused by struvite crystals.  Then, a few months ago, while wiping his butt with baby wipes, I found blood.  Quite a bit of it.  I opened his litter box, and his stool was covered in blood.  Off to the vet we went.  No problems detected.  Lots of money spent.  I was told to put him on Hill's Science Diet.  That stuff is garbage and if ANY vet tells you to put your cat or dog on it, it's time to find a new vet.  Anyway, the bloody poop happened again a few days later.  I decided that yes, I was going to change his diet, but no, it wouldn't be Hill's Science Diet.  Taste of The Wild ended up being my choice.  Within days, all the problems went away.  Duke has very firm stool now, there's no blood, the litter box stench is more tolerable, and no more "Hershey's Kisses" on everything he sits on.  No more baby wipes and showers, so I don't have to hear his mournful cries when he's subjected to being scrubbed down.<br /><br />I'm not saying that B.G. is a bad food, but I'm saying it was a very bad option for me and my cat.  There was something in there that my cat couldn't tolerate.  I won't buy it again.  I'll keep him on a combination of TOTW and raw.  It works for him.
