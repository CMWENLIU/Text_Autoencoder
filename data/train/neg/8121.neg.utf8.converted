I received my gift basket today. I bought it to send to my father who is 84 years old and really enjoys his snacks. I forgot to have it shipped to him and I am so glad I did. I was absolutely mortified at how little was in this pathetic basket. I could have bought these items and made a much prettier basket for 1/4 th of the price I paid. I am very disappointed. Money is very tight this year and I am disabled. This was a very special purchase for me. I am not sending it on to him, I would be too embarrassed. He would never believe it cost [...] and I can not believe it either. I don't have time to return itbut I just had to let you know what a huge disappointment it was. Merry Christmas, Patty Crotwell
