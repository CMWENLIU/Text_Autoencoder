If you like dried manogos, don't buy these because they are not.  they may have started out as mangos but by the time they were mashed, sugared, colored, and shaped they resembled mangos and tasted like sawdust with a lot of sugar and some flavor that vaguely resembled mangos.  After my experience with this company, I will never do business with them again.
