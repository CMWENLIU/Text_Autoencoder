Again, I did see reviews, but wanted to try myself...the smell, texture and taste is so wrong. It leaves the worst taste in your mouth and the similarity to peanut butter is about 10%. People say, 'what do you expect, it's a no calorie peanut butter butter?' But come on, there's no excuse for that taste!
