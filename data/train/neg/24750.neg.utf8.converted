So I read the reviews before and saw ths issue of the hieght of my counter and my Keurig vs adding this drawer. I measured it out and there was going to be enough room to actually allow my Keurig to function. However, once I recieved it, I realized I have to slide it out every time to make a cup of coffe. The drawer is oddly measured because my K-Cups fit inside with about half an inch of slack on each row. So when I do slide my Keurig out, the cups slide. Also, the rubberized "feet" underneath got caught on my granite countertop and I've already lost one. Since it was lopsided and not condusive to holding my $200 coffee pot, I just removed the rest of them. Now I have to try to pick up the thing to move it out or it'll scratch the counters. Honestly I might have to just give up on this and settle for something else!
