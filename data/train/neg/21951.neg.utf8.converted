Very disappointed. The stuff claimed to be safe for use on asphalt roofs. I used it, and it killed the moss alright, but many of my shingles curled and cracked the day after application. Now I'll be on the roof a full day replacing shingles when I should have been finishing up other projects. I'm feeling pretty upset that the the manufacturer would say it is safe for use on the roof when it obviously is not... Couldn't be more unhappy with it...
