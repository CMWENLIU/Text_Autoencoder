I have had several aerogardens over the last four years. I recently purchased two new 7 pod gardens (pro 100).  Up to this time I was a satisfied customer albeit you have to either read up on what grows best or just practice a lot.  Recently I received new universal grow pods that are supposed to fit in all the aerogarden models.  Despite what customer service says they do not fit well in my 7 pod.  Worse is that the new grow pods do not hold the grow medium near the top of the pod.  The new universal pods promote mold and rot and discourage germination.  Up to this point I would have highly recommended this product but not now or until they create a better grow pod.
