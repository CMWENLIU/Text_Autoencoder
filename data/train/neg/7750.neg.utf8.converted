They definitely have a very "fermented" or soured smell that made my nose burn when I opened it. They taste just as bad as they smell. I hadn't used cacao nibs before, so I figured this was just what they were like. Not the case! I went to Nuts.com to purchase some items for a trail mix and saw they had a sample pack of their own Cacao nibs for $2.50 (not sure on size, but it's lasted me awhile; I want to say the package holds about 4 oz). I ordered them with everything else and they are HEAVEN compared to the Navitas. They smell fresh, they taste fresh, and I've been using them in just about everything (about done with the sample pack, sadly!). They are also CHEAPER!! $12.99/lb. I haven't touched the Navitas since and actually just tossed the entire bag (sad to waste the money) out.
