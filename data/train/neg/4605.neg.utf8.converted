I have heard about the benefits of this type of fat and so finally bought some when it was on special here.  It was still sort of expensive, but I had heard so many good things about it, I bought it.  I now have a lot of it in my pantry!  The coconut flavor is VERY strong.  I thought that perhaps it would cook off, but it does not.  Nobody liked the flavor of coconut in food  that aren't supposed to have coconut.  Therefore, I only use it when I am cooking stir fry or Asian--then it is fine, but it is A LOT of product to have around for 2 or 3 meals a month.
