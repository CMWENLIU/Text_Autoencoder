This product is just gross. The whole thing is a sloppy, floppy mess. The rings are soggy, and the soy "meat balls" are never intact, and when you go to stir it in the pot, they instantly come apart and mix into the entire thing, and they don't even taste good. The flavor is gross. I would much rather eat regular spagettio's. Way too bland.
