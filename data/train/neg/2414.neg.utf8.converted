I purchased these for Halloween this year.  Most of the candy in the package was melted.  It had to have sat somewhere pretty warm for them to be as bad as they were.<br /><br />All the candy has 2012 expiration dates, so it isn't old.  It is just too bad that it was delivered in such poor condition. It will due, but I expected better.<br /><br />Candy count:<br /><br />Snickers: 41<br />Twix: 29<br />Crunch: 20<br />Plain M&M's: 16<br />Milky Way: 15<br />Almond Joy: 14<br />Kit Kat: 14<br />Peanut M&M's: 9<br />Reese's Peanut-butter cups: 6 ... (6? Really?  Weak.)<br /><br />Total: 164 - a bit more than 150, but the melted condition kills it for me.
