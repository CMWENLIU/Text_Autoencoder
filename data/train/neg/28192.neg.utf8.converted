Sorry to spoil the celebration, but for those not on a Gluten-free diet, this cake mix is sure to disappoint.<br />As other reviewers have mentioned, the batter is truely revolting, useful perhaps for a practical joke or poisoning the neighbors.  Unfortunately so much beaniness remains in the cooked item that the cake is not very palatable unless smothered with icing and icecream.  The texture is also slightly on the chewy side, although this could easily reflect my own poor baking skills.
