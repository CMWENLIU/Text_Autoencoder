The product is very bland to start with, and the few tidbits of clams included (believe the most i noticed in any given can was 5 pea size or smaller pieces), just leaves too much to be desired. What a disappointment<br />in this product to say the least, it may be healthy, which I don't really<br />believe, but there is certainly little quality except in the outrageous profit margin! Oh, but plenty of potatoes to fill the space, and they aren't very tasty either! Final thought, if you don't wish to be irritated, avoid this product, unless you like exceptionally overpriced<br />overrated and overvalued items!!
