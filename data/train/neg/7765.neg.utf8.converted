I ordered 2 dozen roses for Valentine's Day and on the page it says "in stock."  I get an email back 3 days later stating that the order was canceled and didn't state a reason.  Not only that but I check back to the page right after I get the cancellation and it still says "in stock."  Will never order flowers from this vendor or amazon again.  Don't get your hopes up!
