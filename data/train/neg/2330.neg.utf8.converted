A Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix sounds like a  real treat. I am a hot tea aficionado, but this mix was god-awful. I added it to water both hot and cold. It made everything taste like medicine. My wife refused to drink it at all, so repelled was she by the chemical odor. Although I generally like a lemon flavor, and use ginger in cooking, this combination as presented by Gold Kili is not meant for human consumption.
