Received two gifts of Omaha Steaks for Christmas and anxiously looked forward to a holiday meal of steak, twice-baked potatoes and apple tartlets.  However, the steaks were tough and very disappointing-the potatoes and tartlets were delicious.  My anticipation for future meals is now quite diminished.  I will, most definitely, share my experience with the gift givers.  Ins't that a shame?
