The ingredients list on the package says margarine, as in trans hydrogenated fat.  So not like the ingredients listed on Amazon (lists butter)and not like the traditional stroopwafeln - health reasons aside, they taste so much better with butter! I'm assuming this is true for all the stroopwafeln (Stroopie)shipped by this company - there seem to be several different sizes. To their credit though, they are going to look for real butter stroopwafeln to stock, and send me some for no charge. I'll let you know how it goes!
