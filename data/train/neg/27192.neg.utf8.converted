I don't know what it is about these cookies, but, they are NOT good at all. They're sort of bland, taste a little off, and cannot be doctored in any way to fix the problem. They taste nothing like the ones you can get online or in the mall. I ended up giving them away to family members in gift boxes to get rid of them. I will never ever purchase these again. The strange flavor was NOTHING like a white chocolate and macadamia nut cookie should taste like.
