Be forewarned! These gummy bears are tasty, but if you eat more than a couple at a time, you will get a bad tummy ache and diarrhea. On top of that, there are no nutritional information available, so who knows whether they are actually completely sugar free, and I also wonder about the carbohydrate content. Even my friend who is diabetic would not eat them because he said he would rather eat nothing than suffer with stomach cramps. I seriously only had a handful, and then about 2 hrs later, I got a terrible stomach ache and diarhea. I ended up throwing away the whole bag! What a waste of money!
