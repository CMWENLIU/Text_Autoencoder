I found this a few days ago when I was looking for a good snack to have around the house for not a whole lot of money.  The package came today.  I opened it up and had a few nuts.  they were chewy and smelled a bit off- both signs of staleness.  I checked the expiration date: 6/17/2012... It didn't make sense.  so I had a few more and wondered how I could make them palatable.  Eventually I came across some forums that said that staleness in nuts was the result of the oil turning rancid and hence is non-reversible.  Not to be defeated by something i bought to save money I did some more digging and found a forum that said that if you heat nuts at 350 for 10 minutes you can bring some life back into them.  I tried it and they came out burnt.  Tried again for 5 minutes instead of 10 and it worked.  They weren't perfect but they were crunchy and palatable which was a step up.  I give these 2 stars instead of 1 since they can be partially salvaged.  Too bad Amazon doesn't take returns on food.<br /><br />edit:<br />I just threw up.  I'm throwing these out and changing the review to one star.  Don't buy these if you value your GI tract.
