I never write reviews but this chocolate is so terrible I felt I needed to warn people away from this stuff.<br /><br />First, I was taken aback by the presence of soy.  It's really not needed, but whatever.<br /><br />Second, and more importantly, I'm not even certain there is actually cocoa in this.  I sure as heck didn't taste any.  My mouth was overwhelmed in a horrid menagerie of sweetness, alcohol, and a weird bitter fruity aftertaste.  In fact, I'm still trying to rid my mouth of the fruity aftertaste.  The sweetness is very overpowering for a 70% (supposedly) cacao bar, and worse of all it comes with an alcohol sting.  You know those sugar free diabetic chocolates?  Yeah, like that.  Yuckity yuck yuck.<br /><br />The aftertaste is...man, bad.  Really bad.  There are no adjectives in the English language to describe it.  Artificial fruit flavoring made by Satan...something like that.  With this nasty fruit taste comes the bitterness, but it isn't good bitter (like you find in cocoa) it is nightmarish.<br /><br />I don't know who is in charge of making this stuff, but I really think someone should lock them up.  5150 them.  They are, most likely, criminally insane.  This bar is a travesty.<br /><br />I'd really like to find an organic and fair trade substitute for my regular bar of chocolate; Lindt 90%.  I really expected this to be on par in quality (obviously a lot sweeter at only 70%) but instead I got a disgusting taste in my mouth and a stomachache.<br /><br />I seriously can't get over the fact that I tasted no cocoa.  How does this chocolate have so many rave reviews?  I must have fallen into a bizzaro universe where people throw ducks at balloons and nothing is what it seems.
