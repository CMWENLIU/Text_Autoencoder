I bought this baby brezza four months ago. Used it almost every day. Was working fine until the steam and blend button just stopped working; a short time after that the blend feature... This item is just a BIG waste of money. Try to contact Baby Brezza? Well I don't think their answering machine is of any help..! Very disappointed..!
