I purchased this product and thought by the advertising with all the FDA approvals that it was made in the USA.  Unfortunately - not the case - yet another made in China pet product. These twists are way too thin and they are not equal end to end.  My little 10lb girl can goes thru these like they are paper.  The price was way too high for the product.
