Twice after giving my baby this cereal he vomited profusely to the point of becoming pale, clammy and limp. He stayed listless for a while the first time, very scary. He's not allergic to any of the ingredients but I won't be giving him this boxed cereal again. Not sure what the problem is but I saw another review with the same issues so be aware.
