I love the product and bought the 24 count box at the grocery store, but the area stores stopped carrying the hazelnut so I thought this would be the way to go.  Unfortunately 20% of the creamers cracked and leaked into and through the box.  I spent an hour cleaning up the others.  And some of them curdle when I add them to my coffee.  I won't be purchasing this product this way again.
