I was disappointed because these aren't truly grits.  A real grit is made from HOMINY corn, these are nothing more than coarsely ground corn (polenta), not hominy!  Slow cooking does not make this hominy grits.  I wish they would have labeled this as being ground corn and NOT GRITS.<br />The thing is I haven't been able to find real grits in years.  I was raised on real Southern grits, not polenta, and these ain't them.  The closest thing I've been able to find is posole.
