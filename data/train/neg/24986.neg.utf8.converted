I was surprised that the product came in a recycled (or apparently) cardboard box of low quality. The individual packets of tea were also in flimsy wrapping (compared to the usual sturdy, flavor-holding metallic-lined material). I have been drinking Earl Grey for a while and have also tried several varieties of decaffinated black tea (in other flavors) from other makers. I know that I have had flavorful decaffinated black tea before. That being said, the bergamot in this decaffinated Earl Grey is exceptionally weak. I would not buy this product again and I would even hesitate to purchase Harney & Son's tea anywhere other than from the cafes attached to Barnes and Noble (where it is sold in quality tins).
