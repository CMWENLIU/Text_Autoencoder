As the non-coffee drinker in the house, I can just tell you that my husband has struggled to get through these.  He has a couple of different flavors that he drinks each day and he keeps telling me how happy he will be when this one is out of the mix.  So, my conclusion is that since he is still drinking it, it is not horrible, but not all that good either.<br />By the way, his favorite is the Timothy's Cinnamon Pastry K-Cups if you are looking for something fabulous!
