As soon as I tasted this, I immediately noticed the odd taste. Of course the culprit was the added sucralose, which is a chemical derived from chlorine. Why they need to add this to a product that already contains sugar, I will never know. I noticed the kids also were leaving their cocoa almost untouched. It is just as easy to dump an envelope of Swiss Miss into a cup and add hot water from your Keurig Brewer, and you'll have a much better (and cheaper) cup of cocoa!
