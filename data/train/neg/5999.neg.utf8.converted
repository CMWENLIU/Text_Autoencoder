I'm on MediFast, and a number of people use Walden Farms products to keep their fat/carb/calories down.  Like an idiot, I went to the grocery store and bought about 8 or 9 of the products that were raved about -- IT WASN'T CHEAP!<br /><br />This peanut spread is yucky. It is still in my fridge until I can think of something to do with it.  I don't want to waste it because it was expensive.
