We received our order form Amazon last week and it came in an unmarked box with 24 counts in it. There's no expiration date whatsoever imprinted inside or outside of the box, nor is it on the packets themselves. We don't know how long it has been sitting in the warehouse. Judging by the texture of the almond butter upon opening, it must have been quite a while. The texture is rather gritty, and very dry. It's almost hardened and cannot be squeezed out whatsoever. We tried to soften the spread by warming it in the boiling water with pouch intact but it had no effect. It was completely solid when we opened each pouch. You can't squeeze it out. It is VERY difficult to open each foil packet without scissors on hand. Very badly made inside out, in short.
