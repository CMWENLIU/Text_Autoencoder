Unfortunately, I believed that by looking at the packaging, I was getting the OLD style gum, which has a lesser chance of sticking to the paper when carried in my pocket for a few days, than the new cheap gum.  I loose more gum now because it sticks to the paper after I've carried it in my pocket for a few days.  The old gum was less likely to stick to the paper under the very same conditions.<br /><br />Needless to say, I am quite dissapointed in Wrigley's decision to CUT the quality of their Doublemint Gum.  And also, needless to say, this will be my last purchase of ANY Wrigley's products.  They had a good gum before.  "If it ain't BROKE, don't fix it."
