Thank you, Amazon for carrying this! It's the only beverage aside from water that my husband will drink.<br /><br />Going back to when I met him --- He would buy regular Kool-Aid and add all the sugar.  Once I came into the picture, I turned him on to the Sugar Free version.  He LOVED it.  Then, in seemed like "all of a sudden" the grocery stores quit carrying the cherry flavor.<br /><br />I did an internet search and found the Cherry Sugar Free Kool-Aid on Amazon.  Perfect shipping. Other reviews have mentioned the powder being chunky or hard to break up.  While we did experience that on our first shipment almost a year ago, we have since enountered it.<br /><br />I don't drink Cherry Kool-Aid.  Hubby is so happy and we've signed up for the recurring shipping.  Free shipping and a 15% discount on our order?  Thank you!<br /><br />Update - 12/29/2011 - BOOOOOO! Apparently Kool-Aid is no longer making this as Amazon just cancelled my recurring shipment.  Why on earth would they cancel something so amazing?
