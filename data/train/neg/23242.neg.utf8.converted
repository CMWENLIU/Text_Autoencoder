This is very good tuna and I've purchased from them previously, but this time they get only 1 star as 16 of the 24 cans were dented, some looking as if they were beaten with a hammer. They were delivered via FedEx and the outer packaging itself is not damaged, so I can only surmise they packed up a bunch of dented cans not caring whether their customers get decent product or garbage. For $50, I don't want to have 2/3 of it away...
