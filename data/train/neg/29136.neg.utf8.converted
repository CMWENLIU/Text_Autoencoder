Amazon.com:<br /> I definetly would have wanted to know the product expiration date. If I had known the date of<br />expiration was August 2010, I would not have ordered it. The bars were so hard to chew and stale<br />I asked to return them. Permission was granted and I received a refund without having to pay for<br />return shipping. I was very appreciative of your customer service concern with this problem and<br />resolution of handling of this problem in a prompt and courteous manner.* Please note that in our<br />local stores the expiration dates are March 2010 on this product and they are fresh and flavorful.<br />Thank you for allowing my review; maybe, this will prevent the dissatisfaction of other Amazon<br />customers.  Very Sincerely, Sandra
