Not tasty Not spicy<br />Just some bland mix of vegetables, you can make something better at home even if you are new to using the stove. Try Jyoti brand, i have to try it yet but based on reviews it should be better<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Tried "Jyoti" and "Truly Indian" brands of Grocery and Gourmet Food. Exceptionally better stuff compared to this trash Tasty Bite<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=bl_sr_grocery?_encoding=UTF8&node=16310101&field-brandtextbin=Truly%20Indian<br />http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=bl_sr_grocery?_encoding=UTF8&node=16310101&field-brandtextbin=Jyoti
