I agree with other reviewers.<br />19$ is just too high price for a 6pck 2oz enfamil premium newborn nursette set.<br />This is available at less than 9$ elsewhere.<br />You can get a set of 48 from enfamil for 68$ only.<br />There is something seriously wrong with this deal and Amazon should really do something about it.
