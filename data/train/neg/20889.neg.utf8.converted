These Dark Cherry bars are purported to be healthy nutrition bars. There is really nothing healthy or nutritious about these "Eat Think Smile" bars. They are high in calories (200), fat (7g) and carbs (34g), they have essentially no vitamin content either. The claim is that because they contain cocoa (chocolate) they are good for you because chocolate is supposed to be an antioxidant. That is a very tenuous assumption that has not been fully proven. The only ingredients that might be healthy are the cherries and the oats. I eat Zone nutrition bars and Kellog's Fiber Plus bars. Both taste much better and contain far more healthy ingredients.<br /><br />I read the hype on the side of the box and whoever wrote it could not have been writing about these "Eat Think Smile" bars. The claim is that these bars are a smart choice! If you are starving and only alternative is eating dirt, the dirt might be a healthier choice actually. I really dislike companies that create this kind of ridiculous untrue hype about any product.<br /><br />These "Eat Think Smile" bars are basically cookies and that would be ok if they tasted good but they don't. They have a gritty texture and taste overly sweet and did not taste cherry like to me. If you are looking for a great tasting real nutrition bar, then check out the Zone nutrition bars or the Kellog's Fiber Plus bars or any of the other real nutrition bars. And when you do, compare fat, calories, carbs, vitamins and such before you ever consider buying these fake health bars.<br /><br />If you like gritty cookies with mostly no taste, very sweet and really nothing nutritious in them, then you might like these bars.<br />If on the other hand you are serious about health and nutrition, then there are a lot of better choices that taste much better.
