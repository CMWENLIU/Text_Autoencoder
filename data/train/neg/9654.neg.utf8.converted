I'm revising my 5 Star review. My original review said "Unlike anything else you can find."<br />Sorry, I was basing my opinion on the last bottle of Dat'l Do I had lurking around. This stuff<br />is absolutely nothing like the original.<br /><br />The following is my original review.....<br /><br />"I guess I'm lucky to live near St. Augustine where this stuff is made, its very plentiful<br />down here. Got a great smoky BBQ type flavor, and this sauce is thick, almost like a paste.<br />In fact, you can use it for barbecue sauce, but the best thing I've found this to work with<br />is a can of plain Vienna Sausages and a stack of crackers. Unbelievable! Also does wonders<br />for a Bloody Mary. You will usually find a bottle of this at Firehouse Subs, goes very well<br />with roast beef.<br /><br />Datils will rate out at anywhere from 100,000 to 300,000 Scoville units, they are a relative<br />of the habanero but have a much sweeter fruitier flavor. And if you're really curious about<br />this magic stuff, every October St. Augustine celebrates this amazing culinary gift at the<br />Datil Pepper Festival at the St. Johns County Fair Grounds in St. Augustine. Great fun and<br />even better food. "Smart shoppers" should be able to find this locally. 5 Pods!"<br /><br />This is my TODAY review......THIS STUFF SUCKS!<br /><br />This great sauce has been transformed into a sickly sweet runny sauce that you might find in<br />Tabasco's Sweet n' Spicy sauce, or Tryme's Tiger Sauce. I actually don't have a clue what<br />these people in St. Augustine were thinking, cause this stuff SUCKS! Its not hot sauce, its some<br />sort of hybrid that might be good on a Chinese dish, but it wont help a can of Vienna's....trust<br />me, I know. This stuff isn't even hot enough to unplug your drains, which their previous sauce<br />WAS!<br /><br />1 Lonely Pod, pitiful!
