These fell short on flavor, sweetness, and satisfaction. As other reviewers have mentioned, they do have a bit of an after taste too.  Trader Joe's are way better and at a much better price.<br /><br />For those that absolutely want less calories and low sugar they would get you by, but for me, I'd rather have a little less of something really good.
