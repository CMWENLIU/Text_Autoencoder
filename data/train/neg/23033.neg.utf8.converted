I rarely write a review, but the packaging on this product is absolutely terrible. It's a great product, and a tasty alternative to soy, but at this price, you should receive a full bottle. Each time I order the seal on the bottle has leaked and coconut aminos are EVERYWHERE inside the package. The last time more than half the bottle was gone. Completely unacceptable. Amazon, get this seller/manufacturer to improve the bottle seal or remove it from your store! Not up to standard!
