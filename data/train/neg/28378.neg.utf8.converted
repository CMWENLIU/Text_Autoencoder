I just received a 5 LB bag of Kopper's Dark Chocolate Raisins and couldn't wait to rip open the box and try them. I do so love chocolate covered raisins and especially with dark chocolate. What a terrible disappointment!! The chocolate was crystalized and the raisins were dried out and shrunken. Need I say more??
