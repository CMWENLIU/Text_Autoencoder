No wonder why this cereal is cheap. It does not smell very good or taste very good but I am sure it is healthy so I will eat it. I mix it with another cereal in order to add some taste. As soon as I opened the bag inside the box I knew it was not going to be a great tasting cereal due to the odd smell. Oh well you do not know until you try.
