Water "enhancers", or "energy" drinks are all the rage now. So this new one by the stand alone company of Vitamin Squeeze, is entering a crowded market. Claiming to be an all natural flavored product, the list of ingredients on the bottle is pretty long (longer than the ingredients listed on both Amazon and the companies webpage). Vitamins A, B3, B5, B6, B12, and C have been "added", along with Taurine, Magnesium, electrolytes, and caffeine. Each serving squeeze flavors an 8 oz glass of water, and there are 24 servings in a bottle (or perhaps not - see below).<br /><br />To put this enhancer in perspective, a typical 1oz serving of espresso packs a punch of 40 to 75 mg of caffeine; 40 mg is what this water enhancer provides in an 8 oz glass. The added benefit with the squeeze is that you don't have to add calories via cream and sugar, and you've got a few vitamins thrown in as well. Another plus, is the convenience of simply squeezing in the flavor and caffeine.<br /><br />However, taste wise, the fruit punch tastes like sugar free gum. So yes, it's got that weird phony aftertaste that makes you screw up your face after drinking it. Another problem comes from the squeeze method per serving. One full squeeze delivers much more than is recommended, so each bottle comes no where near 24 servings.<br /><br />All and all, I'm going to stick to coffee and tea for my caffeine, and truly natural juices for my vitamins.
