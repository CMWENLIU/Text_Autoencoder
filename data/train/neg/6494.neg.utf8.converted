Yes I realize that many truffle oils are just an exercise in organic chemistry. However, if you want a strong truffle flavor and use a lot of this oil, then you will have a dish that smells like machine oil and still lacks a dense truffle taste.<br /><br />Looking at the oil from the top of a full can, you will notice small dark oil droplets suspended in an ocean of safflower oil. There's not many dark drops, which is the active ingredient. So you are really buying an expensive bottle of safflower oil. And when was the last time you remember eating truffles which looked like motor oil looking drops in your dish? There is a reason it comes in a dark metal can. Enough said, try another brand.<br /><br />Bottom line = yuck
