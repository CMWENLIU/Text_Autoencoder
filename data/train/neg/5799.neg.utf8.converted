The raisins are great, the Problem is, this is supposed to be 12 packs of 6 boxes, or 4.5 lbs, (see shipping weight) for a total of 72- 1 ounce boxes. They sent me two packs of 6 boxes, for a total of 12 boxes which is 12 ounces, which is about $2.66 an ounce (YIKES). The product specifically states, 44 cents an ounce! which is right if they had sent all 72 boxes. I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE, they KINDLY sent me another order, which also arrived with only 2 packs of 6-1 ounce boxes.<br />HOW FRUSTRATING!<br />The customer service people were in Jamaica, and were very hard to hear, but were very nice, and helpful, but, they have no control over the people at the warehouse.<br />VERY SAD DAY FOR AMAZON, BE WARNED!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MZJT8K">Sun Maid California Golden Raisins (1-Ounce), 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>
