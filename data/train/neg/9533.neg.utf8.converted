After trying some true European absinthes while living in Europe, Lucid is a fantastic disappointment.  It leaves an unsatisfying after taste not present in more traditionally prepared and distilled absinthes.  Particularly when compared to Absente or its more traditional brother Grande Absente, another French absinthe, you really begin to notice the distinction. While the Absente is a slightly lower proof (@ 100) than Lucid (@124) you can accomodate by adjusting the ration of water to absinthe when preparing the drink.  Overall, I'd suggest finding something with a more traditional Verte Absinthe recipe.
