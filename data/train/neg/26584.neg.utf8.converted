I was on a cruise a few years back and bought a bottle of the Mexican Vanilla Totonacs in Cozumel. I have to admit that it was the best vanilla I have ever had. Used it for baking mostly. Finally running low and had been looking to replace it for about a year. Contacted the company directly and was told their export agent would contact me. Never heard anything. Decided to search web again and was surprised to see Amazon was now selling it.<br />For those that have bought this brand in Mexico and are looking to buy more, this is not the same vanilla!! Might be same company but not nearly as good as the product I got in Cozumel. Much thinner and not as much flavor. I am sure the FDA has a lot to do with it. My rating above reflects this. For those that haven't tried the original, you might love this product. But if you have, you will disappointed in this product as I was.
