I personally purchase a lot of the 100 Calorie Snacks or the Rite Bite Snacks. I was excited to see a "cheesecake" bar in the 100 Calorie Section. However, I could NOT find these in any store near me! So, I ordered these & anxiously awaited their arrival...only to be VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! These bars are super dry, almost impossible to eat without a drink nearby. They do not taste anything like cheesecake. Even the graham cracker (Honey Maid) that is underneath the "cheesecake" is unbelievably dry & tasteless, almost like eating sawdust! Their is no "moisture" to the "cheesecake" layer what-so-ever, and it is grainy & gritty. I would not recommend these to anyone!!! If you really want some cheesecake & are on a diet, I say save up some calories for the end of your week & treat yourself to a piece of the real stuff, because you will be sorely disappointed with these bars! I only opened one of them, and made myself finish it because I cannot stand wasting food, it was a challenge to eat every bite!
