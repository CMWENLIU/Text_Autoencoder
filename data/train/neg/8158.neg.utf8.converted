Like the first lady, I tried this today for the first time. It tastes great at first. But after the flavor is gone and the gum is out, there is a terrible tomato-like aftertaste. It's really bad and you can't get rid of it by chewing something else. It's really really bad, I wouldn't recommend this gum at all.
