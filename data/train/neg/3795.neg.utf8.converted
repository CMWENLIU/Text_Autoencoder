This mix is just awful.  No matter what, it will not fully dissolve.  Even after the most vigorous shake, I'll still see clumps at the bottom and big particles floating throughout the bottle.  To make matters worse, it has a sickening taste - literally!  I started to feel sick almost immediately after drinking a bit - the artificial flavoring is truly overwhelming.  And this is coming from someone who relies heavily on artificial sweeteners, so it's not like I'm new to these things.  Definitely not worth buying; I much prefer Crystal Light.
