I bought a gallon of this and when it came it was not green like grape seed oil but a nearly-clear yellow.  I pan fried some eggs with a touch of this oil and instead of the neutral flavor of grape seed oil which doesn't change the flavor of the eggs,  I could taste this oil and it tasted a bit fishy like Canoloa oil or some "off" vegetable oil.  With all of the differences in international standards for Extra Virgin olive oil,  I'm convinced this is a blend of refined oils some of which are Canola (rapeseed oil) rather than grape seed oil. I don't believe grape seed oil is as well regulated as olive oil. I do not blame the distributor as much as the processor but either way I'm returning it.  I also received a batch as a gift but I'm not able to return that since it is food so I'll try to make soap with it and see how it goes.  I don't think any of the other reviewers used this oil for consumption.
