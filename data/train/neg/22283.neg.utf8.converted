This saffron has too much style which is the thin Threads which attached  to the stigmas. The style has no CULINARY VALUE, that means NO AROMA, FLAVOR .  The stigmas are the values of saffron. The stigma is thicker than the style and looks like a horn.  I would say about 80% of the content is style. I won't buy this again.
