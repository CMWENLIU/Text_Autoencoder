The food is GREAT.  The cats have gotten completely addicted to it.  BUT....what Amazon doesn't bother to mention is that "quantities are limited".  I have been buying this food for my 3 cats for about 6 months.  It comprises roughly half their diet (or 3 cats/day).<br /><br />I just went to re-order and was repeatedly told "there's a problem".  Long story, and 2 phone calls plus 2 emails later, I was told I have bought the LIFETIME MAXIMUM of this product.<br /><br />I ordered it for almost twice the price via the marketplace, but I am furious with Amazon.  NOWHERE on this page do they tell you there's a limit.  So I'm here to tell you there is.<br /><br />The food is great, but don't get used to buying it here.
