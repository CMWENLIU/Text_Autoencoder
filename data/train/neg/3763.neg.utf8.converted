Attractive bottle, smells nice, thick enough (like thick lotion, I can stick my finger in the bottle, get a big glop on my finger and it stays there when I hold it upside down, so I did not experience it being runny at all.<br /><br />My main issue is a concern over the high alcohol content (Cetearyl Alcohol being #2 after water on ingredient list). Alcohol is too drying for my thin and super curly hair. I tried it out, anyway and found that is seemed to strip out some possible oil buildup I had from using natural products (including real shea butter).<br /><br />Update:<br />Had to downgrade my reviews for this line when the skin on my arms and neck started breaking out after accumulated exposure-washing my daughter's hair in the sink in addition to using other products from same line on myself that day. Not the best choice for sensitive skin.<br /><br />*Found a "silver lining:"<br /><br />When scalp became extremely dry as a result, with dandruff "raining down" to the touch, I did an internet search. I found that VINEGAR is an excellent conditioner. I used 1/2 vinegar/water-amazing results! My scalp calmed down and my hair seems to have recovered-now soft to the touch instead of brittle.
