I was disappointed with this malt powder. It really doesn't have a very strong malt flavor. The Carnation Malt powder you can buy in the grocery store is far superior taste wise to this product. You have to use an amazing amount of this stuff to get close to tasting "malty". So, today I bought a jar of the Carnation at the store to add to this so it doesn't go to waste. Sorry Kegworks, this is just more like instant milk flavor than a true "MALT" flavor. By the way, the Carnation is also cheaper than this. Postage was way too high, but I didn't mind paying it expecting to get a superior product.
