My 10 month old german shepherd loved it. And loved it so much that in about 5 minutes he was already chewing pieces off the thing. In exactly 45 minutes the damn thing was GONE. My dog had eaten it all. I don't think it's going to hurt him, but this is NOT an everlasting treat AT ALL, definitely not for 60 pound + dogs (my pup is a very strong 80 pound gsd - all muscles, no fat).
