When our son started on solids, we were determined to make all our own food, and purchased the Beaba Baby Cook right away. As a product, we were generally happy with it - it's an "all-in-one" device - you can steam, blend, and reheat homemade food. As a result, when we traveled out of town for 2 weeks, we took it with us (in the travel bag, which we purchased separately, for another $40). We used it in our hotel room with local ingredients, and it was great. Our three complaints about it functionally are minor - it seems to take quite a while to steam the food, you have to hold the blender button in the 'on' position continually, and the blender itself is quite loud. Our baby's room is next to the kitchen, and I would constantly worry about waking him up if I was using this while he was sleeping. It also only makes very small batches of food because of its small size, so I wound up with about 1 cup of blended food after 30+ min of prep and cook time.<br /><br />The biggest issue with this machine is that it's not worth the expense for the money ($150 + $40 for the travel case = $190!!!) - it was a MUCH BETTER VALUE to use our full-size Cuisinart, which we already owned. If we had not, it would have been smarter to purchases a mini-Cuisinart for about $40. Here's why: we made ALL the baby food our son ate, at least at first. It was much, much faster and more efficient to steam the food on the stove, using a couple inexpensive steamer baskets and pots (much faster), and then to puree them (much more quietly)in the Cuisinart. We could make much larger batches of food, which we then froze in ice cube trays (cheaper and again, more efficient, than the freezing trays Beaba sells). The Baby Cook made such small batches it hardly seemed worth the effort. For busy parents out there (and you know you're one of them) - this was, by far, not the most efficient method for making baby food, and costly to boot.<br /><br />TL;DR: The Baby Cook works well, but a Cuisinart/Kitchen Aid is cheaper, more efficient, and will get the job done just as well/better. Don't spend the extra money on the Baby Cook.
