I was really liking this nut bag. I used it about 10 times, but the other day i was making some brazil nut milk and i saw some pulp in the bowl and realized that one of the seams had busted.<br /><br />So, it lasted about 2 months.<br /><br />Maybe get something sturdier than this if you want it to last longer than 2 months. Now i have the hassle of getting another one shipped. Sigh.
