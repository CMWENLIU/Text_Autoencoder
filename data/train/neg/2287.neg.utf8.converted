While the Almond taste is on point, the chocolate taste is not. They were pretty much just plain dry roasted almonds with Cocoa powder mixed with Splenda sprinkled on them. I could only really taste the chocolate with my first bite. After a few bites, All I could taste is almond. The light chocolate taste was just a little too light for me. And for someone who eats chocolate like it's becoming extinct, this is a bad thing. Plus, the chocolate powder was very difficult to remove from my hands.<br /><br />PROS<br />1. Great Almond Flavor<br /><br />CONS<br />1. Just a hint of chocolate - for others this may be a pro but for me, EH, not such a good thing<br />2. Coated in a messy chocolate powder. - It's Best if you have mouth to canister contact when eating these.<br /><br />To sum it all up, I've had better.
