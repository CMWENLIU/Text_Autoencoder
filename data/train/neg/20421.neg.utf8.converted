This product was not at all what was shown. Product not as pictured! Fruit snacks came in tiny packages not the larger bags as pictured. I would not purchase from this seller it was a total rip off. I was charged more then 10X what you can buy this product for at any Albertson's or Safeway Grocery store. Unbelievable!!!! They show a picture of the larger bags to make you believe you are getting 8 larger bags and then when you receive the product it is 8 small child size snack bags for more then $10 when they sell for a little over a dollar a box at your local grocery store. I own several business' and if I ran them this way I would be out of business in no time.<br /><br />Completely disappointed!
