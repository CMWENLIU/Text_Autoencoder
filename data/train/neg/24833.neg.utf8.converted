Before trying Truvia, I purchased the Supreme Stevia in the loose powder form and I loved it! So I purchased Truvia to use at work for my coffee and tea; I was EXTREMELY disappointed. It has a very bitter after taste and it takes too many packs to get the same sweeteness that I get with a 1/4 of a teaspoon of the Supreme Stevia.
