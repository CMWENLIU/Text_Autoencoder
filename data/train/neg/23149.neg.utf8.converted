i didn't realize it was one box of 12 1 oz.pouches for $23.  i would never pay that when i can go to the store down the street and pay $2-$4 depending on a sale.  i thought it was a pack of 12 being  the number of boxes in the order. they definitley got me. hope this prevents someone else from being ripped off. lesson learned.
