My family has enjoyed these cookies for more than a decade, and at our Christmas Eve dinner, we brought them out at the usual time, and started with the annual tradition of "flying angels."  For those of you not familiar with these cookies, if you wrap them in a cylinder, and light the top, when the fire reaches the base, the wrapper shoots up in the air.  It's actually quite a bit of fun.<br /><br />So imagine our surprise this year when NONE of the wrappers would fly.  We compared old wrappers and new, and SOMETHING has changed about the wrappers.  Whether it's wax, weight, or something else, none would fly for us (and we have an awful lot of people who are experienced with this).<br /><br />So, if you're a fan of these cookies, and the fun tradition that's sprung up around them, I caution you, you may not be able to enjoy them this year as you have done in the past.
