I truly love the flavor of this soup mix but it contains partially hydrogenated soybean oil.  That means it has 'trans fats' that effectively cause hardening of the arteries and heart disease.  That's not even mentioning that it has soybean products in it.  Soybeans (except for the fermented forms like tempah) elevate one's estrogen levels which can increase the chance of cancer risks...especially estrogen mediated breast cancers.  And it has Autolyzed Yeast Extract which is another name for the infamous neurotoxin....MSG (monosodium glutamate). I don't understand why this well known company has to use dangerous ingredients when there are so many substitutes that will not destroy our populations health.  Is it purely because it's so much cheaper to use these dangerous, life threatening products that they only see their profit margins and not the health of the nation.  As much as I love the flavor of this soup mix, I can not recommend it to anyone!  I will not be ordering this health 'time bomb' ever again.  Eat it at your own risk!!!
