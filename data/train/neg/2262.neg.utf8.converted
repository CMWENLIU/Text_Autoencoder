Edit: It seems the error has been corrected. This listing used to be $17 for 2 cans of beans. I've received a couple negative comments by people who didn't realize that the listing changed AFTER I wrote my review. I'm editing my original review so I don't get any more asinine comments.<br /><br />I've bought these beans before from the store, and they're decent refried beans. I like them every so often, even though they do have a lot of salt. They're worth a try.
