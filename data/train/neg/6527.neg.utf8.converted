Ordered in November 2008 and have opened 6 cans.  So far, inspite of the product "content" and label, all six have contained almost all pinto beans, only a few kidney beans, and absolutely NO garbanzo beans.<br /><br />I can only assume this is so because pinto beans are the cheapest of the three and garbanzo the most expensive.<br /><br />Very disappointed in Westbrae, and won't purchase this product again.
