For baking and cooking I have used all the Spelt flours available in the USA since 1999. I've frequently found Arrowhead Mills spelt flour to be old and stale. It seems that the age of this product varies widely as well as does availablity from store to store and there is little or no available white or light spelt grinds from Arrowhead, only whole grain being available. Other purveyors of Spelt flour provide a wide variety of grinds, dependable availability, quality and consistency as well as lower price per pound.
