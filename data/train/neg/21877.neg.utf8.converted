I didn't like this tea at all.  I prepared it according to package directions but it was very, very green and kind of thick.  I didn't like the taste but I will admit I didn't drink much of it.  I think I'll stick to the regular white, green and oolong tea.  I thought of making the tea "weaker" but didn't....I don't think I would have liked it any better :)
