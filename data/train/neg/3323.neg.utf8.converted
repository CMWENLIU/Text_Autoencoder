This was a really unsatisfactory beverage in taste and aftereffects. I'm not a huge fan of coffee in a can or jar, having partaken of two widely nationally available brands and found them lacking for a coffee fanatic such as myself (consuming an average of 4-6 cups a day). I was hoping that the Italians (via Denmark, where this product is made) would get it right. Sadly, the Illy Espresso company has failed abysmally with this product. The weird thing was that it tasted fine for the first sip: a nice, bracing bittersweet espresso flavor. The second sip, it seemed a little tinny. Then it was salty. But I was committed to finishing this drink to the full, 6.8 fluid ounce end. The bitter end. Because while I got a faint coffee buzz, I also got major heartburn and a stomachache within a half hour of consumption. I'm guessing as an amateur chemist that adding baking soda (potassium bicarbonate, 20 mg sodium per serving in the drink) with an alkaline Ph interacts negatively with coffee's more acid Ph.  Well, I've popped an antacid, and I will say that this product has convinced me that there are no shortcuts in life. If you want decent coffee, make it yourself. This product contains 156 mg of caffeine per serving. If that's what you're looking for, there are other options that won't feel like you drank battery acid.
