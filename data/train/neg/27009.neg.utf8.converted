My dog LOVES this product and it does help keep her teeth tartar-free, BUT the stick is much thinner than in the past and my dog can now chew through one in less than 1/2 hour as compared to 2-3 days in the past.  Too expensive and too dangerous as she will swallow the stick when at 4".  Company called and they had no explanation for why the sticks are thinner, so will buy the thicker braided 12" sticks through another company on Amazon (1/2 price vs. store pricing).
