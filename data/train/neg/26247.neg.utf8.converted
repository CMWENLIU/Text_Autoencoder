I buy all my cereal from Amazon. I am usually very pleased with products received from Amazon. This box of cereal bowls contained several bowls that were open! All of the varieties I tried were stale and didn't taste right; and the Raisin Bran actually seemed rotten. The first thing I did after encountering these problems was to check for an expiration or use by date. There was no indication on any of the packaging ANYWHERE as to when these bowls of cereal would no longer be appropriate for human consumption. By comparison, the General Mills cereals I've purchased from Amazon have expiration dates on each and every individual bowl (usually printed on the bottom). Kellogg's makes great cereals - I have no problem with Kellogg's - I think I got a bad box that had been stored away in the back of some warehouse somewhere that should have been discarded because it was way past its shelf-life. Amazon, of course, refunded my money. But, just beware that it could happen to you and if it does be sure to get Amazon to refund your money. Amazon's warehouses need to be more vigilant. We can't just complain on here and hope the warehouses change their practices - we need to make our money talk to Amazon so they will get warehouse management/personnel to comply with Amazon standards and federal consumer laws.
