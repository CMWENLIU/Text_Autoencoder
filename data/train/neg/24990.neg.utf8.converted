<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VVUQAW">Smokehouse 26015 Chicken Barz 16oz Resealabe</a><br />Be careful when selecting Chicken Barz from Smokehouse.  It is not the same as the product that I usually purchase from local pet stores.  These strips are full of tough sinewy pieces which my dog has problems digesting. There is another product from Smokehouse with the same name, but different item number.  It is also priced much higher and is probably the same product found in pet stores. The next time that I purchase Smokehouse products from Amazon, I'll make sure to order the more expensive item.
