This is really no different than any other Nylabone other than the shape.  The bone is still a hard plastic type material that does splinter and form sharp shards that cut the dogs mouth and catch on everything. Not really happy, was hoping for a different material that doesn't do that. So it is over rated and not what I had hoped for.
