I gave my daughter the mango Peter Rabbit fruit snack and was impressed with the healthy ingredients.  So I purchased the apple grape without checking the ingredients.  My mistake!!<br /><br />The ingredients are as follows: Organic Apple 86% (healthy), Organic Grape Juice CONCENTRATE 13.9% (not healthy), and Organic Lemon Juice CONCENTRATE (not so healthy).  Concentrated juice has a significantly higher sugar concentration than not from concentrate juice.
