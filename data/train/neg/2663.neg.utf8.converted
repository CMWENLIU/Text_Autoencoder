I ordered this product knowing that my cat loves Newman's Organic Turkey formula.  However, he refuses to eat it, and I am concerned that there is something wrong with this batch. I have offered it to him over a several week period thinking he would change his mind, but no luck.  I usualy have good luck ordering from Amazon, but this time I am totally frustrated not being able to speak to anyone.  I would donate the case to an animal shelter, but I am afraid that it could hurt the animals.  You see....I unknowingly fed another pet bad canned food a number of years ago, and there was eventually a recall.  Later she had health problems, and I believe it damaged her kidneys.  It was, in fact, a high quality pet food, so one never knows.
