Supposedly a variety pack, but I couldn't tell the difference between "Peach Caramel" and "Raspberry Cream."  I actually thought that maybe one of them was mislabeled, but then I read the ingredients.  All of them have an herbal blend base that is supposed to simulate black tea, with a bit of fruit flavor added to make each one "different."  Well, I didn't think much of the herbal base, so I didn't like a single one of the teas.<br /><br />Also, the teas are contained in paper filter bags and then wrapped in a paper wrapper.  They are not sealed.  If I DID like them it would be nice if the bags were air tight since it would still take me a long time to drink 80 bags of tea.
