The peanut butter tastes slightly better than the Kroger brand, but cost much more.  The word "Natural" is misleading since, as another reviewer pointed out, palm oil is added.  I will not by this product again and will avoid all Jiffy peanut butter in the future.<br /><br />Update--03/05/2012:  I now definately believe that the use of the word "Natural" was meant to mislead the consumer into believing that this product contained something better than "un-natural" peanut butter.  Apparently, this is the new buzz word that companies use to get us to buy something which is better for us healthwise, but there are no FDA standards to the word "Natural" which many products now claim.
