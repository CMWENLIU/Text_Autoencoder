I bought this product because my Splenda in 9.7 oz packages became unavailable.  I was willing to give it a reasonable try but I just don't like the flavor.  It's not exactly bitter, maybe chemical-like is a better description.  It makes my tea taste off and leaves an unpleasant tingle on the tongue.  So, it does look like sugar though it is less sweet, but I don't like the taste.  And, I think, for the price, you aren't getting anywhere near enough product.  A twelve oz. bag of this stuff is about the equivalent of a 2/3rds full sandwich bag.  I was quite disappointed overall.
