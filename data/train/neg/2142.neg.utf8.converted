Made in China - need I say more - and these demons wouldn't allow return on a six pack!!!! As we sink further into debt, our miniscule resources are being eaten up with garbage from China. It came up when I said dog treats made in USA! - I just read an online warning from a "Dr. Becker" vet website that these cause kidney problems - DO NOT USE IF YOU LOVE YOUR DOG
