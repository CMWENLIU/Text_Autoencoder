I want to preface this review and say that if you want a really healthy alternative to pasta then you may want to try these. My husband really likes using these for a zero calorie option. I, on the other hand, will not eat them. They still have a fishy type taste and the texture is very different. No matter how we prepare them I can still taste the weirdness and would rather have the calories from real pasta. My husband has an easier time getting over the taste and taking them for what they are. For health nuts who can't or won't eat real pasta this would be a good product to try and see if its something that you enjoy.
