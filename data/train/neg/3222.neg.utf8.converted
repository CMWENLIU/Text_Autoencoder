I am unsure why this product caused such problems for my dogs as the ingredients look okay and it says "highly digestible".  I guess I need to look for "fully digestible".  I didn't throw them out because I want to write the company and my husband decided to give a treat to one of the dogs, who has been subsequently ill for the last 3 days.  She won't eat, wants to eat grass and has bad runs.
