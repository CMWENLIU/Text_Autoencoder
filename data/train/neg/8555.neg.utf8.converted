The Senseo machine shipped with two 18-pod samples packs, light roast and medium roast.  Excited about my new machine, I brewed my first cups of coffee only to be disappointed, not by the machine itself (awesome!), but by the quality of the coffee.  The light roast was so-so, and the medium TERRIBLE.  I quickly ordered the dark to compare, and can now HIGHLY recommend the dark roast over the other two options.  The dark also works the best in espresso-like brewing mode, using two-pods with the 1-cup setting.  It's still not the best coffee out there, and I'm looking forward to comparing with the upcoming podhead.com pods.
