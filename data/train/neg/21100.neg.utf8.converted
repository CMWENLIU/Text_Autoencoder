If you are looking for something comparable to the Chai at you-know-where, skip this tea.  I bought some after reading the reviews, but felt they really missed the mark.  This tea should be simply called "Cinnamon Tea"--that is the ONLY flavor I taste, and not at all like Chai.  Imagine melted Red Hots dissolved in water, and that is about what this tea tastes like.  I love Celestial Seasonings tea usually, but this one is really overpowering with the cinnamon flavor, which should be better pointed out on the box.  I am going to try their India Spice tea based on other reviews, and will hopefully find something more complex like what I am looking for (and will hopefully be a nice substitute for the expensive Chai from Starbuck's).
