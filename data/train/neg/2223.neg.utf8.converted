I tried Planters Natural peanut butter because of a coupon offer and thought the name represented high quality. After reading the ingredients on the label: peanuts, sugar, palm oil and salt I was skeptical but because of the low bargain price I decided to try it. Very disappointed. Oily taste, faint taste of peanuts. I always buy Maple Grove Farms at my local Pathmark or any brand with the magical ingredient of just peanuts, sometimes with some salt. I am frugal but the taste of 100% peanuts is worth the price and I don't think its any more expensive/or perhaps just a little more expensive than the poorer quality brands. Far superior to this disappointment.
