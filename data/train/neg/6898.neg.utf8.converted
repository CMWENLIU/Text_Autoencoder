I ordered the Brooklyn Coffee for K Cup machine.  When using I found the machice short filled and there were grounds in every cup.  The Brooklyn coffee simply does not work in the Keurig machine.  I even switched machines to see if it was the Keurig or the coffee Brooklyn single serve.  Same thing happened.  We switched to another brand of coffee and the Keurig works fine.  It is the Brooklyn single serve cartridge that is at fault.  Do not order this until they find the answer to their problem.
