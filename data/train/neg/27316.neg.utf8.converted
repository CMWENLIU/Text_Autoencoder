This tea brews a light reddish-brown liquor, not unlike the color of iced black tea you'd be served in a restaurant.  I was stunned the first time I made it.  The dry leaves appear to be very dark green.  There are whole jasmine flowers in the tea.  They shouldn't be there; at least very few.  Lots of flower buds is indicative of poor quality tea.  I examined the leaves after brewing.  They appear to be a blend of green and black; possibly some oolong.  The leaves are chopped and there is a great deal of stem.<br /><br />The eight-ounce double seal tin packaging is excellent.  It's too bad the tea is so, well, not as described.  Despite the presence of jasmine buds, there is no jasmine fragrance.  A fragrant jasmine tea also has a jasmine "taste," as taste and smell dovetail.  There is no jasmine taste to this tea.  It has a rather pleasant, fruity taste, but not at all jasmine, not entirely green, and poor quality tea.<br /><br />Pass on this.  There are lots of good jasmine greens you can find at very reasonable prices.
