I loved this product until they changed the formula.  The newer version, while they claim it offers more calcium (which is great), has caused the product to be extremely messy.  I know it sound minor, but when the ENTIRE area surrounding the container or bag is completely covered in dust, you will be annoyed.  In addition to the mess, the additional powder/nutrient essentially cut down the amount of food in the bag since the weight did not increase. When I scoop out a portion now, it is hit or miss as far as whether I am going to get 60% or more powder & I worry about the caloric intake my dogs are or are not getting now.  If you are okay with a huge mess and paying more for less (I have two dogs, so the difference is significant), the product is excellent.  Unfortunately, this new change probably result in me looking into other food options for my dogs.
