25 pound bag, expires in less than 4 months (March) and no directions. What the &%$#%<br /><br />I did find the directions for the single bag (21 ounce) on the web so that helped a bit.<br /><br />I haven't tried a straight vanilla cake yet, my only use so far was some cupcakes where I used both the chocolate mix (individual bag) and the vanilla.  The vanilla seemed much thinner so I decided to make some vanilla/chocolate cupcakes.  I poured about 40% vanilla first then 60% chocolate which sank down so I ended up with a vanilla on the outside and chocolate on the inside cupcake LOL.<br /><br />Again, no straight mix so cannot give an accurate taste.
