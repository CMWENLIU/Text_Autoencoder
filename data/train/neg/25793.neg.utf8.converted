My baby with multiple allergies seems to love them. Great! However, some QA problems either in shipping, or packing, or distribution by Amazon.<br />Pros: Watermelon, Razmatazz, mango tango, and pomgranate pucker, orange<br />Cons:<br />1. Of 5 pound bag-3% error rate (350 suckers Total?)<br /><br />Out of 348 lollipop approx per nutritional label, there were<br /><br />6 Stray stick missing the head/wrapped plastic<br />1 cracked melty looking one<br />1 sucker intact without plastic<br />2 empty plastic wrappers (no candy on stick found)<br />Total: 10 mutant ones<br />It seems a better QA job could be done.<br />Hope made in mexico has just as strict quality rules.<br />Seals on the lollipop package don't seem completely airtight.
