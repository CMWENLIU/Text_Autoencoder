I wouldn't call this a true, delicately subtle floral Earl Grey. The tea, no matter how long or which style it is brewed in, is overly tannic, like a cheap supermarket brand of black tea. It is lovely to smell, disappointing to drink - very little citrus tones (as in, none I could detect) with just the slightest tang of bergamot oil. Extremely disappointing. A good buy if you do not enjoy earl grey but love the smell.
