I have been ordering this coconut milk forever because it had NO additives. I just received my latest shipment, popped open a can, and had a little taste. It didn't taste right, so I looked at the label. They've just started adding guar gum! My son can't have that, so the case is useless. I just looked at a can from my last order. They've changed it. What a waste.
