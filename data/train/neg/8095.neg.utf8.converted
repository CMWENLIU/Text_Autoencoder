Had to throw away my 3 jars as I was about to eat this, I noticed the warning about cross contamination with peanuts and I thought nothing about it until I looked more closely at the ingredients.<br /><br />Once I glanced at the label, I was surprised to see that there were two ingredients listed, "Cashews, Peanut oil"!<br /><br />If Amazon wants to sell this as Cashew butter, there needs to be a distinct warning to people with severe peanut allergies.<br /><br />Do not buy this product if you have any peanut allergies, it's main suspension oil<br />for the cashew butter is PEANUT OIL!
