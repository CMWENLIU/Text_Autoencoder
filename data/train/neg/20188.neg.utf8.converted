I received this item as a birthday gift recently.  The outer box with decoration and bow is lovely, and the outer wrappings of the items inside are nice.  However, the actual items themselves were nothing really special for what this box cost (plus shipping!)  3 of the cookies were crumbled and all were on the dry side; the picture frame was NOT the nice gold-gilded victorian frame that is shown in the picture. Instead, I got a heart-shaped white cermanic frame (made in China).  All in all, the outer wrappings & box out-did the actual items inside each wrapper.  I would not have paid anymore than [...] for this item.  Cannot believe it cost [...]!!!
