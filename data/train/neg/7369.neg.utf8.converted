I tasted Lavazza many times being in Italy as well in France and excellent quality (taste, smell) of it can't be confused with anything else. Have to regret - I'm EXTREMELY disappointed with this "Lavazza Super Crema" beans from Amazon - it's under-roasted, bitter and acid taste, weak (yes, there was a typo) and unpleasant smell and crema....well, even relatively old coffee beans from TJ Maxx produce better crema with proper grind&tamping or even just with the pressurized portafilter.<br />I'm using semi-automatic espresso machine (DeLongi BAR32 before and now Saeco Aroma, Breville BCG450XL Conical Burr Grinder) about 5 years (I mean I'm not a novice for espresso), and have tried this beans immediately after the bag was opened (1st "news" - very weak smell), used fresh grind, careful and dense tamping, machine is properly heated and primed.<br />The consumption date on the package marked as October of 2011 and I know that Lavazza's shelf life is 14 months - therefore, received in March 2010, it's 6 months old roast, not too fresh but I had used much older roasts without any problems. Not sure how it works for latte but as espresso coffee it's wasted money and lost expectation. Don't be fooled by positive reviews - some people never tried the real espresso and some even don't like it but coffee-infused milk drink. Also note that Amazon sells some Lavazza coffee's for much higher price and no "subscription" proposed. The attractive price($16 per kg with subscription)is definitely result of poor quality - something wrong with this "Lavazza Super Crema" coffee.
