Lundberg has a Gluten problem with their 'gluten free' food products.  WARNING:  they are NOT gluten free!!  My entire family got sick eating Lundberg rice and rice cakes----and this product---I should have sued!  The reps at Lundberg act all shocked about anyone complaining about gluten reactions in their products---but trust me---there is plenty of evidence all over the web of people reacting to their products.  They need to step up to the plate and come clean about where the gluten is coming from.  GF is NO fad diet----it is life or death for some of us.
