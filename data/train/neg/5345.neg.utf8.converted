... IF this were not at a reduced price and was eligible for free shipping, I wouldn't have even tried it. I liked that it didn't have MSG and didn't use pork as seasoning. My family is adding more vegetables to our diet as we are "eating better to live better". There was an unnatural sweet taste such that I was expecting to find Sweet Potatoes somewhere, a very unsettling feeling for me. Didn't know if this batch was inadvertantly prepared with their Sweet Potatoe product. We don't like products with hidden sugar.* (*As the commenter noted sugar IS listed in the ingredients. I should have said "unexpected sweet taste". Truthfully I was expecting similar seasoning as in Sylvia's Collard greens.)<br /><br />I've never been to Sylvia's Restaurants so I don't really know if this is how it's supposed to taste. I won't order this again.
