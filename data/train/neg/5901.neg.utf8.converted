I drank Twinings Darjeeling tea in Britain and loved it so I thought I was getting a good deal when I bought 300 bags at a good price from Amazon.  Now I wish I'd read the other reviews.  Apparently Twinings has a different blend for the US.  It has very little taste at all.  I'm giving it 2 stars because it's as good as anything one can find in the average US supermarket but that's not to say it's actually tasty.
