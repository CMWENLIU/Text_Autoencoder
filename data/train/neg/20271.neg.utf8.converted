Bought this item for my 22 month old and my 6 year old to snack on. Neither of the them would touch it after taking the first bite. I tried it to see what the issue was and it was very salty. We are not conservative sodium consumers, so that is not the issue. It's the 350 mg of sodium per serving that is the problem. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I have nearly 4 boxes left of this sitting in my pantry with no one in my family wanting to eat it. I really wanted to like this product because it made it easy to shop for snacks my kids would like online and have it shipped.
