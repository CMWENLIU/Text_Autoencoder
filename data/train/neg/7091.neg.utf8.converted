While the ingredients look good (though the water content is 80% while most of the better brands have 78%) this food has managed to get two of my dogs sick!  Vomiting and uncontrollable bowel movements.  One dog is 17 yrs old and the other 4 yrs old.  I stopped feeding the older girl this food some time ago but discovered I still had cans so I gave a can to the 4 yr old.  After two days on the food he became sick.  He is now on rice and chicken for the next few days.  I cannot recommend this food to anyone.
