The other reviewers that say you'll be getting the damaged, dented cans that the store can't sell are spot on.  Out of my 12 cans, 7 were dented to the point that I won't be able to use them.  I've contacted Amazon about refunding my money since this item is not returnable, and I'll update the review once I know whether Amazon is willing to stand behind their product. At any rate, I will never buy this product, or any other food item, from Amazon again.<br /><br />Ater contacting Amazon, they sent me another 12 busted cans of pumpkin.  Out of 24, a total of 10 were usable (so I still didn't get the 12 that I paid for). Don't waste your time or money on this one.
