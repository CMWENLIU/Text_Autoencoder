As soon as I took my first sip, I regretted my purchase. It has a slightly medicinal flavor, which lingers as an aftertaste. Other than that there is no real flavor to it. The label claims it provides mental performance. It contains caffeine, so that may be true. But many other beverages, better tasting and less expensive, also contain caffeine. As fizzy vitamin water goes, this is very disappointing.
