These are made in China, the country that sent the U.S. tainted raw ingredients which killed at least 149 people (ingredients for Heparin, a blood thinner medication).  China also exported pet food to the US that killed many pets.  Amazon did not include the "Country of Origin" listing for this product, but I read the box after I brought it home for my daughter and then threw them away.
