I looked for the nutrition information and could not find it on Amazon.  Since I love Sesame noodles I bought this product.  On the box it does say 40 carbs, I shoulda paid attention - one bowl kicked my blood sugar level up by nearly 80 points - way above what it should be.  If you are diabetic avoid this product.
