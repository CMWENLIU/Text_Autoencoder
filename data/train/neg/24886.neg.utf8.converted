I have ordered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2BS">Saco Cultured Buttermilk Blend, 16-Ounce Canister (Pack of 3)</a> before and the items arrived intact and were good to use.  This second shipment arrived completely crushed. The buttermilk powder was all over the inside of the box and the other items I had ordered.  All of the containers and their lids were smashed and torn and could not be used. It is too bad that there was not any protective packaging material between the cardboard buttermilk containers and other heavier metal canned items inside the larger box.
