I am disappointed that these contain high fructose corn syrup and also because they do not count toward a fruit serving, even though they state they are made with real fruit. However, they aren't exactly junk food since they are made with real fruit and whole grains.  Definitely not the healthiest option though.<br /><br />Since my daughter enjoys them and they aren't messy, I will give them two stars. I serve them to her a few times a week, along with a serving of fruit and yogurt or milk, to make it a healthier snack or breakfast.  I do think a product from Gerber should be a little more health conscious for our little ones, so as soon as my daughter finishes these bars, I will be switching her to Earth's Best Organic Sunny Days Snack Bars or Earth's Best Organic Tots Cereal Bars.
