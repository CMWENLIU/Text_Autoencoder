We have tried only  a few kcup coffees since we are new to the keruig. We will never buy this coffee again since over half of the box of 50 were defective. What a mess and waste of money.....I will from now on buy the coffee people donut shop coffee instead, it is very high quality kcup (never had a defective cup) and has a nice fresh strong flavor!!!!
