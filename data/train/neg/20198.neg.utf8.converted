These things don't give you the "effect" that they are high is fiber. I really question how much fiber are in them. After purchasing them recently, me and mom felt bloated and like crap the next day. The culprit<br />I believe are these tortillas. Also one of the ingrediants is gluten. Not good. Really too good to be true.
