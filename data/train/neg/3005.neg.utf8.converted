I recently learned (and just got confirmation from calling Earth's Best) that their jar lids contain BPA and was told that they have no plans on changing the packaging.  The rep said the amount is small, but quite frankly, how can you sell _organic_ food tailored for infants and put hazardous to health and development substance!  It is such a shame really because we love this product and their other baby food offerings (and it's kosher as well!), but now have to search for other products.  In summary, if you care about your child's health, beware that the lid on this item contains BPA and the company rep. as of 12/27/10 said that they do not have plans on changing their packaging.
