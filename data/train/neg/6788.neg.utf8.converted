Since Amazon did not give the list of ingredients, I had to search the web. Found the manufacturer's website [...], and the ingredients are:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: Oyster Extractives, Sugar, Water, Monosodium Glutamate As A Flavor Enhancer, Salt, Modified Corn Starch, Wheat Flour, Caramel Color.<br /><br />I searched on Amazon for "gluten free oyster sauce," and this one came up. But, as you can see from the "wheat flour" it is not true.
