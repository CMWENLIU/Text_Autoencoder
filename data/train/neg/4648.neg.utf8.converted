Between the crumble factor and the extremely messy "chocolate" (which tasted more like MOCK-olate) coating, these snacks are a ridiculous waste of calories, effort and money. The chocolate sticks to the cardboard tray and melts immediately upon contact with your fingers. The bar itself disintegrates all over the place when you bite into it. A terribly executed idea.
