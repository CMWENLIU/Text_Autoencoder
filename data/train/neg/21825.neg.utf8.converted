The taste, quality of this individually-wrapped cookie was disappointing; nothing like I expected.  Wanted a rich, homebaked-type cookie, something special, individually packaged.  These cookies were described as: "Premium" so that's what I expected.  Another brand of choc. chip cookies, packaged in bulk, taste better than these.
