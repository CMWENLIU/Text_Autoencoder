I thought I was ordering from a decent company Amazon, but I was wrong. They charged me $38 for only bunch of items but packed very nicely. Items like bunch of popcorn, only may be 50m g of pistachio, 3 candies, 3 to 4 cookies. What is this going one here?? I order 2 similar gifts but your company loot my money. I need to get my money back. I will post the photos of the items which we found inside the package inbeteen bunch of packing paper.<br />THanks,<br />Poonam
