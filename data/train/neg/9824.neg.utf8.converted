I purchased this product before, and it was perfect: lots of halves, not too salty, not very greasy.<br /><br />This time however, I decided to stock up and purchased 5 "2-tin" packages when it had a good price.<br /><br />Turned out to be super greasy. There was so much disgusting oil that I had to use paper towel to drain it every<br />time I wanted to eat.<br /><br />Overall, I would say the inconsistent quality deserves a one so they can improve.
