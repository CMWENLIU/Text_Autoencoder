I bought these for my Dalmatian for the first time about a month ago. He LOVED them...so much that even though I only gave him the recommended amount per day for his weight class he STOPPED EATING HIS FOOD.<br /><br />I went in to Petco and spoke with a customer service rep who told me a couple of people had come in with similar experiences. He said he was personally curious about it and did some research online and pulled up some reviews (which we looked up together while I was in the store) of people with the same issue. We discovered Dogswell now makes this product in China. Whether or not that automatically makes it unsafe I don't know but given the other reviews and the sign from my own dog I am no longer willing to risk it. Do some research - google "Dogswell made in china" and decide for yourself.
