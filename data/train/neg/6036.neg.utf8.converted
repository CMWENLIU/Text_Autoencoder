I love Walden Farms.  I order their salad dressings and syrups in quantity and gladly pay the shipping for the priviledge.  The other day I was in HEB and experienced great joy to see that they carried almost all of the dressings and several fruit spreads.  Then, I saw the peanut butter.  I knew they made one and looked forward to trying it someday.<br /><br />Based on the quality of their other products (which I have been using for over a year now), I bought 2 jars.  Well,  I just opened the first one... revulsion on all levels.  The color- while a color in nature, not the color of something I want to eat.  The smell- sweet in a chemical way.  The texture- what texture?  I tasted it. YUCK.  Tried again... more YUCK.<br /><br />The product does not remotely smack of peanuts or any other nut for that matter.  This from a person who is NOT picky.<br /><br />Happily, the jars are glass and therefore reusable for other more worthy items.  I am going to try P2B instead if I find myself craving peanut butter to the necessary degree.  I am think I am off PB now!<br /><br />BTW- I am being KIND in this review...
