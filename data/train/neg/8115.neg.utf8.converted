We use Earth's best literally every day for our daughter. Obviously overall I recommend them. We have not used this variety but before ordering anything new from Amazon I check the Earth's Best website that has easy to find nutritional information. Search under infant 2nd Food, antioxidant.<br /><br />This has by far the worse nutritional profile of the antioxidant blends available. It is 90 calories with 18g sugars, with 20% RDA of vitamin A and 40% of Vitamin C. For comparsion Sweet Potato Mango is 80 calories, 6 grams sugar, 380% Vitamin A and 25% Vitamin C. It is not so much the vitamins but there is A LOT of sugars in this vis a vis their other antioxidant blends. I would go with a different choice.
