I did not find this drink special in terms of taste; it is kiwi juice infused with carbonation, and a burst of strawberry. Carbonation makes the juice acidic and produces stronger effect on taste buds than the fruit juice.  It does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free, no sugar and no artificial flavors. I hope other reviewers find this drink a little more interesting.<br /><br />1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />4. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH2C">The Switch Fruit Punch, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />5. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG943G">The Switch Grape, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />6. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZLCQ">Vita Coco Coconut Water with Passion Fruit, 11.2-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a><br />7. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>
