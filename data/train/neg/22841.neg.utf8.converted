I just got the Honeydew powder I ordered. It was shipped very quickly which was great. I am a bit confused though. When reading through the listing it said to mix the product with 1 scoop sugar or simple syrup, 1 scoop powdered creamer and 1 scoop of honeydew powder. This made sense till I read the ingredient label on the product. It lists sugar and non dairy creamer as the first ingredients. I was under the impression that the order was for flavored powder and that I would be adding my own sweetener and creamer powder. I am diabetic so I am unable to use this with sugar in it. Both the product description and the directions for preparation are extremely sketchy. If I were to take the product I was sent and prepare it with the directions I was given it would be nothing but sugar and creamer. I paid well over $40 with the high shipping cost for a 2.3 lb. bag of sugar and creamer that I could have purchased at the grocery store for about $3. That is robbery.
