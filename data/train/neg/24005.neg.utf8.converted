I bought this product because it seemed very convienient.  You don't even need milk to make it.  I honestly can't taste anything in it because there is so much salt.  I understand that dried food is salty, but this is ridiculous.  If you have high blood pressure or just don't want to in the future I recommend staying away from this product.
