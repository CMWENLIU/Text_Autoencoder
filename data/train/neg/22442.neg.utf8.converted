I bought this thinking that it would be a great deal. While for most people I'm sure it would be but amazon missed some very important information on the label. This is manufactured on shared equipment that also processes peanuts, tree nuts, soy, milk, eggs, and wheat. So if you can't have those items purchase with caution.
