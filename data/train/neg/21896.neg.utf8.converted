I bought this exact same product, in the exact same quantity per box, at my local supermarket for just under $6.00.  I asked an employee if it was just a trial price, and he said that it was indeed the regular price.  As the other reviewers have stated, these snacks can be very addictive.  To be on the safe side, in case the supermarket does raise the price, I purchased four boxes - for the same price as Amazon is selling a single box!<br /><br />The one-star I rated this item was for the Amazon price, not for the quality of the product. I guarantee you will love this product. I also guarantee that if you do a little research you can find it at your local supermarket for a MUCH lower price.
