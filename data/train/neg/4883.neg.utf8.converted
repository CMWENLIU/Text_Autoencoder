I felt literally poisoned by this tea. I made it extremely weak and I was still terrified that if I went to sleep the night I drank it, I would not wake up.<br />I threw up an hour or so after drinking it.<br />I went to sleep sweating and shaking.<br />I slept 14 hours straight.<br />I felt ill the next day. Not just my bowels, but my entire body including my brain.<br />I was unable to leave the house for the next 24 hours because I could not stay out of the bathroom for over 30 minutes.<br /><br />One star for relieving my constipation!<br /><br />Try some wheat grass or something like that. I hope you find this helpful.
