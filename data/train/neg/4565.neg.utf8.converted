I ordered the Hershey's Sugar Free Chocolate Chips.  I received the order ONE:In an envelope - not something I would send a food Product in.  TWO: The product looked Old and Out Of Date, the bags were cut (yet the packaged shipped in was not)and everything looked like it was melted together.  When I contacted this seller - he called me a liar and did not believe I received the items this way.  When I said I would send a picture - suddenly he hung up. I was told I would be refunded (including the $9.00 shipping fee I was charged plus my $5.35 fee to ship back) I still have not received my full refund!
