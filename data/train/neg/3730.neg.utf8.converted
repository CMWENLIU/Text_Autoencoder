I'll start off by saying that I will not purchase this coffee flavor again.  I thought mocha sounded lovely, but I was disappointed.<br /><br />Normally I check all ingredients before buying, but I forgot on this one and after I had some,  I realized there were artificial flavors.  What a pity.  Tastes like it, too.<br /><br />To me (and hubby) this coffee tastes like it was sprayed with a bad, dollar store perfume.  There is a slight mocha flavor, but it is so fake tasting that it's rather gross.  Adding a little milk helps make it more palatable, but I wouldn't call it tasty.<br /><br />The only good thing about the Mocha Eight O'Clock Coffee is when it is brewing, the whole kitchen smells like a gourmet coffee shop.  So, I guess it's a good room potpourri...<br /><br />I don't recommend it simply because of the usage of artificial flavors that TASTE artificial.  Other varieties without such artificial-ness are better.  The coffee brand itself isn't bad, but this Mocha flavor is.
