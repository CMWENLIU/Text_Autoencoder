I have enjoyed Lapsang Souchong tea for years.  I was expecting a tea that smells like smoke when you open the package. However, when compared side by side with the little bit of old Lapsang I had left, the difference is quite clear; this tea has no smoke smell and a very different flavor profile. It is not a bad tea in and of itself, it just isn't Lapsang Souchong. Thus, I felt I had to give it a 1-star to warn others.
