I love Hunt's diced tomatoes in tomato sauce, so when I saw that they now had a Fire Roasted tomato I was psyched! Unfortunately, it wasn't everything I hoped for. I think sun dried tomatoes (or in this case "fire roasted") are best left to the small glass jars seen on shelves next to pearl onions and jalapenos. I honestly don't think I will be buying these again, unless they are on a REALLY good sale. Otherwise, I'll stick to the normal Hunt's Diced tomatoes.
