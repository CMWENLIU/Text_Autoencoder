This pie filling is "filling" but tastes terrible.  The cherries are tough, so they may have been picked "green", but with all the added "enhancers", no one could even tell they are eating "cherry" pie.  Very disappointing.<br />I now prefer to pay more and buy Comstock or another American brand that will make pie baking rewarding because the taste will be what is expected.<br />Don't buy this China product. Nasty.<br /><br />Oh, and with the very first piece of pie, a PIT!  I wonder how many more will show up in the pie with this first can of "cherries"?
