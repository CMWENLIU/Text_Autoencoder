These look fine as freezer pops and I have never tried this product, but I looked at the nutrition information on the Sqwincher website which indicates they contain, per pop:<br /><br />3oz water<br />1% sodium (does not say how many mg)<br />15mg potassium<br />does not show other electrolyte levels<br /><br />By way of comparison, I have a tube of nuun on my desk.  When dissolved into 16oz of water (the recommended concentration), one tablet of nuun provides:<br /><br />16oz water<br />14% sodium (345mg)<br />6% magnesium (25mg)<br />2% potassium (97g)<br /><br />If it's important to be hydrated and replenish electrolytes, this looks like a terrible product.  I'm giving this a 1 star review because if someone is engaging in a strenuous activity where you care about replenishing hydration and electrolytes, you need something that actually accomplishes that and this product claims to without actually doing it.  I'd recommend gatorade, nuun, or even just a glass of tap water because the electrolyte levels in these pops isn't high enough to really distinguish itself from water.
