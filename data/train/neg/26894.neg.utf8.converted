I noticed there was a bad review on the product but I thought that the review is 2 years old so the product quality can be different now. I was wrong. This "fresh thyme" give a horrible taste to the meal. Even if the product smell is acceptable, the fibers seems to contain mold (at least this is the taste it produces). The texture is mostly solid so is stem based not leaf.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product!
