It would be nice if Amazon would take responsibility for providing complete product information for the items they sell. For example, a buyer might assume that the name Dagoba was significant, perhaps representing the company that manufactures the products. In reality, since 2006, the company that produces "Dagoba" chocolate is Hershey's. The cacao products may still be organic and trade certified, but buyers of the products are supporting a huge multi-national corporation, not the small, ethical business that the name Dagoba originally represented.
