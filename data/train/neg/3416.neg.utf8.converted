I agreed with all these rave reviews. BUT, maybe 6-8 months ago they changed this tea and ruined it. It is pathetic as lipton or any regular tea. I like a bold flavor with cream "british style" I, even, tried 2 tea bags and  it still did not taste the same. I have used this tea for years and am exremely picky about my tea. Having tea, is a big part of our family day. I have change to british PG TIPS tea or Irish Breakfast tea. It is not the same- but, they are pretty good.
