I knew there were some funny flavors, but this bag is a mix of any or all of them, including VOMIT, BOOGER and ROTTEN EGG. I have now consumed at least 10 vomit flavored jelly beans, and that is just wrong. The worst part is how accurately they taste like vomit, and how it quickly transforms to a very realistic bile taste. Oh Yum!! You can't identify them from others so it makes for a good practical joke but a truly horrifying bag of candy. I am scared to eat them anymore
