Buyers Beware! The can of formula I received had an Earth's Best label placed on top of a torn off label of some unknown formula underneath (nothing that even close to resembled an Earth's Best label). I contacted Amazon and received a full refund for the product. Amazon told me they receive this product directly from the manufacturer with no middle man so they could not explain my experience and suggested I contact Earth's Best.<br /><br />I contacted Earth's Best and was told over and over again that they would NEVER re-label any of their products, once again not explaining how this could happen. Leading me to believe this product is NOT Earth's Best formula but something else being re-labeled. If you read other reviews you will see I am not the first person to experience this. It was the other reviews that made me peel off the Earth's Best label and look underneath.<br /><br />I purchased a can of Earth's Best formula today at a local grocery store and peeled off the label to check and see what it would look like underneath, and it was a clean new can - It looked nothing like the can I received from Amazon that had an old torn mystery label underneath.
