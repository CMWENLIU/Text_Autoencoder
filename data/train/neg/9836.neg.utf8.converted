The seeds arrived "Big" brand and not plain Jim Beam that I remember being so good.  They do not match the picture here. The first flavor ingredient is Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) which gives me fuzzy headaches.  I have been unable to eat the seeds.  I tried soaking them in water and then soaking them in some Jack Daniels and drying them out in the oven.  Now they taste ok and have way less MSG but I still miss the old formula!
