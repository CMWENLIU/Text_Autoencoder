maybe you'd like this.  I thought it was terrible, and am looking to give it all away.  I don't know why I ordered it - and the same for the "Chocolate Donut" type - because I don't really like flavored coffee, and ESPECIALLY when the flavors all taste alike and the coffee is so weak it tastes like dishwater.  I like a rich, full-bodied (but not bitter) cup of coffee, which this most assuredly is not.  Maybe if you like lots of cream and sugar, and just a touch of coffee flavor...
