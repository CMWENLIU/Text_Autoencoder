Because my local store wasn't carrying pumpkin yet for the holidays and I really needed it for my dogs, I took a chance ordering this product online. Twice I ordered out of necessity and was twice disappointed. Both times, most of the 12 cans in the box were so severely dented that I couldn't trust that it was safe to feed to my dogs. I would have never bought them if they were on a store shelf in that condition. The cans were not damaged in shipping, because the outer Amazon box was fine and the interior Nummy TumTum box was fine. Sadly, that means the dented cans were packed by the company itself, not damaged in transit.  My e-mail to Nummy Tum Tum's customer service about the condition of their product went unanswered/ignored. Why I gave the company a second chance I really don't know. I guess I naively thought the extent of the damage to the first batch must have been a fluke. I guess I also thought that the Nummy Tum Tum company would take more pride in its product than to ship the garbage they couldn't sell to customers buying them off the shelves to online customers who wouldn't go through the trouble of shipping them back. Boy, was I wrong. I was willing to give the product a chance, even a second chance, but dealing with this company was a big mistake. Buyer beware!
