They came to me as if they had melted in the bag at some time and got returned by a customer. The bag had 1/2 the pink coating of the M&M's adhered to the bag. And it was winter than they were delivered. Some of the M&M's were broken, choc exposed due to pink coating was off of them. WHat a waste of money. Wont even be able to use them. Looks like they had been laying around for a couple of years and/ or sent around the world and back. Would not recommend this Merchant
