Not impressed with this water at all. To me it had an after taste that was not pleasant. It's like the Mood Ring...you have to buy it to see if it works...sorry to say it is not worth the extra money for the novelty of drinking water that is black. You would have to consume a large amount of this drink to get any of the benefits of the Fulvic Acid contained in each bottle. It's just pure hype orchestrated by a reality show participate. Save your hard-earned money and use tap water or regular bottled water, you and your wallet will feel better. Hope this reveiw was helpful to choose regular bottled water and consume the proper foods each day instead of being drawn into these hype-filled promo ads claiming miraculious benefits with this water.
