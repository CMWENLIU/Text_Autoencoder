BEWARE -<br />This is NOT freshly roasted coffee.  It arrived with absolutely NO OIL on the beans.  They were bone dry, with NO AROMA.<br /><br />The bags the beans are sent in are the first indication of a problem.  They are NOT 1-way vented bags.  Those who know coffee and roasting...know that the fresh roasted beans continue to emit a gas for up to several days following roasting.  That is why you MUST use a 1-way vented bag when packaging and shipping fresh beans. The oils will quickly evaporate and the beans turn stale if the beans are exposed to air.<br /><br />I don't know why Camano Island thinks they can package this way for selling on Amazon.  The product the customer ultimately receives is NOT acceptable.<br /><br />I talked directly to Camano Island (since Amazon won't allow returns).  They offered to send me freshly roasted beans AFTER I shipped them the "bad" bags I got from Amazon.  It cost me 1/2 of my original purchase price to ship the "bad" beans to Washington from Michigan!  In my opinion, Camano Island should have only required me to fax or email my Amazon receipt to them or send 1 of the 3 bags to minimize shipping costs.<br /><br />I can only hope that what I receive back from Camano Island is truly fresh.<br /><br />What a terrible experience.<br /><br />I've been let down by Amazon.<br /><br />AGAIN BEWARE of buying this brand, packaged this way from Amazon.  Go direct.
