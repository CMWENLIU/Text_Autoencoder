These things are gross.  I really mean it.  Both me and my g/f tried them and spit them out.  They taste like stale pretzels with no flavor filled with seeds.  I don't think mustard would help to get these things down.  I am really astonished that anyone would give Sticks and Twigs anything over 2 stars.  I think that these may be company employee reviews.  I am not even a picky eater and had to throw out the entire bag.  Stay away...stay far far away from these atrocious crackers.
