My husband absolutely MUST have this for his coffee or he skips having it altogether, so the 2-star rating is for the final cost, not the product itself (I'd give the product 5 stars)!  After doing a cost analysis of having this product delivered to my house or going out and buying it directly from either Sam's Club or Costco, I would have to agree with the other reviewer that going out and buying it from a warehouse store such as Sam's Club or Costco is definitely more cost effective than having it delivered.  The price for the item may look good, but after factoring in shipping, it becomes too costly.
