The apricot leathers are "All-natural, 100%-fruit leather featuring apricots", but since apples are the first ingredient and apricots the second, I have no clue how much apricot they contain, but probably not very much. I'd be a lot more impressed if apricots was the first ingredient, but that would be more expensive to produce than something made mostly of apples.
