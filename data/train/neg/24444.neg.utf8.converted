I love bacon, I love mayonnaise, and I have an affinity to highly processed foods.  In short, I'm your ideal Baconnaise consumer and when I heard this product existed I was in disbelief.  When I brought up the Amazon product page, my mouth was literally watering as I ordered a 3-pack.<br /><br />After a grueling 2-day wait (courtesy of Amazon Prime), my baconnaise arrived and I slathered it onto a ham sandwich and sunk my teeth into it with high expectations.  What followed was the letdown of the century.  It doesn't taste good - it's hard to explain, but to me it tastes overly artificially flavoured (tastes like a big jar of anchovies or something, like a stank and overly fishy Caesar dressing).<br /><br />One star, and if I could give zero I would.  To add insult to injury, Amazon (as far as I can tell) only offers this in three packs, so I was stuck with three jars of it.  I tried unsuccessfully to pawn this garbage off on my friends and coworkers, but to no avail.  I ended up throwing it in the garbage - In the process I probably violated some environmental regs against throwing hazardous waste into the regular garbage.<br /><br />Don't bother with this stuff, or better yet if you are as curious as I was try and sucker one of your friends into buying it and try it on a sandwich before buying.
