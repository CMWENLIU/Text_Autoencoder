I, like another reviewer, wanted that delicious clear broth with mushrooms and onions in it in a japanese restaurant. This soup looks like it, but certainly wasnt the taste I was expecting, and didnt taste like the soup id get locally. Oh well. Regarding the actual taste, its most prominent flavor is fish. I thought it was too fishy, but I do understand people have different tastes so I wont knock its rating down for that.<br /><br />The reason I gave it only 2 stars is what I didnt taste or see. The next prominent flavor is soy sauce. Other then that, theres really not much to this soup. The mushroom and onion "flakes" (I would call them slivers) are small in number and dont contribute much. There were a total of 3 pieces of wheat which added very little. At over a dollar per packet I would say the value is pretty bad. Ramen noodles are cheaper then this, and you get more in the seasoning packet from those then this soup. I would have liked to see larger sized mushrooms and onion. It doesnt really look like the picture - my soup was some straight slivers the thickness of rice grains sitting at the bottom. They were pretty pathetic. I dont believe kikkoman is a "higher quality" and thus you get what you pay for. They could have included more dehydrated onions or scallion. I was disappointed.<br /><br />If you like fish, you might like this soup, but I didnt enjoy it and dont think its a good value. To me, I would call this soup "fish broth with added soy sauce". I just didnt get any of that "mmm!" umami flavor that I recognize. Im sure some people will really like the flavor of this soup, but I'd highly recommend trying to buy one packet locally so you can try it before buying in bulk. If you dont like fish, dont bother at all.<br /><br />Oh well, i'm going to try their miso soup next.
