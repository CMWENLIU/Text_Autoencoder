I would like to give it zero star if it is an option. Right now, in Sam's Club, 32-oz Pack of 8 Similac Advanced Early Shield Bay Formula, Ready to Feed is selling at $27.99, which is almost 40% cheaper and can be convenient returned. The 32-oz bottle itself is also troublesome, since my baby can not finish it within a day. You have to throw the rest out, even with refrigiration.
