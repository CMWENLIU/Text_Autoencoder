Maybe we're the only ones that actually enlarged the photo of the 35 K Cups before we placed our order.  We wanted to make sure that the variety was indeed something that we felt we would enjoy.  Obviously "variety" is just that, various flavors.  However we did expect to at least receive ONE of each flavor shown on the photo, and we did NOT expect to receive SEVEN pumpkin spice, FIVE eggnog, and FIVE Gingerbread (none of which are in the display photo) when placing our very first order with Amazon in January!  Of the 35 K Cups, 17 (almost half) were holiday flavors - I mean, come on at least be honest enough to promote the product as "nearing experation holiday coffee samplers that we can't get rid of...here's hoping you won't notice".  Seriously, give a little credit to the intelligience of your customers, or in our case "first and only orders".
