I have been giving Wellness to my 7 month old pitbull since he was 8 weeks old. I chose it because it is supposed to be a good and natural food. It's very expensive and I thought I was giving my puppy the best. Wrong.<br />My pup has had bad gas all this time but I did not think it was due to the dog food. We just thought he was eating too fast. Then when he was 4 months, he got very sick.. throwing up and loose stools. We took him to the vet for x-rays just to be sure there was no obstruction. There was not. He got better but the gas continued.<br />About 2 weeks ago, my dog started vomiting his Wellness food a few hours after eating. It looked whole. He was not holding down any of his meals and this went on for a week! We took him back to the vet for x-rays and even an mri.. the vet found nothing. We took him off the Wellness and gave him chicken and rice.. he was fine... started mixing in Wellness again and he got sick. Took him off and we are giving him ground beef and brown rice.. he has not thrown up once.<br />Yesterday, we received a call from our friend who adopted Saki's brother. His brother has been on Wellness for the past week and guess what-- same exact symptoms as my dog!!<br />To me, this is sure proof of the Wellness being the culprit.<br />This morning, I researched this food more.. just type in a search engine- "Wellness Super5mix sick" and you will be sick when you read all of the cases of illness due to this product! Stay away from it.. don't risk it..<br /><br />Here is just one link-<br />[...]
