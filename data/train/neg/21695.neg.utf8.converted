This "dark chocolate" sauce tastes just like any cheap chocolate syrup you could buy at the grocery store to make chocolate milk. It's marginally tastier that your standard name-brand chocolate syrup, but it still tastes cheap and fake. If you're looking for something that truly tastes rich and dark-chocolatey, this is not it. Wish I hadn't spent the money.
