I have two cats who both became very ill while eating the chicken and mackerel flavor. Consistency of this food was completely different than the chicken & chicken liver they normally eat. It was watery, almost soupy and had lots of black spots in it. It smelled fine but made cats very sick. I threw the entire case away after my cats got sick.  I haven't had a problem with the chicken flavor.
