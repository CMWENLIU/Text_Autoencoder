This coconut water was pretty good, although i wouldn't say it's remarkably better than Zico and certainly not better than VitaCoco.  The coconut chunks varied quite a bit with quality, ranging from tender and delicious to a little too thick and tough.<br /><br />Also, almost all of my dozen 17.5 oz cans were dented in some way, with one can being a little too compromised for me to consider consumption.  After reasonably extensive storage in my refrigerator, all of the remaining coconut waters acquired a distinct, unpleasant metallic taste.  Maybe this should be expected with a tin storage container, but I certainly don't get unpleasant tastes with tetrapaks and plastic bottles after extended refrigeration.<br /><br />Despite the overall pleasant drinking experience, I doubt I will be ordering again.
