I was disappointed that the on-line advertisement did not indicate what the packaging does. I.e. this product is to tell you that you have a moth problem, does not and is not intended to eliminate moths. To me if you are ordering the product you already know you have a moth problem. I think the product could be useful to know if your moth problem returns after treatment, but after washing tons of loads of laundry and removing the cloths from the house altogether, I am going to be very certain to treat sufficiently that I don't have a re-occurrence. I am happy being green when possible and have pets, but I don't want to waste huge amounts of water and energy rewashing cloths. It does attract moths - that is the only reason for two stars and not one - my issue is the incorrect advertizing.
