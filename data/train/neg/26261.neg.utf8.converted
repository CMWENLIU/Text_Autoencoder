I have used this brand for years and love the red beans and rice packet. But last night we were cooking up the yellow rice for the first time and my husband discovered MSG as one of the ingredients!!!!!!!! I was shocked! Lesson learned... I will read all of the packets ingredients before buying in the future. It will be sad if we can't enjoy these easy and delightful side dishes in the future. Though they list ingredients on this site, notice the disclaimer below. I would rather not support a business that uses these tactics. You decide for yourself.
