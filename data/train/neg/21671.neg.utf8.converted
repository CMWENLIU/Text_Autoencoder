This product doesn't fit into a  Keurig K-Cup Brewer.  You just use a knife to puncture the lid, dump it into a cup, and fill it with hot water.  Could use a Keurig to fill it, I suppose.  Wasted 3 until I realized this.  I gave it 1 star because it tasted OK.  Use the Keurig name to charge extra.  Not acceptable.
