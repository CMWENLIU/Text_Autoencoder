Go order the Kirkland Signature ones on Amazon.. here is the link http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RZNY5G/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&m=A1V3U717S8VN5T<br /><br />I got these in the mail very fast.. when we started to enjoy them.. most if not all were nasty & oddly chewy. They almost tasted old. I was VERY disappointed in this purchase. One of the tubs went to total waste cause they were ALL BURNED! UGHH
