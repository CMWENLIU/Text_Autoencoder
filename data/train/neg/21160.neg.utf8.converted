Product was poorly packaged.  Subsequently it tasted more of cardboard than ham.  Suspect packaged meat had been sitting on a shelf too long before shipping.  Shipping package was marked "keep frozen" but arrived via FEDEX overnite with nothing but warm melted water in plastic bags.  Would not recommend this vendor.
