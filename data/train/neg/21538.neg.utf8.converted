Buyers Beware, 1 lb. of Marzipan for $4.99.. Sounds great, right?<br />What they neglect to tell you is that there is an additional $9 shipping charge!!!!!!<br />Insane.<br />If this company *ever* thinks they will get another dime from me, they are sorely mistaken.<br />I placed my order along with some books, and Amazon does not itemize the shipping charges, only gives you one lump sum for all the items you order... At *no point* does Amazon or the company tell you what the shipping is for this item, unless it is the only item you order, and then only right before the final checkout.<br />It was only after paying, when I received itemized email invoices that I was informed of the $9 shipping charge.<br />What an incredibly shortsighted business practice.<br />1 lb Marzipan, for $16. No thank you.
