I was duped by this product in a shiny, pretty package that is labeled "for all trees".  I placed FEWER of these spikes than was even recommended and a month later the leaves on the oak tree we planted when my daughter was born turned BROWN.  Now, several months later, a good 1/3 of the tree is brown and after consulting a plant nursery owner I have found out that it was the Miracle Grow Fertilizer Spikes that is burning my tree.  I have tried to find them to dig them up but by now they are all but dissolved.<br /><br />The nursery owner actually recommends no Miracle Grow products because they are a one size fit all approach with no regard to your climate or soil type.  It's one thing to use them on houseplants that are in similar environments but another to put them on plants outside in your unique environment.  Also, we had a soil test that showed extremely high levels of phosphorous in the soil.  The reason for this?  Years and years of Miracle Grow by the previous owner.  Phosphorous doesn't leach out of the soil so it just builds up and up with repeat applications.<br /><br />DON'T buy this product unless you have consulted a knowledgeable plant or landscape person first.  Hopefully my tree will survive this debacle.
