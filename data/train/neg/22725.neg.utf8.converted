I love Rice Dream and have been using it for a long time, but I DON'T recommend buying it this way.  Several cartons had a slow leak from the bottom and trying to figure out exactly which cartons were making the wet mess was difficult.  It turned out to be 4 of the 12 cartons, and since you have to refrigerate after the seal has been broken, I had to pour a third of my order down the drain.  Also, the little plastic pour spout/cap on the top of the carton had come off half of the cartons; I was able to hot-glue them back on, but that was very inconvenient.  I've NEVER gotten a leaking carton or faulty pour spout from the Rice Dream I buy at the grocery store, so in the future, I'll just have to make the long drive to the nearest store that carries this product.
