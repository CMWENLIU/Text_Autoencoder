I have been eating "breakfast bars" for at least 10 years.  I've enjoyed various protein bars, Zone bars, Balance Bars, Triple Threat Power Bars, etc etc.  I just ate my first "ThinkThin" chocolate fudge bar, and it is BY FAR the worst-tasting bar I have ever eaten.  What little bit of taste it offers is AWFUL.  I hate to spend perfectly good money on something that makes me want to throw it away.  Don't buy them.  ICKY TASTE!
