I try to do my best with sustainable products and recycling, so bought these bags.  I love the idea of them, but after just a few days the garbage stinks, the bag turns wet and clammy and they are extremely thin and have ripped from just tossing a stalk of broccoli in the bag.  Sometimes I actually double bag these in my garbage can so they don't tear, but they're already pretty expensive so I'm basically paying twice as much.  Not sure if I'm going to continue with these bags - wish there was another biodegradable alternative....
