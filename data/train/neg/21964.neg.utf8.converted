One of the really big selling points of the Keurig brewer was that it produced hot beverages other than just coffee.  Teas, cappuccinos and hot chocolates were all available and we were eager to try them.  I did my research after we got our brewer for Christmas, though, and was really disappointed to read a pile of negative reviews for pretty much every hot chocolate brand available.<br /><br />The Swiss Miss hot chocolate was on sale at our local grocery store so we decided we had to try it.  It had ranked a little bit higher than most of the other brands so I held out hope that it would work out.  I brewed a small cup when we got home and gave it a shot.  The consistency that came out of the machine was nice and the consistency didn't seem watery.<br /><br />This tastes exactly like the no calorie Swiss Miss hot chocolate available in sleeves.  While you're drinking it, it tastes alright, but then it's followed by a very plasticy synthetic aftertaste.  There's no mistaking the artificial sweetener here and I can see how that would bother a lot of people, especially those with sensitive taste buds.<br /><br />I think we'll finish the rest of the box, but I'm not convinced we'll repurchase.  We'll probably just use the Keurig to prepare the water and then use traditional hot chocolate packets.
