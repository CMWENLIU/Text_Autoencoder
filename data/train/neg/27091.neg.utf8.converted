This coffee doesn't smell like butter toffee, it just smells like "flavored coffee" which to me all smells very similar no matter what it's supposed to smell like--pecan praline, blueberry cream, amaretto, even "Norseman Grog" which is a combination of vanilla, rum and caramel.  They all smell pretty much the same to me, even different brands.  I was hoping this one would be different because of the high reviews, but it isn't.  I gave it two stars because the coffee itself is good and not bitter like some.
