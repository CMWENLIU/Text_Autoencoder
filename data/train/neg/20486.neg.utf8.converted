I love Lindt and was really hoping for great things with this 90% bar; alas, it is just too bitter and chalky to eat straight.<br /><br />I consider myself a hardcore chocoholic and can handle intensity on the choco scale. But this is more or less like baking chocolate. There is almost no sugar in it, and while that may be good for flavor, it's almost inedible on its own.<br /><br />I'm confused by those who rated it so highly but I guess taste is totally subjective. I'm usually the one of my friends who likes the darkest, least sweet chocolate, but this is just not working for me at all.
