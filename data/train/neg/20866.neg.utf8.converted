I really had high expectations after having mallow magic, so I ordered a case thinking it wouldn't be too bad. Well now I can't get rid of it, my husband and I don't like it, my kids don't like it. I tried giving it to all our family members, none would take it. It does not taste like caramel apples, just like artificial sweetener. I normally like things sweetened with splenda and don't really notice anything weird. I can't even eat this, no caramel flavor at all, the cooked popcorn looks nothing like the picture on the box. Don't waste your money on this... If you are trying to be healthy plain popcorn tastes better!!
