I know that truffle aroma can be either overwhelming or subtle.  People who aren't used to truffles might find it hard to notice their unique scent.  Others want to stay far away from truffles.<br /><br />I'm in the middle.  I can certainly taste them and I certainly enjoy them as an accompaniment to the appropriate foods.<br /><br />The La Tourangelle is too subtle for my taste.  It's expensive, and for that price, it seems that they can try to infuse more truffle essence into the oil.<br /><br />It was difficult deciding whether to give this product two or three stars.  It deserves two stars for its execution, but three stars for trying.<br /><br />I will be trying some others; hopefully I can point readers in another direction.<br /><br />---<br />Update as of 11/23.  I did try another truffle oil...La Truffiere from JR Mushrooms and specialities.  The JR version was so good that I lowered my review of this one (La Tourangelle) to two stars from three stars.  I gave the La Truffiere four stars.  For my details, see the review for La Truffiere.
