While I eat Go Lean Crunch! often -- not least because of the incomparable crunch -- I have been very disappointed with this particular shipment, which has been more chewy than crunchy right from the beginning.  Kind of like it had been opened and then subjected to humidity for too long.  This despite a "Use by" date of 6/2013.  Edible in milk, but otherwise, blech.  Was hoping it was a fluke w/the first box of the 3, but no such luck.  At this point, I can't return it, but if this happens again, I'll have to reconsider where I buy it.
