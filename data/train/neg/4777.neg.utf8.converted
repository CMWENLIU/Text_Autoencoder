Nothing wrong with the sugar besides the fact it is so expensive, and doesn't last very long but, after fun and time taking experimentation I have found a perfect and cheaper substitute, it's called "Turbinado Sugar"  And I found some at the Whole Foods in St. Louis, but I would imagine they sell it at all Whole Foods.  They sell it in bulk, and it's 1.99 per pound.  So in comparison to what you buy in the store or find on Amazon (after shipping),  1 pound of Teavana Tea costs $13.  For the same $13 you can buy 6.5 pounds of Turbinado Sugar.  And you use it in the same ratio that you use the German Rock Sugar, so you get 6.5 times the bang for your buck
