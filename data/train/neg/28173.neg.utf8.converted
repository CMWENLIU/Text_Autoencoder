I was so excited about these Keebler Animal crackers, thought they would be great for Halloween treats and then my kids could finish the rest. Keebler Animal crackers are really quite delicious! BUT these are so stale and soggy that they can't be eaten! Worst of all you can't even read the code on the box or any of the bags so I have no idea if they are old or if the quality is inferior. SO steer clear of these crackers and buy something else! (I wanted to give them NO stars but that option does not seem available!)
