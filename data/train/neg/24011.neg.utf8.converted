When considering which brands of Turmeric Powder are best to purchase and/or the Best Value, I believe it's most important to know the Percentage of Curcumin inside. I made a call to Spicy World yesterday, to ask what percentage is in this particular one. The person I spoke with on the phone, said he would find out and get back to me. I asked him if he would send me an email with the information. Here is the reply I received today at 1:24 PM (3/22/2012):<br />Hello,<br /><br />Thank you for your call yesterday.  I just received a certificate of analysis from our supplier which states that our turmeric contains 3.57% curcumin inside.  Please note that depending on which batch you may receive, the supplier stated this may vary between .5% between batches.<br /><br />I hope this information is useful.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Sachin Agrawal<br />Spicy World of USA, Inc.
