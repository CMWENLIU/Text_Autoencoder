I'm a user of liquid stevia and i was looking for something i could use for baking.  The sweetener never dissolves with the wet ingredients, and, when your baking cools off, you have crunchy crystals of this sweetener in your baking. I even tried dissolving it first by warming up the wet ingredients, it appeared to dissolve, but after cooling i got the same results.  The other reviewers say that you tune into the taste in order to taste it.  I agree, if you use too little, it does not sweeten (you can't taste it), and if you use enough to taste it, you've ruined what you are trying to sweeten with it's nasty tin foil taste.  Dont bother using it for coffee or tea, because it sinks to the bottom of the cup because it does not completely dissolve even in hot water.  I should also mention that its not sweet in the slightest bit.  And i've been off sugar for years, so it's not because i'm used to real sugar.<br /><br />Bleh.
