I bought Primal Chicken Chips thinking it was a safe USA product that could replace <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017TNMVM">Smokehouse 100% Natural Duck Chips Dog Treats, 16oz Reseal Bag</a> - thought it would be a small crispy crunchy chip. I was wrong, there's no "chip" to it, just tough jerky the size of a half-dollar. I had to fold the leathery stuff in half multiple times to tear it into 4 smaller pieces (like trying to tear a leather belt) and my 11 lb. shih tzu still had trouble chewing it and even choked on the last bit. Gave away to a big dog (80 lbs.) - LOVES them.
