I recently purchased 5 cases of Wellness cat food and the cans arrived at my home in their securely wrapped cases all dented up.  One of my cats is turning her nose up at this food - she pigged-out on this food when I brought it home from the local pet food store.  These cans, if they were sitting on a store shelf, would not be purchased and I feel that National Pet Pharmacy is taking advantage of online orders to get rid of canned food that would otherwise not sell.
