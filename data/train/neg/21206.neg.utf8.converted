The new condensed clam chowder product is bland and watery.  It resembles nothing of the original recipe that was recently discontinued.  I wrote an email to the company about it and all they did was mailed me a letter with a couple coupons to get free cans of more chowder and another couple coupons for $0.30 off any snows product. -- Eat more?  Really?  I just told them I didn't like it.  Don't patronize me. -- And from the reviews I've read on here, it doesnt look many other consumers like it either.  It doesn't seem that this is a company who cares about their customer loyalty and longevity. At the end of the day, this company seems to be more concerned about how much they can save on ingredient costs to inflate their profit. Totally disappointing.  I boycott all Bumblebee products now.
