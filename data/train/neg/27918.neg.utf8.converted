I must admit, I haven't gotten many gift baskets in my time. If this one is any indication of what a gift basket is like, Iam not missing anything!!!!<br /><br />To start with, the gift basket is wrapped in cellophane, with a wide dark brown ribbon, with a sticker that says Back Mountain Gift Baskets.  The basket looks like a generic, cheap looking Easter basket, with two handles, one on each side of the basket.  Iam not sure what they are made of.  Inside where the items are, they are nestled in what looks like straw.<br /><br />Now, on to the items inside.<br /><br />1.  A wrapped box that says Kenzi All Natural Dark Napolitans.  Inside that is a box of Raisinettes.  Inside of that is 6 individual, small, solid dark chocolate, thin, red  wrapped bars, which had a gray tinge to them.<br /><br />2.  Next was a wrapped Chocolate Chip Crispie Marshmallow Bar it said on the package.  Inside was a box of Goya Spanish Flan Style Custard..  Inside that was a rice crispie bar with small chocolate chips.  I took a bite of it.  It was not nearly as good as the rice crispie bars you can make at home.  Not by a longshot!!<br /><br />3.  Next was a box of Venus Stoned Wheat Wafers. Inside were 3 cracker wafers.<br /><br />4.  Next was a Lindt Lindor Truffles Mint Chocolate package.  There were 3 inside, individually wrapped.<br /><br />5.Next was a Belgin Truffles box, with 4 individually wrapped inside.<br /><br />6.  Next was a Italian Herb Cheese Spread Box, 3.5 ounces, in a white plastic container.<br /><br />7.  Next was a box of Caramels Fleur De Sel.  Inside that was a box of Crystal Light Lemonade Box.  Inside that was 5 individually wrapped caramels.<br /><br />8.  Next was a box of Ferrara Milk Chocolate Covered Raisins Box, with grayish what looks like covered raisins.<br /><br />9.  Next was a box that said Milk Chocolate Napolitans.  Inside that was a Royal box of cherry gelatin.  Inside that is 6 individual, thin, small brown wrapped bars.  Like the Dark, Kenzi All Natural Napolitans.  They too had a grayish tinge to them.<br /><br />10.  Next was a box of Cafe Vergnano 1882 Biscoffee Bars. Inside was 4 Coffee Vergano thin, solid packaged bars.  Not sure it it's coffee or not.<br /><br />11 and 12.  Next was a one ounce bag of Trophy Farms All Natural Oven Roasted Peanuts, and a one ounce bag of Trophy Farms All Natural Fruit and Nuts.<br /><br />13.  Next was a sachet type box of Ernest Hemingway Highland Select Tea with 4 individually wrapped Ernest Hemingway tea bags.<br /><br />14.  Next was a box that said Stauffer's Original Recipe Ginger Snaps.  Inside was a box that said Stauffer's Original Animal Crackers.  Inside of that was a 2.3 ounce package of Stauffer's Original Recipe Ginger Snaps.<br /><br />I didn't see any coffee that I know of, and I definitely did not see any salami as stated in the description that I read.<br /><br />When I asked to receive this basket, by the description it sounded like it would be a United Nations Basket, with items from other countries which intrigued me.  Instead each item was made in the United States.<br /><br />Sadly, I would have much preferred the fake boxes of Jello, Crystal Light, Flan Custard, and Animal Crackers, rather than what the real items was.  At least I recognized the fake boxes, and they would have actually been something I could have used.<br /><br />What I got, most of it I plan to throw away.<br /><br />If in the description it says with a celebration in mind, the joke is on me, or I didn't get the joke, even tho I do have a good sense of humor.<br /><br />The endless unwrapping of each item, I wouldn't have minded if they had been quality items, but when I was finished unwrapping everything I was  just glad it was over!!<br /><br />I don't at this point know what this gift basket will be selling for, but to me, even a dollar would be too much!<br /><br />This basket was more like a gag gift to me.  I didn't find it funny at all!! I definitely would NOT send this to someone else, especially if it were someone I loved, or even liked, unless you are trying to get even with someone, but I couldn't even do that!<br /><br />In a nutshell, I am disappointed, to say the least! This just proves to me, that what you see online when you order something, it may not be what you thought at all when you actually do receive what you ordered!!<br /><br />These are my opinions only.  Someone else might enjoy this gift basket. I didn't!  It's cheap looking, the items inside are cheap looking, etc.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I did receive another gift basket today. The one that I received today was NOT the same gift basket that I had received when I wrote my original review above.<br /><br />By that I mean the gift basket that I received today was NOT the original one that I got, not the prototype above, but not even the same gift basket that I had received minus the wierdness, tackyness, and about a hundred other words that I could write to give a description of the FIRST nightmare of a gift basket that I had received.<br /><br />The only similarity from the original gift basket and then this second gift basket is that it's the same gift basket, but the one I received today is a darker color.  Everything else about it is the same as the first gift basket I received, the actual basket.<br /><br />There was a note taped to the outside of this gift basket showing that the orginal gift basket I received was a pre-production, prototype, mock-up that was never intended to be released to the general public.  I HOPE NOT!!!<br /><br />It never occured to me that any gift basket I would ever receive would not be the one that anyone else would have received.<br /><br />Obviously this company needs better quality control, because the one I originally received I never would have let it see the light of day, period.<br /><br />I was hoping that the gift basket that I received today would be the one I originally was supposed to receive to see how it really should have been, but the one I got today is an entirely different gift basket all together.<br /><br />The gift basket I received today was one entirely devoted to coffee, period.  It included:<br /><br />1.  A can of Ground Irish Coffee- 1.75 ounces. The brand is Bewley's Of Ireland, but on the back of the can it says Comfort Foods, Inc.  North Andover, MA.  I will be giving this coffee away.  I can't stand anything that is Irish Cream, no matter what it is.<br /><br />2.  3 packets of different ground coffees, each 1.3 ounces, in flavors of Breakfast Blend, Amaretto Royale, and Moca Java, from a company called Arbuckle's.  The city is Verona, PA.  Each packet of coffee is supposed to make about 10 cups of coffee depending on how strong you like it.<br /><br />3. A coffee mug that says a warm mug of Coffee, the best at igourment.com.  Your standard sized mug.  The writing is in a brown color, the mug itself is like an off white/beige color.  I will also be giving this mug away.  It's just not the kind of mug that I use either for coffee or tea.  The mug is ok, for what it is.<br /><br />4.  A small box that says Sugar in the raw, that has 6 packets.  I know I can buy this same brand in any grocery store.<br /><br />4.  A taller box that says Creamer for your coffee.  Inside that box is 10 packets of a generic looking non-dairy creamer.  I will also be giving this away as I don't use powdered creamer at all, but a liquid flavored creamer.<br /><br />5.A taller box that says Coffee Stirrers.  Inside that are 9 wooden coffee stirrers, like a thin popsicle stick. They aren't even plastic coffee stirrers!<br /><br />6.  A roll of King Original Peppermints which I assume is some kind of mints- 1.55 ounces.<br /><br />7.  A box of Caffe' Vergnano 1882 Biscoffee- 0.83 ounces.  I did receive this same thing in my first gift basket.  They taste like almond cookies.  The box says Product of Italy, but on the back of the box the state shown is PA.  Hardly Italy!<br /><br />8.  Several small packets of biscuit type cookies, to have with coffee.  About 6 of those total.<br /><br />In summary this gift basket was not the tacky, etc one like the first gift basket that I received, but I wouldn't call this one great either.  I wouldn't send this gift basket to anyone I know.  It doesn't look gourmet to me at all.<br /><br />The only things I will be keeping are the packets of coffee, the sugar in the raw, tho as a rule I don't use sugar period, and never in coffee.  I just use flavored liquid creamer in my coffee, and maybe the basket.  The rest I will be giving away.<br /><br />It's really hard to give an update since this second gift basket is not like the first one I received as far as the contents of the basket.<br /><br />I hate to say this, and I will leave it up to anyone who cares to read my review as to if they want to purchase either of these gift baskets or any others from this company, but I  don't like this company, period.<br /><br />They lack any imagination as far as the products/packaging they include in their gift baskets, which if I had to rate the gift baskets based soley on the contents of what was included in either gift basket, I would have to say the first gift basket I received had more variety than this second gift basket did.  I could see what the contents of the first gift basket would have contained, minus all of the wierd packaging that it had, tho some of the products of that one looked old, non-edible.  I threw most of that one away, period.  I didn't even give any of that gift basket away.<br /><br />My real question and my summary of this company is if it's named igourmet, where is the gourmet in their products?  Also, they are supposed to be products that are not from the U.S.A., but once again both gift baskets contained items only from the U.S.A.<br /><br />Most of what they include in their gift baskets, I could find either the same products or higher quality products than theirs in any grocery store.<br /><br />Like I said, it's hard to update a review if the gift baskets are entirely different, how can you compare them to post a review?  All I can do which is what I did in my first review, and that is to state what products were included in this second gift basket, and leave the rest of it up to any potential buyers out there who are considering purchasing a gift basket from this or any other company.<br /><br />I do appreciate getting a second gift basket, which after the first one I was kind of dreading what I would receive in this second gift basket, but this one too does NOT have any wow factor, or quality look to it.<br /><br />To me, especially if it were something like a gift basket it would not only be about the products included, which would be high quality products, but quality packaging too which I enjoy trying products from other companies, perhaps products I had never tried before, but to me it's not only about the items included in the gift basket, but the presentation too matters to me.  It shouldn't show cheap.<br /><br />Also, I don't understand how any company who specializes in gift baskets would include items that you could easily find in any grocery store, but their's is lower quality.<br /><br />How much thought goes into this companies gift baskets?  If I were a company who made gift baskets, I would want it to look like alot of thought went into what they included in their gift basket, from the items they include to their packaging, etc.  It's the total package that matters to me in the end.  I would want my gift baskets to be memorable, thoughtful and enjoyable.  With this company their gift baskets are forgettable, sadly.<br /><br />If I had to rate this second gift basket by how many stars I would give it, I would have to give it a 2, and that is being generous.<br /><br />Sorry, that is just how I see it!
