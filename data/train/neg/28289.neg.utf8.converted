We are not beer drinkers so learning first off that this cannot be used in the bread mixer...did I miss that? then to find I need to buy molasses and beer to make the bread...well it was not a happy surprise.  I did it though and the result was very interesting.  It is a heavy, dark bread with interesting flavor.  Crumbly and not for sandwiches but more like a breakfast bread.
