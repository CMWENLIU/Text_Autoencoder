The reviews were good; variety sounded good, but by the time you add the chicken and the tomatoes and the milk, you've paid several dollars for about 1/2 cup of dried potatoes and spices.  Was not surprised to see that potato is the primary ingredient.<br /><br />Yes, as reviewers said, nice blend of spices but unless you add quite a lot of your own ingredients to the pot, there is no substance - just nicely flavored milk/water.  Will not buy again.
