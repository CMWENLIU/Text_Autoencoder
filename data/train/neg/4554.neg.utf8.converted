The product is good--I have had three orders so far. The problem is with the manufacturer's credibility. One box was much lighter when I picked it up even though it was closed when I examined it. It was about 200g  instead of 500g with sugar cubes freely moving on a bottom of the box. I have no idea what happened and it is impossible to report it to Amazon--missing links, circular instruction, no phone numbers, no customer support links. The buttons on most pages, even on Returns page are "Continue Shopping".
