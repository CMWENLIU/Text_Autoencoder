I specifically ordered MERRICK brand flossies and this vendor sent me generic flossies.  There is a clear difference in the weight and quality and my dog dosen't like them.  When I emailed them asking if they substituted the name brand with generics I received no response.  MERRICK flossies are great- this vendor not so hot.
