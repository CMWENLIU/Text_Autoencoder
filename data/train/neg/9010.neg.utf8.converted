I am a sucker for all things chocolate, and fudge-anything is even more decadently delicious. I jumped at the chance to try these new Chips Ahoy cookies and was extremely disappointed when I didn't like them. The cookie is very similar to those large Grandma's two-pack Fudge Choco-Chip you get from vending machines, but with a fudge-like stuff cocooned in the middle and surrounded by a thin crispy substance (may be sugar, may be white chocolate?).<br /><br />In describing them, they sound delish, but my first-bite impression is a processed and overly-salty flavor that hides the chocolate goodness. At 150 calories every 2 cookies, I'd rather get my choco-fix from a Hershey bar.<br /><br />On the plus side, the new resealable package is great, and keeps you from having to slide the tray out to access a couple of cookies, much less messy!<br /><br />I'm sure there are people that love these, but in my opinion, if you're looking for real old-fashioned fudge flavor, these won't satisfy.
