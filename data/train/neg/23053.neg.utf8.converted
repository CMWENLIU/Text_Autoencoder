I ordered this formula after carefully researching several of the organic brands. One thing that is a deal breaker for me is corn syrup in baby formula. The ingredient list here and on the formula's own website says nothing about corn syrup, but low and behold on the can, "corn syrup solids". Well, 'organic' corn syrup solids, which to me is no better.  Skip this if you don't want corn syrup in your baby's formula, but if it doesn't bother you, you can find other brands with corn syrup for less $$ than this one. I'll be returning it.
