I found this tea to be weak and bitter. Also, all the tea bags, which are in gimmicky triangled shaped tea bags are packed loose in the cardboard box so there's a bunch of loose tea in the bottom of the box. Accordingly, to keep it fresh, one needs to put the bags into an airtight canister or zip lock bag. To have 240 tea bags packed loosely in a cardboard box is just simply poor packaging. The tea arrived somewhat stale and even if it had not, it would have become stale in short order.<br /><br />I see this has received a lot of positive reviews. I've not read them and my review is not influenced by them in anyway. I would never buy this tea again and could not in good conscience recommend it. Perhaps I'm picky but there are too many really good black teas available to, in my humble opinion, ever give this product consideration.
