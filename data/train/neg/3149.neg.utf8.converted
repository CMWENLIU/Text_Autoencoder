I should have heeded the other reviewers who noted that this product was stale on arrival. Same thing happened to me. Amazon was quick to remedy the problem, as it always is.<br /><br />But, stay away from this product. The package had no expiration date so there is no telling how old it is. And whole wheat products tend to go stale more quickly.
