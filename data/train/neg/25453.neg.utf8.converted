My mother and my father had ordered this as an Easter gift for me. They bought in "the online candy shop" trough Amazon on April 9th and payed $25.00 for EXPEDITED delivery. They told me I should receive it by the 12th at the latest, because as stated in the store's shipping policy, expedited to US address takes 1-3 business days. Not only I just received it late afternoon on 04/16, when I opened the box all I could find was melted chocolate all around. I was very very upset and even more when I came to Amazon to leave a neg review and found out it was supposed to be shipped with a gift wrap and nice bow. That's what my parents had payed for (and obviously to send me edible chocolate!). And i was amazed to see that in the shop's shipping policies I found the information: "Expedited orders will be packed with reusable ice packs and insulation at no additional charge. The Online Candy Shop is not responsible for damage of meltable items during shipping, unless an expedited shipping method is chosen."<br />In my case, the expedited shipping didn't come with ice packs and insulation, and neither the nice gift wrap that's in the product description page. Not to mention is IS NOT 1 pound of chocolate. it's written on the box, it's 14 ounces. NEVER BUY FROM THIS STORE. I never had even a slight problem with amazon marketplace purchases before.
