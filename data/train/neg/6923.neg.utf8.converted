When you put these cups in the Kuerig the plastic is so flimsy instead of piercing a hole in the bottom to drain the coffee, the plastic is bent. So the water goes into the k-cup overflows out into your coffee cup, coffee grounds and all. I've tried to pierce a hole myself to no avail. I Wasted $17!!!! Don't waste YOUR money.
