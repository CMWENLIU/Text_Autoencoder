Well, I fell for it too! This is the biggest scam I have ever seen. Are people aware that Penn State couldn't find anything special about Mr. Trivedi? Are people also aware that several of the endorsements that he claims are not true and he has been contacted to remove those endorsements. It's good tasting water, but not at $39.00 for 24 which works out to $1.63 per bottle. I am going back to my Crystal Geyser water that costs me 11 CENTS PER BOTTLE.
