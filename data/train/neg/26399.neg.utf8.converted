First I have to say that I am glad this arrived - When I opened the package I expected another package of k-cups rather a varity pack. No! Instead what I did find was a bunch of random k-cups carelessly tossed in with no real care. I am hesitant to use them as they have been handeled by another person or persons and for all I know these k-cups could in some way be tampered with not being properly packaged! Personally my first impression upon opening this was much like a bottle of OTC meds - there is the label that states "do not use if seal is broken" well as I mention... where is the rest of the packaging? I think that I am probably going to just throw them out as there was no packing slip and since this was suppose to be a gift to go with a Keurig coffee maker I would be highly embarrassed to give this as a gift.
