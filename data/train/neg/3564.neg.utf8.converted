The description states that this is roasted the day they ship.<br />The first order I placed was 2 months old. I wrote Amazon to notify them and they kindly shipped me another order, free of charge.<br />Same roast date.<br /><br />I made this in an espresso machine and a french press. It tastes like office coffee. Coffee flavored water.<br /><br />Check your roast dates, YMMV. It's a white tag on the bottom. It's written in julian format.
