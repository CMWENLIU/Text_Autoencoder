I am very disappointed when I opened the tea. It's not pure green tea, instead mixing with some kind of flowers. The tea leaves are broken ones, no tea shape, no traditional green tea flavor. As a matter of fact, you can't even call it "green" tea. It's definitely not for the traditional green tea drinkers.
