(update)According to an article on CNN.com on 8/5/11, the nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the label.<br />"Researchers at ConsumerLab.com tested the sodium, potassium, magnesium, and sugar content of three leading brands of coconut water, and they found that only one, Zico Natural, contained the stated amount for all four ingredients.<br /><br />The sugar and potassium content in the other two brands, Vita Coco and O.N.E., almost matched the label. But the amounts of sodium and magnesium--two nutrients key to hydration--were as much as 82% and 35% lower, respectively, than the listed amount."<br /><br />I ordered two to try out from Amazon but while waiting on the delivery, I was out shopping when I observed a lot of companies were suddenly cashing out on coconut milk/water! I bought one brand-name from Lucky's Super Market and another brand from Walgreen's next door. Being of Polynesian heritage and homegrown from the islands but living on the mainland, I thought, "Hmmm..all these centuries coconuts been around, suddenly its being pitched as nutritional & interesting. Let's see what the catch is". Both were almost $3.00 but only a particular brand I bought at Lucky's taste like REAL COCONUT MILK 'WATER/Milk' right out the coconut. In Asia, coconut milk comes from "soaking the flesh of the older coconut". But I'm not from Asia which is why I call it coconut milk & not coconut water right of the coconut.<br /><br /> Finally, VitaCoCo came. I tasted it and spit it right out. It didnt taste like coconut water to our family 'at all'. Then I looked to see where it was produced. Before I go further let me explain something to those who may not know. Agriculture for fruits are always better on tropical islands, or from the Caribbean islands. You won't find any fruits more richer in juice or sweeter anywhere else in the world. Vita CoCo says it is produced by a company in Latin America, Brazil. Produced for All Markets Inc. New York, NY. My sister then poured some into a glass and screamed, "OMG They're ripping people off! It's watered down!" She said that because pure coconut milk has a milky color to it. Some less, some more but never crystal clear. The younger the fruit, the richer, more nutritional, and milky the coconut milk. The more mature the fruit, the sweeter & thinner the milk. As the fruit ripens the coconut water gets converted into the solid meat of the fruit. The meat then becomes more nutritional then the milk. So I told her that they weren't ripping consumers off because it says, 100% pure coconut WATER. It's either a little coconut milk diluted with a lot of pure water, or this is what Brazilian coconuts taste like (flat)? And it seems like they're using 'over-riped' coconuts. Which makes sense. Then the meat of the coconut could be sold and not tossed out.<br /><br />As for those who have to have potassium every night like my aunt, DO NOT rely on Vita Coco's ad. My aunt finished off the 17 fl oz of Vita CoCo and still woke up with painful side effects from taking prednisone. This is also how we knew Vita CoCo must be using over-ripe less nutritional coconuts, or watering it down. I ended up having to prepare the daily one banana she's suppose to have before bedtime. Drink mango or guava juice all! The most nutritional of all island fruits ;)
