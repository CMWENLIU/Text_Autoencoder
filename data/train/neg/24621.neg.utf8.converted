Its my understanding the the idea to buying bulk is that the per unit cost decreases versus going to the store and buying one unit. Its this principal that lets stores make money. Now. I've done the math and 45.99/12=3.83. Something look wrong to you? I buy a can or two every day, and at 7-11, quick-chek, wawa, etc,they cost 3.00 or 3.50 if they feel expensive that day, sometimes a deal 2 for 4. Amazon is the only seller of these bulk on the web (besides the starbucks supplier stores use) so they know they can gouge pries. My recommendation is to go to the nearest 7-11 and buy 12 for 36 dollars and avoid amazon all together.There are things they are great for, buying energy drinks in bulk isn't one of them.
