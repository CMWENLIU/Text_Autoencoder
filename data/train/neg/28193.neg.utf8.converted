Like all bob's red mill mixes this tastes strongly of beans.<br /><br />The cake looked great and unlike most GF mixes this bag made a two layer cake, lovely, but the smell of the batter and the taste of the finished cake was AWFUL. We could not get past the bean-flavor. Very disappointing, I can not believe all the good reviews for this product!
