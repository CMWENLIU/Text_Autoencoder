After the disappointment of the shampoo, I had somewhat high hopes still for the conditioner, especially if I could use this for cowashing. When I bagan to pour out the conditioner, I instantly noticed how watery it was. As I applied it to my hair, it was just like putting water on it, it was runny and gave no slip as I tried to detangle my hair. Honestly, this is a cheap ineffective conditioner. There are more synthetics inside of this product than shea butter which is far down on the list of ingredients. You would do much better buying some V05 conditioner for $1. If you're looking for a hydrating conditioner that gives good slip for natural hair, try Herbal Essences Hello Hydration. It has silicones just like this one but provides much better results. After using both the shampoo and conditioner, I was left with lifeless, dull hair with a waxy film over it.
