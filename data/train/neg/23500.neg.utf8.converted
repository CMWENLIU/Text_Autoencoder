For the past 3 years, I've been purchasing the Pour Over cheese popcorn which was FANTASTIC. Well, Orville decides to stop making this heavenly goodness so now I had to find something to replace it. I was hoping this Cheddar popcorn would be just as good, but it wasn't. I'm very disappointed in Orville Redenbacher as this is the second time that I know of that they've discontinued making a wonderful popcorn (Cinnabon Pour Over popcorn is the other). Looks like I'll have to find another brand that can satisfy my taste buds.
