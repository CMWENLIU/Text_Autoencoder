I decided to stalk up our emergency food closet with a lot of different Hamburger & Chicken Helpers because they are so inexpensive and I have tons of ground beef and chicken that I've canned in there already.  However, unless you plan to use these fairly soon don't buy them as some of the expiration dates were as little as a couple of months away.  Very few had dates as far out as 6 months.  If you plan to use them soon and regularly then go for it but they are not a good idea for a long term emergency food storage.
