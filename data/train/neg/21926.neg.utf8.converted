I do not understand the 5-star reviews of these nasty-flavored cans of apple- and grape-juice,they just taste awful.<br />With more calories than a regular Coke I don't care if this is made from juice or not.<br />The Lemon/Lime-flavor is the worst. It contain no citrus-juice,but like all the other flavors,it is made from apple and<br />grape juices with a variety of added flavor and a bit of carbonation,just to fizzy it up. YUCK!
