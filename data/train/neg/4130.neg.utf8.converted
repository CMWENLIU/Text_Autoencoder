I would be the first to applaud these products if they were good.  Unfortunately, I would rather give up drinking that have to drink this tasteless slop.  There is a very nasty, artificial acrid, too citrusy, while at the same time too sweet, taste to these products. The strawberry margherita mix has a very faint taste of strawberry, but no amount of doctoring could make it drinkable.  I poured the mix out.  The Mai Tai mix -- poured it out.  I bought several bottle/dry drink mixes of all their varieties without trying them first.  BIG MISTAKE!  I am either going to pour them out or throw them out, since the folks at Baja Bob's web site have refused to even respond to my request that I return the unopened products for a refund.  You will also note that on their web site's "fan club" page, there are 0 entries.  Save your money unless you are totally desperate.  You'd be better off using Crystal Light Ruby Red Grapefruit.  Now, that tastes pretty good mixed with Vodka.
