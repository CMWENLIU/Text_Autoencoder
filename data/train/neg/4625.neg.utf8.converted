If my dog was writing this review he would give Chef Michael's dog food five stars.  He loved it and wolfed it down.  The kids even used pieces of the food for training games and he eagerly participated.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the dog and I have a different idea of what smells good.  Large amounts of soy give my dog (just a year old) horrendous gas.  I actually didn't read the label before I fed it to him which was completely my fault.  I assumed that a dog food marketed as gourmet would have better quality ingredients.<br /><br />It clearly is very palatable to dogs.  Owners will need to look carefully at the ingredients and decide if it works for them.
