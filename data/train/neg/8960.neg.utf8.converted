In search for a whole grain, organic, unsweetened, and unsalted cereals, I was happy to run across this puffed wheat.  It tastes good but not organic.  I read every single prints on the bag.  There is no mention of its being organic, which is important to me since being organic = non-GMO.  All Arrowhead Mills puffed products are advertised as "ORGANIC" but only the Kamut cereal has the organic seal.  I'm switching to kamut cereal.  I gave it 1 star to get other buyers' attention.
