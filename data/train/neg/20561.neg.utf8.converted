Ok, I know this is an organic grain product but flavor has to count for something.  This stuff is like eating little chunks of wood.  It has no flavor whatsoever.  It take a while to put a bowl of this stuff away because it's very hard -- even when soaked in milk. (I use rice milk because it's sweeter than soy milk.)
