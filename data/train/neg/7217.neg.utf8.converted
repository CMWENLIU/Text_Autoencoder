There's no denying that coffee singles are convenient for people who don't drink coffee every day or don't want to deal with the hassle of cleaning out the coffee maker (like myself).  However, the coffee from these singles is rather bland, with not much taste and no body.  Personally, I'm not convinced that theses singles are that much better than instant coffee.  Use them for the caffeine, not the taste.
