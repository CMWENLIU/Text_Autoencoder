Product is great stuff, but I had no idea what they retailed for in stores.  I was doing christmas shopping at WM and came accross this and was shock to see it costing only $3.49, and it wasn't even on sale.  My order was for $25.31 here on Amazon, no tax, no ship, sold by Family Fun Shoppes LTD.  That works out to $6.33 per bottle.<br /><br />Saw nothing but 5/4 stars, naturally assumed it was a good buy, wished I had read all the comments first, I'm giving it only 1 star so that the next buyer know what they're getting. Again product itself is excellent, the seller, not so much.
