This is the worst green tea I have ever had. Don't be fooled by the pristine picture on the packaging. This tea is made in China--I doubt where this tea is grown looks anything like the picture. I try not to buy food products from China considering how polluted it is. This may be "organic" but the water and air in China is toxic so it doesnt really matter. The taste is all off and it leaves a sour/bitter taste in your mouth. The tea bags are made of a cheap brown material. Overall this product is bad.
