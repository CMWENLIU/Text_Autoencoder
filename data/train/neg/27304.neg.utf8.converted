I have been feeding this formula to my baby for four months now, thinking that I was providing the safest, purest formula available.  Today on the news I saw a report on a study conducted at Dartmouth University that revealed formulas made from rice sugar have extremely high, UNSAFE levels of arsenic in them.  Doing some more research, I see that arsenic is naturally in high levels in rice.  The levels discovered in this formula exceed what an adult should ingest.  I'm so concerned about my baby's health from use of this product.  I'm writing this review because I want other Moms to be aware of this new report and please, do the research before you pick this product.  I would LOVE to see the company's response to this study.  I would think that they would test for unsafe levels of all chemicals within their product.
