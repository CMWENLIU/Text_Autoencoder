The Simple Solution Pee Post is a good idea from a human perspective.  I inserted the post in a part of the yard that I wanted to be used as 'the' area and they didn't even sniff it as something new, let alone as an attractant.  The package lists about 'pee here' technology and descriptions list is a training device that "teaches your pet to urinate in a specific area of your yard".  NOT TRUE.  You can teach your dog to use it but you have to do just that...take the dog to the post until it goes, everytime you want it to go there, until it understands it is on the 'marking' route.  My dogs have this as one of many places in the yard that they use.  So it didn't work here and was a waste of my money.
