I don't know what was wrong with this food, but my cats couldn't eat it.  When they tried they would start chewing and it would fall out of their mouths.  They tried for about an hour to no avail.<br />I don't know if it was the size of the food or what.  They didn't seem to dislike the taste, they just could not eat it.
