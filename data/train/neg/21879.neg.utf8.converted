This product is a huge rip-off. The chocolate chip cookies were almost like astronaut food as far as consistency. I counted a total of 8 half-dollar size cookies in the package and 4 of which had only 1 chocolate chip each. The other food was of similar quality, appearing to be cheap processed junk food. For the price of this package and the amount of snacks received and quality, I say completely avoid this rip-off.
