I bought this because I am on a diet and I like to buy things in small packages to control portions. Once I got them and read the nutrition information I discovered that these are very high calorie for their size (around 220 calories). I am going to stick with Ritz Crackerfuls, double the flavor and half the calories (120 calories). The flavor of all of these Austins was bland and boring and there was never enough filling between the crackers or cookies. Most of the packets I opened had crushed pieces which spilled cracker dust all over the place. I tried one of each variety in this package and took the rest to work to give away to co-workers.
