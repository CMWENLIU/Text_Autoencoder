I didn't like this jerky at all.  I read other reviews and decided to try it.  However, the bag I received was very soft and sweet.  I realize that it's called "sweet" n' spicy, but it wasn't spicy at all.  The sweetness was overpowering.  I prefer at dryer jerky also.  This was so soft that you could bite right through it.  I'm used to jerky that is tougher.<br /><br />I know I'll never purchase this brand again.
