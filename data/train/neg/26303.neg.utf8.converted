On Monday August 22, 2011 the Pop-Tarts, Frosted Strawberry, 12-Count Tarts (Pack of 12) was $25.91 and was not available for subscribe and save.  The product is now priced at $32.89 and is available to subscribe and save for $27.96 08/24/11 the price went up in a matter of two days. The price of items or products on special do not go up in price they can be lower but not raised. Where do Amazon get its pricing scale from items are priced all over the place. You have customers paying different prices for the same items the only different is the flavor. Flavor does not determine the price of an item.<br />Amazon is trying to get over with these made up prices, lower the price when want to and raise them to make money on special offer for the month. Subscribe and save goes up often I purchased the Oreo pack of 48 three months ago for $15.13, a month before they were $15.30 now they are $15.98
