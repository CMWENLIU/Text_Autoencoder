Excited about receiving my cans of pumpkin because we serve overseas in a country with no pumpkins, I quickly lost the excitement when I saw that every single can was dented significantly.  The other reviews are right!  Do not buy this product unless you are okay with using dented cans, which have been proven to grow harmful bacteria!
