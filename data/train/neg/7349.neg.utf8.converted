I've been hunting for a good quality edible glitter for months now, and from the photo and the other reviews, I though this was going to be what I wanted. It's not. These are just those sugar crystal sprinkles that you can get in the grocery store (clear or colored) for about $3 a bottle. They are slightly smaller and shinier than what I've seen, but there's not enough of a difference to be worth $11 a bottle plus shipping. Big disappointment...
