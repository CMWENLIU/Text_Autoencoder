This used to be decent tuna as recently as 6 months ago. The last two orders have been dissppointing in that these are supposedly packaged in Olive Oil. There is virtually no Olive oil in whatever the watery liquid is that runs out of the can. The consumer is then treated to the driest tuna ever! You have been warned....
