I'm looking for an oat cereal to feed a young child and was excited to see that General Mills offered an organic alternative to its well-known conventionally-made Cheerios.  Imagine my dismay to see that they've recently adulterated the product both with sugar and with cheap corn fillers.  When General Mills acquired Cascadian Farms, they made a big show out of keeping on founder and CEO Gene Kahn to run the new subsidiary.  Now, Kahn holds the title of Vice President of Sustainable Development at General Mills.  It seems he's either lost touch with the company he founded, or has sold out to the interests of his new mega-corporation paymasters.<br /><br />Shame, Gene!  Is this sugared corn-stuffed junk really what you founded Cascadian Farms to produce?
