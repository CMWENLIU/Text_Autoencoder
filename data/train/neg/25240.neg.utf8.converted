A co-worker used to use this product.  The spray remains in the air and can be detected as a heavy scent several yards away (huge warehouse-type building), and caused asthmatic reactions after use in normal-sized rooms.  He kindly shared the product information with me AND ceased using it out of concern for those affected.  Many individuals later expressed privately to me that the odor was repulsive, even if it had not been over-strong (it is apparently impossible to apply the spray version of this product "lightly").  So if you are trying to be a chick magnet, DON'T buy this product.  "Your cologne is making me gag and nearly pass out" isn't the conversation you want to start with "the ladies."
