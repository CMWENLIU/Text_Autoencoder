They had this for $2.29 at CVS (which used to be SavOns). It seemed like a Christmasy thing so I bought it. There are six big pieces inside. One of them was broken in half, but I didn't mind. The candy looks pretty and it tastes so-so. It's not one of my favorite kinds of candy, but I bought it to celebrate Christmas. I think I haven't had ribbon candy in many years. I don't remember seeing it around until today at CVS. I think they should use better tasting flavors in this candy. They're really not very good flavors. A couple of pieces were licorice, which I don't like, and one piece was spearmint, which I really hate. I hate anything that is spearmint flavored. There are many much better flavors that they could have used. They really should improve their product.
