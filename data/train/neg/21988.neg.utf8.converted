I ordered this because I once bought great teabags called Two Leaves and a Bud that came in a triangular shaped teabag and were very good.<br /><br />These are not that. I am not sure if the manufacturer has downgraded their quality or what but here are problems with these that I didn't have when I originally bought from this company a year ago:<br /><br />The teabags are packed together more tightly now and are squished into small plastic packages, you are supposed to expand the teabag into it's original 3D shape afterwards, this doesn't work as well as the original packaging.<br /><br />But the bigger problem is that the bit of paper on the end of the teabag string (does this have a name?) is glued, actually STUCK, in each individual package to the teabag portion. Try as you might to detach it so you can put only the bag and not the paper into your tea, it will rip the bag, and then tea leaves will leak out! I should call it tea dust becuase tea leaves are what they used tohave, but squished into thier new package they are just and expensive version of any other organic camomile tea, they are no longer the cool unique ones that had really quality tea in them.<br /><br />I am a pretty picky person about my tea, but I am very dissapointed overall as this is not what I remember or expected about the quality of this tea.
