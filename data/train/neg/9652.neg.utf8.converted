After reading glowing reviews here, I ordered 3 different bundt cakes. Today I made the streusel. Adding 3 eggs and a stick and half of butter, I don't consider this a mix! I was careful with directions, tested it with a toothpick. Cake looked good, but it is dry and not very tasty. Something is missing - flavor.<br /><br />I'll have to doctor up the remaining cake "mixes", as it is too late to return them.
