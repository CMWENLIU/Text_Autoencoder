Crude Oil is natural, too, but I'm not going to feed it to my dog. Corn is bad for dogs and any vet will tell you that. At least whole corn is human-edible. Corn gluten meal's other use is as an herbicide (shudder). No thank you. Do the research, this also has 'animal fat', which has been listed as a very unhealthy ingredient as well. Purina can try dressing up this stuff as much as they like, it's still bad for dogs and it's filler.<br /><br />If you have enough money to buy yourself snack foods, if you're not eating ramen noodles for the last two weeks of every month and if you can drive through a fast-food joint, then feed your dog food that will extend his life.
