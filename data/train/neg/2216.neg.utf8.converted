Like many high-carbohydrate instant "soups," the Lentil Couscous Soup is more couscous than soup.  Preparation is easy, although mine boiled over when prepared according to the very precise (1 minute, 40 seconds) cooking time in the instructions.  I would have preferred a more vague time endpoint and directions to watch for boiling.  The resulting food is quite bland as other reviewers have noted, and what this "low-sodium" (330 mg) soup really needed was more salt.  The flavors that were present were nondescript, neither the couscous nor the lentils providing a distinctive flavor note.  I kept looking at the package to see what kind of flavor I should have been expecting.  The texture was also pretty monotonous, and the couscous itself did not have the best texture, which was disappointing because good couscous is not that hard to make.  As for healthy eating, the product is essentially pasta with lentils added to provide some protein and fiber, and with 37 grams of carbs the 190 calories are pretty empty -- not all that much different from macaroni with low-fat cheese.  I'm glad I tried it, I won't mind eating the other 5 cups in the pack, but I won't be buying it again.
