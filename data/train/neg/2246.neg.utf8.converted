2 points for nutritional numbers, convenience and texture, but compared to other instant oatmeals, the flavor is awful. There is a bitter artificial sweetener taste (remember saccharin?), as well as a hint of artificial butter flavoring; never tasted that in any Maple & Brown Sugar product. For me, it's even a little too salty. These noticeable flavors overwhelm the M&BS goodness.<br /><br />I bought this at a supermarket, and am debating whether to throw the rest out (have strong moral issues with wasting food), or saving it for an emergency. Will never buy again.
