I inquired with the seller if this salt was unprocessed sea salt and they had no clue.  I was very disappointed but should have known it was processed by the whiteness of the product. Unprocessed sea salt retains all the natural occuring minerals from the sea which is why it appears speckled and beige (gray if Celtic). However when it get processed those sea minerals that gives it that speckling effect are stripped away making it no different than the mineral empty table salt you find on most grocer shelves for 30 cents.
