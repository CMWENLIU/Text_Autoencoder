I have been drinking tea for years. This particular blend of green and white tea by the folks at Celestial Seasonings is quite possibly the worst cup of tea I have ever had. Green tea naturally has a grassy kind of taste to it, but it is very light and hidden behind the smooth, sweet, and slightly bitter taste the rest of the flavor produces. I love the taste of a solid green tea, however this is anything but. I don't know what exactly went wrong with this blend of green and white, but the final product remains consistant no matter how many times I try to give CS a chance to prove it was just a bad batch I have recieved. The smoothness and slightly sweet flavor is totally gone and you are left with nothing, NOTHING but bitter grass. I am not a particularly picky tea drinker folks, I can tell you of the kind I have had which is better than the others, but I still can find enjoyment in most teas I consume. This particular brand is just totally unpleasing to the pallet in every way and there is no way I can possibly recommend you avoid it enough.
