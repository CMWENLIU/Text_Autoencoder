I have been a loyal fan of SBC since it was Stewart Brothers Coffee waaay back. For the longest time Henry's Blend has been a staple in our home. Unfortunately, since corporate brass decided that a good thing needed changing, this replacement doesn't do Henry justice. We gave Level 4 a try and disliked it from the start. After going back and buying an original Henry's Blend and pouring coffee grounds out side by side next to the Level 4, there was a noticeable difference in color, texture and aroma. Sad to say, but I will have to find another roaster of our beloved beans.<br />After hearing other stories like this with the other Levels and the disappearace of trusted blends, it makes me wonder if corporate is purposely trying to kill off SBC or create a media fiasco like Coca-Cola did with "New Coke" in the 80's. Who knows.<br />Goodbye Henry. You will be missed.  :(
