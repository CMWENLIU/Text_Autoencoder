I love rye bread, and grew up smelling and tasting fresh loaves of it in the New York City area.  I've been trying all the Hodgson Mill's breads and looked forward to this one.  So far I have baked three loaves of the rye mix, and it comes out looking very little like the photo on the box.<br /><br />Although the smell is somewhat pleasant (a fairly mild rye smell actually), the loaf does not seem to form the many tiny air pockets depicted or expected.  Thus it is incredibly dense, which makes for easy slicing, but a not-terribly-nice mouth-feel on those deli-meat sandwiches I remember from my youth.  The Publix supermarket-baked rye and rye-pumpernickel is actually much closer, from a texture point of view.<br /><br />Perhaps it is my bread machine, a slightly older Panasonic BT55P.  I am using the recommended whole-wheat cycle, which takes five hours, and have followed the bread mix instructions exactly.  I've tried using all butter, all oil (canola) and a combination of the two: same result.  I don't think I would buy this flavor again.  Stick to the white and honey wheat: both are fabulous.
