.<br />We were really looking forward to these little chocolate chips!  After all of the praiseful reviews<br />on Amazon, we expected something wonderful.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1.  Tiny-sized chips. Conveniently shaped for baking or snacking.<br />2.  Good expiration date (more than 6 months from now).<br />3.  Manufactured in a dairy-free facility.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1.  Mediocre in texture and taste. They are waxy, in fact. The flavor is pretty one-dimensional.<br />2.  They don't label how much cacao it contains (in % terms.)  For ex., our preference is 71% content.<br />3.  If you've ever had awesome quality, complex dark chocolate, then you might be disappointed when you taste these.<br />.
