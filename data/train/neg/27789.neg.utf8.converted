I have some of R-Evolution's other kits but I wasn't much of fan of this one.  This kit is extremely repetitive and almost identical to the cuisine kit.  The recipes aren't for drinks but rather silly additions to classical cocktails.  One particularly disappointing "recipe" was for salt foam to top a plain margarita. (Incidentally, the margarita didn't have simple syrup... it was just booze and lime topped with salt foam... yuck!)<br /><br />The DVD format is old fashioned, which is silly considering it's "modernist."
