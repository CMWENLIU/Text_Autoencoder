The nuts were very tasty and if you don't mind the artificial sweeteners, they may be for you.  If you are expecting chocolate covered almonds, you'll be disappointed.  They are what they say however; "cocoa roasted".  They have a modest cocoa flavor with a bit of sweetness.<br /><br />The reason I gave them only 2 stars is because they fail to disclose on the front label that they contain not only one but two artificial sweeteners.  This annoys me because 1) artificial sweeteners bother my stomach and 2) many people don't want to eat artificial sweeteners or give them to their kids.  It irks me when manufacturers try to pawn their wares as a "healthy" snack yet omit the fact that they contain artificial sweeteners or ingredients.<br /><br />One used to be able to spot artificial sweeteners easily by "sugar free" or "NutraSweet" clearly printed on the label but for some reason, the FSA allows products to contain sucralose (a.k.a. Splenda) without any clear labeling at all.  You must read the ingredients to learn these nuts contain both sucralose and acesulfame potassium, two artificial sweeteners.  Shame on you Emerald!
