I too have rec the new formula for the True Chews chicken jerky fillets.  It's smells horrible and looks more like jerky than dried/compressed chicken fillets.  I will not buy this product again.  I guess I will have to start buying Smokehouse.  Beware, Smokehouse products may show made in USA (front of pkg) made in China (on back of pkg). There are Smokehouse products that show USA on both front and back. If your looking for USA always check the pkg both front and back.
