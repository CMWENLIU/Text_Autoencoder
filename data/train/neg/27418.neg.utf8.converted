I purchased a three-pack of this seasoning from Amazon, thinking that I could recreate the taste of the commercial bags of white cheddar popcorn I buy at the super market. Unfortunately, this product tastes nothing like the white cheddar seasoning I was looking for. There is very little cheese flavor evident. The taste is more like a seasoned salt (Lawry's or McCormick, for example). I could taste a hint of celery salt and paprika, but not cheddar cheese. So I am stuck with three jars of seasoned salt. Maybe I will try it on a salad. I don't know why they formulated this stuff the way they did, but to me it is not worth the substantial sodium intake.
