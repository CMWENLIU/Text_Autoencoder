The new Instant Oatmeal (Maple Brown Sugar, as well as other flavors)is TERRIBLE!<br />The "new hearty texture" is coarse and scratchy, not very palatable.  The flavors have a bitter edge to them. I kept trying different flavors from different sources - even at Amazon on the Internet - and cannot tell you how disappointed we are. I now have over 100 packets in my cupboard that no one will eat.  I find that they can be used for no-bake cookies so they won't totally go to waste.  This cereal has been a favorite of my family for generations but unless it changes for the better, it will be history in our household.
