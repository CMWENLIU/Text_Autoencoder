The nuts were stale and inedible.  I contacted Diamond Nuts by e-mail and was told that they were sorry but I should contact Amazon.  Since the manufacture doesn't back its product the last thing I needed was to be shipped another dozen packages of stale walnuts.  I highly advise against any Diamond Products.
