I didn't have such luck with this product as the other reviewers--unfortunately I got SEVERE abdominal cramps the few times I tried it. Still, it's worth a try because it works for many people. Just bear in mind that if you get some bad cramping, you are probably sensitive to SENNA, the active ingredient in the tea. So stay away from other SENNA products, too. (usually labeled "Stimulant Laxative.")<br /><br />So what works for me?  Lots of the high-fiber foods every day.  Plenty of raw fruits (except banana) and vegetables (two raw carrots a day works wonders!)  Whole grains every day makes a big difference--I especially like brown rice and oatmeal. Apples are yummy: I eat one every day.  Eating beans and legumes is also very helpful.  Buy some dried lentils--they cook the fastest--and google some soup recipes. And keep products made with white flour to a minimum.<br /><br />In the worst case scenario, try plain old water. Both ways.<br /><br />Nature is great.
