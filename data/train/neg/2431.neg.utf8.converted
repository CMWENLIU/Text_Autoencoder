There may not be much inflation in the economy but there has been in the Amazon customer ratings. I can remember when a "4" from 10 or more people was close to a lock when it comes to product adequacy. This product's cumulative rating should have meant that Eight O'Clock French Roast would at least be drinkable, but it doesn't and it isn't - drinkable that is.  Really folks, those of you who think this is a GOOD French Roast have been drinking too much Taster's Choice Freeze-Dried (which I would accept a cup of before I would take one of this swill.)<br /><br />I never, NEVER throw food or other consumables out unless it tastes rotten. Half way into the first bag of this stuff I threw it and the other 3 bags in the garbage and sighed in relief. I had gotten rid of the worst rotgut bean coffee I had ever encountered. Really.
