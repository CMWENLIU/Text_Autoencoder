This is not Wholesome Sweeteners organic cane sugar, it's just "natural", though Amazon's description beneath says organic. Their website shows their organic cane products in addition to these natural ones. You don't know what chemical pesticides, fertilizers or processing chemicals are used in growth and production.<br /><br />It is "Fair Trade" certified though, from their site:<br /><br />The Fair Trade Certified logo is Wholesome's guarantee that our farmers' cooperatives are paid directly for the cane grown and milled. This means that the farmers can compete with factory farms, cultivate the quality of their crops, send their kids to school and build thriving communities.<br /><br />I did contact Amazon but they told me there was no way to check the bag, so I asked if they had a phone number for the company.
