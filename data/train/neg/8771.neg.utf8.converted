I am stunned that there are so many positive reviews for this product!<br /><br />The photo of this "gift Basket" literally shows all you receive: 3 very small (one layer) bags of dried fruit, pistachios & almonds--a layer LESS than 1/2-3/4 inch thick!  The majority of the box below these 3 teeny bags is filled with paper filler!<br /><br />This gift is at best worth $5, and I am very upset that Amazon would carry such a misleading and ridiculously overpriced product!<br /><br />To top it off, the teeny bag of pistachios I received have suspicious black specks on top of the nuts through whole little bag.  This product WILL be returned, and I believe is defective because of the appearance of the pistachios.<br /><br />My advice: DON'T buy this or other products by this company!  You or the receipient of your gift will be disappointed--and think you are a cheapskate!
