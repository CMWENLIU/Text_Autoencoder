At 230 calories per bar (with 8g of fat - 12% of DV) you may "think Thin" all you want,  it's just not gonna happen.  Perhaps this is something good for diabetics though,  since it's sweetened with sugar alcohols and not real sugar.<br /><br />It definitely has a weird taste as well.  I noticed it right away,  and it lingers in your mouth.  Sadly,  the whole box is going to end up in the garbage.  At least it was an Amazon Lightning Deal so I didn't pay much.
