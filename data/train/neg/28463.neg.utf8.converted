Ka-Me has entirely changed their recipe for the Szechaun sauce.  Our family does not like the new one and so when I saw the original 7.25 oz. sauce advertised, I ordered an entire case!  Much to my chagrin, they sent the new version which no one will eat.  Please, Ka-Me, return to your old ways.  You have a very broken-hearted family who lives all throughout the United States and Canada. We want the original back!!!
