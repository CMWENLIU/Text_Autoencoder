I was really looking forward to trying this product. I thought it was going to be something new and different, but in the end, it was very disappointing. This was a surprise since I really enjoy most of Kraft products.<br /><br />The pack includes: dry macaroni, a seasoning/thickener packet, dry bread crumbs and a soft Velveeta-like cheese product.<br /><br />You provide 1/2 cup 2% milk, 2 TBLS. unsalted butter, and 1/2 shredded cheddar for the optional "oven bake" method.<br /><br />The difference between Kraft Homestyle Macaroni and Kraft Deluxe is all the additional steps: make the white sauce, add the cheese packet, top with shredded cheddar, bread crumbs and bake it off for 10 minutes at 425. I followed the directions, but something was telling me it needed a lot of help (Dijon, a pinch of garlic and cayenne, a little more butter and maybe some Worcestershire)<br /><br />I should have followed my instincts, because the end result was bland and tasteless. Nothing like real home style macaroni and cheese. The best part of these types of dishes is always the crunchy crumb topping, but even that was flavorless and mediocre. The bread crumbs have a stale quality, but my product was far away from the expiration date.<br /><br />Basically, I could have taken the same amount of time made a better product with Kraft 2% sharp cheddar, my own white sauce, seasonings and bread crumbs.<br /><br />I hate to say it, but I really feel this product is pointless. The original Kraft Deluxe is such a good product on it's own, so creamy and delicious and comforting. This is just a strange mix of stove top and baked that doesn't really work.<br /><br />p.s. *Update*<br />Along with 4-cheese, I also got the "Classic Cheddar" flavor and finally made it a few days ago. I decided not to bake this one. Instead, I pan toasted the crumbs adding a little butter and 3 tsp of Parmesan/Romano mix. I made the cheese sauce as directed, but added a tiny drop of Dijon, black pepper and a dash of onion and garlic powders, then mixed it with the cooked macaroni and a sprinkle of sea salt (you may not need it, but I felt it was very bland). I topped one serving with 1/4 of  breadcrumbs and got a better finished product...more flavorful and creamy, but still not all that great of a product.
