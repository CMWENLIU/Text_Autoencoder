Interested in value and quality, why not use a natural Sea Salt. The label says store in container with cover to breath, meaning not airtight. After three month storage time here in Arizona with 25 to 30 % relative humidity indoors, the salt lost so much water content that the volume left was just half of the volume from the beginning.<br />Think about if you want to buy sea water for $ 5.00 a pound.
