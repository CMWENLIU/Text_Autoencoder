Being Greek and loving cooking I bought this ot make some dolmades. Now let me tell you, 90% of a dolma success is about getting good leaves. Best leaves must be young fresh leaves that grom on top of the vine and are cabbage-like green. The leaves growing on lower part of the plant are way hard and useless for cooking. Well this product was 99% these leaves. Even after boiling these for 1 hour they were useless. Do NOT buy.
