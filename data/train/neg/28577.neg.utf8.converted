To start all of the sticks arrived broken, which kind of defeats the purpose of ordering stick candy.  I tasted a couple of the broken pieces and they tasted "off."  Upon closer inspection of the tin and wrapping, I learned that this candy is made in Mexico.  That would explain the "off" kind of glue-like taste.  I don't want ANYTHING made in Mexico because products are not regulated as they are here, and there is always something just left of center where stuff from Mexico is concerned--looks pretty to the eye but is horrible tasting, etc.  I feel that this should have been clearly stated upfront that the candy is Mexican so consumers can be aware.
