When I read a customer review which said that QUICK GRITS were sent when OLD FASHIONED GRITS had been ordered I thought that the probability of such a mistake happening was so very low that it was safe to order the OLD FASHINED GRITS I wanted to cook and count on receiving them.  Well! the probability of making the mistake referred to is not that low!!!  QUICK GRITS is what I also received!  It turned out to be a blessing because I returned the wrong order but have since located OLD FASHIONED GRITS at Wegmans for $1.87/24oz.box as opposed to what amounted to $5.00 for a similar box from Amazon!!!
