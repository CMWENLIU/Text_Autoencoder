Based on the Amazon reviews I purchased 2 of these for my 2 shih tzu's.  They sniffed if for a couple of minutes and then walked away from it.  They love to chew on bully sticks, beef bones, etc but were not excited by this product.  I bought the small 4-6 inch "chasing our tails moose rack snack, 100-percent naturally shed moose antler chew."
