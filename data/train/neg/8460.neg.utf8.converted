What a waste...I bought these Lindt Truffles to put in a goody bag for my annual bash.  I was so excited when it came in as I opened the package I saw grease stains had saturated the plastic wrapped truffle box.  As I opened one of them up I was horrified to see each and every one of the White Chocolate Truffles had melted and leaked all over the box.  I didn't even bother to open the other box because it was in the same leaky state.  I quickly called Amazon to let them know, but when i called I was told that these are non-returnable items and they can't do anything about it.  I guess they have faced this countless amount of times to have made this policy.  So please unless you want a great messy box of melted white grease I would stay away from this item.  I even paid for 2 day shipping...what a rip off.
