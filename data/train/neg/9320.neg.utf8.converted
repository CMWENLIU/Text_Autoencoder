I totally love this Hazlenut coffee and was shocked when I went to reorder the canister 3 pack and found it was no longer available.  These individual packs might be nice to have in my purse when I am out and about, but at approximately 25 cents a serving, they make absolutely no sense to have in my kitchen!  I did find some canisters for sale on a kosher grocery website and just stocked up.  A bit more expensive than what I was paying on Amazon, but still a way better deal than these high priced singles.  I hope Nescafe brings back the canisters or I will be looking for another brand of coffee.  So bummed out!
