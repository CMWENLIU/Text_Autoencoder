I never received the item.  It was in my area for at least 5 days, I had tracked it and talked to the UPS people.  Still, it never got to me.  I called the company it was produced by, they said call UPS and/or fill out complaint to Amazon.  I called UPS numerous times but didn't contact Amazon because I want nothing to do with Pay Pal.
