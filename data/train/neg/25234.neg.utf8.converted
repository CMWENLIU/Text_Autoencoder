I got a can of these from the grocery store after seeing the good reviews here, but whoa-- they are completely burnt tasting! The spices were terrible and everything was strangely dry. I could barely stand the smell as this was cooking and I ended up tossing it; adding a bit of salt and other seasonings did nothing. Very disappointing!
