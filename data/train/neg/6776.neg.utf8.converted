I bought two packs of this roast beef based on reviewer comments. It wasn't packed well and three of the cans are badly dented. I don't know what I am going to do with all of this stuff as it doesn't taste very good. Tastes very CANNED!<br /><br />I don't eat dog food, but that is how this smells. The beef is in fair-sized chunks and is tender.  Maybe I can doctor it up some way--rinse that gravy off and put it spicy Mexican casseroles or tacos. I ate some of one can and gave the rest to my pooch. He seemed to think it was OK.
