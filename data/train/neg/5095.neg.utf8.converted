If candied fruit suits your taste, Phillippine Brand Mangoes are perfect.  However, with 32G of Sugars, it is too sweet for us - practically resembling candied-mangoes, if there is such a thing.  Plus, according to the packaging, these mangoes are NOT organic, and subjectively written, "The Best Tasting Mango in the World."<br /><br />On the upside, this fruit is mostly non-acidic, soft, and very moist. There were no pieces to discard; all were evenly colored and of apparently high quality despite the high sugar content.<br /><br />In comparison, we enjoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IEDUTG">Klein's Naturals Mango, Organic, (Pack of 6)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5QVO">Sunridge Farms Organic Mango Slices, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> which taste like more like natural fruit, instead of candy.<br /><br />However, YOU be the judge since virtually all tastebuds are biased.
