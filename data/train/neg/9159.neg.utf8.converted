I've seen these at my local Petco where I looked over the ingredient list.  Soy or Soy protein is either the first or second ingredient.  Soy is something I avoid in anything I give my cat.  Soy isn't very digestible by cats and is often a common food allergen.  Also soy is also considered bad for your cat's thyroid gland.  In addition soy may also impact the amount of Taurine your cat absorbs; a lack of Taurine can cause blindness in cats.
