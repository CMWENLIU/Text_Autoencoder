These chips used to be amazing: like nothing else on the market.  I could go through a bag a day all by myself.  They were insanely delicious.  The only minor issue was that a certain amount of the spices they used to flavor them would collect at the bottom of the bag.  So, they decided to "improve" them by reformulating (i.e. changing) the spice mixture so that it would adhere better to the chips.  STUPID!!!  Now, instead of tasting like a product in a class by itself, they taste like a second-rate Doritos.  Unless you have a wheat allergy, there's no longer any really compelling reason to buy these chips as they now taste like any other product on the market.  It's really sad.  I rarely write reviews for anything, but I was so disappointed by this, I just had to mention it.  Why do companies always have to ruin a good thing?  I mean, I'm sure I should thank them for the sake of my hips, but my taste buds are still in mourning.
