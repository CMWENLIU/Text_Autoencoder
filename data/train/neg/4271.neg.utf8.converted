I will start with some helpful info..<br /><br />-Nespresso machine: Pixie<br />-Ne-Cap capsules 100 pcs. ($23.29)<br />-Coffee: Lavazza - Crema e Gusto 250g enough for 50 capsules ($5.75)<br />-Empty capsule weight: ~1 gram<br />-Filled capsule weight: ~6 grams<br />-One capsule preparation time: 60-70 secs<br />-Cost of filled capsule: ~$0.35<br /><br />The main reasons for purchasing the refill capsules are, being able to enjoy the coffee I like and save some money.<br /><br />I haven't encountered any troubles with the capsules EXCEPT that you dont get the best out of it, as most of the hot water is spilled into the used capsules container; although I had the capsules filled, pressed and sealed appropirately. Therefore, I had to reuse the same capsule, however, sometimes replaced it with another one. The reason of water spill/waste is that Ne-Cap capsules are shorter than Nespresso capsules. Thus I assume if they were the same size, the capsules will perform much better.<br /><br />This option is somehow economical, nevertheless, sometimes you may need to use two capsules to enjoy your Espresso, or Cappuccino cup.<br /><br />Conclusion, if you are not enjoying the taste of Nespresso flavours or you like to have your own ground coffee, and want to save some $$$, go for it..BUT dont expect the same performance and cleanness of Nespresso capsules.<br /><br />Update 2/8/2012================<br /><br />When I first used the Ne-Caps, I gave it 3 stars. After using almost 30 capsules, I got to believe that it's not worth it and that Nespresso capsules are irreplaceable. I tried all possible ways to enhance the performance of the capsules, I made more holes at the base, also I dilated the existing ones, but all my attempt were useless. The shape of Ne-Cap pods should be modified to look like nespresso ones. That way, I believe they would be better. So my advice is to stick to nespresso despite the price. Save yourself the time and headache and enjoy your easy, tasty coffee.
