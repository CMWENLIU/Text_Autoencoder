I bought this tea box sets for giving the boxes away as little gifts. I already knew that PG Tips makes great tea from past experience. Unfortunately, when the package arrived, I found some of the boxes to be squashed, and the rest had a lot of loose tea on the outside trapped in the wrap, which gave them a dirty look and made them unsuitable for gifting. Also, the tea wasn't very fresh.
