I bought these macarons through Groupon and only spent $24. When they arrived, the cool pack was warm to the touch. The macarons were wrapped in plastic in sets of 12. I was excited to have that fresh macaron taste, but I was sorely disappointed. They lacked the typical moisture and the flavors were a bit bland. Even though I put them in the fridge, they are getting harder and less tasteful by the minute. I guess nothing beats fresh macarons from Paris!
