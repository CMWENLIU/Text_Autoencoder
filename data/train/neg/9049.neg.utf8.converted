Why does JR Specialties attempt to trick young,gullible, aspiring chefs to use this cheap ARTIFICIAL oil?<br />DO your research- truffle oil is not natural JR, so that piece of info should  be included under PRODUCT DESCRIPTION.<br />At least when people pay for the crap you are selling, they should bw aware that it's crap and not some<br />european made high-end truffle oil!
