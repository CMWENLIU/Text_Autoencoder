What was once a great tea has fallen  prey to a worldwide packaged food malady: smaller portions, weaker portions, or artificial ingredient substitutes -- all in the name of cutting costs. In the case of Twining's decaf English Breakfst tea, the amount of tea per bag seems to be shrinking at at alarming rate each year. My latest purchase has turned out to be the weakest tea I've ever had.<br /><br />It's back to loose tea filling a tea`caddy and, hopefully, more flavor.
