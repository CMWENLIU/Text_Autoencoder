I received yesterday my order of one 8oz bottle of that "pur Maple extract". Opened the bottle right away, i knew then it was a VERY weak extract.<br />Put it to the test already, my recipe calls for 1 teasp. extract for the batter, I used 2 TABLESpoons, to no avail, as the cake, now cooled has no maple flavor in its batter TO JUSTIFY THE TITLE OF MAPLE WALNUT CAKE...THOUGH THE WALNUTS i TOASTED GIVE IT A GOOD FLAVOR.<br />The glaze recipe called for one teaspoon extract also, I used a full TABLESPOON, and the glaze is delicious.<br />THIS PRODUCT DELIVERS A VERY FAINT MAPLE FLAVOR, not what you would expect for an extract at that price.<br />Will never purchase this item again, I am going to investigate other brands. SERIOUS BAKERS : skip this brand, UNLESS ALL YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS A WEAK, FAINT MAPLE FLAVOR.
