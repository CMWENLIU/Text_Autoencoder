Why is the Altoid/Wrigley company using deceptive advertising???  Why are you using the old Spearmint Altoids CAN in your advertising and then selling everyone the (NEW) not as flavorful  tasting spearmint altoids???  This should be illegal...wait, it is...it's called Bait & Switch.<br />Spearmint Altoids have been great for years.  But, my recent purchase of two 12 packs have left me severally disapointed in the product..  DON'T PURCHASE spearmint altoids with the yellow banner across the top that says "New Great Taste! Same Punch!".  They have very very little spearmint flavor.<br />They look the same, but taste like the original altoids with just a hint of spearmint flavor.  Why the trickery?
