This drink doesn't taste anything like fruit punch. And I don't know how anyone can call it "light". It is hard to explain the taste but the closest I can come is that it is a heavy cherry taste similar to what you would get if you drank the juice out of canned cherries (only not as tart).<br /><br />No one in my family can stand this stuff.<br /><br />Do I recommend this drink? NO WAY!
