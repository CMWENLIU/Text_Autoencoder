This product does not live up to the slick packaging and promotion of being "real maple syrup. Greatly disappointed in product. Based on product promotion on Amazon, led to believe that this was "real maple" syrup.<br />WRONG!!! Will not buy again. This type of slick packaging dumped onto the buying public is exactly why we as a nation are in the shape we are in to this date.
