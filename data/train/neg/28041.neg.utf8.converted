I was excited to try this because I drink mostly flavored water and I work overnight. I am always in needed of caffeine. I liked the fact that Vitamin Squeeze would help me get in my daily dose of Vitamin's. Unfortunately, Vitamin Squeeze was a huge let down. First of all, it says that you only need one squeeze. I tried what I determined a squeeze to be and my water verily tasted flavored. I added the proper amount (about 5-8 squeezes) to get the coloring of what a fruit punch flavored drink should look like.<br /><br />The Vitamin Squeeze tasted like watered down, but sugary Kool-aid. I actually liked the flavor and continued to drink it. I definitely felt a slight energy increase. It was not enough to make you buzzed, but enough to notice a difference. My biggest problem then came when it was time to take the Vitamin Squeeze home (I first tried it at work). The lid was completely closed and it LEAKED everywhere! On top of that, the red dye in Vitamin Squeeze stained my hand and my desk. I was able to get the stains out, but not happy with the crappy container that this product comes in. I also do not like that fact that IT HAS TO BE REFRIGERATED and you have to shake well before each use. For me, this takes away a lot of the convenience factor. I want something I can take with me places.<br /><br />PROS:<br />*Makes water taste better<br />*You get a larger container for your money<br />*Contains Vitamins and Electrolytes<br />*Sugar, Carb and Calorie free<br /><br />CONS:<br />*You have to add more than you do with similar drinks<br />*It has to be Refrigerated<br />*You have to shake well before using<br />*Has a slight after-taste<br />*You have to limit intake due to Vitamins (too much is bad for you too) and caffeine<br />*The bottle is not secure<br />*It stains<br /><br />Overall, this product has more Cons than Pros. I will not be purchasing any Vitamin Squeeze and I recommend you try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VOOQKA">MIO Black Cherry, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> instead.
