I like apricots... so I don't know if it was the fact that the apricots were liquefied into this apple sauce mix, or something else, but these cups had a nasty aftertaste to them, kind of like dirt.<br /><br />I definitely won't be buying this flavor again, but other LeRoux Creek flavors such as cinnamon apple are very good.
