With all the positive reviews I really was looking forward to trying this but was sadly disappointed when I received my shipment and tried 2 of the flavors.  So far I've had the orange and the cola...not enjoyable at all.  I had realistic expectations and did not expect it to taste like the "regular" sugar or even "diet" versions that are popular.  But, I had hoped they would at least be good.  My teens and I dislike the taste completely.  There is also a very bitter aftertaste that lingers for a long time.  Ugh.  I'm going to stick to my carbonated water with a slice of lemon from now on. **Have tried all the flavors and still do not like this product.  I have had other products with Stevia that are acceptable, the aftertaste on this one is horrible.
