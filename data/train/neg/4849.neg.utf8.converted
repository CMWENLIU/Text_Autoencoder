While the taste of these cookies is spot on and worth the price, the structure of these cookies does not serve them well for travel.  Each of the four boxes of my cookies were in pieces.  Not even one cookie was whole out of the four packages.  Buyer beware if you are planning to give any of the boxes as gifts, which I had planned on doing.
