I bought this product towards the end of 2010. I have no problem with the actual chia seed itself, it is no different than other chia I have bought on Amazon - I have tried out a few different brands.<br />But what irks me is that the product description claims that it is organic. Once I received the product I scrutinized the product packaging and ingredients carefully and nowhere does it say it is organic. I paid a price premium for this brand over other cheaper ones available on Amazon simply because it claimed to be organic on this website. That was deceptive.<br />I will not buy this product again. I can find other sellers, both organic and non-organic, who have accurate product descriptions.  I realize that the Amazon disclaimer says not to trust the descriptions and to check with the manufacturer. The problem is that (like in my case) I cannot do it till I buy the product. I did use up the full bag because, like I said, there is nothing wrong with the Chia. They just are not selling what they claim that is all.
