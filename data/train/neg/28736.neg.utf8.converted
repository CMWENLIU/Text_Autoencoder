I loved the original large cake so much I ordered this smaller one, thinking it<br />would be easier on the waist line.  Unfortunately, it proved to be quite dry,<br />while the 33 oz. size was delightfully moist.  I can only wonder it all the 16 oz,<br />cakes are dry, or if this was an exception.<br /><br />  Virginia Leblanc
