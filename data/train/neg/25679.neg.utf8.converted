I am very disappointed with this gum. I used in for a long time and noticed that the formula had changed a few months ago. I called the company and was told that the gum base was changed. That was a big mistake to me because it doesn't last very long and within about 10 min. or less it becomes very rubbery. I am now trying a different Zylitol gum hoping for better alternative.
