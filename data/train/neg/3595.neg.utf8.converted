I recently bought RiceSelect's whole wheat orzo and I decided to order some RiceSelect royal blend at the same time. The orzo is pretty good, but the rice, oh, the rice, what a terrible disappointment. I was surprised to see that the directions call for such a short cooking time, and sure enough, it did cook that fast. That might sound like a good thing, but the rice came out quite mushy. Looking more closely at the uncooked product, it sure looks to me like it has been processed in some way prior to packaging (maybe it has been parboiled then dried?). In any case, I'm so disappointed by this rice I'm going to give it away to a food bank and just go back to buying rice at my local health food store.<br /><br />If I'm right about the processing of this rice, it should be noted in the product info, and it isn't. If I had bought this locally I would be returning the 3 unopened jars, but it just seems like too much hassle to worry about and I'm sure the food bank will be happy to have it.<br /><br />I have bought literally hundreds of items from Amazon, and this is the first one I've felt compelled to comment on. I absolutely love Amazon, but this product is a total bust.
