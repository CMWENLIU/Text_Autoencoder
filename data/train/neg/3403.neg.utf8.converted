I was sincerely looking forward to enjoying this product and reviewing it, however, it's hard to sing the praises of anything when the roof of your mouth is on fire.<br /><br />Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews is a good idea gone terribly wrong. The nuts are wonderful. I plan on soaking off the seasoning and using them in a chicken recipe. But there is no possability I could eat them as the manufacturer has served them up.<br /><br />To be sure that this was not some oversensitivity on my part, I offered the cannister to a friend -- casually and without comment. He ate two or three and begged me for a beverage to clear his mouth, saying he thought he must be "allergic" to something in them, because they "made his mouth burn."<br /><br />I'm just baffled that the seasoning is this unpleasantly strong yet sold in a cannister that suggests a mild freshness. I truly regret that I could not give Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews a higher rating.
