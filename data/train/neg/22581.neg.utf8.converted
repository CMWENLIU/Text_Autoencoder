My family is very sensitive to everything.  Lots of allergies, overly sensitive to prescriptions, etc.  So, we regularly cut the dose in half of most things we use as a precaution.  In fact when I drink juice, I dilute it 60-75% with water - just becuase the flavors are so strong to me.<br /><br />So, I purchased these and planned to split these into smaller servings.  I was going to use my empty gel caps which I keep at home to be able to split them.  But, they do not use standard size gel caps!!<br /><br />I have always been able to use standard O,1,2 or 3 size capsules which I get from my local pharmacy.  But these Dehydrated Water Capsules must be imported, since they do not fit any of the standards US sizes.<br /><br />I am afraid to use the entire capsule all at once due to my very sensitive nature, so I can't really comment on its strength or it's flavor.  But if you are interested in splitting the serving size down I recommend you find an American source for these - as these can not be split.  jk  :-)
