I tried these after reading about their health benefits and the positive reviews written by other customers.  The smell is pretty bad but I could get past that; it's the fact that it would be easier to eat rubber that got to me.  I tried one bite and spit it out.  My husband tried it and it took him forever to chew up one bite, we threw the rest in the trash.  Sounds good when you read about it, and I have a pretty tough stomach, but even this was just too much for me.  Don't waste your money.
