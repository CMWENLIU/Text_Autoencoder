Hmm Where to start? I usually mess with every meal I get that comes in a box and as my wife would say. I eat everything. I cooked this exactly as the directions suggested. As soon as I saw the broccoli powder junk I was like oh know but figured I would precede. I cooked the chicken in cubes and put salt and pepper and a lil cayenne to add a lil heat. When I was finished it was a yellow mess. I took about a bite out and brought it to my wife. She took a small bite and gave me the look as if she was gonna spit it out onto the plate. So I made her something else. I decided that I would just eat it because I dont like things going to waste. I added a lil milk because it was very dry and more salt and pepper because of it being very bland and flat tasting. I got about half way through what I put on my plate and could not do it. This just tasted horrible period. I would not recommend this to a dog let alone a human being unless they were starving and still I would feel bad for giving it to them. The idea itself sounds yummy but did not do it for us at all.
