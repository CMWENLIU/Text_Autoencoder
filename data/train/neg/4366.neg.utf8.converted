Save your money.<br />Go buy yellow or white popcorn from your local grocery store (under a $1.00 a lb.).<br />They are charging $4.80 a pound here.<br />I found two of the three verities they are selling here are no more than yellow and white popcorn which cost less than $1.00 a lb. at your local grocery store.<br />Their third verity here the 'Purple' has no significant different taste or flavor than yellow or white popcorn.<br />Popcorn is popcorn after being popped.<br />Also save your money on their caramel topping. You are just buying brown sugar.<br />They are charging ($11.58) for a 10 oz. jar of what amounts to brown sugar.<br />A 2 lb. bag of brown sugar is around $2.00 at your local grocery store.<br />By the way brown sugar a very good popcorn topping in my opinion.  As good as I have found.<br />So there you are.<br />My opinion for what it's worth.
