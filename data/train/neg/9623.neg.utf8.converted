Mine just arrived a couple of days ago, so plants haven't grown yet.  However, just wanted to share how important it is to have the right place for the thing.  The lights are VERY bright, and you'd need to have a huge kitchen counter to place it on.  It is bigger than I expected, and kind of intrusive.  If I had seen it in person, I would not have bought it.  Measure your space carefully before buying, and consider having very bright light almost all the time!
