I'm sorry, but these are horrible!  They taste burnt!  They are so bitter that neither my husband or I were able to eat them.  I tried them three different times because I didn't want to give up so easily, but they really are just awful.  It's not just a 'deep' flavor, they truly do taste burnt.  Won't buy again.
