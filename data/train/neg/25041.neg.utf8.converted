Don't waste your money on this product if you are looking for decent coffee flavor in an instant coffee...buy Starbucks instead. I used 2 packets in 8 oz. of water, double the amount called for, and still had a beverage that tasted nothing like coffee...more of a nutty flavor. I gave the remaining coffee to a 90 yr. old pal of mine who must drink half-strength coffee...perfect for her
