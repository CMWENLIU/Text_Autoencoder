After taking this 3 different times I noticed that the following day I am extremely bloated to the point that it hurts to walk! Stomach would hurt, frequent bowel movements. Through friends also heard that this product bloated them and they stopped taking it. Only good thing I can say is that it suppressed my appetite for a few days. Don't know if it's something i want to experience for a whole 24 hrs (bloating) just to suppress appetite. Read the label about this product containing Senna as one of the ingredients.
