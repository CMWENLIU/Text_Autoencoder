I try not to right a negative review, but drinking this has got to be the worst experience I ever had with any drink. I took one sip of it and it had me gagging. I had to get a bottle of minute maid lemonade just to wash the taste away, and even after that, my mouth was still completely dry and still had the horrid aftertaste. I would not give this to my worst enemy.
