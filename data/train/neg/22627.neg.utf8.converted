I tried this out in several situations, while I was on my feet and while I was sitting at the computer. I tried one piece. I tried three pieces at once. Nothing. I never felt in any way, shape, or form, energized. It just didn't happen.<br /><br />The flavor is nice, not too sweet or syrupy. They'd probably make a nice throat clearer when you didn't need a full on cough drop, but as to energy... it just wasn't there. I'm completely underwhelmed.
