For years this was my go-to bar providing quality, character, value, availability.  Don't misunderstand, I'm not suggesting that it was ever something more than it was but the bottom line is that whether you are a chocolate snob or a casual chocolate lover, you knew that this was simply excellent chocolate for the price.  Nearly boutique chocolate level flavor that you could pick up for half the price.<br /><br />But to my shock the new recipe is simply garbage. Mundane, flat, lacking any punch. What the !@#% was Lindt thinking?  I, along with many others, will have to seek a new replacement for a serviceable bar that the Lindt 70% so faithfully provided for years.  Lindt, shame on you.  You lost a good percentage of your loyal base...and all for what? Sadly nothing, because its not as if this new formula will appeal to a 'broader audience'--it will not.
