I feel kind of foolish that I've been buying this Nori from Amazon for a while now.  To be fair, the Edozen Nori brand does taste great and is easy to work with when making sushi rolls.  However, I thought $4.99 wasn't bad for a pack of 10 . . . until I discovered this exact same brand, same package for sale at my local Kroger grocery store for $1.99.  Yep, I've been paying 2 1/2 times too much for something that was readily available at a grocery store chain.  I would check out your local grocery store before buying this product from Amazon and you may get a much better deal.
