Gatorade made from the powder mix doesn't taste syrupy like store-bought Gatorade does.  It's also much less expensive to mix your own -- think about it, why would you pay for a bottle of water + flavor syrup?  HOWEVER, the prices for this product on Amazon and eBay are very inflated.  I found it at my local grocery store (HEB) for about $7, which was on sale from about $8.  The online prices are ridiculous.
