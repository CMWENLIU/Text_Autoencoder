My dog likes this food but shortly after I started feeding it I noticed she was drinking way more water than usual.  At first I didn't make the connection to the food.  She's 11 years old so I wondered if she was developing diabetes.  She also started having accidents in the house, which she had not done since puppyhood, so maybe a bladder infection?  I took her to the vet.  He checked her urine and said there was no infection but the ph was high.  He suggested changing her diet.  As soon as I did that my dog resumed her normal water consumption and stopped peeing in the house.  This food must have a lot of salt or something.  I would not recommend it.
