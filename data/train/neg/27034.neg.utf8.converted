100% of the soy used in Kashi products is Genetically Modified, and when the USDA tested the grains used there were found to be pesticides that are known carcinogens and hormone disruptors. It's true, most Kashi and Kellogg's products are contaminated with GMOs. If you write Kellogg's to complain, they will try to tell you how great GMOs are. We know better! Tell Kellogg's you're boycotting Kashi until they stop using Monsanto's GMOs.
