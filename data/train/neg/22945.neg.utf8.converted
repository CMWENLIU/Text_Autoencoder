I purchased thinking it would be fine since most drink mixes don't have ingredience that are on the top 10 list but this drink mix does contain soy lecithin which half of my family cannot have.  If only the product description contained ingredient information then I wouldn't be stuck with so many containers of drink mix that I cannot use.
