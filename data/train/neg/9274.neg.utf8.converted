I purchased these mushrooms after taking cordyceps for about a year.  Previously, I was supplied by my father who always ordered them online from Mushroom Harvest.  I figured that this price was better so I decided to buy my own.  I should also state that I take them for 2 specific reasons.... 1. They eliminate my allergies and 2.  They significantly  help my endurance.  I gave half of the NEW cordyceps to my father and kept the other half for myself.  At first, I thought that perhaps it was me because I did not feel any effects at all.  I took them exactly as I had in the past for 2 weeks and sadly, my allergies resurfaced which prompted me to be extremely tired.  I had some of my OLD Mushroom Harvest cordycep supply from my dad so I took a teaspoon.  Within that day, my allergies cleared which indirectly effected my energy level.  I was back to running/gym and my regular work routine at my usual pace.  I did not want to believe that these mushrooms were not potent so I would still take the NEW ones periodically for a week at a time.  At one point, I even tried increasing the dosage..... but still rendered the same disappointing results.<br /><br />  Months later, I mentioned the differences in mushrooms to my father.  He said that he noticed the same effects or lack there of but did not tell me to avoid offending me since I bought/gave them to him. :(  He had already ordered himself more cordyceps from Mushroom Harvest.  I had to do the same thing which bothered me because somehow no matter how old I get, he is always RIGHT!!!!!!!<br /><br />  I really wanted these cordyceps to be effective and am sadly disappointed that they were kind of a waste............ On a positive note, the Kismet Kreations Cordyceps came in a timely fashion and had a nice hand written thank you on the invoice!!!! :)<br /><br />P.S. No, I am definitely not an endorser for Mushroom Harvest.... If anyone can tell me where to get equally potent but less expensive Cordyceps, please let me know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
