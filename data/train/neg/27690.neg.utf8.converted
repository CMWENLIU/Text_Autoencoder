I have been ordering these Merrick flossies for years now, they're made in the USA, not China, and keep my dog occupied for almost 30 min. So the price is usually worth it- nothing else keeps my dog occupied that long. BUT I was highly disappointed by this last shipment that I ordered last week. They are not only shorter, but much, MUCH thinner. My dog goes through one in half the time now. Also, each one of the 50 flossies are individually wrapped, super inconvenient having to open each and every one every time, not to mention the waste of plastic... Not sure what is going on with the Merrick brand. Otherwise, amazon is great in ordering & shipping.
