I have been using Xylitol for a year now. I am not Diabetic nor am I overweight. I just simply don't like to consume all that sugar. What makes this product bad is not the Xylitol, Its the Stevia component. The Stevia completely hijacks the sweetener to the point you can't taste anything else, not even your coffee.<br /><br />So it comes down to this, If you enjoy Stevia then buy this product. If you have never tried Stevia and your looking for Xylitol then look somewere else. Or atleast go to your local natural foods store and test run Stevia.<br /><br />I on the other hand have three boxes of this that I can't seem to move as quickly.
