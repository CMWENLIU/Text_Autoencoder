We were thouroughly disappointed with this product. The coffee smelled okay initially when we opened it (not quite what I remembered from Seattle's Best) but was tasted burnt and left a horrible aftertaste. We initially thought it was our coffee maker, then cleaned it...still same result. Tried it in my French press same result...HORRIBLE. Unfortunately we bought 3 bags of this garbage and I will end up throwing 2.5 bags out. Please DO NOT BUY this product. I never leave negative comments on Amazon but this had to brought to everyone's attention. This had to be fake Seattle's best....Folgers would have been a better alternative!
