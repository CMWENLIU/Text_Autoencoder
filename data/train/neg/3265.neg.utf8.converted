The door comes with the MS-2 ultrasonic collar.  After several months of use the top popped off the MS-2 ultrasonic collar and the battery fell out.  My dog was trapped outside all day in the Florida heat.  I'm lucky she didn't die from heat stroke.<br /><br />I called customer service. They told me that my dog had removed the lid!!  I explained that my dog was unable to remove the cap/lid.  The lady in customer service said to me "Are you saying the lid jumped off".<br /><br />Perfect.  I have to hear that when my dog is panting and drinking water like crazy due to a flaw in their product.
