If you love food that leaves your mouth burning long after a Mexican meal, and if you adore the taste of ginger, you'll love this beverage. Over-poweringly- piquant and heavily overwhelmed with the taste of ginger, this hot drink would really warm you up on that cold winter night. I am mad about ginger, and I crave spicy foods that burn my mouth for hours, so I enjoyed this beverage, once. All this said, I didn't love it, and I won't buy it. The ginger is overpowering, even for me, almost completely masking the light lemon and honey taste.<br /><br />If you are craving a rich, sweet drink to warm you up, this is not it. If you don't enjoy mouth-burning delicacies, this is not for you! However, ginger is very therapeutic for certain health conditions, so this may be a more appropriate use for this product.
