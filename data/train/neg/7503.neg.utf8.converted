Don't get me wrong- I like peanut butter. I like peanuts. I like granola too, but nowadays you have to read the labels to see if what you are getting is really healthy or not.  Many folks think that if the word "granola" is on something, it must be healthy for you.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I compared the nutritional label on these Big Nut Bars, to that on a Reese's Peanut Butter cup:<br /><br />Big Nut Bars:<br /><br />Calories = 220<br />Fat Calories = 110<br />Carbs  = 22g<br />Sugars = 12g<br />Protein = 7g<br /><br />Peanut Butter Cups<br /><br />Calories = 230<br />fat calories = 120<br />Carbs = 23g<br />Sugars = 20g<br />Protein = 4g<br /><br />So you will get more protein from a Big Nut Bar, and there is less sugar in it than a Reese's Peanut Butter cup, but I wouldn't go so far as to say either is healthy!<br /><br />Health issues aside, this bar is a conglomeration of peanut butter, peanuts granola, and what tastes like Rice Crispies. Not sure.<br />It is messy to try and eat (you'll get peanut butter all over your fingers, etc.) but if you like those ingredients, you'll like the taste of this bar.  The picture on the front of the box matches the look of the actual bars really well.<br /><br />Pretty straight forward, but not going to win any health awards.
