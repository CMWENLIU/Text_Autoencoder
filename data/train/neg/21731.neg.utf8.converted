I purchased this product on the off chance that zero reviews but first page listing on the "bestselling" decaf whole bean page meant that it was decent coffee.  I was wrong.<br /><br />First, the bag looked like it had been on a shelf for several years.  The plastic was severely scuffed and the label was very worn, as if it had been shifted around in a bin for a very long amount of time.  There was no roasting date or expiration date, so it's impossible to ascertain how old the beans really are.  Isn't that illegal these days?<br /><br />Secondly, the beans have almost no smell and are not even slightly oily.  Compared to a really good bean, such as the Java Trading Company's Espresso Jet City, these are an utter failure.  Even when finely ground, these Organic Camano Island Peru Decaf. have almost no aroma, and what little they do have is not appealing.  It literally smells like caked dirt, not like coffee should smell.  Sure, it's dark roasted, but even the inside of the bag is suspiciously missing even a hint of the oils prevalent on top quality beans.<br /><br />Lastly, when brewed in either a pump espresso maker, a French press, or a drip coffee machine, the brew's complete lack of crema, body, or aroma is the final nail in the coffin.  Starbucks is better than this stuff.  This Camano Islands Peru Decaf isn't just slightly bad; it isn't even worthy of being placed in a Folger's can.<br /><br />Please look elsewhere for a good decaf organic bean, and don't make the same mistake I did.
