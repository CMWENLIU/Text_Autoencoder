These roasted nuts are processed with Peanut Oil (which should be in the Title of the product) and I am not sure why they use the peanut oil, but after I had sampled a few nuts, I noticed a poor after taste.<br /><br />I have eaten Pistachios most of my life and nothing has ever stopped me from eating them until now.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product.
