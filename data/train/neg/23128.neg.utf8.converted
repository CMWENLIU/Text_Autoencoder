Several cans in my shipment had small dents that did not affect the quality of the product. However I had to call the company as directed on the side of the can to let them know that I threw out four (4) cans of the shipment that had rotted (the smell was horrible).  Despite advertisement of 100% satisfaction guaranteed, no one has responded to my calls in three days.  I have five cats and buy a lot of the product, well I used to buy a lot.  I'm going back to Evo and/or other quality brands that stand behind their products.
