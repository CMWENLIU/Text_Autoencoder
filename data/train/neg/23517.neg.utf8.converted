Maybe my bag was somehow bad, but this tastes like cinnamon and nothing else.  Very heavy on the spice, so much so that there is no mention of the tea in the brewed result.  Simply way overwhelming.  I have to assume this was a mistake because brewing it reminded me of the spice packs one might boil to create aroma in the house over the holidays.  In fact that is my plan for the remainder, to take it to my mother's on Thanksgiving for her to use in scenting her home.<br /><br />Hail Flavius!
