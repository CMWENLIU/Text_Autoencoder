Other than a bit of natural fruit flavor, there is nothing natural about this "water enhancer". Just one drop turned a glass of clear water into a bright orange glass of something that looked suspiciously like Kool Aid. I added a few more drops to try to get some flavor, which didn't really work either. With no electrolytes or yummy flavor, plus lots of chemical colors and sweeteners, I don't understand the point. Yuck!
