I bought this to try and shortcut a lobster stew recipe.  It was horrible.  It is so salty all you can taste is salt - like the tinny salt taste in canned soup.  I read the reviews about the sodium content, but figured I would compensate with the other ingredients in the recipe.  I put no other salt in the stew, and still all I could taste was salt - but more importantly, no lobster flavor whatsoever.  It was worth a shot, I guess, but I will throw the rest out.
