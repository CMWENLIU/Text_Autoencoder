This is one big disappointment to me:(<br /> I thought I was getting a bargain- but I guess you get what you pay for.<br />These sticks look dirty, and some are so oddly shaped that they are unusable - and they have no fragrance either.<br /> I like to put a cinnamon stick in my coffee maker each day...and I am not even certain these are cinnamon sticks.<br />Don't make the same mistake I did - don't bother ordering these!  :(  :(
