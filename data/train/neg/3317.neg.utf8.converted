1. I am purposely writing this review blind of the other reviews.  If I am the only 1 star then consider I must have got a bad can.  That or &lt;1% of the population has a gene incompatible with this recipe :-)<br /><br />2. Is "worst thing" hyperbolic.. maybe.  I remember when I was five I tried tasting some strawberry air freshener, that was pretty bad.  Among intended foodstuffs, this does indeed rank up there with worst<br /><br />3. The ingredients are coffee, sugar, and preservative, so I am not sure how it has gone wrong.  For one thing it tastes slightly carbonated/citric... likely the preservative.  And the sweetness is just way off.  Too high and totally unbalanced with the coffee.  The coffee has a weird mouth-feel.  Ever accidentally sipped form a cup of coffee on your desk only to realize it was from 3 days ago?  Sort of like that.<br /><br />If it helpful to know, I am a coffee drinker.  My general drinks of choice are double-short-americano or triple-tall-cappucino
