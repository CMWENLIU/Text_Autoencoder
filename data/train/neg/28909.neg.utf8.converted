I purchased this product solely off the description from its website.  It stated that, "It's so delicious many of our customers report they love to eat it off the spoon!" When I read that, I thought," great! Im sold." I recieved this product and mixed 4 teaspoons with some skim milk and drank it.  I damn near threw up, it took me 30 min. to choke it down.  I then even tried mixing 4 teaspoons with 2 bananas, 10 strawberries, and a quart of strawberry yogurt and it was still undrinkable. I threw it away cause I did not want to spend $20 dollars on other stuff just to make 4 teaspoons taste better. Dont buy this stuff.<br /><br />[...]
