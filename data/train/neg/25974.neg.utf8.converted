I love flavored tea, especially tea mixed with fruit flavors. The mixes that I like in this particular Lipton Pyramid Teabag series, include Bavarian Wild Berries, White with Blue Pomergranate, and Island Favor with Peach and Mango. I bought the Harvest Strawberry & Passion Fruit yesterday, and tried one cup today. I must say that this particular mix has to be the weakest one in this series, because the basic red tea is weak, and you don't taste the Strawberry nor the Passion Fruit favor. The two ingredients that stand out, believe it or not, are the hisbicus flowers and lemon grass.
