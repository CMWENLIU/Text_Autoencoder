I am a popcorn fanatic. I love most any popcorn I've ever tasted. I bought a box of this from a local discount store, and it was the first popcorn I've ever thrown in the trash. I would never recommend it to anyone, nor would I purchase it again. I love other flavors of the Jolly Time Healthy Pop, but this one is awful.
