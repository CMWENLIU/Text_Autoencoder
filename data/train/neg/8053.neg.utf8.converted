This is a waste of money if you are looking for the french vanilla flavor it just doesn't have any.  I ended up giving away 5 of the 6 cans.  The mocha by Folger's is excellent and you can taste the chocolate.  I thought the french vanilla would be the same but it was just a sweet coffee.  I purchased the Victorian Inn brand and from the reviews this has a good vanilla taste; I hope so because I was trully disappointed in this Folger's French Vanilla.
