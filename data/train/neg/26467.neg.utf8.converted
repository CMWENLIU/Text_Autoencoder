My wife and I enjoy some jelly occasionally but never eat a whole jar before it spoils. This individually packed jelly looked like a great solution but when it arrived the use-by date was just a little over a month away. There is no way we'll eat that much jelly in a month. The jelly tastes good enough but the short shelf life made it a bad purchase for us. Most of it will end up being thrown away just like the jars we used to buy. Who knew jelly only lasted a month?
