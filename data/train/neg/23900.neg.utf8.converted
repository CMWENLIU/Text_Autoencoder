I bought 4 cases of this because I HEART Housewives/NJ!!  Now I am going to start by saying that black is not my favorite color AT ALL, but I will try anything that is like..you know...healthy organic.  I'm really healthy like that ;  So I invited some of my best girlfriends over for a tasting party and OMG things got CRAY!  I have to add that my boyfriend and I got into a huge fight earlier that day about him not wanting me to wear these really cute shorts that I found on sale at TJ Max that were like short but not THAT short, and I had this really cute top that I wanted to wear with them but he was like "you look super slutty in those shorts" and I was all like "Whatever Ramondo, you wear like those cholo shirts out every day and I don't say anything about that!"  Anyways, point being I was ready to try something new!  So the water arrived and all my girlfriends and I each took a bottle.  My first reaction was..."I don't think i can put something THIS black in my mouth"  But I had spent 55$ a case on this so I just sucked it down (that will show Ramondo LOLOLOLZZZZ....)<br /><br />It sorta tasted like I expected...like dirt water...but like not bad dirt water..like dirt water you drank when you went with your uncle to the river when you were six to go swimming with him and then you would jump in and accidentally drink a little river water.<br /><br />So overall i was pretty please with it but I was really upset about the TJ Max shorts and Ramondo so 2.5 stars<br /><br />XOXOXOXOXOXO-
