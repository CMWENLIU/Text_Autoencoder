We bought this chocolate last year when they had the big sale on it here on Amazon. It was just great. Scharffenberger milk chocolate has a deep rich flavor with a great snap and the texture is very smooth.<br /><br />This latest batch of "Scharffenberger Milk Chocolate" is obviously Hersheys attempt to make it more profitable by removing any value from it. It is lighter in color with a slightly chalky and waxy texture, it is barely creamy and the texture and flavor are not remotely as good as the actual Scharffenberger used to be.<br /><br />It is much more a third rate Swiss style chocolate and completely lacks the straight forward high quality chocolate flavor that real Scharffenberger had. And if you want Swiss style chocolate you are much better off buying Lindt or Tobler than this over priced and very poor imitation.<br /><br />This is not nearly as good as the original bar. It seemed obvious that Hershey's would eventually abandon Scharffenbergers high standards, quality beans and traditional methods and simply try to maximize profits. This "chocolate" proves that beyond any doubt.<br /><br />In the end, it seems they probably only bought the company to eliminate it from being competition.<br /><br />They are certainly destroying any remaining brand loyalty now.
