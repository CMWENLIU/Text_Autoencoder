In my very unscientific personal research in my home, I had this experience:<br />After reading pros and cons of both ProPest and Safer Brands for clothes moth capture, I wasn't sure which one would work best, so:  I ordered both, and put one of each in all of the rooms where I suspected moths.<br />Day 1:  Pro-Pest had a moth in each trap; Safer had none<br />Day 2:  Pro-Pest 10 v. Safer had 1<br />We are now on Day 14, and some of the Safer traps still have zero moths, while the ProPest continues to capture them.  I tried switching them around, and to see if somehow positioning gave an edge, and nope:  the Pro-Pest gets them where the Safer Brand does not.  I'm a believer and about to order more packs of the Pro-Pest!
