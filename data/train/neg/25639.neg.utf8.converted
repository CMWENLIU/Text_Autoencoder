I wanted to like this since it's only 45 calories per 2 tablespoons, but it's simply lacking the peanuty flavor I expect from peanut butter.  Sad.  I'm going back to eating regular peanut butter in moderation (ie 1 tablespoon in my oatmeal in the mornings and that's all).  Not sure what I'm going to do with these jars of PB2, maybe give to my brother in law to mix in his whey protein shakes.
