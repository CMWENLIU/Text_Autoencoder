Compare the ingredients.. This stuff is no better for you than the original Skippy. They both have the same ingredients (check for yourself) except the one thing they changed was replacing that nasty partially hydrogenated oil with palm oil which is no better for you and will still clog your arteries. If you're truly looking for a natural peanut butter look for one without any oils added to it period. I myself really like Smuckers Natural Peanut Butter with Honey. It tastes great. Stirring it can be a pain but it is so worth it if it's better for our health.
