Unfortunately, this product contains milk. There was no description (except vegetarian), i.e., no ingredients listed. The local version of this product does not contain milk, although it looks exactly the same. I cannot eat the chocolate with milk, and hence am out $40. Nutricity refused any sort of refund or credit and just gave a corporate boilerplate get-lost type response. Also, they refused to change the description of the product for future buyers to indicate the ingredients. If you don't mind milk in your dark chocolate, you might like this product, but I'd advise against buying anything from Nutricity.
