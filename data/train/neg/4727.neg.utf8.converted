My most recent sardine order was for 3 types of sardine.<br /><br />This type came in third place.<br /><br />It may be because they are "wood smoked" that they seem dry and stiff.  There are more flavorful sardines.  I won't get these again.<br /><br />Sardines include skin and bones (This was what I wanted.)
