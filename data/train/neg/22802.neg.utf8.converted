I've struggled to get a good cup of coffee out of these.  They clog, they break, they generally make the process of making a cup of coffee arduous.<br /><br />I've been using melitta coffee filters until I bought a box of these filters, and never had a problem with them.  I will go back to Melitta and might not even finish using one box of these.
