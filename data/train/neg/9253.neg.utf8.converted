This food has EXTREMELY high levels of protein. Not all dogs need a high protein diet, and in fact for some it can be quite dangerous. While my dog was on Orijen, my vet discovered that he had elevated liver enzymes. Many dog food health websites advocate high protein foods, but these can be very dangerous. Dogs that don't have a lot of energy and/or have little body fat (like sighthounds) do not need this much protein, and processing it can be very bad for their livers. This is a high quality food, I love that it is made by a small company in Canada, and many people have had great success with it. But know that it is NOT for every dog! Please be careful and keep in mind that more protein is not always better if you are considering this food!
