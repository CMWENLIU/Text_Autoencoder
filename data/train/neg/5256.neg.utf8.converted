I had such high hopes for these. I really wanted an easy quick and healthy meal for my toddler on those days we spend too long at the park and needed a really quick lunch before nap time. I thought I'd throw some cut up soy hot dogs in with these and it would be like 'healthy franks and beans.' Not so much. The taste was just awful. I wound up using them up in chili to hide the flavor. I was so sad because these were the only Eden Organic canned items at my Whole Foods. Glad I found a wider variety on Amazon, but I will be sure this time to have a recipe planned for them rather than eating them plain!
