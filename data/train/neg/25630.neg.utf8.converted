It was not sweet. Small amounts or large amounts, stirred or shaken or blended, this aspartame imparted virtually no sweetness whatsoever to the many drinks I tried it in.  Aspartame is very sensitive to heat, so sellers must be cautious about storage, packaging, and shipping, or aspartame _will_ lose its sweetness.  Seller first told me to return it for a refund, then a few hours later reversed themselves, forcing me to use Amazon's A-Z Warranty, which unfairly places price pressure on Amazon products across the board. The quality of a merchant is determined by how they act when problems arise, and on that basis, I will never do business with HerbStoreUSA again, including this so-called aspartame.
