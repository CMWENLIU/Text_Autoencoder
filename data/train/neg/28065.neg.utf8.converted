This is not almond flour, obviously it says blend. But read the ingredients on the bag - it contains A LOT of flours that aren't good for you. Find real almond flour that is ONLY almond. Much better for you. I wish I could return this and didn't order it at all.  I don't even think they can legally call it almond since it barely contains almond at all. Its mostly RICE. Enjoy your RICE blend.
