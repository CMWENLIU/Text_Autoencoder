I always loved Potato Buds, I would make them at college all the time and they were even slightly (SLIGHTLY) comparable to homemade!<br /><br />I'm making Shephards Pie and usually use fresh ingredients but it's raining and I don't want to peel and cook and mash potatoes.  I bought a box of Buds hoping to launch my Pie into deliciousness, but WHAT DID I JUST TASTE???  Prepared they are horrible - crumbly, salty and dry.  They can be doctored...but there are instructions on the box for a reason, right?<br /><br />The uncooked product looks like flaky baby cereal.<br /><br />If you are starving, why not - the price isn't so bad and I bet you could add more liquid, more butter, WAY LESS SALT, and fix them up.  But if I remember correctly, these babies used to be delicious as is.  Feeling like Betty dropped the ball.
