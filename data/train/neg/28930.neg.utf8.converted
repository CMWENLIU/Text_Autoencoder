My Husband & I stayed at a Inn in Branson,Mo this summer & they served waffles at breakfast using this mix! They were delicious & I vowed to purchase a waffle iron of my own just so I could whip these up at home! We got a waffle iron before I ordered this mix though & bought Krusteaz waffle mix from our local Wal-mart in the mean time to test out the waffle maker. Krusteaz mix is easy (need eggs & oil) & doesnt require melted butter like Carbons Golden Malted & tastes awesome, much like what we had at the Inn in Branson! Yet I couldnt wait to get my Carbons Golden Malted waffle mix in the mail & had ordered 6 tins of it! Thats How much we loved it at the Inn where we 1st had it! Now I know how good it was which is why I am shocked to be writing this review... We made our 1st batch of waffles using this mix & was sort of put off that we had to add melted butter unlike the Krusteaz store bought which uses oil instead! Aside from that the waffles didnt come out full like all the others we had using the other mix & tasted VERY BLAND wasnt even a little bit malted flavored like we remembered. Had a almost bitter bland flavor, we thought maybe we did something wrong & made a whole new batch & yet again tasted awful! We did use water & not milk however thats what we used with the Krusteaz brand too & it was very good! I cant imagine milk making it have a better or sweeter flavor & am sure that the Inn where we stayed used water rather than go through the expense of using that much milk for a free breakfast for their guests!!! My husband even said next time we should try milk & add some vanilla extract to the mix, which perhaps will make it taste better however that is just to mask the awful bland flavor it has! I considered giving the rest of my tins to people for Christmas however wouldnt want to embarrass myself now knowing how bad it tastes! =( I hate that Im giving the mix a bad review because like I said it was wonderful when we 1st tried it in Branson, maybe some how we received a BAD batch or something either way we are sitting on 5 1/2 tins of UNWANTED mix!!! We Really want to send it back, but waited to long!!! Hope this helps you all as for us we will be buying th yummy Krusteaz mix from our local grocery from now on & I only gave it 2 stars because I know how good it supposed to be!
