A friend of mine just purchased these for a camping trip. I was curious to see what this product tasted like ahead of time, so we opened one up. Immediately upon opening I was hit with the distinct smell of cat food. How do you make beans and corn smell like cat food?? The beans and corn were mushy and tasted horrible. Maybe its a French thing, but my American palate did not like this one bit. Please do not submit your mouth to such torture.
