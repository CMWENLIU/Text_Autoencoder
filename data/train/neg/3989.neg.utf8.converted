My cat just won't eat it.  She tried a few bits and sat up for a few moments after each bite and acted like she was trying to figure out what was odd about the taste.  I've never seen her do that.  She wouldn't eat it.  I tried mixing it with some Fancy Feast, but she sniffed it and just sat there and wouldn't eat it. This catfood is very much like very wet babyfood.  It doesn't have anything to "bite" into. It's very mushy and soft.  I suspect that it has too many vegetables and not enough meat and fish in it.  I feel bummed that I have wasted my money on this.
