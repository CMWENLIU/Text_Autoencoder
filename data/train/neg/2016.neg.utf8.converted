I thought this would be some kind of find, all right.  It said organic on the box, so how could I go wrong?<br /><br />Well, to me "organic" means pure and natural, as in its original state.  I got the 4-pack and put three of the boxes in the freezer so they wouldn't spoil, and then only later found that the product had been degermed. ;-(<br /><br />I wonder what they did with the germ... sold it to the health food stores?  Slopped hogs with it?  LOL<br /><br />These may be good-tasting grits, as good as you can get in the store, perhaps.  But at least this way the buyer can make an informed decision.
