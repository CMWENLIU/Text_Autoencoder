No where did it say how many ounces were in these 7 bags, so I assumed it was the larger bag that Sam's Club sold.  Sam's Club also sold the larger bags for about $2.67/bag.  However, when I received the ordered bags, they were only 4.5 oz each!  I can buy them cheaper at my local gas station, MINUS the shipping charge!!  Not to mention that only the larger bags said 'Limited Edition' on them, which this company advertised - the ones I received did not.  False advertising! TOTAL RIP OFF, DO NOT BUY FROM COSMETIC SOLUTIONS!!
