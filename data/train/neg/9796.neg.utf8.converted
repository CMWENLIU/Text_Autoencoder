This is definitely an indulgence item. I don't mind the calories (over 500 a serving) if the product is good, but I find this product way too sweet for my taste. I was overwhelmed by the sweetness and could not really get much of the pumpkin flavor or any flavor other than sweet. There was a grittiness to the texture that I did not enjoy. It is probably the sugar granules, but it would not dissolve or go away even when the product was heated. It felt like I was biting on sand pieces. When heated (particularly in the microwave), the oil will separate from the solid parts so you have to spend a couple of minutes mixing it back in, or you can try to pour it off and save on the calories a bit.
