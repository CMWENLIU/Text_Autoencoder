I grew up with Cattlemen's then I moved to the other side of the USA.  I later discovered Cattlemen's BBQ Sauce at Walmart and started using it, then Walmart discontinued it my area and I could not get it anywhere in this state, so I went to Amazon. I ordered 2 cases of 6 Plastic bottles. I just got my shippment from Amazon and 2 of the bottle are damaged ( meaning there is BBQ sauce inside the box )there wasn't any packaging inside the box, the bottles were wrapped in bundles of 6 and the bundles were loose in the box.From what I read about returns on products like this one, you cann't return them. Would I order a product like this from AMAZON again,NO. Don't get me wrong I still love Cattlemen's BQQ Sauce, I'll try getting it from some one else.
