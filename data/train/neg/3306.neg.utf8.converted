First of all I have to say that I love dark chocolate and this product sounded like something that I would have liked.  But as it turns out, I really didn't like the way it tasted, as a matter of fact, I couldn't even finish the bar. I try to eat healthy and I think it's great that they came out with a healthier product, but unfortunately I feel that in doing that, they sacrificed the flavor and I just didn't care for it.
