I have never before given a negative review to anything, but I am very sorry that I bought a full 12 pack of this.  I had previously used another brand and found it to be wonderful. I made the mistake of assuming that this product would be of equal quality.  Pacific Natural has a very thick consistency and exudes a strong chalky taste. Can't return the unopened 11 containers and will not drink them. I will buy living harvest brand in the future even though it costs more.
