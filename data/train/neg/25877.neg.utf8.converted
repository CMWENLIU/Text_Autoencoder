I tried this several months ago and found it to be an over-priced complete disappointment. I love acai and used to eat the pulps & purees all the time when I lived in Brazil. This is not a good acai product. First, it is stored at room temperature. What a joke. Acai should be maintained frozen to preserve the nutrients..at times refrigeration is okay, but room temp for a fruit product stored for several months...not a good deal. Anyone in Brazil knows this. Second, they claim to use the whole fruit including the seed. This is false marketing. The seeds are used to burn for fuel and composted for fertilizer in Brazil. Nobody uses the seeds for dietary consumption. Finally, this product treats acai as a dietary supplement. Acai is a fruit, a whole food. It is not intended to be served in 1oz serving sizes. Again, you would get laughed at in Brazil if you wanted a 1oz serving of acai. Like asking for 3 blueberries. Don't buy the Genesis Today hype. Very disappointed in all of their products. You're better off looking for some frozen acai pulp or frozen acai puree and eating a normal fruit serving of a few ounces.
