Be aware that nowhere on the website does it say that this item must be opened and used within 30 days.  However, that information was printed on the box so when I received it I called the company to determine if that 30 days is simply a "recommended to be used by" date (I wanted to give it as a Christmas gift).  They informed me that while there could possibly be a 5-7 day "grace" period, the 30-day limit is pretty firm.  The company will not refund or exchange this item. I'm sure this is a good product but be sure you are planning to open and start it growing immediately.
