Description misleads buyers. It states "It's what is inside that counts - natural flavors, pure cane sugar and filtered water. Only the best ingredients." Upon receiving, the ingredients listed are; Water, Sugar, Natural and Articficial Flavors, Propylene Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol, Ethanol, Dextrose, Gum Arabic, Gum Xanthan, Vegetable Gum, Ester Gum, Vegetable Oil, Food Starch, Glyceryl, Abletate, Citric Acid, Phosporic Acid, Tartaric Acid, Tannic Acid, Malic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Tartrazine, Triacentin, GHA, Yellow#5, ..... and the list goes on. My opinion is if a product is described as such, than the ingredient list should be all natural - not composed of natural occuring and synthetic chemical compounds to make up the product. I am returning this product as "NOT AS DESCRIBED".
