I used these as an additive to my melted chocolate that I was using to cover cake pops and cake bites.  Before, I was just using oil to do the job, which was very successful.  Many different resources said that I needed to try these paramount crystals to help the chocolate hold to the cake pops.  My attempt with these paramount crystals was a near disaster... Several of the pops started to sweat through the chocolate and on others the chocolate cracked, both of which had never happened on the hundreds of cake pops/bites that I had made with oil in the chocolate.  Needless to say, I switched back to oil.
