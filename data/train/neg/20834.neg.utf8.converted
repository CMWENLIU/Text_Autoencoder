The nutritional information reveals 2 grams of trans fats. Just FYI for those who wouldn't catch it otherwise... In my book, anything with partially hydrogonated oils is not a consumable product!<br /><br />"...there is no safe level of trans fat consumption. There is no adequate level, recommended daily amount or tolerable upper limit for trans fats. This is because any incremental increase in trans fat intake increases the risk of coronary heart disease." NEJM
