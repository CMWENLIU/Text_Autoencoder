I got my Aerogarden, despite the many bad reviews on the faulty pumps.  I<br />figured that surely it wasn't a widespread problem.  I had about a week of happiness, watching most of my plants sprout.  A buzzing sound started within 10 days, but it was bearable.  In about 15 days, the pump could be heard in the kitchen AND the living room.  After 20 days, I had to move the Aerogarden to the only room in the house where there were no occupants most of the day - the utility room.  To say it is loud is an understatement.  I have called the Aerogarden help line.  They told me that they had replaced the pumps with a different kind, since they were having trouble with the old ones.  These new ones just weren't working out either, apparently.  They would replace mine immediately.  I have a black Aerogarden, but the customer service rep told me I could get a white replacement pump faster than a black one!!!  I agreed to the white pump, but now I'm not sure I can wait for even that to come in.  I am pretty sure I will have to pull the plug on my garden.  The noise is awful, and I'm willing to sacrifice my herbs for my sanity.  They agreed to send me a replacement herb kit for the herbs I will lose.  Another problem I have:  no cilantro sprouts at all.  They have apparently also had trouble with these, and the cilantro is now not covered under their guarantee of growth.  They WILL send you a different herb.  I guess it is my bad luck that I bought this mainly for the cilantro!!  The rest of the herbs seem to be thriving.  Too bad I am getting ready to sacrifice them for some peace and quiet.<br /><br />This is a very interesting kit, but you would be wise to assume that the faulty pump will happen to YOU too.  You would think that the pump problem would be ironed out by now - I have spent a lot of time researching this - most of my time spent AFTER I bought it - and this has been going on for a long time.  Not much quality for your money.<br /><br />UPDATE:  4/27/07  Company has not provided a replacement pump as promised, however, here is temporary fix for the obnoxious pump noise.<br /><br />From your plumbing or home supply store, obtain plumber's silicon grease.  After removing the pump from the base, (using a small philips driver), remove the front cover and small diffuser plate from the pump.  Fingers will do.  The pump impeller will be exposed, then lift the impeller off of the spindle.  Using the plumber's grease, apply enough to coat the round magnet on the impeller shaft, making sure that there's enough to fill the gap between the magnet and rotor hole.  Re-assemble the whole thing and treat yourself to silence.  If the noise comes back in a day or two, then you didnt use enough grease.  This grease is not petroleum based and does not contaminate the water, its milky clear and easy to use.<br /><br />The basic problem with this pump appears to be that the rotor bearing surface is not hard enough to resist wear and just a small amount of additional clearance between the rotor and rotor shaft due to wear allows the rotor to chatter.  The purpose of the grease is not necessarily to lube the rotor bearing surface, but to dampen the rotating resonance effects inherent in the design.  The best fix is of course to replace the cheap pump with a better design.  You'd think that for $140, AG could spend an extra 75 cents for something that lasts.  Hey AG, though I may have tried, I could not polish this turd.
