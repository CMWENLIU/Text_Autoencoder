So not sure what gives with this but this ISN'T the same Mudslide I had in the variety pack..The normal mudslide smells/tastes so good and smells my kitchen up with the yummy chocolate coffee smell but not this.. As a hint of chocolate but that is about it- I would have returned but threw out the packaging... Anyways very unhappy with this product- I should have read the previous comment as they had the same result.. Order at your own risk...
