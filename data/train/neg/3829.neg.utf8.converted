We love Steaz green tea with peach at our house. So much so that we had three orders per month sent to our home. But our last three orders--while labeled as peach tea--actually contain raspberry tea! Amazon generously refunded us our money as they do not accept returns on food. We have tried to buy the peach tea at two local grocery stores and have had the same experience--raspberry tea in peach cans.<br /><br />I give the peach tea five stars, but zero star for raspberry tea in peach tea cans.<br /><br />I have contacted Steaz about this issue, but have not heard from them . . . .<br /><br />So beware!
