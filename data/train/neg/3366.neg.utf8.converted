<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EQYS7Q">Terra Kettles Cut Blend Potato Chips, Sea Salt, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a> While these chips are crisp, they feel and taste too oily for me.  The per serving fat listed online is 6g while the bag lists it at 10g.  Since the bag contains 2 servings, that would be 20g per 2 oz bag.  They are packaged in stronger material than other chips I have tried.
