And by that, I mean, it's okay if you need a paper weight.  Or a door stop.  Or some other solid, inert mass.  Because as a food, Haribo gummie bears are somewhere between Friskie's Turkey & Giblets and gravel.  Haribo brand gummie bears lack flavor, gum, or bear.  They're even shaped like tiny fragments of Mount Rushmore -- doubly impressive for a German candy that never even witnessed South Dakota.<br /><br />If you need a solid gummie, go for Target's Market Pantry brand or whatever Area 51 concoction going on at Saratoga Sweets in Clifton Park, NY.  I mean, man, the banana flavor of those bears kicks your teeth right down into your sweet spot.  Double flippin' awesome.<br /><br />In closing, real Germans prefer other bears and/or hunt meisters.
