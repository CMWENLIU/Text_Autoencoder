I was surprised to find these teas to be unappealing and distasteful.  Besides these teas, I recently tried several other Bentley teas -- blueberry, raspberry, peach & ginger, and mango -- and I have to report that I also disliked them.  The Bentley teas seem to have very different smells compared to other teas, like Twinings, Tazo, Ahmad, etc.<br /><br />Although I've tried many teas that didn't impress me, the Bentley teas are the first that I have found that I completely dislike.  Given the mixture of very positive and very negative reviews for their teas, I'm guessing that it is a situation where people have strong reactions to the smell of their teas and either love them or hate them.
