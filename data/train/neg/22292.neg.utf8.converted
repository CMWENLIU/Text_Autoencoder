I've purchased 3 boxes of the 3 gallon bags and have not been happy with them. Every roll has had at least 4 or 5 bags that were ripped or incomplete.  Plus they leak and don't hold much. I've had to double the bags every time to hold the compostables and prevent the leaking. Can't believe people like these.
