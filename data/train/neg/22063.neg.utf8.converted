The price seemed too good to be true. Italian coffee beans for my good espresso machine at a great price. Well, turns out that you get what you pay for: nice packaging but the lowest of the low quality robusta coffee beans (with some arabica, I guess to make it seem "classy". Unfortunately, the smell and flavor give it away immediately. This is very bad coffee, very light in color, off in flavor whether made into espresso or used in drip. Buyer beware. This is cheap quality packaged to mask it's true nature. Don't buy, or prepare to be disappointed.
