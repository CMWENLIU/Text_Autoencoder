on the advice of friends i purchased this 2-pack.  everyone raves about how good it is and how it is a substitute for peanut butter.  i have to disagree.  it's like eating sweetened grease.<br />a side by side label comparison (using Skippy Natural PB) shows that the two are very similar except for protein and vitamin/mineral amounts but i much prefer peanut butter.  the flavor of this stuff is okay but just too greasy for me.  i think i could mix up brown sugar and butter and get the same effect.<br />so my vote is Yuck.
