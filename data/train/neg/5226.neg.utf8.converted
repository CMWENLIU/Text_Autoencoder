These cookies taste good, BUT they didn't arrive intact.  I may have had two out of the 9 cookies in full shape.  The rest were pieces; mainly crumbs.  I have 6 boxes of crumbs ( because I used the subscibe and save) and will probably use for pie crusts or cheesecake crust.<br />Its  disappointing so far as just wanting a couple yummy cookies once in awhile !  Didn't want to have to bake to use. : (
