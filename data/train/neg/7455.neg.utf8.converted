these are awful, my 7 month old did not like them and eevn when I threw them out to the birds they didn't even eat them. What bothered me also is that they weren't even made in the U.S.A. I was surprised that Earth's Best had a low rating. She loved them, she was able to hold on to them better than these, they didnt just dissolve away like nothing. the Earth's Best is a million times better.
