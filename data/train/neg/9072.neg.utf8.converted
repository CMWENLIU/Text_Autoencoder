We bought a jar of this and use it nearly everyday. At first we were enthralled with the flavor, and I would have given it a five star review, but now, about 9 months later, it barely has any flavor or scent at all. We kept the lid closed between uses, but I don't think the lid keeps a good seal, and perhaps that's why there's no flavor left. Our first time buying truffle salt, we got a little jar at Pikes Place Market, and its potency lasted well over a year until it ran out. If you buy this, maybe put half in a well sealed glass jar to store. We have a tiny bottle of truffle oil we picked up in Italy a year ago, and that's still very potent, not sure why this product loses it so quickly.
