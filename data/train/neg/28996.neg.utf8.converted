I found this product to be horrible.  The juice was extremely cloudy and there was also a thick white colored residue at the bottom of the bottle.  It cleared somewhat when shaken in the bottle however it never went away.  I felt the juice tasted somewhat bitter and I didn't care for the taste it added in my martini.  I stored several bottles sideways on a shelf in my liquor cabinet and noticed within about two months they were leaking from around the cap with a rusty slimy residue dripping out.
