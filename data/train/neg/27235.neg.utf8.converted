I ordered this product because it seemed it would be good for everyone in the family. I did read the other reviews and knew they were going to be super crunchy, which they were, but they seemed to be stale.  My children said they tasted funny.  I checked if I could send them back but it stated non-returnable.  I threw them away and will be<br />very leary about ordering food products if there is no returns allowed if the product is not good.
