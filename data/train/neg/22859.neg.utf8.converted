Notice how it says "Raw dog food" then "with chicken". It's written this way because it's not entirely raw, the chicken is cooked. Cooked proteins are likely to be allergenic! The whole point of a raw diet it for it to be raw so it isn't allergenic and is easy to digest, and of course the most important part of the dog's diet is the protein source. I wish this company would stop trying to trick people into thinking their food is raw. Some dogs do not do well on this product. The owners assume it is raw and then assume raw doesn't work. In many of these cases, the dog would benefit from a truly raw diet. For this reason I really wish The Honest Kitchen would straighten up and give up the practice of deceit. They are essentially harming many, many animals who could find relief on a truly raw diet. I have already had this discussion with their representative many years ago. The company did change their wording so that they no longer tell outright lies, but it is still deceptive. I can't imagine they care about anyone's pet if they carry on like this. If your pet has had issues such as hot spots, digestive upset, body odor, itchy feet or any other chronic condition, ask your vet if it could be an allergy to the cooked proteins in this diet. If it is, and you were under the impression that you were feeding raw protein, let the manufacturer know. They have to know how many pets they are harming, or they will never straighten up.
