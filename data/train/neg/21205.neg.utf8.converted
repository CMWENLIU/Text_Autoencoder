I use to LOVE Snow's Clam Chowder, but like all the other reviews, since Bumble Bee took over this brand, it is the worst tasting soup I have ever eaten!!! Usually, eat New England Clam Chowder about once a month with BLT sandwiches. I bought this soup from Grocery Outlet and my boyfriend said "Well what do you expect"? So.... needless to say I will let the manager, of Grocery Outlet know, that he shouldn't stock this soup, in his store!
