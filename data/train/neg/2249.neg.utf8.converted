My wife bought this along with regular Quaker maple oatmeal.  I figured I'd give it a shot. Huge mistake. First off, the "healthier" one has the same amount of calories (160) and higher fat (3g vs 1g) than the normal oatmeal.  Secondly, it tastes like I'm eating a bowl of sweet and low. It literally did not smell like anything edible. Buyer beware.
