I specifically ordered these chips because the nutrition information states they have 4 grams of fiber per serving. They taste good, so I ordered the case from Amazon. (In fact, I even signed up for subscribe and save) When my package arrived today, the bag says they only have 1 gram of fiber per serving! I called Garden of Eatin' and was told that there was new analysis and testing done which shows they only actually have one gram of fiber per serving. That's a huge difference! The customer service rep said the testing was done in September, yet the nutrition information on their own website still shows 4 grams of fiber. To me, that is false advertising. How hard is it to go in change that information on your own website!<br /><br />So, bottom line, if you don't care about the amount of fiber...these are really tasty chips. But if the amount of fiber is what attracted you to them, don't buy!
