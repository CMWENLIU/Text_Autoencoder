I used to buy Godiva chocolates for friends as gifts. Whe I lived in S.F. I took the bus to get to their downtown store.<br />I used to think that Godiva was the BEST chocolate ever, that is until I found out that they use gmos in their candy, because its cheap. Why am I paying a premium price for sub standard candy?  Hersheys uses gmos; the very same stuff Godiva uses. I expect that from Hersheys. Their candy bars are 75 cents compared to Godiva at $3.oo!<br /><br />What a ripoff! Shame on you Godiva!  I already found a better chocolate to replace you and its cheaper and tastes better!<br />They are called Theo Chocolate Company and are NON-GMo vefified.
