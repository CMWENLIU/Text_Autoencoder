we have been giving our dogs Happy Hips Chicken treats for a few years with no problems, however my dog recently started getting tremendously sick out of the blue.  She started drinking tons of water, having accidents all over the house and stopped eating her food.  My Vet has done a X-Ray, ultrasound, blood work etc...they have no idea what is going on.  My poor German Shepherd is on the brink of dying and everything seems to point to these chicken treats.  All of her food is top quality made in USA food, I always trusted what Dogswell said about testing their treats extensively, now I am not so sure.  I just read an aritcle on Fanconi Syndrome caused by treats from China, I plan on calling my vet first thing in the morning, wish us luck.  :(
