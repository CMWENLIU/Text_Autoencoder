As a background, i have been preparing escargot for years at home and decided to upgrade my aging collection of olde Pyrex and metal escargot plates and to have matching dishes to serve 6 friends or family.<br /><br />I just received my escargot plates-had hoped that the ceramic would be superior in heat retention.<br />My disappointment comes from the quality.  The plates themselves appear to be a heavy stoneware-like material.  They are not. Worse still when i called the vendor i was told that each plate was very heavy and that was the reason for the high shipping cost.  A lot of nonsense and hooey.<br /><br />The glazing was incomplete on the bottoms of three out of 6, and on one of the handles.  This may result in moisture penetrating the ceramic.  It certainly will make clean up tougher.  The depressions are small at best to hold small snails and ample butter, and downright tight for the extra large snails. There is no lip on the edge which will allow for extra butter.  Worst is that these are 4.5" in diameter-downright small.  Very disappointing and i would not recommend these.<br /><br />They are, however, minimally functional and appear that they would retain heat similarly but not better than glass or ceramic plates without the bowl.<br /><br />Also the picture seems to show a two tone dish, brown top with a more rustic grey brown lower section, like real stoneware,  as well as a taper-mine are not like this, they are evenly brown and not tapered.<br /><br />Not happy as there as larger plain ceramic dishes available for half the price.  I thought these were a superior product.  I would not recommend these for the above reasons.  Shipping prices posted are ridiculous.  Actually, not ridiculous, they are outrageous, as all six, in thier cehap cardboard box (which holds six-likely originally sold as sets) weighed about 1.5 lbs total. The shipping prices quoted via the Amazon portal are absurd.  These bowls are made in Taiwan, which only bearing is that the cost versus quality is apparent.  WHiel the description i accessed indicates these are made in France , they are not.<br /><br />IMHO a waste of money, unless you like the color and compactness. When i complained to the vendor i was dismayed at the customer service, including a claim for re-stocking fees for defective items shipped, something i have never encountered. More dismaying still, is that these items in the vendors catalog, included in my shipment , sell for almost a dollar less than listed here.  So not only does the seller charge high shipping, a handling charge, but also more than its own catalog price.  I think this is a vendor to be avoided from my experience.
