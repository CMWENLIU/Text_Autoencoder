I finally ordered it after reading the glorious reviews, and I have to ask, are we talking about the same stuff? It's just ground up, oily, coconut meat. I can't believe I got suckered into buying it at this price, which, by the way, was $16.99, thank you so much, vendor, for dropping the price right after I ordered.<br /><br />Oh well, I just wanted to take a teaspoon or so a day to get those medium chain fatty acids. That shouldn't be a problem. I sure won't be tempted to have too much.
