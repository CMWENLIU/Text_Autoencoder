Ordered the 6 coconut cake mixes on February 17, 2010 and order was in stock and confirmed by them.  I was told the order would arrive between February 23rd and 26th.  Did not arrive on 26th, but was told it shipped.  Due to snow storm gave them the benefit of the doublt.  Emailed on Saturday the 27th letting them know I had not recieved the coconut cake mixes.  I expected a responce confirming that due to weather it was delay and should/would arrive on Monday March 1st.  Needless to day on March 1st when I arrived home no package.<br /><br />I checked my email only to find a message saying "Thank you for your query and I apologize for the delay. We won't be getting a new shipment in for that item until the middle of March. How would you like us to handle your order?"  This after confriming it was in stock when order was placed and again after confirming receipt of order on the 17th and giving me the arrival date of February 23-26th!!!<br /><br />Rather unprofessional wouldn't you say not to mention unreliable?  How disappointing as this was for a wedding cake for a friend.  Had I known on the 17th they didn't have the mixes in stock I would have searched for other vendors or tested my own "from scratch" cake  Now I won't have the flavor for the weeking cake for March 6th nor will I have time to search for a recipe.  So sad.<br /><br />So beware if you need somethingin a timely manner from this vendor as they are not reliable!!! Shame on them!!!
