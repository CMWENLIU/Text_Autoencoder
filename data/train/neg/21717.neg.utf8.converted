I have been buying the unsweetened carob chips from a local high end supermarket.  I decided to try these since they cost less.  What a mistake!  These taste like cardboard!  I was very disappointed after having bought 5 lbs. thinking they would be the same.  These are awful!  I had to throw them out and go back to buying the other ones at the supermarket.  Sometimes it doesn't pay to try and save money, in this case it didn't.  Also, when they arrived, 2 packages were melted, so they were not packaged well.
