This is not kalamata olive oil.<br />1.  Tin has picture of normal olives not kalamata<br />2.  No where on the tin does it say "kalamata"<br />3.  Tasted it and it does not taste anything like kalamata Ive had before.<br />4.  The description on site says 100% kalamata.<br />Sending it back.....<br />UPDATE<br />The same day I wrote this review I was contacted by Mr. Alexander Mallas, with SuperOlive.com, the seller. 650-591-1010 .<br />He explained that the product description was written by the Martinis Company,the manufacturer.<br />The Kalamata is the region in Greece where the olives are grown, not necessarily kalamata olives.<br />I never knew there was such a place.  The seller plans on clarifing this in their description.<br />Mr. Mallas did say he attended an olive oil convention in Greece and found that the locals make their own kalamata olive oil for themselves and it is not readily available to the public.  The quest will continue....<br />It was a pleasure discussing the many different grades and types of olive oil. I plan on reading the book,<br />Extra Virginity: The Sublime and Scandale, by Tom Mueller, which he recommended.  I heard the program on NPR, with this review.<br />The Martinis oil I have he said I can keep, with an acidy level of .8 ( whatever that means ) I would only use it to fry fish, or other foods.<br />I am satisfied with the response, in fact Mr. Mallas is a colorfull man, and would look forward to another discussion after completing my<br />education.
