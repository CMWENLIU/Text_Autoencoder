I love Vita Coco and have been a big fun of it for a long time. Love the Mango, Pineapple, and most other flavor but few. Most of the time I order the basic non flavor type but decided to try this new kind. Yuck! Such a strange taste to it! Even my teenage son who loves Vita Coco and other coconut waters, refuse to have it so now I'll have to finish it so it won't be wasted. This is the one flavor that I have to force myself to finish, and I rarely come up with the bad flavor like this. Totally not recommended, go for Mango or regular Vita Coco instead!
