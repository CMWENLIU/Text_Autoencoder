German Haribos don't contain artificial flavors and no artificial colors. German Haribos are all natural.<br />The Turkish ones however taste too sweet and less fruity, and look much more colorful because of artificial colors (FD & C yellow no. 5, red no. 40,blue no.1) and unnatural flavors.<br /><br />When you send a mail to Haribo, they reply that the Turkish Haribos, sold in the US, contain that artificial stuff, so that the Gummy Bear flavor survives the long shipping by ship. Looking at long shelf life duration of even the German Haribos that seems like a lie to me. Cost cutting and less restrictive US-Food regulation seem to be the real reasons ...<br /><br />Hungarian made Haribos (seen in India) aren't any better btw.
