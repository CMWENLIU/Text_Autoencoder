This was not what I expected in a Christmas "pudding" !  This description would<br />make you believe it was moist (with brandy) - NOT !  It was dry and tasted like<br />raisins.  In defense of the company (Cole), maybe any other "pudding" would have<br />been the same, but most of mine went in the trash, and at $25 it was a disappointment !
