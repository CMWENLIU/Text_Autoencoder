I'm reading Wheat Belly and am trying to go Gluten Free so was considering this product.  Reading the reviews here alerted me to read the ingredient list and I see that this contains more Tapioca and Potato starch than almond flour which the book explains is actually worse for you due to their GI than the wheat you're trying to avoid.  Misleading when the name of the product is fifth on the ingredients list.
