They contain too much fat, sometimes canola oil (more healthy), sometimes palm oil (less healthy).  They are very sweet. The chocolate is not as good as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Y0OFRQ">Valrhona Manjari Dark Chocolate Bar - 64% - 1 box, 20 2.46 oz bars</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007Q5B60">Scharffen Berger Semisweet 62% Cacao Baking Chocolate Bar 9.7oz.</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N9VLJ2">Ghirardelli Intense Dark Premium Dark Chocolate Assortment 50 Pack</a>.  It is however palatable.  The cookie layer was soggy. I have eaten the UK equivalent of these Mallomars (Chocolate Marshmallows) as a child and the base was much crisper. The base tasted stale.  The cookies were broken, some stuck together, others fell apart.<br /><br />Unhealthy foods like this are to be avoided, except perhaps for children's parties, but even then this package was so badly handled that the cookies were not presentable.  Instead get ideas for healthy food from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060928115">Everyday Cooking with Dr. Dean Ornish: 150 Easy, Low-Fat, High-Flavor Recipes</a>. If you must eat cookies, then <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YHLS8W">Kashi TLC Cookies, Oatmeal Dark Chocolate, 8.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a> might be a healthier alternative.<br /><br />I note that the Chocolate Marshmallows that I had as a child were individually wrapped in foil and according to Wikipedia, under the heading Chocolate-coated marshmallow treats some use a shortbread base (firmer) with an Italian meringue which is stiffer than the marshmallow. It also reports that Nabisco only makes Mallomars from October to April, either for marketing reasons or because they do not keep well in warm tempratures - it would be good from someone from Nabisco to verify if this is the case. Clearly my Mallomars suffered from poor storage and inadequate packing, as did those of many other reviewers.
