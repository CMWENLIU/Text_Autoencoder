I read reviews preferring Da Vinci, so I gave it a try. I prefer Torani. Torani has fuller, truer flavor. Da Vinci was very thin and had minimally higher sodium. Can't really justify the price for Da Vinci. Torani was strong enough to provide flavor and go a long way before needing to be restocked. I am sorry I bought three bottles of Da Vinci. But I am certain now, after my taste testing, that no matter what the flavor, Torani has a satisfactory rating with me, and Da Vinci has an unsatisfactory rating.
