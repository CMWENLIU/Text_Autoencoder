If you plan on purchasing this item through Kitty Hawk Wholesale as a gift, and think it will arrive by a certain date, think again.  My experience with Kitty Hawk Wholesale was that they dragged their heels on getting this item out and then they lied regarding when it was shipped and when it would arrive.  Maybe they prefer to only ship on certain days.  Who knows?  But the popcorn was great!  My father much enjoyed it when he finally got to sit down with it, two days after Father's Day.
