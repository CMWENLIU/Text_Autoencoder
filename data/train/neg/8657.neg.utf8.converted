OMG....this has got to be THE most foul tasting slop I have ever tried. It tastes nothing like cheese and queso dip but more like yellow/orange food coloring and thick motor oil. I can not possibly even conceive it that anyone at the factory tasting lab spooned this slop in their mouth and exclaimed its goodness and said "Let's go with it".<br />It's difficult to explain how bad this tastes, the only thing that comes to mind is a motor oil and gasoline mix.<br />Please please PLEASE! For your own good.....leave this crap on the shelf!<br />I'm doing this for you people!
