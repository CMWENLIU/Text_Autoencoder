I'm usually pretty attentive when I make a purchase on Amazon.com. But not this time. When I purchased this, I thought that I was buying moong dal, the type you have to cook. Actually, this product is a crunchy snack. (Yes, I know now that it does say "Snack," but I wasn't paying a lot of attention.) This is dehusked split green "gram" or mung beans that are fried in vegetable oil. They are crunchy and salty. Not a bad snack, but I don't recommend this product, especially since there are five pouches, and I'll never eat them. I'm still working on the first bag. :)
