A very strange treat.. dogs did not like any of the varieties we tried and I ordered three different varieties.<br />Not a 'strip' but a baked 'cookie' that was really very hard and more of a chunk of something backed, not meat looking or smelling.<br />Just really weird and I would never buy them again! save your money and buy the Chicken Jerky treats at WalGreens that are a bone fide strip of chicken and dogs love them! these are chunks of mystery material and not at all appetizing.
