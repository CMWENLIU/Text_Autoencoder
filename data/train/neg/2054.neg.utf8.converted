I'm not a beef jerky aficionado, but I do know that this jerky doesn't have much flavor compared to other jerky out there. Maybe it's because there's too much brown sugar and not enough beef flavor. Or does the MSG have something to do with it?<br /><br />I just purchased some Pacific Gold jerky(which Amazon sells but I got it at Costco cheaper) and it has a lot more beef flavor and no MSG.
