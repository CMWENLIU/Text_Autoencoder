I usually like Stonewall Kitchen products, so I was excited to see one of my favorite recipe book author lending her name to a product.  I finally bit the bullet and shelled out $10+ for a boxed mix and I was SOOOO disappointed!  The box comes with three packets - the cake mix, coconut, & "frosting mix" (which is just powdered sugar).  The cupcakes were okay - they were pretty moist, but I used all the coconut in the cake rather then reserving 1/3 for the topping (I used additional store-bought coconut for the topping).  The "frosting" was awful - it's the packet of sugar mixed with butter and cream cheese and it was very bad when made as directed.  I added in about another cup of powered sugar to make the constancy spreadable and taste right.<br /><br />Over all, the cupcakes were a hit, but for a $10+ mix that makes 12 cupcakes I shouldn't have to buy and add my own ingredients!  I could have easily done this from scratch for the same or less money and it would have been just as simple!
