The description of this product says, "flavor assortment may vary," which is misleading.  It should say, "quantities of each flavor may vary drastically."  The five-pound bag I received contained (percentage of total is in parentheses) - 3 Very Cherry (1%), 14 Googly Grape (4%), 28 Tooberry Blueberry (9%), 30 Mango Tango (10%), 31 Strawberry Smash (10%), 38 Pomegranate Pucker (12%), 43 Sour Apple Tart (14%), and a whopping 126 Wet-Face Watermelon (40%).  I didn't expect an equal assortment of each flavor, but the disparity is ridiculous.  These 5-pound bags appear to be how Yummy Earth gets rid of their overstock.
