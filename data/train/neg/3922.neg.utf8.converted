This product is wayyy to bitter for me. I am not discounting the quality however the taste is very strong and bitter. I realize this isn't the over-sugared chocolate like snickers, however i was expecting to be able to doctor it a little. I am still trying out recipes to see what works. I am not a coffee lover which i am assuming you would almost have to be since this tastes very similar to coffee. I do like chocolate but this was a tad overpowering. But the product was as described, in powdered form and does smell great. That's the only reason i gave it a low rating is because of taste otherwise it would be 5 stars.
