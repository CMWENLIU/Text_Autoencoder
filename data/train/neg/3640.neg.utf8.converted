So, I made these cookies a few weeks ago and they were really good.  In fact, I got an upset stomach from eating so much dough and only ended up with a few fabulous cookies.  So I bought some more.  I smelled the beans as soon as I opened the package, that beaney smell that some GF flours have, and while I didn't remember that from last time I figured it would go away when mixed and cooked.  So I mixed in the rest of the ingredients, and the smell got a bit worse, and the texture seemed all wrong.  I tasted the dough (you must be thinking that I'm an idiot by now doing this, but I really wanted some cookies to go with today's snowstorm!), and YUCK.  5 minutes later I still have a bad, metallic taste in my mouth.  Seriously, like these are contaminated with metals or something.  I am going to throw away the cookies that are baking.  They look all wrong... like meringue, not like chocolate chip cookies, nothing like the batch two weeks ago.  It's really weird.  Two completely different experiences with the same product in less than a month.  This batch of cookies is a failure of 4 of 5 senses: smell, sight, taste, and texture.  I'm glad I can't hear cookies.  There are some serious quality control issues here, that are probably the root of the range of opinions in these ratings.  I think I need to contact Bob.  Too bad for him I didn't review this product two weeks ago.
