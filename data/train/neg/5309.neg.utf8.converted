Based on reviews, I ordered this bigger size because I read the smaller size had a weird taste. I was happy with some although there are some cans that had a weird taste. I went abroad and since I was enrolled in the auto delivery I received the second batch while I was away. I figured maybe the first batch was just a bad batch but once I opened the first can of the second batch, I still had that taste. I tried to do an exchange but I was not within the time frame.<br />My daughter says it could be because they're packaged in cans and she adviced I just switch to Vita Coco. I did order the Vita Coco 17oz and am very happy with it. Unfortunately it doesn't have the auto delivery that Amy and Brian has so I just have to put in an order every time.
