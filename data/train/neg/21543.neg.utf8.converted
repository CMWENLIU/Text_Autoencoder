While the other Nescafe flavors seemed to be very rich and gourmet tasting, I felt this one needed to go back to the development lab.  To me, it tasted like powdered hot cocoa, and not a very good one at that.  I have tried adjusting the Choc/Milk ratio but didn't find a good taste.  It's a shame because NesCafe has such a good name in Europe where drinking Chocolate is held to a much higher standard than here in the US.  I expected a better product.
