Although my cats rejected Merrick's Quail & Chicken, I'm giving it five stars [but not anymore - see UPDATE below] because I think it smells great and the ingredients list is excellent. After supplementing their regular canned food with small amounts of the Quail & Chicken over a period of about two weeks (six cans divided between two cats) in order to introduce it gradually, the cats began refusing to eat it all together. It smells like roasted poultry and they ate it readily at first. I feel it must not have agreed with their tummies, or they would have continued to eat it. But who knows why these things happen with fussy cats. I tried to reintroduce it several times over the next few weeks, but they'd have none of it.<br /><br />I haven't tried lots of different natural canned foods for my cats, but I have found two that they consistently like. Those are Natural Life Lamaderm Lamb & Rice Platter and Natural Balance Indoor Cat Formula. But who knows why they prefer those, or how long that preference will last.<br /><br />UPDATE (July 17, 2011): I've recently learned about an ingredient in Merrick's canned cat foods that may have caused my cats to reject it, after having eaten it readily at first. That ingredient is "yeast extract." It seems that this is just an innocent-sounding name for glutamates (the same as in monosodium glutamate or MSG). It's an appetite stimulant (flavor enhancer) with the same side effects as MSG. For the many who are sensitive to it, the side effects of glutamate include headaches, dizziness, abdominal cramps, heartburn, etc.<br /><br />If a cat eats something that tastes good, but then the cat feels sick, it will eventually reject that food. I'm glad they have that survival instinct or they'd be sick all the time thanks to these dumb pet food companies that will feed them anything. It would be a real coup to get pets addicted to your brand of pet food by adding a flavor enhancer that other brands didn't have, now wouldn't it? Of course, it if makes them sick and they reject it, then the scheme has backfired.<br /><br />And, by the way, my cats still enjoy the Natural Life and Natural Balance foods that I've been feeding them. So it seems it wasn't just a passing preference.<br /><br />Because of the deceptive ingredient "yeast extract" and its potential for making pets sick, I now give this food a "1 star" rating.
