I had to throw out almost all of these raisins because they contained crawly things and/or what looks like the droppings of crawly things. I must say I generally love Newman's products, and I was willing to give these raisins the benefit of the doubt. With natural products, sometimes bugs get in them. That's part of the territory with organic matter. But I found white grubs and little brown dots that weren't a part of the raisins in box after shrink-wrapped box. Some boxes were fine, and I ate the raisins in them, but the majority were tainted. I'll need to be assured there's been an improvement in quality control before I try Newman's snack-pack organic raisins again.
