I can eat just about anything, but these went down the garbage disposal.  I followed instructions and used pasta sauce on them, couldn't eat them......added freshly grated cheese...still couldnt eat them.  The texture is just awful, sort of like chewing on cartilage.  I don't know what I am going to do with the extra bags.
