THIS TEA PACKAGE, (Lipton Black Tea, 100% Natural, Tea Bags, 48-Count Boxes, (package of 12) equalling a total of 576 tea-bags, SEEMED like a tremendous bargain!  I'd always enjoyed Lipton Tea growing up....  And, though I noticed another type of Lipton Tea was also on sale: Lipton "Yellow Label" Tea...slightly more expensive, but boasting itself to be "better tasting tea", I know I have always enjoyed and been perfectly satisfied with Plain, Regular Lipton Tea.  So, I decided that was what I would buy....<br /><br />"SO FAR, SO GOOD" DEPARTMENT<br />=============================<br />When I opened the package, I was delighted to find that each box was individually wrapped, to keep in the fragile tea flavour.  I had always used the 100-bag box at home, so getting used to this smaller box would, I realized, take a while...<br /><br />I was surprised to find that there was only a smallish picture of Thomas J. Lipton, 19th-century founder of the Lipton Tea Company, on the bottom-right of the package.  Inside, the tea-bags were lined up, just as before, in individual paper wrappers, which UNwrapped to provide, not only a tag, but the entire wrapper, to provide balance, and easily allow the tag not to fall in.  I noticed that, sadly, a picture of Thomas J. Lipton, heretofore proudly placed on each tea-bag wrapper, was no longer on each paper wrapper...  But this was a small matter....I supposed.  I prepared my tea, (I like 2 bags in a 20-ounce glass), and when the colour had reached the correct darkness to my taste, I took out the tea bag, added some sugar, and -- after a few minutes to let the brew cool off -- drank it.<br /><br />"WHAT IS THIS????..! " DEPARTMENT<br />==================================<br /><br />But when I drank it, I scarecely believed I was drinking tea at all!<br />Not Lipton Tea, as I remember it, anyway.  The slight flavour that did come through was bitter.  I was glad it wasn't stronger.  Adding sugar made it only slightly more palatable.  (I don't like milk IN my tea...if I must drink milk WITH my tea, I use a separate cup, nearby).  I remembered the "Yellow Label" Tea, and have come to a startling conclusion.  Is it possible, I wondered, that, instead of "Yellow Label" Lipton Tea being a newly-developed, superiour tasting tea, that "Yellow Label" tea is actually the reglar Lipton Tea I had grown up with, and that this "bargain" tea I had bought, was actually a newer, cheaper variety?  I don't know...I can only suppose....  (As the theme-song goes on the great TV show, 'MONK': "I could be wrong here...but I don't think so.")<br /><br />Going to Amazon to write this review, I noticed yet ANOTHER orange-pekoe variety of Lipton Tea.  The gourmet "Brisk" Lipton Tea,  It boasts that each bag has four brewing sides....but my much cheaper Lipton Tea, here being reviewed, ALSO has four brewing sides to each bag.  It's enough to make a person become tea-ed, (or rather, "keyed"), up.  And confused.  Which tea is the Lipton I grew up with?  If, indeed, Lipton now makes it's least expensive tea from formerly unused, inferiour tea leafs, it should label THIS (new????)<br />as its "Bargain Blend".  And the old, familiar tea, (now called "Yellow Label Tea"?), as the "Original Blend."  Then again, the Lipton's Tea I grew up with, always called itself "the Brisk" tea....as is now in the gourmet blend.  I guess I'm confused here.  Maybe the "blend-switching" hasn't taken place at all -- and it's just mu ageing taste-buds that are at fault?  A little truth in advertising is strongly requested, here!<br /><br />At any rate, after drinking 3 cups of tea, with two tea bags for eah cup, (or 20-ounce glass), I now have 570 tea bags left.  I won't throw them out....but will (sigh!), have to make them into tea. The tea is not unpalatable -- just largely tasteless, with a hint of bitterness thrown in.  I guess I'll just be drinking a LOT of tea, in the near future, so I can use up these 570 bags of tea up, before I buy the Yellow Label or "Brisk" varieties.  Had the tea been more properly labeled, ("Bargain Blend"), I might have paid a little more for the Lipton Tea I (think), I grew up with.  As it is....well, maybe I can make my spaghetti and vegetables healthier, by boiling them in tea, rather than in plain water.<br /><br />Sigh......
