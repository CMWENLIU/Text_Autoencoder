The only reason why my dog ate this is because it was a present from a friend.  I gave him a little piece and he threw up all of his food after 2 hours he had the treat. This is the first time this happens, that's why I decided to do a little research.  Like other reviewer mentioned any kind of onion product is really bad for dogs, also sugar, salt, BHA.  THE FACT THAT YOUR DOG LOVES IT AND THAT IT'S CHEAP doesn't mean it's any good; just google the name of the company and some of its products especially chicken jerky and you'll see what kind of garbage they produce.
