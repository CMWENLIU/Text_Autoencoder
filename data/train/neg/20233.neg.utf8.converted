The people saying, "these are the best chocolate truffles I've ever tasted" have obviously never tasted a real chocolate truffle.  These things, while they'll satisfy a sweet tooth, are NOT chocolate.  Search the box; you won't see the word "chocolate" anywhere.  They are made of vegetable oil flavored with some cocoa.  Try a Teuscher's Champagne Truffle, and then tell me if these vegetable oil balls are still "the best truffle".  Not even close.  Not even in the same universe as a real truffle.
