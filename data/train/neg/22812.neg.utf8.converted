I buy several of the Think Thin bar flavors - tried this one and found, to my dismay, that it has a pronouonced coconut flavor, which is okay if you like coconut.  Flavor is darker, but muddier, and ingredients list a fractionated palm kernel oil, which is not in the other bars I buy.  Would not purchase it again.
