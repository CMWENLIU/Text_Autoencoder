I was very excited to get some more Silver Needle Tea.  Their price was competitive but no cheap by any means.<br /><br />First complaint was the packaging the tea was packed in plastic bag and shipped with the second outer plastic bag.  Silver needle tea have beautiful fuzzy little delicate buds that should be handled with care, this was not the case.  However their handling was just a preview to the lack of quality, this tea company sells.<br />Review of the Tea.<br />Aroma: The aroma was weak when compared to other Silver needle tea I've had.<br />Appearance: there was lots of impurities. I will post a picture if I can figure out how. There were pieces of stems beyond the bud.  Piece of leaves of the were clearly not baby buds but of mature leaves.  Lots of brown colors there were pieces of leaves that were clearly not beautiful fuzzy little friends.  The buds that were there were more yellow than the delicate green.<br /><br />brew:  there was lots of debris/particulate in the first few brews.  the brew lacked delicate aroma and its color was off darker than I'm used to.  the flavor was more earthy than delicate reminding me of a strong cheap green tea. this tea also lacked exquisite sweat flavors/aromas that I so love about silver needle teas.<br /><br />on a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate this tea and 1.5 or 2.  For comparison I would rate my last batch of Rishi Organic Silver needle tea an 8.5.<br /><br />I am now stuck with 8 ounces of this very disappointing.  If you are a connoisseur of this absolutely wonderful type of tea save yourself disappointment and look elsewhere.
