For all the hype these Leonard Mountain dry soups have gotten, they sure did disappoint. I have made 6 varieties now (sitting here with a bowl of the Chicken Pasta as I type), and they were consistently bad...even though I followed the package directions EXACTLY. Maybe that was the problem - I followed the package directions. None were done in 20 minutes. ("edible" in 20 minutes - yes; worth paying xx dollars for it - no; worth calling it "gourmet" - no.) And one reviewer called the veggies "chunky" - really? Wonder what kind of soup they're used to if they think these soups are chunky.<br /><br />My advice: Lipton instant soup will give you just about the same salty, overseasoned experience as these Leonard Mountain mixes, but for a lot cheaper. Of course, Liption instant soup doesn't purport to call itself "gourmet" like LM does.<br /><br />My real advice: Want a "real" soup that REALLY only takes 20 minutes? Throw some stock (canned broth will work too) in a pot and let it boil, then toss in some fresh veggies (frozen if you want), pre-cooked meat (or raw shrimp), pasta if you want it, canned beans if you want them, and cook until the veggies are the way you like them. Season to taste with just salt and pepper, or add garlic and/or onion powder. Green herbs are great too if you know how to use them.<br /><br />If you're using a crockpot (which I do all the time), do the same thing except wait until the last 30 minutes to toss in the pre-cooked meat. You could also get away with dried beans in a crockpot.<br /><br />In any case, fresh soup only takes 20 minutes to begin with, so these LM soups aren't saving anyone any time.<br /><br />I will NEVER buy these again. EVER. If I need convenience, I'd rather buy canned soup than these.
