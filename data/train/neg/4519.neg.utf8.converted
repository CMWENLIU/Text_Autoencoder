I'm totally disapointed by HARIBO and by the american product - produced in Turkey. They called it original and its not, because they use the corn syrup in the Haribo for the Americans. I'm German living in the US and ordered it for my 2 year old daughter. But I'm totally disapointed. They dont use fructose or syrup made out of fruits. The corn syrup goes into the lever of our kids and turns into fet. Its a grazy thing what Haribo does and I throw all the Gummib&auml;rchen into the trash. Its not ORIGINAL Its against kids and its not a sweet in somehow a good way - its a sweet in a very bad american way where people are used for the experiements of food industry and there profit.
