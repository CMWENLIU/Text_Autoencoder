Followed the directions to a T.  In the fridge for a while for hibernation period.  Placed in front of a sunny window and kept the seeds moist.  Seeds were supposed to germinate in 30-45 days and there was nothing.  Finally threw it out.  Kept the small plastic greenhouse, so i could maybe try again, just need to get some more seeds.<br /><br />I received this a a gift.
