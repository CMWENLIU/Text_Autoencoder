Switched from Canidae Pure Grain-Free Formula because it caused an allergic reaction to Merrick Whole Earth Formula because it was rated so highly and was affordable for a graduate student.  Unfortunately, while the Canidae caused my dog to shed fur everywhere and lose patches of his fur, he immediately disliked Merrick and would refuse to eat it.  This is a dog that eats everything that you hand him, so I was initially surprised.  Then, I realized after observing him attempt to eat the food for about a week that he was eating it fast and throwing it back up.  I understand that dogs that eat fast will sometimes choke but this never occurred before with Canidae.  Then, after about a week of eating, choking, throwing it back up, and eating it again (gross, I know) he began to refuse to eat it altogether - missing meal times and sullenly looking at me for half the day until he was starving enough to eat a couple of bites.  After thinking about whether it would be spoiling him if I just shucked the entire bag I'd bought and try another brand, he tore me down when I noticed that he was losing weight, after having already experienced rampant allergic weight loss on Canidae.  So, I switched to another brand today and observed: he tore into that new brand of dog food like today was his last day on earth.<br /><br />So, to conclude: Merrick Whole Earth Farms Dry Food is really affordable and offers quality ingredients - although it is not grain-free, the merits of grain-free are still being contested by dog nutritionists and its expensiveness (in my opinion) is the same expense that individuals would pay at the onset of the Atkins fad - which are being given to the consumer at a good, affordable price.  It is really unbecoming of the dog food market in general that consumers are forced to pay unholy prices to feed their dogs something that isn't made out of processed chicken by-products so Merrick gets an extra star from me just because there are so few foods out there that challenge its affordability balanced with quality. Unfortunately, no matter how good the price is, if your dog won't eat it, its a waste.
