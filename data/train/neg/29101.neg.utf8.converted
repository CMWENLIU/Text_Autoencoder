If you want heat and don't give a damn what it tastes like, or plan to add it as a minor ingredient just to add heat, then this is your sauce. It is hotter than hell's kitchen. However if you plan to use it as a sauce, or want to add FLAVOR to your food, get something else. it is fowl tasting and bitter.
