I love the bars themselves and found them less expensive through Amazon so ecided to buy them.  I opened the first bar and notices the chocolate covering was whitish (signify the emulsifiers are breaking down) I bit into it it was nasty tasting like something that was very out of date and stale.  My best guess is improper storange with Amazon or during shipping extreme heat)  I did contact Amazon and they did refund my money on these (well let's see the next statement).  I never shopped for food on line so was a bit leary now more leary.
