Amazon Box contained multiple objects including this product in it's separate bubble wrap envelope<br /><br />The box arrived well packed and with no damage.  However, one jar of the Black Truffle Cream had the seal broken and the oil leaked all over inside of it's bubble wrapped package.<br /><br />Packaging aside, the truffle cream is bitter with no 'truffle' taste that I'm used to in truffle salt and oil.  I've bought truffle cheese and truffle aioli and both were great.  I love the truffle taste and this product just didn't deliver.
