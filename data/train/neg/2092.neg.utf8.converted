If you're reading this review, you probably remember (and loved) the Count Chocula cereal that they sold in the grocery stores back in the 1970s.  And you're probably annoyed at the way that it's no longer stocked on the shelves of your local grocery store.<br /><br />Well, buying this 21st century version of Count Chocula won't bring back the good old days.  This cereal doesn't look the same, it doesn't smell the same and it doesn't taste the same!<br /><br />I remember when I was a kid, opening up a box of Count Chocula and my nostrils would be treated to an overwhelming scent of chocolate goodness.<br /><br />Now, as an adult, I open up this NEW version of Count Chocula and there isn't any chocolate scent at all!!!<br /><br />And this cereal doesn't even LOOK the same!  The marshmallows look different and the crunchy part is coated with some sort of unfamiliar glaze.<br /><br />And the taste is all wrong too.  In the 1970s the cereal was MUCH sweeter!  They've obviously changed the recipe.<br /><br />And back in the 1970s, after eating the cereal the milk in your bowl would be all brown and taste like chocolate.  Basically the old Count Chocula would turn ordinary milk into chocolate milk. Now with this NEW version of Count Chocula, the milk stays white and it just tastes like ordinary milk!<br /><br />It's just not the same.  The thrill of the 1970s Count Chocula is gone.
