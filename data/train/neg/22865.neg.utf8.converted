its ok for curry paste, better then the average curry products available at most supermarkets, but i prefer hand brand curry paste, much better, a huge difference, much more flavorful, its all i use now, also as a side note these mae ploy containers are the small ones not the larger ones found in asian food markets. not a good value here.
