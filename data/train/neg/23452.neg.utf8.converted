Although I might not be a coffee connoisseur, I do know the difference between a smooth or bitter tasting cup of Kona coffee. This might be labeled Kona, I say that it has an awful bitter after taste for being Kona. I have gone back to one of the original Kona coffee listed under the Kona coffee counsel. It is comparable to the pricing of this coffee yet a much smoother taste that I like.<br /><br />As stated above, this coffee is "Not As Described"
