One of the three plants that makes Taste of the Wild in South Carolina has had some quality control issues. Two other brands made at the plant have been recalled for Salmonella. My dog happens to be very sick with Salmonella symptoms. I spent over $800 at the vet and he almost died.  Is it a coincidence that there is a Salmonella issue at the plant and my dog is very ill with similar symptoms? I'm not sure, but I don't trust them anymore.
