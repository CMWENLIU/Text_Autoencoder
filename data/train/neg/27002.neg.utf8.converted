Roast arrived to early for Christmas and with no instructions.  I telephoned pastacheese and was told it had to be frozen as it could not stay in fridge for the 8 days.  It was only wrapped in a saran like wrap.  For the price paid it should have been vacuum sealed and then could have been refridgerated for the time until Christmas.  After thawing and cooking it was no better than roasts I have purchased at local chain markets.  It turned out to be a very expensive disappointment!!
