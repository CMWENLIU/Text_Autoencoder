First of all, I got this because ginger is really good for the body and I love lemons. I am not ginger's biggest fan when it comes to taste so I was hoping that this product would be more balanced because of the lemon. I got the packet and it's easy to mix it into some water and it dissolves pretty well. I could not finish this drink at all. I think I only got half way before it got to be too much for me.<br /><br />The ginger taste is so strong that you really do not taste the lemon at all. There was maybe a tiny bit of lemon flavor but really it was just the ginger flavor. This is great if you are a huge ginger fan but it was definitely not for me and probably for anyone who is just so so on ginger, this will not be their cup of tea. Basically, you are just eating pure ginger.<br /><br />I let my husband have a taste and even he, who is a lot more into ginger than I am, thought it was a bit too much. This should be called instant ginger beverage mix instead of ginger & lemon beverage mix.
