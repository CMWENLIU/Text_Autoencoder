As you can see, I ordered a set of three boxes of these, happy for free shipping and a good price, which Amazon usually lacks on groceries... and how disappointed I was, not in Amazon but in Numi...<br /><br />I guess too many complained that the SMELL wasn't like other EGs, and they're right... it wasn't. Others spray alcohol-containing, leaf-wrecking oils on the leaves, leaving behind a horrible taste to me and also making the leaves oxidize rapidly, making the tea quality suck! Numi HAD it absolutely perfect. I was ready to tell you how to get, out of their tea, the perfect GENUINE Earl Grey tea, one where the tea wasn't killed by modern techniques of spraying chemicals (essential oils are almost all alcohol, after all; bergamot oil is almost always mixed with cheaper and easier to process citrus that grows far more places than a tiny town in Italy)... and now, I'm just here to say "move along, nothing here to see" because in changing their fruit supplier or aging/malting process or -something- (the tea leaves wouldn't likely vary so much, the brews side by side making the same color and the leaves being cut the same way and clearly the same region and process--yes, I'm one of THOSE tea drinkers, Steepster reviews and all), from the bags smelling like another brand, a rather costly one that starts with R and nearly rhymes with fishy, which has rather funky EG (that brand sprays the leaves, which Numi proclaims my shared disdain for)... well, what was--back when they had the boxes with the old man and his walking stick slumped in front of a cottage or whatnot--the first and only EG I would drink happily, a tea I went to specific 24/7 restaurants at 2am when needing food just because I could at least count on the tea... well, it's a passing memory, one I have about half a dozen more memories to treasure before parting ways with Numi, probably with an email expressing sadness.<br /><br />I DO overall recommend their teas: The lemon myrtle chamomile, now deceptively called lemon chamomile when it's the FLOWER not the fruit added to lovely organic chamomile, is hopefully still as wonderful, their Moroccan Mint is unsurpassed and the smoothest, sweetest mint imaginable, impossible to oversteep for that matter, able to handle a trio of steepings for that matter [whereas Stash uses PNW mint that is medicinal, which is honestly only good to make yogurt sauce or ... medicine!], and even for the ones like Golden Chai that aren't to MY liking, they're still well made, just not a blend I care for ingredient-wise...<br /><br />I simply can't recommend THIS Numi product anymore (and I hope as I use the last of my others this proves the ONLY one that got "revamped" somehow, the "how" seemingly the fruit, whether they are doing it faster or using different fruit or outsourcing the bergamot processing or... whatever they changed to make it a stinky-bagged, fruitless flavored, bitter chemical-aftertaste tea). I tasted the new just one night after a week of delighting in their original blend night after night, using my reliable method with precise timing and all, went away from it a full month, and in finding the last half box of the old, decided to compare them to be sure it wasn't simply me being thrown off. It's not. I don't deem it so unworthy that it can't be a pleasant change for the people who benefit from our brunch outreaches geared at homeless populations, and it'll probably be a welcome addition, but I will NOT be drinking the other 51 bags from this purchase myself, not when I have teas I genuinely love (as I did this, which was barely drinkable with a LOT of sugar that rendered it barely-even-tea anymore--before, it was best with a tiny bit of sugar and milk, but it was absolutely palatable with no additions).
