Saeco did not work at all straight out of the box. called customer service, Kenneth B , who offered immediate replacement. However after I mailed faulty machine back it took me a month of frustration, calls, emails, etc, until finally replacement was send. Stay away from Saeco if you can. If you bought it from Costco or Starbucks just take it back, instead of Saeco recommendation in the box: "do not take it back, call us ,blah, blah"
