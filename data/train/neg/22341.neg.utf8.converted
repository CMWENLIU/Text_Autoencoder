When I ordered Fisher scone mix I did not know the high fat content is hydrogenated oil.  Consequently I want to cancel my standing order of delivery of Fisher scone mix scheduled for every two months.<br />I will continue to order sticky Fingers scone mix because it has a low fat content which is not hydrogenated.  Can the ingredients of your food items listed for sale be displayed so that the customer can make an<br />informed judgement before ordering?  My rating of the Fisher scone mix is not relevant since I did not and may not use it  The Sticky Fingers scone mix is excellent and I give it a 5 star rating.
