Knowing I'd save a lot of money buying these chocolates online, I instantly went to Amazon to see if they sold it.<br /><br />The first time I ordered Rochers from Amazon, it was during summer.  When they arrived, the Rochers were all melted with chocolate dropping out of the foil wrappers. After throwing them in the freezer for a day to let them harden, the foil had been mixed into the chocolate..I either had to break off all the hazelnut chocolate, or eat the Rocher with bits of foil in it.<br /><br />The second time I purchased them for Valentine's Day.  The package looked fine..but when I bit into the first one, it was very stale tasting.  The inside fudge was crumbling apart, and the wafer was real flexible, like what happens to an ice cream cone after a few minutes of dripping ice cream has been absorbed into it.<br /><br />Even if the price is cheaper online, these two bad experiences have made me stay away from buying any food product online.
