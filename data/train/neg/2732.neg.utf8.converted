seller was not honest w dealing w shipping. USPS showed shipped tracking no. but never was sent. ITEM but still not receipt to AUNTIE birthday person. She even when to the post office in her town. She personally went to the post office 2 times and talked with post master. She was told it was held up. but it is actually not even sent.so AUNTIE kept telling us that she will stay home and when she wasn't she left a cooler outside her door cuz she lives in Florida in the Keys. She was very sad. i am sad for her. I will go down to the store myself and mail it out my self, but time has passed for her actual birthday 26 April.<br /><br />The seller did not want to have any negative comments written which i agreed but the April 30 delivery did not occur. and now it is Mid May and it was not sent, so i must tell people that we are unhappy. This item was expensive as it was.then with shipping  it was more than we wanted to spend but we knew she loved loved See's candy so it was worth it.
