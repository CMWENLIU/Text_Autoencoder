I have had Pad Thai before...And always liked it quite a bit. This kind, to me, is pretty disgusting. It's nothing like any of it I've had before. The noodles are weird and really short and the broth they're in is gross. Although I really love some of the other Dr McDougall's products,  I would not recommend this one :(
