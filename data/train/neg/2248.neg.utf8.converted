I regularly buy the flavor variety pack in the grocery store because that's all they carry. I logged on to trusty ol' Amazon to see if I could order just cinnamon or just banana bread. They're way more expensive than this flavor, and here's why: this is the worst one. It smells fine, at first, like pancake syrup, but then you realize that you can smell it for days after you've cooked it. Seriously. My husband asked me last Saturday if I was making something for breakfast, and when I told him no, he looked at me strangely. Later he told me that he thought I had cooked myself some breakfast and didn't want to share! The smell was from this flavored oatmeal I had made on WEDNESDAY. Even just picking it up while shuffling through and looking for a cinnamon packet can cause the smell to linger on your hands for hours. The taste is pretty strong, too...it's not necessarily bad, it's just overpowering. Like I said, it smells like pancake syrup, and that's pretty much what it tastes like--really sweet syrup. I would advise you go out and buy one variety box at the store before committing yourself to 4 whole boxes of syrupy sweetness.
