I used to be a big fan of Thai Kitchen's green curry paste and coconut milk. Now the curry paste has lost all its fire and the coconut milk is thinner in consistency and flavorless. Bummer, as it's hard to find quality products (of any kind) these days. Interesting note?--Thai Kitchen was recently acquired by another, larger company. Looks like the "recipes" have changed. As will mine.
