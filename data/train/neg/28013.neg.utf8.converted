My wife and I have had a SodaStream for about a year now. It hasn't changed our lives, but we like it.<br /><br />Some flavors are excellent, most are passable (think generic soda), and a few aren't so good.<br /><br />But this Cherry Cola flavor, oh my goodness, it is AWFUL.<br /><br />If I had to describe it, it's kind of a mediciney black licorice. Just terrible. They need to abandon this flavor, because if this were the first flavor I'd sampled, I'd immediately walk away from the SodaStream display.
