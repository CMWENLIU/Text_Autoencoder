While I am well aware that Cadbury does make some excellent products, the Curly Wurly's are not one of them. These candy bars are NOTHING like the original Marathon Bar's from the 1970's, except in appearance. The chocolate coating is much to thin on the Curly Wurly's compared to the original Marathon Bar's and the caramel has a distinct buttery taste which the Marathon Bar did not. The Curly Wurly's  are ok if your just looking for a chocolate candy bar with a different taste, but I personally will not ever buy them again.
