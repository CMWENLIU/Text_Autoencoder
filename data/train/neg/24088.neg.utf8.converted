I was pleased to be able to keep these on hand for baking and other cooking purposes so I subscribed to them monthly. I am aware that the cost of food items has gone up recently but I was shocked to see that they had gone from 26.00 the first month to 53.00 the second month. Needless to say I stopped my subscription after they were sent automatically (per my request of course) but I did not notice the price raise until after I had received them. Product is fair but way way to pricey now for the results.
