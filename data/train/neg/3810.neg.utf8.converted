I just went through my 4th bag. Make sure theses all organic prunes as it states here. No preservatives. I had 2 bags that said under Ingredients: prunes, potassium sorbate as a preservative. I can't have potassium sorbate and that is why I purchase these. Be careful on what you will receive in the mail. I would check all bags under INGREDIENTS: Organic prunes and NOT Prunes, Potassium as a preservative. You will see the difference in the prunes as the organic prunes are more mushy and the postasium sorbate are intact and not mushy. If you ever had dried prunes that are preserved you will notice the difference in textured.
