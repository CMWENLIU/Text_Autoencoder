If the price for a 3-pack remains at $39.99 + $12 shipping, DO NOT PURCHASE!!! If you go to Spice Place, the same price gets you DOUBLE the amount ($13.43/16 oz)!! I trust that Amazon shoppers are discerning consumers so I feel a duty to point that this pricing is a ripoff and that you can find better.<br /><br />Apart from that, I love the mix. A tasty way to prepare it is by mixing it with just light whipping cream, maybe a little sour cream to thicken.
