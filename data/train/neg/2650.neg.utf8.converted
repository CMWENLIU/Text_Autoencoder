At first, I thought this coffee just had an mild "earthy" flavor, but now I recognize it as being mildly stale! This has happened to me once before when ordering from Amazon and I have read other reviews indicating that they experienced the same with other brands. From now on, I will either get my coffee directly from the company itself or check for brewing dates (should be within 1 week at the most) when buying from local roasters.
