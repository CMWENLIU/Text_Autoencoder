Clearly I need to brush up on my math skills. I ordered the Riceworks brown rice crisps assuming the $17.95 price was reflective of a bulk purchase - because who in their right mind would pay $17.95 for ONE BAG OF CHIPS. But - sadly - no, the $17.95 was reflective of one 16oz bag of chips. No, really - it is/was. To add to this purchasing disaster, the chips were completely crushed resulting in a price average of .10/chip crumb. It's *almost* funny.
