My experiance with this company has been nothing but bad. Placed the order on the 3rd, arrived on the 16th. Bought this product with aticipation of taste and quality but the smell of the tea and the taste(even when washed) was utterly disgusting, making lipton tea seem desirable. I highly discourage buying this item or from this company if you enjoy quality loose leaf tea. If you are just getting into it loose tea and want to try some thing different or want to use these are decoration, then these may suit you.
