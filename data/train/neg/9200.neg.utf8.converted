Its not a real K cup.<br /><br />There is no way to store them except in a air tight container or ziplock bag, also when you get to the bottom of your coffee cup there is alot of sediment and grounds,its really gross.<br /><br />I would stick the real K Cups and skip this.Remember amazon does not offer refunds on this either since its a grocery item.
