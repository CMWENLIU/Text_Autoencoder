The only way you can go wrong with these peas is if you pay the price listed at the time I write this review - $24.53 a can?????!!!!<br /><br />There's better ways to blow money.  You can pick these up at practically any major grocery store for less than $2.00 (easily).<br /><br />Why is the price $24.53?  I can understand making a profit, but a retirement off of peas????<br /><br />Crazy
