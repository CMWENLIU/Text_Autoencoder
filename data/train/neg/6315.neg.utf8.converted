Every single can of Jyoti Natural Foods Delhi Saag, Spinach and Mustard Greens was dented. At first I thought it was just because they were poorly packed, but I realize that Amazon sent me a box of pre-dented cans, since the interior box was not sealed as most bulk orders from Jyoti are, and other items in my shipment were not damaged. Amazon, this is the way you lose customers!
