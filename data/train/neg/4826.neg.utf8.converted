You get what you pay for.  This jerky was crumbly and overly seasoned with MSG.  Papaya extract is used to soften the meat, but is over used in this jerky.  The result is a crumby texture that does not hold together when chewed.  It was not disgusting, but I would not buy it again.  Try their one pound bags instead.
