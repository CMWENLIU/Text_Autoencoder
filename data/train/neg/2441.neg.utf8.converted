Honestly, I feel terrible writing this review because I searched and searched for an alcohol-free, liquid vanilla in a larger amount and really wanted to LOVE this product!  I bought this product specifically because I live abroad and needed a larger bottle and they offer this in 16 and 32 ounces.<br /><br />This product is very thick and tastes very strongly of chemicals.  I could barely get any vanilla flavor from it - and it makes my icings and frostings taste horrid.  The propylene glycol (not safe) just makes the product taste terrible.  It's listed as the second to last ingredient - but really - it just takes over any vanilla in the bottle.  And it comes out like glue into the measuring spoon and sticks!  Really a disappointment.
