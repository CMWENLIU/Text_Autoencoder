My mom bought into this product and went through bottles and bottles, at a lot of expense.  As far as she (or we) could tell, it did not improve her health in any way.  Conceivably if it was only a few dollars a bottle, it may give some noticeable boost (although we did not experience that), but it is NOT worth this huge amount of money people are being roped into paying.  Also, Mom didn't seem to mind the taste, but I tried it once, and honestly, it tasted so bad that I probably couldn't make myself drink a dose every day anyway.
