I miss read before I ordered, got 2 very small tins of oil.  Later realized that there is a 2 LITER pack for nearly the same price.  So I'm going to say this particular version of the product is overpriced.  Especially for a tin can, I have used this packaging for olive oil before and you tend to lose that last serving or so in the lip of the tin.  Drives me crazy!  For this reason, I'm 2 starring it, and am going to make sure to check my ounces before I send in a future order.
