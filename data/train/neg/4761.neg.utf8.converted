It is as yummy and nutritious as all the other reviews claim. You don't have to like Indian food to like this product and it does remind me of a good chile.<br />Regular price at Stop & Shop is $3.69. I thought that was expensive so I decided to look for it online. The price on Amazon and other online retailers is so ridiculously expensive that I'm going back to the supermarket to stock up just in case they priced it wrong.
