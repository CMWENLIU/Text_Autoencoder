If you're looking for a Campbell's cream of mushroom soup substitute, this isn't it. It doesn't have the milky-creamy consistency of Campbell's. It has a sour taste, from the cultured cream and whey. The broth is transparent. The pieces of mushroom are bigger. It's really nothing like Campbell's in taste or appearance. It's definitely much, much healthier, but I don't like the taste or texture and won't be buying it again. I'll be making my own cream of mushroom soup from now on.
