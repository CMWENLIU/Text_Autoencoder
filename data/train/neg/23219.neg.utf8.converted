I have purchased Yogi tea for years now.  This tea is fine, but I was disappointed by the slight misinformation.  I'm not sure why they simply call this tea "Ginger" at least on the front of the package.  I am now paying much more attention to the actual ingredients of Yogi teas because this has 4 other ingredients of which 3 are in greater amount in this one.  I just wanted plain ginger tea and this has licorice, lemongrass, peppermint & black pepper.  Black pepper & licorice are very strong flavors especially if you aren't aware they are steeping in your cup.  It's a fine tea, yet holds a misleading title.  That's all.  Thank you.
