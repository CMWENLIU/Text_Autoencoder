it is gatorade, what can you say ? but it is in heavy cans and when I ordered it from amazon they 3rd-partied it and the shipper put 6 big cans in a flimy box with zero protection and zero padding. when it arrived 4 of 6 cans were split and spilling dry gatorade. I had to go and buy a huge plastic tub to pour all the<br />gatorade in before it humidified into a solid green brick. extremely dissatisfied. would NOT buy again from amazon.
