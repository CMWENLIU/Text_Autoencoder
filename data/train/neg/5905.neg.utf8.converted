For many years, Big Red and Denteyne were my favorite chewing gums.  Both had a wonderfully clean taste that helped to cover up onion and/or garlic breath.  However, I noticed an unpleasant bitter taste to the Big Red gum. Every time I chewed it, I got a bad headache. If I had more than one stick, I became dizzy. I actually fell one time. Trying to understand the reason for my falling and dizziness,  I looked at the ingredients  on the packaging of everything I was eating. Much to my surprise, there was a change in the Big Red ingredients and this gum now contains ASPARTAME.  It took me a while to put together the bitter taste with the gum.  I do not consume ASPARTAME.  I'm now trying to find a gum with real cane sugar and/or stevia.  I cannot find a single one? For more information about Aspartame, Google its side effects on the Internet. You may be surprised.
