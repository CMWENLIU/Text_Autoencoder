I understand that the description says "Due to availability some flavors may be substituted without prior notice" so I can't be too mad, but its a bit ridiculous when you buy a 22-pack tea "sampler" and you only get 7 differnt types of tea. I received 5 Green Tea, 5 Sleepytime Herbal Tea, 4 English Breakfast Black Tea...you get the picture. Definitely go with a different sampler.
