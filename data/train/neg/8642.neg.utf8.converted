While these are good, high quality nuts, the price listed here on Amazon is over twice what they sell for at the Target store.  What's going on with that?  When I saw the price, I figured it was a double package, but apparently it's not.  Amazon, are you seriously asking $25 for less than two pounds of nuts?
