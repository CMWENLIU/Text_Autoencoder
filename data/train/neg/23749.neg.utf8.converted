My fiance gave our dog this busy bone yesterday evening, and today our dog has been horribly sick! He keeps throwing up big hard pieces of the bone and had a hard time breathing a few times when pieces were getting stuck in his throat on the way out. HORRIBLE product, and very dangerous. I can't believe Purina can sell these with a clear conscious.
