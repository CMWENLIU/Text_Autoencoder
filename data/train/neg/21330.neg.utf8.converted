All you need to do is read the ingredients, and the review writes itself.  First ingredient: chicken meal (lower quality "rendered" chicken), next three ingredients: rice, corn, corn.  So in other words, this cat food is mainly made from mostly grain and some lower quality meat.  You don't find the ingredient "chicken" until the 7th ingredient.  C'mon people, you are smarter than to fall for that.  Compare that to any of the legit brands like Wellness, Buffalo Blue, Eukanuba etc., that have meat as the *first* ingredient and far less grain.
