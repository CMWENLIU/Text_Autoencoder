Carnivore Kisses by Stella and Chewy's<br />Link: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JFZLZ8">Stella & Chewy's Carnivore Kisses, Freeze-Dried Chicken Breast Dog Treats</a><br /><br />Inside the pieces, "kisses", are the tendons or ligaments (my best guess)from the chicken breast that are still attached. You cannot see them because they are within the kiss. These are chunks that are not ground up like their terrific bags of "freeze-dried safe raw food". When I broke the kisses apart for my 5 lb dog, there were pieces of these tendons/ligaments that were hard, some long and one of them actually sharp. I believe it could have easily pierced or choked my dog! If you break them apart, it will be fine, but under no circumstances, in my opinion, should these be fed to a smaller dog who could suffer some severe consequences from the contents of these "kisses"!
