The Jar is square and has convenient narrowing of the back side to allow a grip on it. But this makes it difficult to get the spread out of the corners of the jar and impossible to get the spread out of the lower corners. Kraft should supply a special spreading tool with each jar, I have nothing in my kitchen that does the job.<br /><br />This kind of jar is great for nuts and candies, but not a spreadable.
