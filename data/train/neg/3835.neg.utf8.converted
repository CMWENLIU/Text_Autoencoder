Having bought loose flavored teas a few years ago I  was glad to have at first seen a seller that was giving these flavored teas on Amazon,  but while the aroma smells nice there is hardly to no taste to any of the teas.  When you get the teas it says to add a Tsp for every 6oz but you almost have to triple that amount to get any kind of distinction of taste from the teas,  the only one at all that has any taste for the amount directed is the mint tea which with its powerful aroma is no surprise.  All I can say is this isn't worth the price try another seller or just stay with the teas you like now,  because even for Amazon prime members who can get the free two day shipping $25.00 dollars for this poor level of quality tea is not worth wasting your money on.  Now that I know better the one thing I regret is not being able to get my money back for this poor choice of selection....
