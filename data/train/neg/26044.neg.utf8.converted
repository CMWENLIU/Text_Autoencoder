I didn't expect to receive the exact mix that is pictured, but I assumed that it would be representative of what we'd received. We received 4 flavored coffees (2 each of Golden French Toast and Pumpkin Spice). The other 20 coffees were a variety of blends, but not what I consider "flavored" coffees (Columbian, Nantucket Blend, Caribou Blend, Folgers Lively Columbian).<br /><br />So if you are looking for flavored coffees, I don't suggest this item!<br /><br />After re-reading the product description that says "This variety sampler includes only flavored caffeinated coffee.", I got even more annoyed. My package included only 4 flavored coffees and it also included decaf! So I decided to return the item - then learned that it was non-returnable. I followed the links to correspond with customer service, and after a few minutes of chatting with someone, they said that they'd refund my money. Doesn't sound like a standard policy - but I'm glad that amazon.com stands behind their website.<br /><br />JoAn
