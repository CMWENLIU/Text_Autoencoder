These cashews are awful...no, wait, awful isn't strong enough word.  Disgusting, yep, that's it.  They're disgusting.  Eating these cashews is like going to your cupboard, grabbing a container of onion salt, and eating a spoonful of it.  If that is appealing to you, then buy these cashews.  Remember to give your significant other a sloppy wet onion kiss when you're done.
