WARNING:  HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP in this product.  While the description of this item from every Amazon seller states "No high fructose corn syrup..." the label on the jar lists high fructose corn syrup as the fourth ingredient; in fact, as the only sweetener used in this product.  I do not necessarily blame the sellers because Kraft announced it was going to eliminate HFC from their products but did not make good on that promise.  Too bad.  I remember 'way back when I could rely on Kraft for decent, wholesome food, and I thought the company was perhaps returning to that model. Silly me!  Into the trash with this.
