I bought this new Zico water hoping to have the good taste it had before but unfortunately it tastes horrible. I could not bear drinking half bottle. Very funky taste. I am from Brazil and I sure know what young coconut water tastes like...and what they did to the taste of it is nowhere close to real coconut water. Perhaps works for those who like aged coconut water.<br />I wish I could return my order. Never buying it again. Back to O.N.E.
