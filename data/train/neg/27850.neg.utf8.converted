I bought a ton of this stuff, not realizing that it is 1960's style FREEZE DRIED crystals. It was so awful, it actually upset my stomache and I am just going to heave the rest into the garbage where it belongs. Make sure you understand what it is you are buying. Spend a little more and get something you can enjoy!
