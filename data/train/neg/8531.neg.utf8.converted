These are just the right size for our two Boston Terriers.  They love the flavors of all the Itty Bitty Buddy Biscuits.  We use them as treats during training and they have been very effective.<br /><br />Just recently ordered the Sweet Potato flavor.  Dogs love them.  (What don't dogs love to eat?)  But, this product crumbles on its own, leaving the cookie container full of small pieces.  This is not true of the other flavors.  So, we will stick with the Itty Bitty product but never again order the Sweet Potato flavor.
