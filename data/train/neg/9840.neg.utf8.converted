Yes, this product can give you cancer, but so can toothpaste and a lot of other things we take for granted. You're gonna die some day from something, so if you really like this gum, why not, right? It's probably safer than smoking cigarettes.<br /><br />"Titanium dioxide dust, when inhaled, has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen possibly carcinogenic to humans." -- Wikipedia.<br /><br />Of course, Xyloburst is by no means the only gum with titanium dioxide. Spry has it too, and so do a lot of other brands, with the notable exception of xylichew, which does not. So if cancer isn't your thing, then buy Xylichew. For my part I have noticed that I cough a lot more after chewing a lot of gum, probably because of all the titanium dioxide dust that gets stirred up by chewing. What is the titanium dioxide for? Why, color. The manufacturer has determined in his infinite wisdom that our brains will explode if we see a piece of gum that is not perfectly white. So he put a carcinogen in a purported "health food" product, making fools out of all the trendy folks that pay a premium for a one-way ticket to the cancer clinic.<br /><br />I give three stars, because I really did like the texture, flavor and the fact xylitol was used instead of sorbitol. I think Xyloburst is pretty close to being worth a try, just not there yet. The cancer thing is kind of a buzzkill, you know?
