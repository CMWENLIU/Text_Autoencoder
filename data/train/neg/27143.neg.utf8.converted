This is WAYYYYY too expensive at $1.84 per bar. Yes, Bounty bars are the ultimate chocolate and coconut experience (especially the Dark variety) but this price is outlandish. A more resonable price would be $4.29 which represents a 20% discount from what you might pay at your local supermarket and which you don't have to wait for DAYS to receive. C'mon you british clowns, Americans are not as stupid as you think.
