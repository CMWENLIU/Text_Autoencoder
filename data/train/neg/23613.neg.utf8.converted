I was really excited to find these-- I lived in India and this was a staple at my school. Really great in curry. They truly are delicious and meaty, plus I've never seen them in the United States. The price was right (2.39 for a 1-lb bag). I put 5 bags in my cart, went to check out, and was shocked to find that the shipping cost over $15. Really? More than $3 a bag???? What a rip off!!!!! I can't believe that nobody else mentioned this in their review. I'm going to call the company and find out what the deal is, and if it's a different story, I'll update.
