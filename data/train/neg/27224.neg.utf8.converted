Unfortunately, after years of looking for a replacement, for Snow's Fish Chowder...I was very disappointed when I received this.  I have ordered other products that were "Fish Chowder" only to find they used fish, other than Haddock in their chowder.  When I found this, I was thrilled to find it.  If you want Fish Chowder that has Haddock in it, don't order this item.  When you receive it, it is Look's Atlantic brand Premium FISH CHOWDER, not HADDOCK CHOWDER.<br /><br />I bought this based on the label saying Haddock, and the other reviewer talking about how much Haddock it had in it.  I was disappointed to find it has Alaskan Pollack in it instead of Haddock.  Believe me it doesn't taste the same.<br /><br />If you do buy this product...be warned, you cannot return it.  For some reason, Amazon.com will not allow this to be returned, even though it is shipped from and sold by Amazon.com.
