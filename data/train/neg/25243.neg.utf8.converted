The tortuga rum cakes are the most delicious cakes I've had, but was disgusted with what amazon delivered. I don't know if it was old stock, but the cakes had been robbed of their moistness. Cannot express my disappointment and shame, since they were gifts to my friends. Amazon should be careful when it comes to food to ensure its fresh.
