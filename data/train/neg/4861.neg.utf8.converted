I purchased these chips on October 18, 2010.  They were rancid/stale so you can certainly believe the other reviewers.  I had not noticed the reviews about the horrible taste and staleness of these chips.  I wish I had.  I contacted customer service for a refund which they approved but I think Amazon should either stop selling these chips due to such poor reviews or check their stock to make sure they are FRESH. If you order, you should order with caution.  I am trying another brand instead of reordering these.
