One of my dogs (8 lbs)was able to remove the treat disc from the ball and promptly made a huge icky mess on their futon:(  The other pup (3.75 lbs) isn't as agressive a chewer, so it's fine for her.  I just have to figure out how to give it to the little one without the big one stealing it from her, lol!
