I decided to buy a packet of these to try because they are way easier to get than the actual berries, and a bit cheaper too.  So mistakenly, I ordered the double pack, 2 packages for 30 bucks.  TOTAL waste of money.  Ive tried real berries once about 4 years ago, and they were pretty good.  Granted, this isn't going to change your entire life perspective on food or anything, but some stuff does noticeably change, like lemons, grapefruit, beer, vinegar, etc...<br /><br />Now skip ahead to last week. We got the packages of MBerry's, and they came decently quick (I think it took like 8 days?), so no complaints there.  I opened the one package, and decided read the product description and such to make sure we did the tablets right.  The sellers/manufacturers recommend eating a 1/2 to 1 tablet, and mention that you can eat a 1/2 and get the same effects for less time.  BULL!  We all took one tab, let it fully dissolve on our tongues, being pretty particular about letting them sit and the saliva being swooshed around..you know the whole 9 yards to make sure we got max bang for our buck.  THEY SUCKED.  After about 15 mins we started trying foods, and even the things like lemons, grapefruit, etc.. that work with normal berries felt like they were working at HALF strength!  I could definitely tell the lemons were a little sweet, but they were also still tart!  And this wasn't just me, similar if not worse effects reported by 5 other people!!!<br /><br />Overall, I was really disappointed with these tablets.  Total waste of money, especially now that im stuck with an extra box as well.  Do yourself a favor and either A) Try another brand, or B) Get the read deal.  Hopefully Ill be able to sell my unopened package on ebay or craigslist....or to any of you!  So if your really set on a package, email me ill sell it to you for less than listed for sure! =)<br /><br />Hopefully someone benefits from knowing ahead of time, because i was also under false impression from the amount of glowing reviews, which all turned out to be PHONY.  WATCH OUT AND SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT WORKS!!!
