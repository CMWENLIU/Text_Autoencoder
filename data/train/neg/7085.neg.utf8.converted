When reading the label in the store, I discovered that this contains sulfite, a preservative that can cause serious allergic reactions in some people.  I only get migraines from it. It is listed as an ingredient on the McCormik website.<br />Why isn't it listed on the Amazon site? Are there other products with an incomplete ingredient list?  It would be wise to check the manufacturers website before you buy.
