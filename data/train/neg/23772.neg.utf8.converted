After buying 12 boxes of this to save money over the Annie's Organic M&C we usually purchase, I have learned the hard way WHY this is sold under private label by Annie's and WHY it is cheaper.  These questions are raised on this site by other reviewers, and I certainly do wish someone had previously addressed the matter herewith so I could have saved myself the purchase cost of this x12.<br /><br />This Simply Organic M&C contains a lesser-grade pasta and less actual cheese than Annie's.  As a result, to achieve palatable texture and flavor by mainstream standards, Simply Organic adds starch and whey, not to mention SUGAR!  Yes that's right, I said SUGAR!  I cannot believe any responsible organic manufacturer would put sugar in macaroni and cheese.  Nor can I believe that any responsible parent would wittingly or willingly feed sugar to their children via yet another unnecessary source.  Nevertheless, sugar is the second ingredient, and I would guess [hope] that most buyers are merely unsuspecting and unaware.<br /><br />As a holistic mother whose one compromise in our completely organic lifestyle is occasional macaroni and cheese from a box (because we home school our children and manage a large property including five kinds of fruits plus a variety of vegetables and animals, and there are hectic days when dinner simply gets "pushed to the back burner" - pun intended!), I would not dream of feeding this to my children.  If you have strong convictions about what the growing bodies and brains in your family ingest, then you will want to steer clear of this.<br /><br />If this is not enough to convince you, then allow me to cite a real life experiment.  My husband is an engineer who dabbles in new product development and cannot let anything go untested; as such, we made one box to sample.  Since he is an ardent cheese lover, I fully expected him to recoil from the sickengly sweet taste, which he did.  However, I am notorious among my family and friends for having a mad sweet tooth (e.g., I eat icing and leave the cake behind).  Yet despite my love of all things sugary, this was a complete turn off for me.  When I want sugar, I want sugar.  And when I want cheddar, I want cheddar.  In my humble opinion, in this case more than ever, it should be as the old saying states: "never the twain shall meet."<br /><br />Sugary sweet cheddar?  It's just not right.<br /><br />Feeding sugar to children hidden in macaroni and cheese?  It's just plain wrong.<br /><br />Simply put: Simply Organic is not worthy of our patronage.<br /><br />Eat healthy and be well in your journey.... ;)
