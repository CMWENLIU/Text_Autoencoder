Never really had a problem purchasing k cups, However, I decided I wanted more of a variety, so I went with this product. My wife and I were extremelyl disappointed to say the least. 3/4 of the k cups were different kinds of decaf coffee. I don't know about the rest of you, but I mostly drink coffee as a wake me up in the morning, not for the taste. (which I find bland). Decaf flavors should be sprinkled in here or there, not dominate the entire package.
