Ghirardelli had been my standby for Xmas candy-making since it was the ONLY brand left I could find in my town that made ACTUAL white chocolate chips, but they, like everyone else, seem to think that no one will notice the difference if they take out the actual, y'know, chocolate part.<br /><br />Well, guess what, WE NOTICED! It is absolutely ridiculous that you're pretending to be a step up in luxury from the cheap-o Hersheys and Nestles of the world, and yet you're putting out this sub-standard crap - it's the same thing the rest of them are selling! It is also absolutely ridiculous that there are NO REAL WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIPS ANYWHERE in the city of Greenville, NC!<br /><br />Please give us back the white chocolate! This imitation crap doesn't taste as good and is much harder to melt properly! We are willing to pay more if you will JUST GIVE US THE OPTION!
