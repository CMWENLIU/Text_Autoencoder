Taste was disappointing and unappealing. Perhaps having enjoyed so many authentic and freshly prepared meals (we cook a lot of Indian dishes and use fresh spices) both at home and in restaurants, I had higher expectations than other reviewers. Would definitely NOT recommend.<br /><br />The paste was hard to mix (so that the chicken was coated evenly) and the "Sauce" consistency was runny. (And I used even less water than suggested.)<br /><br />You'd be better off with one of the many sauces in a jar (if you can stand all the salt), if you can't make fresh.<br /><br />It's too easy to just create your own sauce from scratch. Better flavor, which is the bottom line.
