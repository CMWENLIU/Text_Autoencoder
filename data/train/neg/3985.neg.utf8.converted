We had a problem with a lot of fruit flies in our kitchen.  I picked up one of these to take care of business despite spotty reviews.  Oops.<br /><br />We had it up for several days and I saw one fly land on it the entire time.  The best part of this tragic story is that when I picked up the trap to investigate the one trapped fly...I'l be darned if that fly didn't pick up his feet and take off. That's right, the fly flew away after landing on this.  None of the other flies in the area even bothered.<br /><br />They should call this the "sucker" trap.  The sucker in this case would be me.  Save your money and invest in quicker hand reflexes.
