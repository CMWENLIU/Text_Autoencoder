Yup, it's blue food coloring! Make sure you scroll all the way down.<br />It is only a 1oz bottle and does not weight 6.4oz to mail. Yes, I thought I was getting a deal for 6.4oz of the stuff. Stupid me! There are many other brands less expensive than $4.21/ounce. The Confectionary House has a ZERO return policy, so be sure it is what you want!
