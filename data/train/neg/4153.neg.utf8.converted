A real waste of $$$ - Don't know what I was expecting...the product's own PR only makes vague claims for renewed health after drinking this over 2 days.<br />Didn't bring about any sort of "cleanse" (as in colonic) for me; don't feel any better (or worse); bloating not reduced; energy level still low.<br />Does, indeed, taste horrible but I actually got used to it - it was only for 2 days! Very bitter with a sort of stale oil smell/taste, which might be from the acai since the fluid contains no oil products.<br />The only Maybe Possible good thing is that it keeps you on a schedule, making you very aware of when you're supposed to drink your "cocktail" and what you may have eaten since the last drink...subconciously keeps you a bit more honest on your diet??<br />It didn't harm me, didn't give me gas or headaches, didn't interrupt my sleep or make me jittery - but the same could be said for a lot of low-cal food items (H2O, anyone?).<br />Stick to Vitaminwaters, Lean Cuisines and more exercise!
