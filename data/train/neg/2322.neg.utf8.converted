This does not look like the picture.  Buyer Beware!  I have had the $10 plant for 3 months.  Not worth the money.  It was half dead when I got it, and the company said I could pay to return it to them, and would have to have it packaged in a certain way.  Cost more to ship back.  I kept it and I am still not happy.  I bought a few plant from them.  I have a green thumb and love house plants, but these were not worth it.
