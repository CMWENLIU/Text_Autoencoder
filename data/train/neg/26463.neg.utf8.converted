I carefully researched "natural" brands of cat food and decided Newman's had the best ingredient list of all the competitors out there. They didn't have questionable ingredients like Wysong, and some other "natural" companies that I would never buy. I was happy to find an organic cat food and began switching my cats over from a high quality, but not organic, commercial cat food. All of my cats except one seemed to prefer the taste of the Newman's, while the one cat tried to refuse it. So, no real problems there. However, like some other people have mentioned, my cats began to throw up. A lot.<br /><br />I am very concerned about the digestibility of this cat food. My cats are not throwing up hairballs - they are throwing up the food which looks like it hardly broke down, if at all, in their digestive track.<br /><br />Also, you have to feed larger quantities of Newman's to get the same amount of vitamins to your cat that are supplied in smaller servings of brands like Iams. So, don't compare this to another brand pound-for-pound.<br /><br />I have never tried the Newman's canned cat food, but perhaps cats would have an easier time keeping it down.<br /><br />I was very careful in switching my cats over to a new brand, which shouldn't be a health issue if the brand truly IS "high quality," so I have grave concerns about this dry cat food. I was really hoping I had found an organic brand that my cats would eat for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />My cats have never had problems like this before (they are all around 4-years-old) and I feel horrible that I made them sick by trying to give them what I thought would be a healthier food.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this dry food to anyone.
