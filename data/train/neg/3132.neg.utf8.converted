This is bad tuna, can't say it any better.  It's flavor and smell tend to be very strong, not what you expect from the top of the line tuna they make.  The chunk light they make is slightly better.  1 in 4 cans actually are solid albacore, the other 3 are made up of mush, I can't even call it chunk style.  I don't eat tuna in salads or sandwiches, I eat it out of the can.  When I buy solid albacore, I expect that, this brand can't be trusted to give quality time after time.  DON'T BUY.
