I have no idea who is submitting the 5* reviews here, but they lost their taste buds years ago.<br /><br />This stuff tastes nothing like salt.  It has a horrible bitter after-taste that lingers in your mouth ruining anything it touches.<br /><br />Try it at a restaurant or something before buying it.  It even nauseates in cooking or in recipes requiring any significant amount of salt.<br /><br />If you are on a salt free diet, find something else.  Yuk!  With a capital Yuk!!<br /><br />=============UPDATE=====================<br /><br />I have found one use for this.  In cooking, with tomato sauce, if you mix it with real salt, you need much less salt.  The tomato sauce appears to nullify the bitterness somehow.  So, if you like pasta with sauce but have to cut down on salt intake, perhaps this is the answer for that.<br /><br />But it is NO salt shaker for the table.
