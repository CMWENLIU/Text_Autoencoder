If you regularly buy these chips, you would be like me and say, "that's a great deal!"  These chips are not cheap at the stores, but they are fresh.  The expiration date is not past when you receive your big box... but for some reason they are not fresh, and the salt on the chips is all at the bottom.  I kept thinking that it was "just that one bag..." but it was all of them.  I had eaten too many of them to send them back.  Do not buy this product from Amazon- but... my shipment may be the unlucky one that was stale- although i read several other reviews sharing my opinion... and i did not believe!
