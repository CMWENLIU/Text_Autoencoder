I recently created a candy buffet for 150+ people for a work event, and 2 items went over extremely poorly.  This was, by far, the worst.  The colors for the candy buffet were red, white, and blue - and these appeared to be white in the picture.  Unfortunately, they were not even close to white.  They were a sickly looking yellowish color instead.<br /><br />Because I didn't have a lot of time and I needed every item I had ordered, I went ahead and put these out (I stuck them in back behind some other stuff).  People still managed to find them, pick them up with disgusted looks, and laugh as they yelled things like "Who brought the rancid licorice??" and, "What the #*$ is this??"  It was an after-hours party, as you can probably guess :)<br /><br />The worst part is that the candy was extremely oily, and even at room temperature, it seemed to "sweat" even more oil.  I've never seen anything like it.  I'm not sure anyone ever got around to tasting them, but my guess is that they weren't good, given the odd smells and texture.
