We were looking for a healthy snack for our three children and purchased a case of these. On the front of the package in large letters is ..."Made from American Grown Fruits" but on the back in small letters is..."Made in China". I feel this is very deceptive on the part of this company. I wish we could return these, but they are not returnable to Amazon. Our children will not be eating these.
