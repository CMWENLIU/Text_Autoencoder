I was pretty excited after reading the TImes article and seeing that the price was significantly lower than the Nespresso capsules - especially as I didn't have to worry about shipping costs as an Amazon Prime customer.  Unfortunately, the flavor & quality just doesn't make it for me.  I won't be ordering these again.
