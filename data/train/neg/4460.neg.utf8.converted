The last order for Planters Redskin Spanish Peanuts that you sent us was the ones with sea salts.  I order<br />these Redskins for my wife.  She says they are not as good.  I will not order any more peanuts if the sea salts<br />are all that you carry now.  The only reason we order from you folks is because the old redskins are hard<br />to find in our local stores.  The ones I ordered had the red label. The ones with sea salt have a brown label.
