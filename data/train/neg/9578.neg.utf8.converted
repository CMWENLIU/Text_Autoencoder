I ordered this product and just got my box today 4/21/2011.  When I opened the box there was another box, so I opened the next box and there is cocunut oil all over the 2 jars, bubble wrap and all over the box!  I will never order this again, as today I received my box and they already close the return date!  There is a major problem here and I do not recommend anyone ordering this product.  I want my money back.
