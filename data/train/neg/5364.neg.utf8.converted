If you are just ordering canned tomatoes, then so be it.  These, however, are depicted as "Product of San Marzano" tomatoes.  What arrived were just canned Italian tomatoes with no indication that they are from San Marzano, because they aren't.  The labels are identical, except where the one in the illustration says "Product of San Marzano", these just say "Product of Italy".<br /><br />For those who buy California "champagne", Dominican "Cohibas" and salmon "caviar", please enjoy these tomatoes, as you probably won't notice the difference.  They are not, however, San Marzanos, so if you think you've uncovered a great deal, you haven't.  All you've found is a pure and unadulterated example of "bait and switch".<br /><br />Also beware the blanket Amazon disclaimer: "Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product."  Nice!  Not sure how exactly one can rely on information other than what they provide or read the labels BEFORE one places one's order.<br /><br />Anyway, you've been warned.  Caveat emptor.
