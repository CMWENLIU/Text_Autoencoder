My extended family and I went on a trip to visit baseball stadiums and thought "What better way to get in the baseball mood than by picking up some Big League Chew and having it at the games!"<br /><br />Well,what was to be a great weekend was ultimately ruined when we found out I had accidentally purchased the Ground Ball Grape flavor.  For those not familiar it tastes like some horrible medicine meant to cure fun.  We tried to put up a brave front and make a game out of who can actually keep giant wads of the awful gum in their mouth for the longest time, but our record sadly hovered around 45 seconds.  Of the three bags we purchased, one and a half were completely wasted and we couldn't even GIVE them away.<br /><br />Lesson learned: be wary of what flavors you pick lest you create an impassable rift in your family relationships and get banned from all future trips.
