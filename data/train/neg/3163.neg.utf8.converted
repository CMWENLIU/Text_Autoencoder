This cereal is very misleading: the box claims to have blueberry clusters (photo shows abundant clusters) but contains at most two or three clusters PER BOWL, maybe 15 clusters PER BOX. As someone who rarely reviews anything, the extreme lack of blueberries and apparent false advertising was so laughable that I felt the need to find reviews on the Internet to see how others received it. I find it very surprising that there are so many positive reviews... Is the lack of blueberries a new thing? Perhaps the economic meltdown has led to Kashi grossly cutting back on including dried fruit in their products? I think the answer is yes. That, or maybe we should just all stop making the silly assumption that a cereal that claims to have "oat flakes & blueberry clusters" actually has blueberry clusters.
