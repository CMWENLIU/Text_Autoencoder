Living in New York City, most people know Jacques Torres as a premium chocolatier. However my recent experience ordering Valentine's day chocolate has shown me otherwise. I ordered three boxes of chocolates for my sweetheart. The order cost nearly [...] which included [...] for 2nd day shipping. I recieved the chocolates promptly within two days of placing the order. When my girlfriend opened the box the contents were scrambled around inside the box. A couple of chocolates were broken (something you wouldn't expect for a truffle which has a soft center). This was my first alert that something was wrong. Biting into the chocolate the truffle was stiff, flavorless and had a moldy taste. This isn't the worst of it. I promptly called Mr. Chocolates (the Jacques Torres Website) and explained my dissatisfaction with the order I've recieved. Stephanie, at the phone number I called, said I need to send an email explaining my dissatifisfaction with the order. She said she would check with her superiors and let me know what they are going to do about it. I never got a response to my email so I sent a follow up email two days later. Her response at that time was that she still didn't know what they can do about replacing my order but that she would notify me when they decide what to do. Well now it's been a week and still no response. I'm extremely dissapointed with the lack of their customer response, the quality of the chocolates and their inability to promptly handle my complaint. Truly not worth ordering chocolates from Jacque Torres! Don't waste your time or money on these guys. BTW I wouldn't even give them one star except I wasn't able to post a review unless I gave them at least one.
