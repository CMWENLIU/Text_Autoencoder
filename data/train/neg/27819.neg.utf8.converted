I ordered these after my husband and I started remembering candy bars from our childhood.. I remembered the 7-up bars, which I loved, and he remembered these bars.. I did a search on the internet and discovered the 7-up bars are no longer made, but these are. So I bought a box of them for us since I'd never seen them in stores (right after that, we noticed them in a few stores. lol).. I love chocolate, but this is that cheaper kind of chocolate.. I'm not sure what the difference is, but it's unnaturally too sweet and kind of cheap tasting. The fillings are also way too sweet, in a cheap product kind of way.. The peanut butter is barely there, the white creamy feeling is just too sweet and cheap tasting (like the cheaper candy they sell in stores), the caramel is ok, but there isn't a whole lot in there and the fudge center is also ok, but there also isn't a lot in there.. All in all, this isn't the candy of yesteryear...<br /><br />We only ate a few each and have started giving them to the kids and grandkids stuck in gifts, just trying to get rid of them. Some of the grandkids don't even like them, though.<br /><br />Unless yo like that cheap, overprocessed, over sweetened chocolate and filling taste, I wouldn't recommend these.
