Smells good, tastes weak and the batch I got was very dusty and the small particles did not get filtered out with a standard strainer. You cannot make multiple infusions with this stuff. This is fairly disappointing, but I suppose something has to be wrong with a very cheap bulk tea. I probably wouldn't buy it again for this reason. If you don't mind a little debris on the top of your cuppa or using a lot of tea in your infusions, it's okay.
