I never review products, good or bad, but this "coffee" is so bad I had to.<br /><br />This is not the typical k-cup coffee. This is an instant coffee similar to Nescafe or SB Via but tastes horrible.<br />The sugar/splenda mix makes this way too sweet. Mixing it half and half with black coffee makes it drinkable.<br /><br />This is basically just adding hot water to instant coffee. There isn't a filter or coffee grounds in the cup.
