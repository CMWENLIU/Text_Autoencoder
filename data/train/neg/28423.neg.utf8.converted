states its 120 tablets but as in so many of these coconut oil tablets lately it doesn,t give you any specifics and it doesn,t matter what you click on you can,t find it. Seems Amazon is slipping or the customers are getting dumber. Wouldn't it be wise to know how many milligrams in each capsule and how many you are expected to comsume in one daily requirement before you buy? I will not buy this or any of the many others like it on Amazon until/unless I know exactly what I am purchasing.
