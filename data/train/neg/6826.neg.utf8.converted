If you are Russian and looking for good buckwheat kasha - don't buy that one, it's totally different thing. It smells like medicine and tastes weird, not like regular simple buckwheat. If you are the person who decided to try a buckwheat first time - don't buy that one, you will be disappointed and never know what a tasty meal it should be.
