So the taste is fine. The lime IS unsweetened, okay, fine, and the flavor does come through. No, it doesn't have any real tartness or "fresh lime" quality. But it does add lime flavor. But WHY THEY CAN'T offer this in a jar, resealable bag, etc., instead of tiny packets that have so little solid inside that it's actually hard to empty the contents--that, I don't get. Plus it's a lot of little garbage to throw away that surely isn't necessary.
