These oats are rolled, but they are thin, resulting in a creamy bowl of hot cereal. If you like a heartier oat, that keeps its shape, and is more "flaky" when cooked, then try Mother's Thick Rolled Oats: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZ8B0">Mother's Rolled Oats, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> We like the taste and texture of the thick oats, and they can easily be made into "quick" oats for recipies with one or two pulses in the food processor - so they are a more versatile oat. They also make chewier oatmeal cookies and a very nice garnish on top of homemade breads or muffins. Try Vermont pure maple syrup on these hearty oats for a real treat! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00248A9HU">Butternut Mountain Farm Pure Maple Syrup, Grade A Medium Amber, 1 Pint Jug</a>
