In my culture we cook with coconut milk all the time. Usually I use chaokoh brand but I was at whole foods and happened to buy thai kitchen brand organic coconut milk. Why they even make organic coconut milk I will never know. The husk and shell on a coconut are thick enough to protect the nut from pesticides. though I don't know about commercial coconut growing I do know that coconut palms grow everywhere around my family's home and there's no need for pesticides; the nuts are protected by nature. Anyways, I'm glad I didn't buy a whole case of the stuff. I tasted it before I added it to the eggplant dish I was making and it was gross and watery. Real coconut milk, like chaokoh, has the slightest sweetness to it and is thick, creamy and separated. I was in a pinch so I went ahead and used it, but I feel my dish would have been better if I used my usual brand.
