***<br /><br />this 5 pounds of citric acid was ordered 6-20-11, arrived 6-27-11. order was fulfilled by amazon and sent in a plastic bag inside a cardboard box with no additional padding to protect it in transit. fortunately the box suffered no damage so contents arrived safely. had there been damage to the box it is highly likely that the bag could have been punctured and the citric acid granules would have then spilled out. i do not recommend that you buy this sort of item from amazon-my personal experience with merchandise packaged by amazon is usually that no padding whatsoever is used or that the padding is insufficient and not properly placed between the product and outer box.<br /><br />the citric acid meets the need for which it was bought.<br /><br />***
