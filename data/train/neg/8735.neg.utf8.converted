The package is 12 packages of 6 Pouches.  In each pouch, there is two bars.  But who cares how many bars in each pouch?  The weigh of each pocuch matters, but not how manufacturer package the each pouch.  If manufaturer decides to package each pouch with 8 small tiny bars, it does not make the package more valuable.  In short, I thought it is 12 x 12 snacks for me, which is good price.  It ended up 12 X 6 snacks for me, which is not so good price.  I can buy the same product at local stores cheaper and at smaller quarntity.  Why shall I order online and buy large quantity if there is no saving?  Disappointed.
