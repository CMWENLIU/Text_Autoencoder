I had high hopes of this food after seeing the ingredients and reading the reviews, but my cats won't touch the stuff.  It has a very thin slop-like texture, whole peas, and is a pale grayish brown color.  The only way they'll eat it is if I mix it with other food and even then, they turn their noses up at it most of the time.  I should have bought one can at the pet store before committing to 12 on Amazon.  Next time I'll be smarter!
