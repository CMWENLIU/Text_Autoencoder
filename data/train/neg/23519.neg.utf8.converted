We love "choco" as it is loving called in our house. I have order the 85 serving container many times, but overlooked that this is only for ONE! Also the list price is $29.99! Maybe if if is shipped from the other side of the world. Be careful and look for the two pack in the $13-15 range. That is what this should cost. This product page is double the price.
