I was quite disappointed that the item which arrived was NOT the one pictured.  It contained 3 varieties of Bailey's Irish Creme filled chocolates not the Grand Marnier, Mailubu or Kahlua ones pictured.  I purchased this as a gift, so I gave it to the person and they were appreciative.  I did request  some compensation for this overight and was issued a refund for 20%.  I guess buying from this vendor is like a box of chocolate and you can never be sure just whar youo will get.
