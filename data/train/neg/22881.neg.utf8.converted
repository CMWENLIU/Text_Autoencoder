I tried this product mostly to save calories, and boy did I get an education. I ate a handful of gummy bears and blew up like a balloon - felt pain like I've rarely felt before, was in the bathroom for a good 12 hours, and honestly considered calling 911 at one point.  It was 2 days before my digestive system could handle regular food again.<br /><br />Later I found out that this sweetener (otherwise known as "Lycasin"), actually killed certain lower animals it was given to.  I for one plan to read my labels much more carefully and avoid it like the plague!
