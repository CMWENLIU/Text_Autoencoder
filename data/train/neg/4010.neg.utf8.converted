As an avid soda drinker, I know what I like. I haven't been drinking it much lately for reasons of health, so the thought of a healthier replacement is always a good thing.<br />Well what we have here is pretty much what one expects from a carbonated juice, as that's what it is. It certainly doesn't taste anything like normal black cherry soda, a favorite flavor. If anything, it tastes more like sparkling grape juice -- but seriously, almost $1 for an 8.3oz can, in a 24 pack? It's just not worth it.<br />I can see this working as a great substitute for soda for kids, but otherwise I don't see this particularly worth the purchase.
