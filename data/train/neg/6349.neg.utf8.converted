I don't like the after-taste of the "Butter Flavored Popcorn Topping".....<br /><br />I prefer "Mor Gold" Premium Butter Topping it has a far superior taste and "Mor Gold" is also more creamy and more theater like buttery taste than "Butter Flavored Popcorn Topping".<br /><br />If you haven't tried Mor Gold - then you really can't say...I've tried them all and Mor Gold taste is just like in the movie theaters...I too use to work in a movie theater and I know that butter popcorn taste like the back of my hand, I love it and Mor Gold has it hands down....<br /><br />Also if you can find the Coconut oil in the 1/4 lb. sticks, this also helps make it more like the movies But it's not really necessary, Mor Gold will do the job well all by itself....The salt is really just up to you....I tried the "fine grain popcorn salt" but I think regular house salt from your pantry is just as good or even better...Try It & Enjoy!
