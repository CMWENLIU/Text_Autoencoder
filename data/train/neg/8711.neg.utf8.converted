There is nothing in this product worth feeding to a cat.  It will make your cat dull, fat, unhealthy, and sleepy.  Look at the ingredients and notice how much corn and other grain materials there are and not much real meat.  Look at the ingredients in pet food and avoid corn and wheat and by products.  Try Innova Evo, it is the best food there is.
