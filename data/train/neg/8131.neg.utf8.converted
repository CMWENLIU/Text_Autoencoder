I first reviewed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEHQV8">these crackers for the Amazon Vine program in January, 2012,</a> listed as being sold in packs of six. Below are my original and updated comments:<br /><br />***** Original Comments *****<br /><br />Nabisco Premium saltines have been *the* saltine in our household since my childhood, so I was eager to try this new variety. It turns out this is more than just new convenient packaging.<br /><br />First of all, like most "New and Improved" these days, "New" really means "Less per Package." While the standard package of four full-sized sleeves of crackers weighs in at 16 oz., this new packaging holds only 13.6oz. There are only 24 servings per box vs. 30. Minus one star for that. Having said that, I like everything else about this product. The smaller sized sleeves helps keep crackers from going stale.<br /><br />When I tried the crackers, I thought they seemed crisper than "normal" so I compared them to the old style I had in the cabinet. Sure enough, these are different. These crackers are thinner. A stack of five of these is equivalent to four of the old. They are a bit crispier compared to the old version.<br /><br />A check of the ingredients shows a new recipe, too. Unlike the old version, which contain HFCS, these have no sugar at all. The new crackers have a slightly higher calorie count/serving, as well as a bit more fat. The sodium count, however, is down.<br /><br />Bottom line: I like this new version and will buy them when they hit the stores here.<br /><br />*****************<br />UPDATE 07/18/2012<br />*****************<br />Reducing my rating from four stars to one.<br /><br />I stored these crackers as I have all saltine crackers for the past 25 years, and the same way my mother did when I was a child...in a metal box styled to look like a Nabisco Saltine box. They kept unopened sleeves of crackers from going stale or eaten by mice.<br /><br />I opened the next to last sleeve today and discovered the crackers had turned rancid. When saltines go stale the smell ok but taste flat and have little crunch. These had a decided rancid odor and taste, but were just as crunchy as the first sleeve. Never experienced this from Nabisco Saltines, and I've been eating them over 50 years.<br /><br />I am assuming Nabisco sent Amazon factory-fresh crackers to be evaluated, so considering the short time I've had them I am truly disappointed. Unfortunately I tossed the box when I put them in the tin. When I called Nabisco CS I was told I was the first one to report this (what a surprise!). They made no offer to replace the defective crackers, offer coupons, or even ask my name. So not much Customer Service, either.
