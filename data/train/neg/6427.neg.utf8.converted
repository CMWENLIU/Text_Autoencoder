I have to agree with the majority here.  The new 70% bar, made in N.H., is just a Hershey bar in a fancy package.  Don't even bother.  In fact, once I tried it, I returned the 8 I bought on sale locally and exchanged them for the 85% bar.  The 85% is still made in France with the "old recipe" and has no soy lecithin.  Comments about the 70% bar being "greasy" and "plastic" are correct.  But let's be frank... no serious chocolate connoisseur would consider any Lindt bar worthy.  If you're serious about chocolate, look towards Michel Cluizel, Valrhona, Bonnat and others.
