I bought one of these and used for feeding with my 6 month old.  I thought it would be very convenient, especially on the go.  However, I found that the spoon is too deep for my baby.  She can't get all food into her mouth so there's always some left on the spoon.  And since the hole is at the bottom of the spoon, you need to squeeze a lot out in order to fill the spoon up.  It might work better when she's older and can take bigger bites.
