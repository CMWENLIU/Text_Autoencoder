I was very disappointed when these arrived and I tried them. They were off color and did not even taste like the fruit they represent. They were also hard and dry. These were supplied from the All Stuff Considered. The first box I ordered came from the Natural Health Shop and were fresh, moist and tasted just as they should. I will not order these again if they will be supplied from the All Stuff Considered.
