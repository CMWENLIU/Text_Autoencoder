These bars are my favorite, and Amazon has three sources. World Wide Sales it turns out is the best value. In all cases, the bars come 2 to a foil pack. World Wide Solutions offering has 6 foil packs per box. Here is where the confusion begins. The box is labeled "12 bars" in the lower left corner and a cartoon bubble on the upper right in the ad says "6 pack". I learned after recieving the order that "12 bars" means 6 servings since I consume the entire foil pack of two thin bars. Furthermore, "6 pack" means 6 boxes each containing 6 foil packs for a total of 36 servings for $28.05. Ordering a quantity of 1 yields 6 boxs, each containing 6 foil packs for $28.05 plus shipping.<br /><br />Cosmetic Solutions sells 9 servings (foil packs) for $14 and Amazon sells 30 servings (foil packs) for $30.
