I don't know if this company is in the habit of sending rotten food, but my first order of this product smelled like vinegar. I was informed that it indicated that it was fermented/rotten, and unfortunately, I tried some before knowing this. Tasted a hint of chocolate and it was as hard as roasted almonds, but it still had a rotten taste to it.
