I edited this review in October 2012, after my machine broke.<br /><br />I bought the Saeco Vienna Plus 21 months ago to replace a much-loved and much-used Solis Master 5000. My understanding was that the Vienna Plus had basically the same internal components as my old Solis. I got over 8000 coffees out of the old Solis over the course of 8 years, before its boiler gave out. (The Solis had a digital coffee counter). I loved the Solis.<br /><br />The machine had some minor problems, for example, it seems to leak water into the drip tray (I read somewhere that's a feature, not a bug), a plastic knob broke (fixed with glue), and the dosage dials stopped adjusting. A few weeks ago, however, the machine began to smell like burnt machine gears, and as it worsened, the stench now contaminates the coffee. The cost for repair would be $150 labor, plus $225 for a new grinder ($350 total). Less for a used grinder. I'm 9 months out of the 12-month warranty. We make an average of 3 espressos daily.<br /><br />I would *not* have bought this machine had I known the experience I would have. I have lowered by rating from 5 stars, to 1 star. I agree with the sentiment of some other reviewers that this superautomatic machine makes most sense if you don't expect longevity. Assume a lifetime of 1-2 years.<br /><br />Another point of interest, if you follow the Solis/Saeco product line, is that there is no water-level detector. The machine just runs, and if the water runs out, it times out (it does not overheat). You just refill the water tank, re-prime (e.g., run the water wand for a few seconds) and make the coffee again.<br /><br />I'm replacing it with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002S51RQG">Breville Barista Express BES860XL Machine with Grinder</a>, which requires an extra step when making an espresso, but after watching several videos, I think the BES860XL will taste much better, and be a convenient part of my morning espresso.
