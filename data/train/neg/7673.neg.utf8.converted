I agree with the other reviewer!  Amazon should require the price to be lowered, or pull the listing - this is a ridiculously high price!!! Target, Babies R Us, etc have the 6-pack for $9 or lower, and if you get the Enfamil checks or coupons, you can really get a much better deal.  The idea of paying $5 for 2 OUNCES of formula (that a newborn will scarf down in one sitting) is highway robbery!! do NOT buy this at this price!!!
