I gave both our dogs, a beagle and a lab the Calcibone(Fun Bites) Mega Congo.  About 15 minutes after eating both dogs began panting heavily and listliss. This lasted thru the night.  The beagle is still not feeling up to speed but the lab seemed to be ok by the end of the next day.  Has anyone had any issues.  It scared us.<br /><br />Regards<br />Leanne
