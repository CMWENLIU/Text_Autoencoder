I bought these thinking they would actually be less fat being labeled after a big-name weight reduction group.  13 grams of fat a serving?  Really?  Is that what is considered "weight watching"?  It was a bag of Whitman's chocolates pre-packaged under the WW brand and sold as something much more expensive but basically about the same fat content as just buying Whitman's chocolates and eating 3. (3 is a serving)  Sure they tasted good but so do regular chocolates.  Silly.  Not worth the money.  Just go buy a box of Whitman's and eat 3. lol
