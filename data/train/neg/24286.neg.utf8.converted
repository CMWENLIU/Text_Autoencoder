My husband and I ran out of Illy and decided to give the Alessi decaf espresso a try since it was much cheaper... what a mistake! It was REALLY bad. No comparison whatsoever to the Illy decaf we'd had before. So we threw out the one can we'd opened, and I think I'll donate the other cans. What a big disappointment... we're back to the Illy now.
