After reading the review by "That Chatty Gal" I have to agree with her. I really wanted to like this tea. What's better than Madagascar Vanilla and Tea? I love both so this seemed like a wonderful choice. Unfortunately for me, the tea smelled like tobacco (good tobacco if that matters!) but had a syrupy sweet taste and no real depth of flavor. I also tried it with soymilk, honey, sugar, milk, and both cold and iced. Still, I was unable to even drink one cup because I just didn't find this to be a pleasant experience. I used about half of the box trying to make it work, but it didn't.<br /><br />On the other hand, my children really enjoy this tea so I think this is one of the teas that you either love or hate. As for me, I'll stick with Celestial Seasonings Chai teas if I'm in the mood for a sweet tea with milk and sugar.
