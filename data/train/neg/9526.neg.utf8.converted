The whole kit showed up as promised.  I made the recipes as instructed.  The bread was heavy like a rock, not fluffy like the Ezekial bread we buy in the store.  I discovered that to make that kind of bread, we would have to invest in a special grinding machine that costs over $200.  Well--me thinks we'll stick to buying it from the store.
