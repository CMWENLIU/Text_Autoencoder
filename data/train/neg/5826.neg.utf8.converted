For the price, the product is really mediocre, and makes me wish I just put a gift basket together myself. The packaging is wrapped in an ugly plastic wrap, and the bows were too short. I ended up just taking off the plastic wrap and tying the bow on the basket and putting it in a gift bag. The basket is flimsy and it wont even stand up by itself which is  making me really mad. It's definitely not worth the money. It's actually very small, and it looks something worth $10 at most.
