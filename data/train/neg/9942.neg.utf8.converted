Formula has changed as well as where the product is made and it shows!!!  None of the packageing indicates these changes.  Not half as good in flavoring as it used to be along with the fact that it is now higher in fat % which has affected the taste and the calorie count......would not buy unless the calorie counts goes back to 150 or less. Whatever changed to accomodate the fat change also affected the flavor big time.....almost tastes blah.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D05RWC">KIND PLUS, Almond Cashew + Omega-3, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>
