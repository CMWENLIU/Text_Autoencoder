I had been using raw apricot seeds from another source for years, but when I found this product at this price (about 1/2 the price I was paying) I couldn't resist.  Immediately I noticed a brittle, crunchy texture like they were toasted or freeze-dried (both of which will destroy the B17).  The package clearly states "raw", which I suppose, however deceptively, does not exclude freeze-drying.  And after  popping the usual 7 kernels in my mouth, I braced myself for the wave of bitterness.  It never came.<br />Too bad I ordered 2 packages.  I am using 9-10 instead of 7 until these are gone.  I am too suspicious to reorder.
