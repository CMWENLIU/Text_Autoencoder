Just like some of the other posts, its made me and my 3 yr old daughter very sick. I cant handle small amounts of gluten. Were 100% gluten free. We ate these for our bedtime snack and both of us felt so bad in the morning we went back to bed and slept 2 1/2 hours and had all the other symptoms of eating a large amount of gluten! the chocolate cake from Betty CRocker did the same thing!<br />General mills cereals that says GF do the same thing to us! Beware! Make your brownies from scratch!
