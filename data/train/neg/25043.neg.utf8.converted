I only drink organic coffee at home. That's why I was excited to read the reviews on this product. All I can say is I'm really glad I also bought Starbucks Via. This stuff is awful! It doesn't even taste like coffee. I'm somewhat flexible. I'm not really that picky. I can drink just about any coffee in an "emergency." I could not drink this stuff. I don't really know how to describe this product. When I tried the Starbucks I was very impressed, however. To me it tasted like what you'd get at an actual Starbucks.<br /><br />Take my word for it, go with Starbucks. It's not organic, but at least you can drink it.
