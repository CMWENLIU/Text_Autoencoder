I'm a huge fan of almost every variety of hot beverages the Tassimo makes...  this is not one of them.  If you make a full cup, it tastes very lackluster and watery.  The head of foam is very thin and disappears very quickly.  Both of these problems can be improved by making a smaller cup, but even so, it still doesn't hold a candle to other flavors.<br /><br />If you want a GREAT cup of Tassimo crema, go for the Mastro Lorenzo Crema.  HUGE improvement in taste, and the foam is nice and thick.<br /><br />Tassimo makes lots of great drinks...  but skip this one.
