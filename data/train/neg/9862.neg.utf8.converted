I bought these thinking they would make a nice meal at work, but was completely unprepared for what the product actually is. The picture looks like a nice meal with beef and gravy with some mashed potato, what you get is a sea of white, tasteless puree, with a little bit of brown mushy stuff anda thin butter loaded liquid which they say is gravy. It was very unappetizing.
