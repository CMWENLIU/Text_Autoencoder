The truffle package arrived with two severely damaged corners (bottom), and some of the contents are crumbled. I intended to give this as part of a holiday gift, but now can not. The order information says that this item can not be returned because it is a grocery. It would be great if the seller would contact me to facilitate a return, refund or exchange.
