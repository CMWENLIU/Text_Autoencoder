Hello<br />I just got a letter from Kraft foods and they are bringing back the old formula this summer!  Until then they stated to look for the best used by date of Jan222011 or any date after that and the taste will be almost like the original, I tried it and it does almost taste like the old formula.  YAHOO!!!!!!! That other stuff was terrible and they now realize it too.
