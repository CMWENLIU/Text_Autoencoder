The brownies were not rich, not chocolate chunk...only a few chips on top...much much smaller than the picture...not chewy...soft and mushy like the cheapo ones you get at the grocery store...were in the box in 4 stacks of four and the bottom brownie on each stack was smashed to half size and the rest were all stuck together...the box they came in was beautiful and worth much more than the contents...I paid $32 + $11 shipping for 16 small brownie crumbles that were only worth about $5 if they weren't stuck together...drew was reluctant to give refund, and would only respond to my e-mails with one-sentence Blackberry replies, so I gave up
