Our 11 month old son had a bad, week-long stomach flu and had stopped taking the plain Pedialyte once he was able to start drinking formula again, but because he still had diarrhea he needed some Pedialyte. So I tried giving him this fruit flavor. He had a few sips via spoon and spewed projectile vomit twice. This is after having not vomited in over 24 hours. It put us back to square one. Smell and taste it yourself, it's awful. Maybe older kids prefer it, who knows, but I will never give this product to my child ever again.
