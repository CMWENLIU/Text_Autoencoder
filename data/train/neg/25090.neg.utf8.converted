Newman's Own Pomegranate Licorice Twists are a unique candy, to be sure. I'd never heard of a pomegranate-flavored licorice before, so I was anxious to try it. First the good: The pieces are firm and chewy (I like a little substance to my licorice), they're a good size (about 2 inches shorter than a Twizzler), and the pomegranate flavor is nice. Now the bad: While the flavor is good while you're eating the licorice, a bitter aftertaste lingers (I had to either immediately take a drink or shove another piece of licorice into my mouth to get rid of the aftertaste), and the price is outrageous. At 53 cents per ounce, this licorice is four times the price of  Twizzlers. Is it four times as good? I don't think so. While I enjoyed trying these licorice twists, I won't be buying them in the future.
