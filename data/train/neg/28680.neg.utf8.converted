I'm a sucker for convenience, but with two kids and a job - do you really blame me? I'm the stereotypical busy mom, and I thought these would be great. I bought the popcorn in early August but quickly forgot about it as we moved into the fall months. While cleaning our pantry, I re-discovered them.<br /><br />Today I thought it would make a great addition to my lunch. I went to the break room, popped it on and waited patiently.<br /><br />It was still popping when I pulled out, but it just smelled burnt.<br /><br />To my surprise, it was. Not only that, but the bag had sprung a leak. Unpopped kernels and butter leaked out. Had I let it go the full 2 minutes, we would have been facing a massive fire. Cleaning the microwave after that was bad enough, but having to deal with the possible problems it could have caused? Even worse.<br /><br />I've only used one bag, but I'm throwing the rest of the box away. A fire hazard isn't worth it.
