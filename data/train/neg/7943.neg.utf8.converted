We LOVE this Gingergizer and ordered it regularly, but the last shipment we got had something wrong with it...the color was lighter than usual, but we opened a bottle anyway and drank some and the taste was totally different and very unpleasant.  To be certain it wasn't just that one bottle that was contaminated, we opened a second bottle, but it was rancid too.  Since grocery items cannot be returned, I guess we are just out the $20+ cost.  I'd like to keep ordering it and would do so if I knew this one contaminated shipment was a fluke; we had ordered it many times before -- at least 6 or 7 cases, and never had a problem so I don't know what happened.
