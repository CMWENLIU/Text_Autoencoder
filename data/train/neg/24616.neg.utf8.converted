I figured I'd really like the Godiva Chocolate Creme Coffee pods for my Senseo because I like both coffee and chocolate. Having used these over a few weeks, I now feel that the coffee is fairly weak and so is the chocolate aspect. It's definitely drinkable, but won't leave you with a taste you can remember. If you're looking for a stronger coffee or chocolatey taste, this is likely to be disappointing.
