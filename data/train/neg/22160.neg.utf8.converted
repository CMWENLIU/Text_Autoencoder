Hi, my husband and I tried Stevia to use in our coffee as a sugar substitute and we didn't like it. It made our coffee have a weird taste and smell. It also left a weird aftertaste in our mouths when we were done. We decided to use Agave Nectar instead and we like that much better. It's cheaper too.
