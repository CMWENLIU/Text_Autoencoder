We have bought five types of sprouts from this seller and have tried four of them.  Those four have sprouted well, but the sunflower seeds still have their hulls.<br /><br />Therefore, when sprouting these sunflower seeds, each sprout has to be removed from its hull to be eaten.  It would be better to buy hulled sunflower seeds for sprouting and not to use these.
