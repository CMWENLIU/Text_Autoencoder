I love drinking hot tea and some of my favorites have lots of lemon. Figuring the ginger would be an interesting addition I thought I would give this a try. The drink dissolved completely into a dark yellow brew but the ginger flavor was way to powerful and I couldn't taste any lemon at all. I used 8 oz of water and when that was too strong I watered it down but that did nothing to diminish the ginger. In fact the tea even had a "hot" taste as if there was chili in it. I'll pass on this one.
