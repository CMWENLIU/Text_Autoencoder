I bought Yogi tea after reading all the good reviews it got on Amazon. Boy, was I disappointed!<br />It's very very hard to drink. I forced it down my throat and it took a lot from me<br />to hold it down. I had the puke sensation for a long time after drinking it. Now I know,<br />why it works for weightloss. After drinking this, you don't feel like eating or drinking anything. I also noticed that this tea has all kinds of (organic) ingredients, only<br />that it is missing is Tea! Go figure!<br /><br />So far I've used 3 tea bags, the rest is going to my trash bin. What a waste of money.
