Ordered these to be delivered on the tenth of febuary due to description saying they arrive in bud form. Well I received them on the 14th, Valentines day. Had I wanted to give my wife some ugly closed buds for a valentines day present I would have requested the 14th and not the 10th. So when I realized I would not receive them when requested, a date that would have given them time to open up I had to go purchase flowers locally. Not to mention that upon arrival of said buds, well after one look I can tell you that there is no way in heck that they would bloom to look anything like the picture, seems to be lacking like half the flowers and two of them that were sent have the stems broken not too far below the bulb s so there's two less from the already lacking amount.
