I bought this vanilla powder in Whole Foods, I assumed that Whole Foods sell best products. Unfortunately WH also sell GMO, but they pay me money back even for empty bottles of this vanilla powder.<br />I do not recommend to buy this vanilla powder, especially for children and young adults, because maltodextrin is made from GMO (genetically modified organism).<br />Nielsen-Massey company also give me false info over the phone that they do not use GMO.<br />Here is part of document I received from Nielsen-Massey company by email:<br /><br />"To whom it might concern:<br />Regarding MALTRIN M100 and M510 maltodextrin, these products are processed from some GMO raw materials. These products will typically test negative for GMOs by PCR method. Those products will not meet EU labeling regulations as a non-GMO...."
