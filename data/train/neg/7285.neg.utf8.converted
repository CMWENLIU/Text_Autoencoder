The front of the box and their ads say "0g Net Carbs" but the nutritional label says 1g fiber, 1g sugar and 12g sugar alcohols. Eating one of these is the same as eating 13g of sugar for a diabetic. Unless their opinion that the diarrhea that the 12g of maltitol per cookie will give you will cause you to expel the cookie before it has a chance to be digested? P.S. Each of these 70 calorie cookies in miniscule. About the size of your fingertip.
