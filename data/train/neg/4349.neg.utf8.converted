Not too thrilled with this one though.  Seems to not have any growth and getting yellower by the day.  I'm not sure it survived shipping very well.  It was moist when we got it, but there was only one bloom left on it which dropped after one week.  I didn't care for it any differently than the Jade, which sits right next to it on the counter.  The only thing it seems to attract is bugs.  We finally had to put it outside because it was getting pretty bad.  I think its still alive, but not sure how much longer it has.
