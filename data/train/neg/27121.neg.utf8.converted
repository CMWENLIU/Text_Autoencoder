Since the total carbs are what is important for diabetics, this should not be recommended. It has 42 grams of carbs and only 4 grams of fiber per 1/2 cup of cooked pasta. This is almost the total amount of carbs allowed diabetics for a complete meal. Only 1/2 cup is the maximum of carbs for a meal. Who  can eat just one cup of pasta?<br /><br />It is very misleading to diabetics as "digestible carbs" has no meaning to them. Total carbs less fiber is what counts to a diabetic. Thus diabetics beware. If you want to eat it remember, 1/2 cup is a complete meal of carbs.
