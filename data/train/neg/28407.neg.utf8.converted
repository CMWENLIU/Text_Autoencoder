I came across this tea in the grocery store just a few days after reading all the great reviews here, so I had to buy a box. But now that I've tried it, I have to ask: Are we drinking the same tea? Because this tea has no aroma and very little flavor, and I would rate it below Lipton's, if you can believe it.<br /><br />My recommendation for a great black breakfast tea is Numi's Morning Rise Breakfast Blend, available in some stores and also here on Amazon.
