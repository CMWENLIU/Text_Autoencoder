I personally love all the goods and commodities from Amazon --  most of the time, they're on par or above expectations, and when they're not, you can always return them without big hassle. This pack of prunes, however, is a nightmare. I had it in the morning, and haven't been without a stomach pain since. My advice is to stay away from it. Well, unless you've had it before and loved it without any issues.
