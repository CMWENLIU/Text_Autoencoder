Bought this coffee after reading about how it is roasted and packed for shipment to ensure fresh coffee.  The coffee is dry and old.  It is not fresh roasted, packed and shipped fresh.  It was old and dry coffee and doesn't make that fresh smooth Jamacian brew I paid for.  Now I have 5 lbs of old dry coffee.  I would not recommend purchasing from this company, the coffee is a severe disappointment.  Amazon should not sell this inferior product on the site.
