Have you ever been to a nice Italian restaurant that grated real cheese right onto your dish?  Remember the wonderful aroma, taste, and texture?  Well you can buy that same cheese and enjoy a fantastic culinary experience every time you serve pasta, salad, or many other dishes.  This is not it.  Ever since discovering REAL Parmesan cheese, I will never buy this product again.<br /><br />This powder-like substance is nothing like the real thing.  It has a poor aroma, flat processed taste, and doesn't even look like real cheese.  I'm not sure why it tastes so bad.  I suspect the cheese itself isn't of the quality of real imported Parmigiano to begin with, plus it's been pre-grated with added chemicals.  Sure, it adds a little flavor and adds a little light coloring to the dish, but do yourself a big favor and skip this.<br /><br />Look for real Parmigiano Reggiano (I found it at my local warehouse club), or Parmigiano Reggiano Stravecchio which is aged a little more and is fantastic.  Also get a decent grater (amazon has the nice Zyliss 11370 that works great for Parmesan).  Yes it will cost about 2-3x per pound what the Kraft costs, but it is easily 100x as good.  Less will go a lot further, so you really won't spend much more for a vastly better product.  Just grating the real thing fills the room with a beautiful, addictive aroma!<br /><br />Alternately, you can get a great "real" Romano cheese block also which is about the same price as this per pound and is also excellent grated onto pasta dishes, or even mixed with the Parmigiano for added zing.<br /><br />I use both regularly.  Recently I used the Kraft stuff someone else brought to a potluck, and while it may be better than nothing, it reminded me how low American taste buds have gotten if this is the most popular grated cheese on the market.  I am reminded of when I served guests REAL maple syrup, but they didn't like it because it didn't taste like the fake stuff they were used to - artificially flavored corn syrup.  For someone like that, or who prefers cool-aid to juice, hot dogs over sirloin, etc., then like the cave dwellers in Plato's Republic, perhaps they simply cannot accept something different.  But I would hope most people do want something better!<br /><br />To be fair, this will keep for a year on your shelf (unlike the real thing), so if you want it for emergency use or you are headed to Antarctica for 6 months, you might actually have a use for this powdery stuff.  If so, though, keep in mind that despite saying 100% real, this Kraft product does have added ingredients including cellulose powder and potassium sorbate (a preservative).  Other bottled brands, such as Bakers & Chefs (which I think tastes a little better than Kraft) don't have added preservatives.  Amazon also carries Racconto brand which I haven't tried.
