I am always looking for good quality cat food and thought I would give this a try.<br />Sadly it did not go down well in my house ! Two of my cats just walked away without a mouthful and the third ate about a quarter of a can. Whereas with Fancy Feast, they inhale it.<br />Maybe it's like humans, the stuff that is bad for you simply tastes better !
