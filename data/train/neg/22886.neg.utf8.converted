I, like some of the other reviewers, had a nasty reaction to something in these gummis, I'm going to assume it was the sweetener.  I ate a couple of handfuls over the course of a couple of hours and shortly there after I wound up with severe intestinal distress which lasted a good six hours.  Beware these gummis if you have any reaction to alternative sweeteners.<br /><br />Aside from these I have very much enjoyed the other Haribo gummi candies and will buy the other varieties again, just not the sugar free ones.
