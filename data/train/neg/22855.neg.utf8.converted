If I could give these treats and a whole bunch of others 0 stars, I would.  They contain among their first ingredients corn syrup solids, then dextrose and a little bit farther down the list sugar.  Sugar and other forms of sugar like corn syrup and dextrose are linked to cancer in dogs.  They're just as bad if not worse for them  than for humans.  Sure the dogs love them; but there are a lot of healthy treats out there that are just as well liked.  You're buying the name brand, advertising and packaging.
