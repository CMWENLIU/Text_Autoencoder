This product was sold to me as a replacement for Killex. Well let me tell you it does not perform  the same. I followed the instructions to the letter and now a week later the weeds are just starting to bearly die off. With Killex over the same time frame the weeds would be dead and gone. The only reason I purchased this product is we can no longer buy Killex.
