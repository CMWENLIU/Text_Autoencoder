Talk about false advertising!! This is what you will get if you order this. From the website it looks like you are getting a nice gift. Boy did I get fooled. It makes me mad to know that there are companies like this that do people this way. And to think of what I am having to pay for something that is really not worth it. I think they should be made to repay us what we are paying for this gift basket since they are promoting false advertising. I will have to "cherish" every bite of these tiny treats. I want my money back!!! I will be glad to send it back to you. I have not opened it.
