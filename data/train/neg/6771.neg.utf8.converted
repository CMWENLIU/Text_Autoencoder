You have heard the expression "Restaurant Quality".  These are definitely not.  Pad Thai is usually hotter than these, the noodles are not up to par.  definitely a disappointment.  I donated all but the first 2 boxes (I tried it 2x to be sure I did not cook it wrong)to a local food bank.  Although I hated it, I'm sure someone needing food would find it edible.<br /><br />If you are expecting it to compare with a Thai restaurant you are in for a HUGE disappointment<br /><br />AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL
