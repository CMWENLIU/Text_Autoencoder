I eat a lot of healthy food and am willing to try new ones.  So recently I tried this cereal.  The only plus I can report is that it had a lot of raisins in it.  Which is a good thing because, without the raisins it would have been completely tasteless.  But the worst thing about it is that it contains some very hard bits that almost broke a tooth.<br /><br />That was my experience the first time, eating it cold with milk.  I noticed that the box suggested it could also be eaten warm...I figured that heating it with milk might soften the hard bits, so I decided to try it (I was also trying desperately to avoid throwing away the $5.49 investment).  My theory was wrong.  The hard bits are un-softenable.  I dumped the rest of the box of cereal...and $5.49 + tax...in the compost bin.
