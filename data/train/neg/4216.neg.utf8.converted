Amazon.com packed this product very well and the package was not damaged during shipment.<br /><br />The Vito Coco product I ordered and received (as titled) was not as good condition.  On 4 of the 34 oz boxes, the seals were broke slightly.  All 4 with broken seals were dripping very slightly - very noticeable as I held onto them.  The slight pressure used to hold them caused the dripping out of the seal before ever removing the seal. Two of the containers was smashed on the top - both of which were 2 of the 4 with broken seals. When I opened some of the shipping packages of these products, it smelled moldy.<br /><br />The seal for the opening is flimsy and could easily be damaged. Some of the seals were far too easy to remove - not the kind of seal you want to use for this heavy weight - 34 oz product.<br /><br />I only have one other coconut water to compare this product to, and that is the brand O.N.E.  Compared to O.N.E., the taste of this product was off - a taste of decay or mold. Some tasted moldier than others. I drank them all anyway (with no apparent ill affects), except for 3 of the 4 in which the seals were broken.  3 of the 4 with broken seals, I poured down the drain.<br /><br />The price of the 34 oz 6 pack product of Vita Coco is excellent in comparison to other coconut water brands on the market, but is it worth it?  Not to me.  I will not be buying this product again unless they improve IF the price remains the same.
