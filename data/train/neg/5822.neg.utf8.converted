Up until yesterday, my family and I enjoyed this product versus raw sugar or any other sweetener. We even got past the extra liquidity of our oatmeal once we added blue agave. Alas, having been informed of yet other feat of ingenious marketing, I am tossing out two unopened and one partially finished bottles.<br /><br />Before consuming another drop, take a look at this recently published article:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />"Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food. Sorry. Don't kill the messenger..."<br /><br />and goes on to say:<br /><br />"Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.<br /><br />In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to break it down into digestible sugar (fructose), resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you.<br /><br />If you simply must have some sweets, a small amount of agave nectar every once in a while isn't going to kill you. Just don't buy into the idea that it's any better for you than plain old sugar or HFCS."<br /><br />If anyone is interested in purchasing my unopened bottles, let me know before the end of the week!
