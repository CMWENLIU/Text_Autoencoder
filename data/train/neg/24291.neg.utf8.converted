In case you haven't noticed, the manufacturer has recently changed the concents of the cans of the fish and shrimp feast.  Much more fish scraps and water, and correspondingly less fish meat, which I'm sure increases their profit margin, but it's not as good for the cats.  Our cats used to really like it, too, but not any more.
