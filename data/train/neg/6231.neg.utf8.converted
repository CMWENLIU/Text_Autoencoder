The definition of truffle - and to anyone who purchases truffles - is a soft candy made of a chocolate mixture.  NOT SO with this - these are like malted milk balls with some strange taste that doesn't taste like hazelnut.  If I had know they weren't really truffles I would have never purchase them.  These are NOT returnable so it was a waste of money... Beware!
