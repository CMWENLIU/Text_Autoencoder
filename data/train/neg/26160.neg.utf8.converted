This new honey pineapple mango is awful.  The worst tasting powdered tea mix I have ever had.  I guess I will have to go back to plain iced tea because I threw this stuff out.  I loved the Green Tea TO GO mandarin and mango but it has been discontinued by Lipton and replaced with this terrible tasting stuff.  I won't even waste my money trying the other new flavors.
