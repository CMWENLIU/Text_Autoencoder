These gummy bears look nothing like the advertised picture. I ordered them for a candy buffet for my wedding, and my colors are red, white, and silver, and I thought these would be perfect. Now I have 10 lbs of useless gummy bears that I can't even eat! The product features even say "Delightful red and white gummy bears", but I did not get red or white, I got yellow. So disappointed! I doubt I will ever order from this company again.
