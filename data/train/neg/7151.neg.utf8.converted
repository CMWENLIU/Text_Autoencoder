what a rip-off. i bought the exact same item at my local japanese grocery store and it was only $4. i'm almost out and i wanted to see if i could buy them online, but every store is over-priced!<br /><br />youkan has always been a favorite snack for me, but paying double the price is definitely not worth it!
