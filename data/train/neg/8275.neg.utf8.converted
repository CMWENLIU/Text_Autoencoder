I just canceled an order for Cytomax because after researching it more on various sites, including their own, I find Cytomax to be very misleading concerning ingredients in their product.  I contacted their customer service department and the words "herbal lift" mean caffeine.  Why don't they just say what it is....caffeine?  Why do they hide the fact that certain flavors have caffeine in them?  Reason:  Some people won't buy sports drinks with caffeine in them.....me being one of those people.  Some flavors contain guarana extract.  Look it up...it has a very high caffeine content.  In summary, I simply don't trust Cytomax as a company.  If I have to search for the truth, it's the same as them not telling the truth to me.  To try to bring my impressions to conclusion, I called Cytomax on the number listed on their website and their customer service people are very evasive or not able to address my questions about what is in their product to back up their anecdotal evidence listed on their website.  They transferred me to their sales manager who is an "avid cyclist", got voicemail and no return phone call.  If you want to know what you're really putting in your body, don't buy Cytomax.
