The other oysters from this company are raised in South Korea but these are from China!  Do not buy them!  And you can't return them even still in the bag they were shipped in.  It looks like the trash can will be having oysters for dinner.  I should have known when the descriptin didn't say anything that they were hiding something.  The other oyster products from this company proudly say South Korea as the place of origin.
