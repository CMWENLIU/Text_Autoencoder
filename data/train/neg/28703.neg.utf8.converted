It all tasted, in the immortal words of Elaine Benes, "Fake! Fake! Fake!"<br /><br />The LateJuly Organic Classic Rich crackers were excellent.  Really.<br /><br />The Terra Nostra Organic Robust Dark 60% Cacao was rock hard and resisted melting in the mouth.  I adore dark chocolate, but not this.<br /><br />"Just add a drink and chow down," reads the back of the box.  Better make that the strongest you have around.
