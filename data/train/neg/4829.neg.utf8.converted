Barbara, if you read your reviews, please listen.  Your cereal doesn't taste the same as it used to.  I loved the original Puffins.  Slightly sweet in milk, nice flavor, great organic nutrition. Then your packaging changed [to a blander boring beige, BTW] and your cereal changed as well.  It is now completely tasteless.  I have tried the new version 3 times from 3 different stores and they are all bland as your new packaging.  I am sorry to say, this will be the last box I ever buy.  Please bring back your old cereal---you changed something, please change it back.
