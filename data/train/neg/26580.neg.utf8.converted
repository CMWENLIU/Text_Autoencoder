I have to confess that I buy products base on reviews and I don't do my own homework to return the favor. This time I think I should warn other people about this product. My baby grew up to toddler drinking formula since he was 6 months old. We tried several brands until we landed in one that it is not Enfamil and I will not mention for the sake of the credibiliy of this review.<br />We wanted to keep with the nutrition supplements that baby formulas provide to my toddler and Enfagrow provided a good option. The issue, the major issue, is that it simple taste ugly. Adults may tell you that any baby food will taste ugly anyway, but me and my toddler agreed that bitterness, and awful taste is the best describer for this product. It has been such a "shock" that he does not drink anything that looks like milk anymore. So, save your time and money, if your toddler already knows the taste of real milk, he/she will just pull this one away. Now, I have to mix milk with other things to try to make him like it again. About the nutrients..well I am still searching for a better alternative or at least with better taste, what is the point of having all those nutrients in this powder milk when the baby will not drink it...just a thought
