I ordered this product because my son has multiple food sensitivities and allergies. This is a safe alternative to cocoa powder for him. However, when I received this product from "Halal Everyday" seller, it was a "mystery powder" that had been REPACKAGED into two clear, heat-sealed plastic bags with a home-made label reading "carob powder". I have absolutely no doubt that they buy in bulk and re-package to sell by the pound, but I CANNOT use something that isn't in food safe packaging, and have NO IDEA if there has been any contamination of this brown powder with a label-maker tag affixed with tape! Deceptive product photo shows the original foil bag in which FRONTIER organic products are usually sold, not the "bait and switch", who-knows-what-kind-of PLASTIC BAG in which this stuff arrived!! Would cost alsmost as much to return it as it cost to buy it, so I will be throwing it in the trash. Won't order from this merchant again.
