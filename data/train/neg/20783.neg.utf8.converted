Frontier's candy product actually comes in the form of flat, stringy ginger chips that seem freeze-dried rather than crystallized. Although the ginger is hot,sweet and spicy (and I like that), each piece was difficult to chew. Often, it felt like chewing cud (sorry, too much information I know), but I was literally left with a stringy, wet wad in my mouth after eating each piece. Couldn't even swallow...more like eating ginger gum than candies.<br /><br />I didn't even finish off the entire bag. Ginger candy is one of my favorite candies -- up there with chocolate for me. Not being able to finish off the ginger, tells you something. I only eat this stuff when I'm desperate for something to snack on, and even afterward, ick. There isn't even a calming medicinal effect I usually experience with ginger. It's more of a laxative-like effect than tummy nirvana.<br /><br />I prefer Reed's crystallized ginger and The Ginger People's crystallized ginger candies to this stuff. I wish Amazon would take the picture down. A little truth in advertising please. Put the real picture of ginger chips up to stop confusing the buyer.<br /><br />Sorry, but I will not be buying this again.
