I am a huge fan of the original annie's pasta meals, so when this came out I thought it was a good idea. However, it was poorly executed. When you use the recomended amount of water, its to water, even after 10 mintues of sitting. Too little, your noodles will clump together and get undercooked. Obviously they didn't test this product enough. Stick to original annie's!
