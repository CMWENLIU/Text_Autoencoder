We gave this to our 35 pound mutt who went after it with determination.  he really liked the texture of the product and seemed very happy with it.  however, he chewed off two clean corners in all of five minutes.  this is about the time it would take him to chew through a 5 dollar product.  we are very disappointed that this product, which is rated a 9 on the tuffy scale, and cost a good amount, did not last up to FIVE MINUTES of chewing.  dont waste your money.
