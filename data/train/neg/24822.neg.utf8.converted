This is certainly not the worst tasting cereal in the world, not the greatest, but for a health food not bad at all.  The main problem with eating it is that it is a bit too crunchy, and it leaves a very stubborn residue if left in the cereal bowl for an hour.  HOWEVER, the main problem doesn't come when you eat the cereal; it comes about 3 hours after you eat the cereal.  You will be haunted by the most unrelenting gas that you are likely to have ever experienced.  I am positive that GoLEan crunch is responsible because for the last two days that and milk were the only two things I ate and both days I experienced the same tortuous flatulence (I have never had a problem with my milk [Horizon Organic whole]).  The gas isn't particularly smelly but it is frighteningly voluminous.  If you were to consume this product along with a serving of egg curry, you could vanquish your most powerful enemies.
