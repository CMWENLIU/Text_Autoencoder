Normally I buy almond paste, not prepared marzipan, but thought that just this once I could save a little time. There is no one to blame but myself for not reading the ingedient list before buying. This is what happens when you rush. By now I should know that when it comes to even old stand-by products, nothing can be taken for granted.<br /><br />The ingredient list begins as expected, sugar, blanched almonds, water but then it veers off into new frontier - sorbitol -- then corn syrup and potassium sorbate finish the list. Potassium sorbate is used as a preservative to extend shelf-life, and perhaps is necessary, but why is sorbitol added to something as straightforward as marzipan? If this wasn't enough, the marzipan does not have a good almond flavor -- it is incredibly bland.<br /><br />Ironically, and a bit off the subject, I just read a book about dental health that discussed how damaging sorbitol is to the teeth and gums even though it is a popular sweetener in sugar-free gums and mints. The dentist who wrote the book stated that the bad bacteria in the mouth actually adapt to sorbitol quickly and begins to feed on it with greater frenzy than pure sugar.<br /><br />Whether the dental issue is of concern, sorbitol is widely known to cause intestinal distress in some people, and people with irritable bowel syndrome limit or completely avoid the product. Bottom line is that sorbitol isn't usually found in marzipan and unless this ingredient is specifically desired by the purchaser, I'd steer clear for that reason alone.<br /><br />I cook and bake in order to avoid additives, so this marzipan is particularly unacceptable for my use. Tallying up the plusses and minuses we have on the plus side, it is the correct texture for shaping and rolling out. On the minus side -- it is incredibly bland and is chemically enhanced with an artificial sweetener. Never again.
