While there were some lovely pods in my order, I received about a dozen of the same flavor, without notice, since the podmerchant's stock had been depleted. Some of the pods had expired, as well. I got this as a gift for my boss, so you can imagine it was more than a little embarrassing... Customer service wasn't much to speak of, either. They had a "what's the problem" response when I expressed disappointment with the lack of variety and the expired goods, and they were always traveling, so communication was slow. I can't recommend them, unless you really don't care what you get! The quality of the espresso was hit-or-miss. Most of them were mediocre or stale, so. Caveat emptor.
