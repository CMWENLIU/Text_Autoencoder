I think I've turned into a troll when it comes to this company; it turns out they don't use dedicated gluten-free lines in their production.  So, if you're baking with this because you have celiac, it might make you sick.<br /><br />And, to echo, "Gritty" above, I'll raise you one, 'gritty' and add, 'so gritty it's inedible'.  I spent a week of evenings trying to make gluten-free shortbread with this stuff:  it's like sand.<br /><br />After a long search, because a lot of what is sold as gluten free, either isn't, or is only 'legally' gluten free, meaning that on the day samples of it were tested it had only 20 ppm (or the company is claiming that), I found gluten free rice flour:  Koda farms in California only mills rice--and they are not expensive.  Look for their white rice flour under the name, "Kokuho Rose Premium Rice Flour" or "Diamond K", either from the Asian section of your grocery store, Koda farms online, or occasionally on Amazon.
