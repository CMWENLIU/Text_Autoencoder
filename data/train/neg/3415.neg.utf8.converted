The product description currently states that these nuts have "a hint of pepper."  Don't you believe it.  There's at least as much pepper on these as there is salt, and there's too much of both.  I can't taste anything but the pepper when I eat them, and they're so salty that I'm thirsty afterwards.  This is a terrible product, and the company needs to seriously scale back their seasonings.
