I have been letting my autistic daughter eat a bag of these every week for the past few years.  Since they were stocked at my local natural foods co-op and claimed to be "natural" I just assumed that they would come from GMO free corn.  It was not until I read the Cornucopia Institute's "Cereal Crimes" report that I read about so called "natural" cereals containing plenty of GMO's and pesticide residues, and often at a higher price than the organics.  Most of Barbara's Bakery's cereals are not organic so I looked a little closer at the ingredients on these cheese puffs too and realized that if we had wanted GMO's and pesticides just about any brand would have been fine.  I do admit though that Barbara's have a good taste.<br /><br />  "Natural" is a worthless title.  Best to stick with USDA certified organics.  I am switching to the Little Bear original baked cheese puffs instead. I didn't care for their Lite Cheese Puffs but he Baked are good.  Amazon has them at a reasonable price. We don't need GMO corn with a genetically engineered Bt pesticide circulating in our guts.<br /><br />  Barbara's Bakery, stop the deceptive advertising and provide an organic version of these!
