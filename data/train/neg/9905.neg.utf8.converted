After opening the box this item was basicly a 24oz bag of crumbs.  This is also not what I believed I was ordering.  Who the hell would pay 14 bucks for a 24oz bag of chips (I mean crumbs).  I believed I was ordering several bags of chips as it does mention there are 18 items.  Do not purchase this item.  It's a rip-off. I'll be contacting Amazon about this one.
