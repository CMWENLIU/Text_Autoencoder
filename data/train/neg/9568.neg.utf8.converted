I was shocked when I opened the shipping box and found the box of candy surrounded only by a small amount of brown crumpled paper. I thought, "This is lousy packing for fragile candy." I was right. I get better packing on EBay from independent sellers than I did from this COMPANY. The candy was a mess, ranging from pieces broken off to shattered to crushed into powder. Not only that, the wrappers were sticky with some actually gooey. What a disappointment. I was looking forward to trying some of their retro mixes, but I'm not about to waste my money for crushed, melted candy and OVERPRICED PRICED SHIPPING with LOUSY PACKING. Phooey.
