I read 10 reviews that said this was the greatest soy milk product and 1 review that said it had a funny after taste and recommended the Silk Soy. I have to agree with the one review. I'm not sure what it is but it has almost a medicinal taste. I was ordering Silk but the subscription service on Silk Vanilla Soy was cancelled by Amazon. I'm not sure why. I tried this brand but it really is not a good substitute.<br /><br />Who knew?
