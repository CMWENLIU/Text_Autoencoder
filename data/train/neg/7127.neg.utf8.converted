This highly reminds me of "THE NEW COKE" debacle. Until recently, Ovaltine was perfect in my opinion. It dissolved perfectly and uniformly. Tasted great, and was better than most other chocolate drinks in a nutritional sense. Now the formula has changed and I can't stand it. It looks, tastes and mixes like Nesquik. It takes the whole of five minutes of hand mixing to get it to dissolve. WHY? It doesn't taste as rich or of any form of real chocolate. In fact, it is nothing like the good old Ovaltine that I've always loved. It gets two stars because, independent of the old Ovaltine, I simply don't like it. In comparison, I'd give it one star for complete mockery. Whoever decided to change the recipe obviously didn't do their research or even listen to their customer base. I won't drink Ovaltine again until the recipe changes back. They should probably call it "Ovaltine Classic" or something to signify it's return.
