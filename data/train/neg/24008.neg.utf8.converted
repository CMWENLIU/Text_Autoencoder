I purchased these BIG FRANKS after reading the positive reviews and after enjoying other LOMA LINDA products.  I have NO idea what the 5-star reviewers ate because I could barely stomach these pseudo-food products.  I'm not sure what to do with the remaining cans because relish, catsup, onions, mustard and tons of other toppings failed to camouflage the rubbery off-taste of these "franks."  My conclusion is that I think I'll eat all the condiments and dispense with this red-grey monstrosity.<br /><br />UPDATE: After reading responses to my review, I realize that the way to appreciate these franks is to eat them during childhood WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER (sorry... just kidding... I couldn't resist).  Okay... If you don't acquire a taste for these during your imprintable years, be cautious about buying them now.  You've been warned.  GOOD LUCK.
