I ordered 'Davidson's Tea bing cherry with almond' for a friend who complained to me that she could not find cherry almond tea anymore.  The box of tea I received was discolored and had a dusty residue inside the shrinkwrap.  A closer examination showed weavil molts inside the wrapper.  I sealed the box in another plastic bag (I don't want weavils in my cupboards) and reported my findings to Amazon, asking for a refund.  I am pleased to report that I was promptly refunded the cost of the tea and the shipping.  I think this item must have been old and improperly stored.  I am glad that Amazon stands behind their products and will order again, altho for now I will not be ordering foods in boxes.
