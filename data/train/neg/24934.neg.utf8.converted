I am normally a Nature Valley fan, but I was highly disappointed with the product I recieved.  I had found that the Oat and Honey bars were stale and soft.  I contacted the seller online candy and they said they would not cover the product quality since it was in code of the sell date.  I contact Nature Valley who initially responded that they would help out with the product.  But after several attempts after the first response to figure out a fix to the problem I received no responses.  I am very disappointed.
