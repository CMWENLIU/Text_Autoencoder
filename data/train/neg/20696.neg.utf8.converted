The gardenia was packed very well, looked great, I followed the directions, but the plant appeared to be suicidal; it started losing leaves immediately.  They turned spotty black and brown, fell off, and I'm left with a nearly leaflass carcass.  However, it is still alive, I'm still following the instructions, and hope springs eternal.  My $9.00 gardenia from a Big Box store is thriving (Although Not a Bonsai), as are my other plants, so I  know it's not me.  Help!
