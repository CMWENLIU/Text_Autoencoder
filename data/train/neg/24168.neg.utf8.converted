Honestly... certain things are a huge rip off, and this is one of them. Horned melons you can grow yourself, in almost any climate zone. I live in northern Wisconsin, planted some seeds in doors in about March, and moved them outside in June... had fruit this summer. They have almost the same growth pattern as cucumbers... fast, viney, thorny and whatnot. If you want to have this fruit, buy a pouch of seeds from somewhere online, grow them yourself, eat some... and save some seeds for the following year. I also had success having it fruit in a five gallon pot, in my bedroom next to a east facing window... Took a little bit longer, but they did it!<br /><br />ALSO, these pictures don't show the truth behind the horns... they are sharp, they hurt, they will make you bleed... I suggest getting some thick winter gloves on and just take scissors and cut the points off.
