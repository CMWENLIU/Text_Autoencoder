On the website, the Genco packaging labels this as Olive Pomace Oil. What arrived was labeled in small lettering on a stick-on label, "Rape Pomace Oil," an oil made not only from rapeseed (canola) inferior oil, but from the leftover pomace of even that.  Although I bought this as a low quality oil acceptable for making olive oil soap, it is unsuitable even for that purpose.<br /><br />I was sadly misguided by all marketing sources leading me to this purchase. Please be careful, because this is priced almost equally with lower grade olive oils, which it is not.
