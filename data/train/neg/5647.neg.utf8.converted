I didn't enjoy this blend at all.  If you're a fan of Starbuck's coffee (which I think is so over-roasted it tastes burnt), then you won't enjoy this.  If you're looking for a lighter roast, this is a good price...but the flavor was simply the worst "Kona" blend I've ever tried.  Maybe your taste will be different!  I'll be moving on to a different blend.
