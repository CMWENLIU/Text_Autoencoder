I ordered this product based on the appealing picture, and the fact that it came up as "organic." It is not organic, and it's not "Granola," it's just baked oats with 6 pieces of dried cranberry. I counted them, 6. Nothing else. You can't return this because it's a grocery item. Terrible purchase, dont bother.
