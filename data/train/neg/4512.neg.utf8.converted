This is a really lousy quality food made primarily of corn and byproducts. Corn is a cheap filler which offers little nutritional value and byproducts, well self explanatory (leftovers when all the nutritious bits have been taken out for human consumption). Dont let your vet talk you into feeding this to your dogs. Vets do not receive any nutritional training besides what is offered to them by sales reps from Hills! Whats ironic is that this "food" is no better then any low end grocery store brand, yet you're expected to shell out as much as better quality brands. Check out dog food advisor website for complete product rating and pick a food that is safe and nutritious to feed.
