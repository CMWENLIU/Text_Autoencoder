This cider is pretty gross.  I actually ordered multiple types/flavors but none of them were any good.  If you select the largest cup size on the Kureg then you get a watered-down mess.  Even with the smaller sizes it tastes way too sweet an the fke sugar sweetener makes me gag.  Recommend people who do not like coffee to stick to the tea flavor K-cups.
