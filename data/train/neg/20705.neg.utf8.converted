I bought a can of this for the novelty of seeing how my cat would react to a can of cat food that cost almost a buck fifty.  He's normally not a picky eater and routinely eats canned Friskies or 9-Lives.  I opened the can and placed the contents into a clean feeding bowl and presented it to him in his normal feeding place on the counter (up away from the dog).  He took a sniff and recoiled from it.  I then offered him a can of his regular food that he happily ate.  Well, that didn't go well.  So I then offered it to our Lab/Golden mix, a dog that loves nothing more than snapping up the cat's food if it is left within her reach.  One sniff and she jerked her head back from it and walked away.  Next step was to fling it out into the back yard where the grackles (an omnivorous bird common to South Texas) scavenge for moldy bread, pizza bones, stale chips and pretty much anything else we toss out.  Nope, the grackles wouldn't touch it either.  But the fire ants love it.  They are all over it and within a few days it will be gone.
