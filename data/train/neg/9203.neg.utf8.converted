I sent this one back!!!  First the color is not as shown.  The pudding is a "gray" color (how appetizing is that!) not the vanilla color as shown.  Second the taste is horrible!  Not a hint of vanilla, just a medicinal flavor.  Yuk!  Got it for a family member who has chronic illness thinking it was a good way to keep up nutrients without neglecting taste.  I was wrong!  Yuk!!!
