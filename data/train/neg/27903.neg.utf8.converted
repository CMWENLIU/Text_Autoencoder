Rather than a sampler of different coffee types this appears to be a way to get rid of damaged or outdated goods and get paid for it.  There was not even a good sampling, as I had three each of several blends and not one of each as I would expect from a sampler.  Just about all of the individual K-Cups were damaged in one way or another as well.
