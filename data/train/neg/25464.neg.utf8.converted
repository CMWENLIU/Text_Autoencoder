I wanted to like this coffee as I appreciate the fair trade and organic policies of the company. However, I had my doubts from the moment I broke the seal on the can and there was no coffee smell whatsoever! There is hardly even an aroma when it brews! The taste is just bland with a slight bitterness, neither of which you want in a cup of coffee.<br /><br />Perhaps their whole bean might have been better, I don't know. I decided I'd try this for those mornings when you wake up and just don't want to take out the grinder and go through that process. Okay, I learned my lesson - it was a mistake!
