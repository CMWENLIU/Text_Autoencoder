Purchased four types of nuts from Bergin simultaneously to make large batch of trail mix for several of my brothers who frequently hike/mountain bike  with a group. I do the easy work by making their trail mix; they do the hard work - the hiking and biking!<br /><br />First time purchase of these Bergin cashews, filberts (hazelnuts) and pecans; second attempt at their almonds. (First purchase of Bergin almonds was horrible; stale, sticky, gummy & chewy even though the 'flavor' seemed ok. They were just terrible. But that was months ago so I thought I'd give it another try).<br /><br />So far, the filberts, almonds (this time around) and the pecans are terrifically yummy. It is the cashews this time that are useless. Waste of money. All packages were sealed by folded over cellophane bags (like those cheap, holiday treat bags) and closed with an adhesive label listing nutritional values. Could not determine reason for stale cashews, but then again, I couldn't determine reason for stale almonds months ago either.<br /><br />So, some good; some not so good. Unsure if I'd purchase from this company again, even if on sale. Guess it is the luck of the draw.
