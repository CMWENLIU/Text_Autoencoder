...this coffee tastes horrible.<br /><br />Having not learned my lesson to never look a gift horse in the mouth, I complain every chance I get about this smelly swill my employer buys to caffeinate the troops. In fact, it is this sort of indiscretion that lead me to bringing my own press pots, digital gram scale, and Costco french roast (yes, lowly mass-batched beans!) to work.<br /><br />If all you're looking for is a caffeine buzz, this will do the trick. But the cost is an acidic after taste that camps out on the tongue for the next few hours. Usually, I equate lighter roasts such as these with "inoffensive," i.e. suitable for general audiences, including those who don't want a coffee to overwhelm them. Some (myself included) might even say "bland."  In acts of desperation when supplies are running low, I've supplemented my mellow dark roast with a scoop or two of this -- and its "flavor" adds a sour exclamation point that can't be masked.<br /><br />I'm not the only one who detests this brew: a few of my coworkers have similar sentiments, though are either too cheap to bring their own, or just aren't as passionate (aka abnormal) as I. And maybe this is work's way of cutting down on coffee consumption, which isn't all bad since there are Peet's and Starbucks nearby.
