I ordered two dozen Barnum's Animal Crackers for my son's first birthday party which was circus themed. I thought these crackers would be perfect favors for the kids because it had circus animals on the box. But to my disappointment, when the boxes arrived they were the blue Holiday box with a polar bear on it. (I'm assuming it's because I ordered them in early January? But still!) Plus, they were stale! Ewww. I wish I would've known that's what I would be receiving otherwise I wouldn't have ordered them. I ended up going to Target to buy the original ones.
