I shopped around a little after purchasing this antler chew, and I really don't think this one was a good deal. It is about 6 inches long, as advertised, but pretty thin. Also my dog, who usually goes crazy for elk antlers, isn't really interested in chewing it. I recommend ordering from Grateful Shed Antler Chews instead.
