Arizona Iced Tea products are terrific - except the powder substitute.  This product while purported to be Arizona Arnold Palmer Half and Half has 0 likeness to the canned and bottled products.  I tried extra water and less water and still all I get is a gritty tastless product.  I am sold on the bottled product - I will not buy this poor imitation again.
