I love this soup and it is somewhat hard to find in stores. This is why I bought it on Amazon. However the order arrived with half of the cans dented (a couple of them really bad). This should not happen and it is a health issue. I would not buy them in this condition at the supermarket. Amazon should have inspected them before sending them.
