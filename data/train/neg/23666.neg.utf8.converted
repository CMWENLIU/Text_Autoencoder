I am a huge mac n cheese fan, and can usually eat any brand, but this is the worst macaroni I have ever tasted. I agree with the other customers who said it was too runny. Even if the consistency was good it still has a bad taste. I don't like to waste food, so it was all I could do to eat the entire bowl. I will definitely not be purchasing this product again.
