I chose Westbrae's canned beans because they are organic. However, since then I've discovered that Westbrae uses cans with BPA in the lining.<br /><br />With BPA lining the cans and research showing solid levels of the chemical leeching from cans and plastics into containers' contents, showing up in Americans' blood streams (from infants to the elderly), I don't think the product can still be called organic!<br /><br />BPA leeching into our food is no better or safer than products sprayed with pesticides.<br /><br />At least pesticides can be washed off many foods (not all, but some). Most people, though, just empty cans of foods, like beans and tomatoes, directly into their recipes without thinking of washing them first. (How does one rinse or wash soup?) In fact, many people like the salt and other seasonings in canned foods. They believe it is safe to use the foods as they are in the can, which is a reasonable assumption since that is how such products are marketed.<br /><br />I know I quit adding salt to my own recipes containing canned foods many years ago, because the canned goods already had salt in them. The canning process is supposed to kill bacteria and preserve nutrition, just as home canning does. It wasn't until the information came out about BPA in our bloodstreams, and from where most of us are exposed to it, that I realized there was a problem using such foods as is. There are still many Americans who do not yet realize that there is a problem and they are unwittingly feeding that problem to their families.<br /><br />There is something especially unethical and tragic about people paying a company higher prices for organic foods, thinking they are better protecting their health, only to be swallowing BPA with each mouthful.<br /><br />Until Westbrae stops using BPA lined cans or stops claiming the organic label and charging organic prices, I can't give high marks for either context.
