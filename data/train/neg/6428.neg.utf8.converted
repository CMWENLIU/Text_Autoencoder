A few weeks ago, I sent a complaint to Lindt via their web site and did receive a very nice email  response.  It mirrored pretty much what the web site says about the overwhelming positive response.<br /><br />Here's the funny part:  I was in a Lindt store last week and complained about the recipe change.  The sales person said that they've been receiving numerous complaints from previously-happy 70% customers.  And yes, the reason for the change in taste is that the bar is being manufactured in the US now, with a soya emulsifier and less cocoa butter.<br /><br />As I mentioned in my email to Lindt...  I hope they don't have the same PR disaster Coca-Cola had when they "improved" their recipe.
