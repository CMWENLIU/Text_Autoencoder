Verbac products in general have been SUPERIOR in my opinion, especially the HEXtra chews. I thought I'd give these VeggieDent Chews a try for some variety. Here's the problem - since these are marketed as a means to clean a dogs teeth, I would expect them to last a while during which the chewing and gnawing action would indeed help the dogs teeth, but here's the snag, I have a small-to-medium size dog and he went through one of these chews in minutes, whereas the HEXtra chews last much longer. There wasn't any "chewing" involved, the dog just bit the VeggieDent Chew and it breaks off into smaller semi-sharp shards and only chews momentarily then its gone. I would have expected these chews to have a more chewy consistency rather than a hard consistency so a dog couldn't just bite through the chew and swallow the smaller pieces. I cannot possibly fathom any benefit to the dog's teeth in terms of removing plaque or reducing tarter. I wouldn't buy these again and will stick with the HEXtra line of chews.
