You get what you pay for...  I was excited to see Turkish Antep Pistachios at this price, but was disappointed when I began eating them.  They were not as flavorful as other nuts I have eaten.  Yes, I paid more for those, but if I had it to do over, I would have spent the extra money to enjoy the true flavor of Antep pistachios.
