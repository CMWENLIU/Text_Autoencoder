Its unfair to rate chocolate I have not tried yet so I am really only commenting on the condition for which it arrived. Not on the taste.<br /><br />As it seems others have suffered the same fate, 5LBS of chocolate unsecured in a large box with no packing materials is no match for the Holiday Postal Rush. The real problem was it was a Holiday purchase, so now I am scrambling to find a suitable replacement. I thought about gifting it anyway and blaming a small child or a disgruntled postal worker but in reality Amazon should have used the care they usually use when sending a book or video and cellophane it to the cardboard. So while Amazon quite possibly saved my friend from Diabetes ... it put me in position of finding another gift with only days to spare.
