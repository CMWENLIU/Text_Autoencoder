This is the worst honey I have ever tried. I bought it based on 2 excellent reviews here but I don't understand how anyone could have given this product more than 1 star. Not even sure this is real honey. Unlike real honey, this one is very runny... but that would not bother me too much. The problem is the "taste" of this. Imagine glue mixed with cigarette ash and sugar... that's what this tastes like. Sadly, I bought 3 bottles with s&s... not sure what I'll do with it, I feel bad donating something so foul tasting to the food bank...<br />Do yourself a favor and order real honey... this sewage is only good for pouring down the sewer... yuck!
