Agree with the other reviewer. This product claims to be safe for diabetics, yet the first ingredient listed is maltodextrin, not stevia! I am a diabetic, and maltodextrin spikes my blood sugar just as much as table sugar does. It should not be legal for sugar substitutes to use this ingredient, and say "safe for diabetics" on the label, when it is not!  I was so upset that I had this product and had been using it before realizing that it had maltodextrin in it. It had not even occured to me that I needed to check the ingredients on a package that said it is STEVIA. I'd understand if it said it is a stevia blend like some others, but this is marketed as a natural, diabetic friendly product and it isn't.<br /><br />There are a lot "sugar free" products out there that also contain maltodextrin. I was not expecting to find it in what I thought was a natural sweetener.
