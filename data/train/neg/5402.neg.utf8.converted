I have two complaints about this product.<br /><br />First, for some reason, every one of the 24 cups brewed in my Keurig came out at four ounces instead of 12 ounces. I have no idea why. I pressed the large cup of coffee button on my machine, and four ounces of coffee came out.  I pressed the small cup of coffee button on the machine and four ounces of coffee came out.  After two years of using the Keurig, the Grove Square is the only product line this happens for.<br /><br />Second, it's instant coffee. For being instant coffee, it has a decent flavor.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed with this product. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone.
