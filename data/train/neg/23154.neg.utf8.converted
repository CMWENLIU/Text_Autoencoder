Have you ever experienced a whole-body shudder? If not, this will give you one.<br />If anyone in my family consumes something that is poisonous and we need to induce vomiting to save them from it, I'll give them a taste of this Walden Farms product and surely they will live. I can't even begin to describe the taste or texture of this product in any way that is acceptable to Amazon; but if you can get some Smuckers Sugar Free caramel sauce then do it! Avoid the Walden Farms product unless you just love torture!
