was really looking forward to this shipment--I remember Sapporo from my younger years in San Fran.  Spice packs were everything I remembered and loved but the noodles had a funny "off" taste, like the oil they used to fry them was waaaay past prime.  Finally just ripped out the spice packets and used ramen noodles from grocery store.  will not order again.
