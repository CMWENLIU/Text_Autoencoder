this product is o.k. but i think you can get away w/out it and be fine ...not really worth the money. CONS: it only makes a very small amount of food at once. if I am going through the trouble, i'd rather make a bigger batch and freeze it. Also, the lid on the resevoir gets so hot and is shaped oddly so that it is difficult to get a grip of it to take off. a serious caution, the booklet i got w/ mine (purchased in 2008) has recipes that include foods that you are not supposed to give to babies under a year old!!!!!finally, the blend mode does not have an optional 'stay on' so that if you want to puree something, you need to stand there and hold the button. you can't do something else while it's blending b/c you need to be right there to keep it running. PROS: technically, it does what it says it does, and it is easy to clean. I find that even though i own this, i tend to use my good old pan w/ a steamer basket and then puree in my food processor. works just as well, saves time, and makes more at once.
