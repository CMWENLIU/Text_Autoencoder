I was using Dabur Amla Hair oil for many years and realized that it is mineral oil (Paraffinum Liquidum) and it is petroleum product and NOT a organic oil. It has Zero percent<br />(0 %) hair penetration. I have started using and trying different oils including coconut oil, and Til (Sesame) oil. I loved both - Coconut and Til oil from different company including any local Ayurvedic company in/from India which has herbs into it.<br /><br />Coconut and Til oil has more than 90% hair penetration after overnight use and I am telling this after I searched and reviewed some studies done on hair products, especially, oil. Dabur do have other hair oils product (e.g. Vatika) which has coconut oil and so if you pleased then can use that. But local Ayurvedic are far better than big brand for hair oil.<br /><br />Hope that help you a bit. Thanks.
