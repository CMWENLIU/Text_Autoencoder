These seeds got to me very quickly ...And for cooking I'm sure there fine...But they are very clean seeds washed washed washed ...No taste... no oil....Might as well buy them from the supermarket...Complete TEA USELESS....I think some of the other reviewers may work for the company....Look Elsewhere folks....
