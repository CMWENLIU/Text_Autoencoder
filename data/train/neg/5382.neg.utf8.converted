If you love the old "Sanka" instant coffee from years ago than this product is for you.  However, if you are like the rest of us who like a good cup of "joe" in morning get us going then STAY AWAY FROM THIS!!  Good coffee usually urges you for more.....this is crying "no more please...I can't bear the pain much longer".  Absolutely disgusting!!
