I was really looking forward to receiving a sample of jerky to try. However, of the 10 items five were antelope sticks and two were ostrich sticks. So for 10 possible different flavors I only received five and 50% was one flavor.  Furthermore they were all date stamped before the date I ordered. I certainly hope that is not a sell by date.  This is not what I expected.
