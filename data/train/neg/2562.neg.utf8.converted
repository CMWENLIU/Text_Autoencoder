Initially I liked this product very much. I like the taste and texture, and the three shipments I've received have all been fresh. I have not had any problems with "stale" or "chalky" shipments as described by some other reviewers.<br /><br />However, I became suspicious of whether it is really "low glycemic" as claimed, because it tastes sweeter than one would expect for a sugar-free low-carb product. Looking more closely at the ingredients, I noticed that it contains maltitol, which is a "sugar alcohol." The maltitol in the product contributes 11 grams of carbs to each bar (for a total of 24 grams of carbs).<br /><br />I've read that if you're on a low-carb diet, maltitol should probably be avoided, because it is a carb, and it does have an effect on blood sugar.<br /><br />Also, maltitol can cause intestinal discomfort and/or diarrhea, if you're sensitive to it, or eat too much of it.<br /><br />I have switched to Greens+ High Protein bars (peanut butter flavor), which are fairly low glycemic for this type of product but do not have artificials sweeteners or maltitol. (And no, I do not work for Greens+).<br /><br />Disclaimer: I'm not a nutritionist. You can google maltitol if you want to find out more.
