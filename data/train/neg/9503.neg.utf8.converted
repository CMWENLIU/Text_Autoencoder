Normally, my cats all love crunchy treats. I've seen them try to chew into the packs to get to the treats. I have 3 cats, a 13 year old male, a 1 year old male, and a 1 year old female.<br /><br />I gave them all some of these treats. The two males ate three pieces each and left the rest. Well, actually, the younger male tried to bury the ones that were left, making the same motions he does in the litter box. The female ate five pieces and then was done; she would not touch the others' leftovers.<br /><br />I have never in my life seen any cats walk away from treats like these. And since the recommended amount for teeth cleaning is 5 pieces twice a day, these obviously are not going to work even if the cats could be persuaded to try them again, if three is all they can stand.<br /><br />Looking at how the cats were chewing them, I might guess that these were _too_ crunchy for them to enjoy. But that wouldn't explain why the one cat thought the treats should be buried.
