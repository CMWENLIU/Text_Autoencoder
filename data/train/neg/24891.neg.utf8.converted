I started a diet a few months ago.  I found that portion control is one of the most important factors when I have an occasional treat.  One of these small bags of cookies is a favorite treat of mine.<br /><br />I was able to buy this item where I lived before but they are not carried in the area where I now live.  When I ordered this item, I was under them impression that when it said pack of 6, it meant that I would get six boxes with six bags of cookies in each.  Nope.  I only got one box with six bags of cookies in it.<br /><br />This is a royal rip-off.  Do not buy these cookies on-line.  These cost only a few bucks in the grocery store.
