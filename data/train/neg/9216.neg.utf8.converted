I really wanted to like this tea. I drink a lot of ice tea in the summer, but hate taking up a lot of shelf space in the refrigerator. I always drink unsweetened tea, fairly strong. I was pleased that this tea came out strong enough that I could add more ice and even some water, but I was disappointed in the flavor. To me it tastes exactly like Nestea instant tea powder. Yuck!<br />I am thinking about trying some of the "sweet tea" options, but if they are just sweet flavors over the same yucky base, I don't think it would be an improvement.<br />Stick to putting a tea bag in a glass and boiling some water through your Keurig.
