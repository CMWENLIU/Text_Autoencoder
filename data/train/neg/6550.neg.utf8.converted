I realize that this is one of the best cat foods out there ... but none of my four cats will eat it.  And really, my cats aren't that picky.  I'd mixed it with the remaining grocery store brand to introduce them to it slowly.  However, my cats pick out every single piece of the old stuff and leave the Wellness CORE behind.  I bet eventually they'll have to eat it, but boy are they NOT interested in it.
