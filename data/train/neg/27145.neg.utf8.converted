I ordered this coffee the first time about a year ago, and it was amongst the best beans that ever passed through my Jura espresso maker. At the time the packaging also looked like the one shown on this picture (black).<br /><br />However, I since reordered twice, and in both cases the coffee has a horrible, burned aftertaste, probably from getting burned in the roasting process. This coincided with a change in the packaging style (which is now green). As a matter of fact, I am having a cup of it as I write this, and I can't wait for the beans to be finished so I can put something else into my machine again.<br /><br />NOT recommended as it is now! If you ask me, go with the "Biodynamic" (whatever that means...) French Roast instead, I just had that and is was GREAT!
