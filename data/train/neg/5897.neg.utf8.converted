I learned about Zevia in Jorge Cruise's "Belly Fat Cure" and I love ginger ale.  So I tried it.  I am very sorry to say that it is far too sweet for me.  I have to fill it with 50% water, which spoils the carbonation.  I'm thinking SweetLeaf Stevia Ginger Ale in carbonated water might be better.  I used to make my own ginger ale from real ginger.  I think I'm going to go back to homemade.
