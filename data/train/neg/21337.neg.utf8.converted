SENSEO owners be aware - these pods won't fit in your machine. They are just too big for the single pod holder but yet too small for the double pod holder. The standard SENSEO pods have about 7.5-8 g of coffee per pod, these have 10g. I used 10g pods before (e.g. Barnie's 58006 Hazelnut Flavored Single Cup Coffee Pods) which fit if you press them into the holder before you close the lid, but these are just too large.
