Enjoy Life has reformulated these bars and they are now virtually inedible. My sons brought one home today as they thought it had mold. It was likely just the dark chocolate having been exposed to cold (it gets that white coating). However, the bar did not look right - it was dense and rubbery. I contacted the company since it was a product problem as far as I was concerned and not an Amazon problem - they told me about the reformulation saying their customers wanted this "improvement".  They offered a coupon for a free box, but I already have 5 boxes that my sons will not eat.  This is really sad that what was a really good GF product has been made virtually inedible and that the company is very confused about this. I tried one of the old and new bars a few minutes ago and agree 100% with my sons. The sadest thing is that my son's friend at school loved these bars and he doesn't even have to eat GF (which is a big endorsement for any allergen-free product) - he also found the bars inedible and thought they were moldy.<br /><br />The only issue that I would attribute to Amazon is that I have these on subscribe and save and I feel that I should have been notified when the product changed, since this is NOT the product I had subscribed to. They are no longer labeled clearly as "Coco Loco".
