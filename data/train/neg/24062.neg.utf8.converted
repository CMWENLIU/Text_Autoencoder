I bought this bulk packaging because it is a favorite blend that is used daily in the office. However, the description of "Pack of six 40-count boxes" was less descriptive than was useful. Upon opening one of the six boxes the internal foil packet had 4 tea bags in each and each tea bag was smaller than a "normal" tea bag. I had to use two to get the same strength as I usually do. The "savings" were not worth the hassle of dealing with open packets that needed to be stored, and doubling up on tea bags. I was disappointed because I love Bigelow teas. I will continue to buy Bigelow, but not in bulk.
