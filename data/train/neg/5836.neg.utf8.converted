I was impressed by the price, so I ordered these.  They are horrible...hard as rocks, stale-tasting, full of stems, and they leave a bad after taste in the mouth.  I am a raw vegan and use lots of goji berries; I have never experienced any as awful as these.<br /><br />Perhaps this is only a bad batch, as others seem to have gotten good ones.  If that's the case, then the company has terrible qualitycontrol, as well as terrible goji berries.
