I purchased based on reviews here and was very dissapointed. I had just finished a bulk order of Bigelow Earl Grey from here at amazon, and it was REALLY good. I just thought, oh, a boutique tea with good reviews ought to be better...NO. Save your money and go with the Bigelow (Bigelow Earl Grey Tea, 40-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)), no kidding.
