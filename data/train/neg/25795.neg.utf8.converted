Wanted to know what the ingrients was for the natural flavors because it can be 1500 different toxic things including MSG. Yummy earth refused to answer the question on many attempts. Just another company making us think it is ok for our children when it really is not. If you are concerned email the company and ask them for an exact ingredient list for just one item and see what happens. Just a concerned mom who truely wants to eat organic and not have the wool pulled over my eyes.
