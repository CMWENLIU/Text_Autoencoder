As others have also mentioned, my cat got struvite crystals and this was the primary food he was given. He needed emergency surgery to clean out his bladder, and it was awful to see him suffering. I too bought this because it was listed as one of the best on the market, and both my cats were eating it but one of them nearly died because of this diet. After talking with others that had pets with bladder blockage problems, some indicate that the name "Wellness" in often association. I can't help but think that his ailment must have something to do with this food. While I can't say it was THE cause because my other cat didn't get sick, this certainly didn't prevent it and was most of his diet. I am switching to a wet or canned diet for my cat, and I am definitely not using this brand ever again. And I don't think you should risk it.<br /><br />Also, I hope others who have this experience will write reviews because a food that charges a premium for its purported high quality shouldn't have such terrible effects on any pets--even if it is just a marginal amount.
