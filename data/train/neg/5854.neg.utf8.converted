Newtons Fruit Thins Fig and Honey, 10.5-Ounce<br />I love fig newtons and thought this would be a great, low-sugar snack food. I was surprised to find that there was only a hint of the fig newton taste. There are bits of fig in the cookie, but it is hard and not really appealing. The cookie itself is crisp and a pretty good size but the overall taste is bland to me. Also, it isn't overly sweet which is nice but I wish it tasted more like fig newtons. For the price and taste I will be looking elsewhere for alternatives to cookies and the like.
