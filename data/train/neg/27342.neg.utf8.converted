I really wanted my kittens to like Avoderm canned foods but sadly none were a hit. This formula was the first to be shunned. It has a nice pate texture to it but the color was seemingly odd, like an orange. I've since plated two other Advo formulas, purchased from two different vendors and got the same poor results. This brand is usually in the top 5 best cat foods out there if you feed grain free and or human grade. I'm really bummed this food isn't being accepted. Maybe when they're older they'll have more of a palate for it.<br /><br />I'm giving this review only 1 star only due to my own experience. I'm sure others are very happy with it.
