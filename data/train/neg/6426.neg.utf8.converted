This used to be one of my favorite chocolate bars before they ruined it with soy lecithin.  I've been reading the other reviews and I'm really happy to see so many people saying the same thing.  My wife sent an e-mail to Lindt and they wrote back saying they had done extensive market research and had gotten positive feedback on the new recipe.  I have a very hard time believing that.<br />I have found some good alternatives but they more expensive.  Michel Cluizel 72% Noir de Cacao is very good but not as easy to find and about twice as expensive as the Lindt bar.  I hope Lindt will come to their senses and change it back.
