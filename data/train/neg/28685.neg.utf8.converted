These sticks don't smell like peanut butter at all, so my dog didn't like them... though she goes absolutely gaga over real peanut butter. Also these sticks are much softer than the beef flavor, which my dog likes. After begrudgingly eating a couple of these, she barfed, and has not wanted them since. If you need to buy this, go for the beef flavor!!
