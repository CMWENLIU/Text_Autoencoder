This cocoa is not the same as the cocoa in the can with the same name and label. It has no ground chocolate in it and that's what makes it good. This cocoa isn't any better than Swiss Miss. In fact, Swiss Miss is probably better. A real disappointment and I feel cheated because it's not as advertised.
