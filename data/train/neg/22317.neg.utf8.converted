The item is called "3pk 6 Inch Premium..."  and the description says "3 Come in each Package" suggests 3 packs of 3 bully sticks for a total of 9 as "pk" facially appears to be a contraction for "Package."  Not the case.  There is exactly three (3) bully sticks total.  While some may say 'one can never assume,' one can also say 'if the seller isn't absolutely clear, they will get downvotes.'
