The item arrived today and i was not a happy camper with upon opening the box. 1 bag of 24 oz when the description says "Red Mill Organic Steel Cut Oats ( 4x24 OZ)" I called swanson and they brushed me off and wouldnt try to fix the issue. We used to buy vitamins from them buy i plan not to in the future. Amazon is being quite helpful in resolving the issue.
