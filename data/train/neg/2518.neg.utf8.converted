I only get these when I forget to order my regular brand (Spectrum); my local GNC has Nutiva. Every bag has had dirt in it and a couple have had other 'foreign' hard objects. I have to look at every spoon as I eat to make sure nothing other than chia is included. I tried to find a better way to clean them, but of course.. water is not an option. I do buy these locally when in a pinch, but I would never, ever order them.
