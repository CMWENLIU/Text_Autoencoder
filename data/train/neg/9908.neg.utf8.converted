I have been buying dried peaches all the time through Sahara. My local store has increased the price this year and I started looking on Amazon. Found this one and ordered. It took almost a month to arrive and smells terrible. I am pretty sure that the manufacturer used Sulfur dioxide to process the peaches and left this stinky smell. I was in a hurry to travel to EU for a month right after I received the peaches and was not able to file a return. Do not buy if you care about your health. The product description does not include using this chemical for processing. I gave one start because I could not give lower.
