This was one of the worst tasting coffee's I have ever tried. Something must be wrong with the batch, mis packed or everyone else who reviewed this is nuts.<br /><br />I have to assume there was some kind of problem with the beans. It was bland and lacked flavor. The beans looked nothing like any espresso beans I have ever seen. No real crema, yuck.<br /><br />Sending them back, why suffer?
