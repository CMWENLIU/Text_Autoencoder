I just tried this--love the taste but hated all of the hard seeds from the flax.I have false teeth and it was impossible to eat without them getting stuck everywhere. Probably great for youngsters who like chunky things, but not for me.I wish they had ground up the flaxseeds--then it would have been perfect!
