I mean it's just mac n cheese, no frills needed.  just the classic mac n cheese.. awesome.  It was fresh, unexpired, and I didn't have to leave the house lol. :)<br /><br />------<br /><br />Update:  It used to be $11.49 which was a fair deal considering you're buying quantity.  There was no need to raise the price, you guys were making money already.  Such a big jump in price just brought the stars down to 2 until you guys stop being greedy (price vs quality = lower stars). It's called low budget food for a reason. It's $1 per box in the stores by themselves and it's like 50 cents if you buy in bulk.  My mac n' cheese addiction is not worth $2 per box.
