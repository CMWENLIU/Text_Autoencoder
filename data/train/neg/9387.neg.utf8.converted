This is my first ever product review. I did not purchase this product from Amazon, but my local Whole Foods market just a couple days ago. Normally I'm not one to do reviews, but since this product is so expensive, I wanted to share my experience.<br /><br />I've been working really hard recently to cut my sugar intake. After reading rave reviews on Amazon about Sweet Tree Coconut Palm sugar, and doing a little research, I debated for 2 weeks, and then decided to just go get some even though it was $5 for a pound. (my health is more important) I started out by using some in my steel cut oats yesterday, which I really liked! I also used it in my coffee yesterday in place of regular sugar, but I noticed little dark things floated to the top. I know it's pretty raw, so I figured, maybe they were little fibers from the tree, or perhaps it was something with that batch of coffee? So I just scooped the little dark floaters out, and drank my coffee. Which tasted pretty good with the palm sugar! I was so pleased, that I was very excited to have my coffee this morning with my new found sweetener.<br /><br />This morning (not more than 10 minutes ago) I made some coffee again with my palm sugar, and before I even had a chance to drink it... more little floaters! As I pushed them to the sides of my white cup, one I noticed for sure had LEGS on it! Yes, my friends... it was a BUG!! I dumped my coffee imediately, and made some more with(unfortunately) my raw organic sugar that I still have. No floaters. So it's definitely not in the coffee... it's in the palm sugar! Has anyone else had an experience/noticed this? I know it's supposed to be healthier and all... but for $5 I'd like my sugar to not have little bugs in it. That's NOT the extra minerals I had in mind! Maybe I just got a bad bag?  It's not my intention to bad mouth this company -- but I would want someone to tell me if they knew I was eating/drinking little bugs. I haven't contacted the company just yet, as I just noticed it for sure this morning. I also looked in the bag that I have, and can see others... one is caked in sugar crystals, so they're hard to notice unless you really look for them.
