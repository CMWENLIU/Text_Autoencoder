Can you leave NO stars marked for a rating? We waited since JUNE. 7. and got the pack of 12 boxes today, July 27.<br /><br />As of last night when I printed out the tracking info for my Mom, it had the picture of and title for, SUN MAID Raisin Muffin Mix.<br /><br />NOW, we open the package and it's Krusteaz, the photo is Krusteaz NOW, but it still says "Sun Maid Raisin Mix" if I scroll the mouse over the photo AND, it still says "Sun Maid Raisin Mix" on the title.<br /><br />I am NOT.  NOT.  Happy.  To wait all this time and then it's Krusteaz the Klown junk?  No.  If I wanted Krusteaz I would have bought it nearly 2 months ago.  I wanted the SUN MAID as a gift for my Mother.<br /><br />I am not happy. Does Amazon not notify people when there is a change of product?
