I have long been a fan of Lindt bars, and this one was no exception, although I do agree with another reviewer that most of the flavoring of this particular bar comes from sugar (19 grams, or about 1.5 tablespoons per serving!) and milk.  I was especially disappointed, though, to discover that this bar contains "artificial flavoring".  Read the label.  Apparently, some of their other products do as well.  Such a disappointment from what I thought was a gourmet chocolatier.
