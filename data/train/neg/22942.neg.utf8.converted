At first this didn't taste like anything.  By time I added enough Mio to taste something, I was then disgusted by the flavor.  I like tea, truly I do.  This is not tea.  But I've found a few ways to describe this flavor:<br /><br />Sucking on brown saccharine?<br /><br />Chewing on stale aspirin?<br /><br />Someone dropped a cigarette butt in my water?<br /><br />Sweaty gym socks were wrung out in my glass?<br /><br />Someone left used motor oil on the bottom of my glass?<br /><br />This  drink is a great idea but a terrible rendering of such.  My teenager wanted to try it and I'm tempted to do a science experiment on him.  We call him Big Foot and I'm wondering if it would stop the growth of said feet.  I don't want him to stop growing taller (6'2" now) so I wonder if I sprinkle it directly on his feet, if that would work?  I'll get back to you.<br /><br />I keep trying to figure out how people like this.  I've finally figured it out and I have a message for them:  WATER is not spelled V.O.D.K.A
