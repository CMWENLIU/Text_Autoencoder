After trying the Caledonian Kitchen Irish Whiskey Cake, I found it dull and a disappointment to a palate that has been gifted with some of Britons finest Cakes. It is not moist as it should be. It has only a slight hint of Whiskey certainly not obtained from the top shelf. It became pasty as I permitted it to blend in my mouth. The pecans are ground so fine they are lost in the breading and produce only a hint of flavour. If one was to remove the Irish Whiskey from this product you would have a basic run of the mill raisin nut cake that is best eaten with a tall glass of milk to assist in washing it down. In my years I have had numerous authentic Irish Whiskey Cakes including living 3 years in the midlands of England. Tasting a good Irish whiskey cake will initially produce a moist nutty texture on the tongue followed by a moderate but not over powering bath of Irish Whiskey to the palate. It blends with the saliva and becomes similar to a bread pudding texture almost immediately complimented by the raisins. As one swallows, the aroma of the Whiskey remains in the mouth and can be sensed in the nose. It should be moderately sweet, the Whiskey delicate, and the nuts and raisins a compliment to the texture. Even at the low price I would not purchase this product again as it insults the refined integrity of a traditional Irish Whiskey Cake. Most Irish Whiskey cakes will cost you in the neighborhood of $15-20 per pound. I would regard this product to a good Irish Whiskey cake the same as Meatloaf to a Prime Rib.
