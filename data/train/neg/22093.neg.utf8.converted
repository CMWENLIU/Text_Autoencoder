I read positive reviews here and my local grocer said he had heard positive comments from customers.  So I purchased a bottle.  Took it home, shook it up, poured a bit into a teaspoon and tasted it.  Oh my, I nearly gagged.  There was only the slightest hint of a chocolate/cocoa flavor.  With a nasty after-taste.  I then shook the bottle up well and tried again.  No difference.<br /><br />I thought it might taste better if chilled and put on ice cream.  So I tried that a few days later.  Ugh!  That was awful too.  Couldn't finish eating the ice cream.<br /><br />Had my wife try it and she hated it.  So I poured the remaining 95% of the contents down the drain and recycled the bottle.  I honestly don't know how anyone can eat the stuff.
