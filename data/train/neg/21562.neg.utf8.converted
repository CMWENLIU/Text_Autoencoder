My fault for not realizing how small the 7-lbs "jugs" are -- I was thinking of them as the "small" jugs, which in my mind are the 14-lb ones. I've never even seen 7-lb containers before.  They are so small, 1 literally filled up the litter tray when I changed it -- almost. So I completely overpaid for in essence 1 21-lb jug of litter -- over $20! Again, my fault for not reading more carefully, but it's a TOTAL rip-off. Don't make the same mistake!
