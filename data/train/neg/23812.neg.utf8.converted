Got this for myself since I do usually enjoy Numi tea bags.<br /><br />Howerver, I would NEVER consider giving this to any one as a gift!<br /><br />The box itself is very flimsy, the tea pot is a joke!  There was no strainer included, the lid of the pot, does not even fit on the pot!  It's very dangerous to pour hot tea when the lid does not want to sit on the pot!  Yes, it was cool to see the flowers unfold, but it ends there.<br /><br />The color & the flavor is just not as impressive as what I had expected.<br /><br />I wanted to return the item, but LATER found out that as a "grocery" item, it is NOT returnable!  I wish that had been noted on the item page or before I checked out!!!  I do not recommend this item at all!
