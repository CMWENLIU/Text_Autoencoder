I saw the words Natural Flavors on the label of this bottle.  Since this notation is used to hide monosodium glutamate (MSG), a flavor enhancer, I called the number on the bottle.  The woman at Walnut Acres said the Natural Flavor included a vegetable extract but not MSG as the law requires the ingredient to be labeled if used. The law really states it is required by the FDA that food manufacturers list the ingredient "monosodium glutamate" on food labels, but they do not have to label ingredients that contain free glutamic acid, even though it's the main component of MSG. Glutamic acid is an extract of a seaweed which certainly is classified as a vegetable.  Glutamic acid is a slow killer which should be banned but I regret to say our FDA is not always acting in our best interests. What is also sad is that this company tries to pass this off as Organic.  I will add that the juice did not taste very good and certainly did not taste like cranberry juice.
