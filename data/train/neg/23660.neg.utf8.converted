I bought a 2 lb. bag directly from the factory in Fairfield, CA not from Amazon so I don't know if there might be quality or freshness differences.  The jelly beans were stale and hard.  And the bag says "Product of Thailand" which was a surprise since it supposedly came from CA's factory.  In the past the belly flops were odd doubles or strange shapes packaged in a plain bag which also gave them a quirky appeal but these looked normal and are packaged like any other retail candy.  I much preferred the old flops.
