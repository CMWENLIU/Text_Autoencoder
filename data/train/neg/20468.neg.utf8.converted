I'm used to the Tazo Chai concentrate. Tried this because the grocery store ran out of the Tazo mix. First of all, this stuff is way too sweet (even when using 1/4 mix with 3/4 milk). The spices are barely there (with 1/2 mix 1/2 milk). The tea did leave my mouth dry. Will not purchase again, wondering if I should dump the rest down the sink. I'm going back to Tazo.
