I used to eat a lot of Tinkyada pasta until I read that rice grown in the US South may contain high levels of arsenic. According to Tinkyada, their rice is grown in Arkansas. I emailed them to find out if they had tested their rice for arsenic.  I never received a reply.  Their website does not address the issue either.  Until they print assurances that their rice is safe, I plan to avoid all their products.<br /><br />Lundberg rice, which is grown in California, is safe from arsenic according to the company.
