Does not work as advertised.<br /><br />When I input into my centrifuges, it just made a mess instead of depleted uranium ore that I could turn into plutonium.  Very inconvenient for a man who is looking to have delusions of grandeur.<br /><br />However, when baked in an oven, it makes a delicious treat.  I recommend combining the oven-baked product with a product known as "icing".  No, "icing" does not cause anything to freeze.
