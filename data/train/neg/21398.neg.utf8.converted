I can usually eat just about anything, but this my friends is the worst thing I have ever put into my mouth. The smell was absolutely horrible, reminded me of something that died weeks ago. I actually purchased this believing it was actual chicken noodle soup, until I get home and realize it is a fake chicken. I spent almost $7 on 2 cans of this stuff, too bad I can't get my money bad. This stuff is so bad that if God exist I wouldn't be surprised if the maker is eternally punished for the sin of making this atrocity. I'm just playing about the last sentence, just trying to get my point across about how much this stuff revolts me. This stuff is bad enough to scare you away from trying vegan dishes. I have tried other vegan dishes, and some were ok, but it goes a little far when this stuff is right next to real chicken noodle soup. I have not tried any of the companies other products, so I am not downing the company as a whole, but this needs a new recipe.
