Someone was kind enough to buy me these chocolates from my giftlist.  I've had Godiva chocolates delivered from Godiva's own site but thought it would be easier to list them on Amazon.  BIG MISTAKE!  When ordered from Godiva the chocolates were shipped fresh and cold with an ice pack to make sure they didn't melt.  The chocolates from Amazon where shipped in a regular box, most of the chocolates where melted into a solid block.  They were also dry and crusty.  I would think that Godiva would have to same standards no matter how people order their products. I'm a very unsatisfied customer.
