I bought these originally thinking they were honey and sesame.  As it turns out, they are sugar and sesame.  They do taste great but traditionally this type of snack should have honey instead of sugar.  If you are looking for a honey and sesame snack, there are others available through Amazon that contain honey instead of sugar, among those are [Joyva Sesame Crunch Candy].  If you are looking for a sugar alternative snack that is all natural, that is your best bet.
