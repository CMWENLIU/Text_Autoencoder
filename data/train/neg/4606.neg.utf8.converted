I've tried a few different kinds of coconut oil. This is average I'd say. The reason I give it 2 stars is the packing. And the quantity.<br /><br />First, the seals were intact on both jars in the 2-pack that I ordered. But there was coconut oil all over the inside of the box, covering the jars, and even on the shipping label. Again, the seals were intact and the jars had no cracks, so I'm not sure why it was all over the place. The white plastic jar lids that covered the seals were both cracked because there was no padding in the large box that it came in. So this was probably from everything rolling around.<br /><br />Now as far as quantity - both jars had huge gaping spaces in the middle. I couldn't see this until the jar was partway gone. Coconut oil is a soft solid at room temperature. It was like the sides and bottom were covered with oil to make the jar look full and then some was squeezed in on top. Both jars were like that. I submitted a shipping complaint and no one responded. You can do better with another product. This is a little cheaper but you are asking for a mess.
