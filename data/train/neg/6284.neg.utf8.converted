Of course orgeat is a key component in the classic Mai Tai, but so was 17 year old, high ester Jamaican rum.  You can bet Vic's Garnier Orgeat was made with real almonds.<br /><br />This product does not contain any almond or even almond extract.  It is chemically flavored.  Now if you love artificials then this is your product.<br /><br />But as for me, it's way too easy to make your own. A great and easy recipe is available at kaiserpenguin, though you have to find your own link.<br /><br />But it's easy, much better and real!
