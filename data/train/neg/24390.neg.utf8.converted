I bought this and the Sumatra blend (which was even worse) because of the great price. Unfortunately, there is a reason for the price. This seems to be low grade coffee. It is very bitter and bad tasting. The pods don't even smell that great... fresh ground french vanilla coffee usually smells fantastic. Avoid.
