I like this the least of the three lavender extracts I've tried. For my palette, there is an unpleasant, harsh, chemical aftertaste.<br /><br />I understand that not everyone tastes things the same way. I often find the same taste in artificially-sweetened products with xylitol and sorbitol. If you're not sensitive to those, you may be fine with this flavoring.<br /><br />I liked the Herb Pharm <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001TL6FS">Lavender Extract 1 Ounces</a> and the Bakto Flavors <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LXGBUE">Natural Lavender Flavor-4 OZ</a> much, much better.<br /><br />A related, also high-quality product would be the Sonoma lavender syrup <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NH7E42">Sonoma Syrup Co., No.3 Lavender Infused Simple Syrup, 12.7 Ounce Bottle, 12.7 Ounce Bottle</a>.
