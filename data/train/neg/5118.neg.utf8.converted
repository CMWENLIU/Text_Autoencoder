I would give this no stars but not sure how to.I bought these at a local store (Thank goodness I can return them!) My family loves potato salad and mashed potatoes, so I thought I would give them a shot. Took me twice as long as it would have if I had just peeled the potatoes as I usually do. You have to cook the potatoes BEFORE you peel them - but only halfway- and if they are not cooked anough, the peel doesn't come off as easy as they say. Then you put them back in the water to finish boiling. The "bumps" on the gloves that give  them the rough texture also started to come off with the second potato.<br /><br />Don't waste your money - just keep a very sharp knife handy.
