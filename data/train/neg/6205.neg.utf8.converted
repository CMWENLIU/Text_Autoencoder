These are extremely well made but whisky seems to taste much better in the Glencarin glasses. I have 8 of the Riedel Vinum Single Malt Glasses and about 30 of the Glencarin whisky glasses.  I have used these at about 10 different tastings and with the except of one person (and then only with one bourbon) every preferred the Glencarin glasses.<br /><br />As an experiment, I had people put the same whisky from the same bottle in a Riedel Vinum Single Malt Glass and a Glencarin whisky glass.  The difference was amazing:  The Glencarin whisky glass seemed to make the whisky smoother and more flavorful.<br /><br />At my tastings I will put both glasses out for people to use and they will wash and reuse their Glencarin whisky glasses before they will pick up a clean Riedel Vinum Single Malt Glasses.  That speaks to the effect.<br /><br />Just to be clear these are very well made and do improve the tastes of the whisky put in them, but the Glencarin whisky glasses do a much better job AND they are cheaper!<br /><br />I still have 6 unopened Riedel Vinum Single Malt Glasses....not sure what I will do with them.<br /><br />My recommendation, use these:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EXF3BS">Glencarin Crystal Whiskey Glass, Set of 4</a>
