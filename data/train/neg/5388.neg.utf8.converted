They have no filter in them, it's like instant coffee grounds every time thick mess in the bottom of my cup! Not a good deal at all! I will stick with brand name kcups from now on!  Big waste of money I would rather pay $10 more and get great coffee! I will be throwing these away, for sure!  Do not buy from this company.
