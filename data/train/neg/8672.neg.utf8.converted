I recently needed anchovies to make a Caesar salad.  Though I would've normally preferred the flat variety, none were available, so I bought the rolled thinking that there wouldn't be much difference between the two apart from the capers.  I had never purchased Yankee Clipper brand before but thinking that all grocery store anchovies were about equal, I bought them.  This belief was shattered upon opening the can.  The rolled anchovies looked very old (they sort of liquified when handled), were utterly flavorless (unless one thinks that anchovies need only to taste salty), and were packed in an oily slime that didn't resemble any olive oil that I was familiar with.  In sum, these are an extremely low-quality product, priced at or near the same price as such so-called gourmet-level canned anchovies.  Avoid.
