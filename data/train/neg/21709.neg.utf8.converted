My Decaf K-cups arrived today and I am very upset. Some of the dates on the K-cups expire next week! Some are unmarked with an expiration date and none are good beyond 4 months from now. They are packed in an unmarked box with a toilet paper roll inside. Don't buy this and certainly don't give it as a gift. I hope to get fresh coffee or my money back!
