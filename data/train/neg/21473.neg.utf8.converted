Yes, ALL Wrigley's Gums, even the ones with SUGAR, now contain at least ONE, (and many contain two or all of them) ASPARTAME, ACESULFAME-K, SUCRALOSE!<br /><br />WHY a gum with Sugar needs these dangerous chemical sweeteners is a mystery to me, but since they changed the logo of the packages on their gum, you can no longer buy any Wrigley's (or most other brands too) gum without one or more of these nasty chemical additives.<br /><br />Also note that Sucralose (AKA brand name Splenda) is NOT the same thing as Sucrose! (Sugar)  The slight spelling difference is to decieve those that read ingredient labels to think they are reading Sucrose and not notice it is Sucralose.<br /><br />Sucralose causes severe abdominal pain, so if you have had that after chewing gum, now you know why.<br /><br />Aspartame has dozens of books and thousands of websites explaining what is wrong with that, as well as the other one.<br /><br />Very sad that I never again will get to enjoy my childhood favorites of Wrigley's Spearmint, Juicy Fruit or Big Red ever again.
