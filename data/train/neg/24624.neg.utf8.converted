**Update** The recipe for this product has changed.  The second ingredient listed is almond butter.  I didn't realize that it had changed and bought some.  It's cheaper now, but not as good. Very disappointing.<br /><br />Old review: I love Nutella, but I stopped eating it because it has dairy (I'm allergic) and hydrogenated fat.  So, I was very excited to find Justin's Chocolate Hazelnut Butter.  This product is non-dairy, has no hydrogenated fat, and has less sugar than Nutella.  While it is good, I think it tastes a little too salty, especially if you put it on a cracker, since they also tend to be salty.  My final descriptions would have to be: good stuff, could be great with a little less salt.
