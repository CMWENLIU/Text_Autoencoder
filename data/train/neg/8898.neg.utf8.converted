First of all this stuff is Cinnamon Leaf Oil and NOT Cinnamon Bark Oil. Olive nation is misleading people by not making it clear that this is Cinnamon leaf Oil. Even the label on the bottle they sent is different to the one on Amazon. Don't get me wrong,this stuff is Potent and will burn your hands if you are not carefull but it has no smell. And what is point of it if you don't get that classic Cinnamon scent? Only Cinnamon Bark oil will give you that. Compared to Cinnamon Bark Oil you can't smell this stuff. I wanted this stuff for my house, after seing them used in hotel in Sri Lanka (where the best Cinnamon Oil comes from)but I might as well throw it.
