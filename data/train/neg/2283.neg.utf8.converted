I was excited to try this product.  I am reasonable fan of almonds.  (especially fond of smoked almonds) and I like chocolate.<br />However the combination of the dry cocoa powder, which is slightly bitter, and the dry unsalted taste of the almond doesn't really seem to work.<br />Frankly first impression is one of blandness.<br />Maybe because my palette leans toward the sweet side, these just seem bland.  The combination almost offsets the benefits of either taste.  It's just not a sweet taste, and that was what I expected.
