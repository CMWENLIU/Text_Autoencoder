This review is based on price not on coffee quality or taste.<br /><br />Do the math.............<br /><br />2 boxes of 25 K-cups = 50 K-cups @ 41.95 = $0.839/cup<br /><br />On Green mountain web site 24 K-Cups @ $13.95 = $0.581/cup<br /><br />You can get that down to $11.95 for $0.498/cup with the "cafe express".<br /><br />Even if you buy from Keurig they are $13.95 for 24 K-cups.<br /><br />I love Amazon but that seems like a BIG price for the joy of buying from Amazon.
