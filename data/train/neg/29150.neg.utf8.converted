I enjoyed these k-cups when I used them. They tasted pretty good. However, I quickly noticed that my Keurig brewer began to have problems after I started using these and other Grove Square k-cups. Even when I would brew other cups, I would get half-brewed cups of coffee, smaller cups, and other issues. I cleaned the brewer, following all the instructions and tips in the manual. The issues came up again as soon as I used these k-cups. What I discovered is that the Grove Square k-cups were gunking up my brewer badly. I had to clean out every part of the brewer completely, including the brewer basket area, the water reservoir, and the internal mechanism. After completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal. I won't order any Grove Square products again.
