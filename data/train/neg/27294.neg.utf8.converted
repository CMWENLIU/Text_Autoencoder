6/10/12 For those interested in the Holle brand of formula, please visit:<br />violey.com<br />At the top of the page please select English and then perform a search for Holle.<br />Please also see the pictures here for the nutritional information for the stage 1 and stage 2 Holle formulas.<br /><br />Please continue to feel free asking questions/concerns, etc in the comments.<br />There is a bunch of info in there, along with other user testimonials, so be sure to check them out, too.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />****As of 2/16/12 since the news of the elevated arsenic levels, we are searching for an alternative.<br />The Nature's One brand of Baby's Only, both Dairy and Soy based formulas, have been mentioned as being the highest of the brands tested.<br /><br />This information was published on several different media sites that I was able to find. Although the scientific results and brands were not released, I've found from several different sources that this brand is far higher than the others, contrary to the statement posted on the Nature's One website.<br /><br />**3/13/12 For anyone interested, we have officially switched to the Holle brand of infant formula. Our daughter has been on this formula for almost 2 weeks, and she took to it right away. There is plenty of information, along with user reviews from around the world, online.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is not available for sale here in the US.<br />Please see the source I have been ordering from in Germany that offers relatively moderate shipping fees in the comments.<br />If you have any questions about the Holle products, please leave a comment, and I'll get back to you at my earliest convenience.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />I ordered this formula because my wife is starting back to school in a couple of weeks, and won't have the ability to breastfeed or pump as she has been doing. I have read much of the info from the manufacture's website, and the many online reviews. Even with the occasional constipation some users have had, we decided to give this a shot.<br /><br />Our 4 month old daughter (wow does time really fly with them) took right to it. My wife tasted the formula, and said it is sweet like breast milk tends to be. We had tried another brand since we get free samples, and it must have been awful. Our daughter didn't like it one bit.<br /><br />We haven't had an issue with constipation, however she is still receiving breast milk, which may be helping with that. We are hoping that my wife will be able to pump enough in the mornings and evening, before and after class, to keep a supply, and only really need to supplement with the formula, which is only twice a day currently.<br /><br />I also really like that the manufacturer is an advocate of breastfeeding, and that is why they label their products for 12+month infants.<br /><br />You also can't go wrong with the 3 pack price that Amazon offers. Plus is comes with free 2 day shipping using Amazon Mom Prime.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Our daughter is now on this formula exclusively. She hasn't had constipation issues as other reviews have mentioned. Her bowel movements are firmer, and more solid, which makes clean up easier, and still regular. I wouldn't say she has any pain associated from this though.<br /><br />She still also takes to it wonderfully. There was never any problem with her distinguishing between breast milk and this formula.<br /><br />As a note, Amazon's price on this only saves us 1 cent per can compared to the local Whole Foods price. However, we do not regularly shop at Whole Foods as it isn't very convenient for us. The 2 day shipping is great, and very convenient. Just make sure to stock up while Amazon has it in stock. They seem to sell out quite often.<br /><br />ANOTHER UPDATE: 11/6/11<br />The Amazon price has increased on the 3 pack of this formula. It is no longer feasible to buy from here, so off to Whole Foods we go. Somewhat disappointed, as Amazon was saving us money, and valuable time.
