Short and Sweet:  this beef jerky is quite sweet, compared to commercial jerky.  In a one ounce portion, there are seven (7) grams of carbohydrates.  For those on a low-carb diet, that is a significant amount.<br /><br />I notice that in the more "natural" jerkies, they tend to use more sugar.  Perhaps it helps the texture and make the jerky a little less likely to dry out.<br /><br />It does show this on the label, which Amazon makes available, so don't make the same mistake I did and buy impulsively.<br /><br />If you are trying to find a beef jerky without preservatives, and from animals raised without antibiotics, etc, then this product is acceptable, if a little sweet.  But if you are on a high protein diet, avoiding carbohydrates, then beware.
