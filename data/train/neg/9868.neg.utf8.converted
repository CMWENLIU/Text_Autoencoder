I was really hoping to enjoy this because it was well reviewed on Amazon.  However, I honestly couldn't even finish the cup of chai... the artificial sweetener taste was really bad.  If you are the type who doesn't mind artificial sweetener, then I would say go for it, but if sucralose bugs you at all, DON'T DO IT.  I guess I'll check the labels on my K-cups more carefully from now on.
