These are really cute bears but they taste horrible! I had a friend purchase them for me as a birthday present because she knows my love of gummy bears but man were these terrible! They are really hard and split in half and honestly you cant tell the difference in the flavors because they all taste like plastic. Just pass these and get you a huge bag of small gummy bears instead!
