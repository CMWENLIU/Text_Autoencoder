I bought this because I had heard good things about it. I was so disappointed when I finally got to try it.  It was so bitter tasting, not at all what I had expected. I started out with a very minimal amount because I had been told that it was sweeter than sugar, I had to keep adding more and even then all I could taste was the bitterness.  A few weeks later I was talking to a co-worker who also majored in chemistry etc., and she said that whether or not you like the taste depends on your chemical makeup, so some people find it very sweet and love it and others find it bitter and hate it.  Just my luck that I was in the latter crowd!! It was pricey for such a small bottle and since I can't use it, it was a complete waste of money.
