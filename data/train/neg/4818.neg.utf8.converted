I wasn't a fan of this "variety" pack. Only 1 or 2 bags of my favorites, and over 10 bags of BBQ. Granted, 3 different kinds of BBQ, but they all tasted the same to me and I didn't like any of them. Also included were 3 bags of pork rinds which I also don't eat. Ended up giving away over half of the case to friends. Waste of money for me, won't be ordering this pack again.
