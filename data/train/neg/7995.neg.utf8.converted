Real San Marzano tomatoes are grown in volcanic soil in Italy, and get a special designation by the Italian department of agriculture. The reason being they are prized and generally cost more than other tomatoes.<br /><br /> Now when it comes to general tomatoes, US and Canada can produce them just as well as anyone else or better.  This is not the case with San Marzano tomatoes.  The soil gives them a distinctive taste, and they are well known to make the best non acidic tasting sauces.<br /><br />This marketing ploy is as if I made a brand named "Extra Virgin" brand olive oil when in reality it was regular olive oil.  Even if these are grown with the same seeds, it is not the same.  Also, these are not much cheaper than the real thing.  If you can does not have a seal on it from the Italian DOP, They are not real.  This can also deceives by putting italian words on it etc.<br /><br />In any decent supermarket, you can find the real deal.  In NY they are easy to find, but in other areas of the country it is sometimes hard to find.  Cento cans real San Marzano tomatoes, so if you see their variety that says San Marzano, pick them up.  They have the seal on them too.
