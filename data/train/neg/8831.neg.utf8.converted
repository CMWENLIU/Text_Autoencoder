First of all, after receiving the tuna, I looked on the can to see where it is from and it doesn't say ANYWHERE on the can.  I went online to try to get this information, still nothing.  I hope to God this tuna is not from China.  It doesn't taste like tinned tuna from Italy, which was what I was hoping to get.  Now I have 23 more cans of this tuna which no one in the family even likes.  Would definitely not recommend this brand of tuna.
