I love flavored nori, but this brand just doesn't do it for me.  The taste is pretty... plain.  We purchased the two pack about 6 months ago and still have one container sitting around, which says a lot in our family of seaweed lovers.  In the future, I will be sticking with the brands that I know to satisfy my taste buds.
