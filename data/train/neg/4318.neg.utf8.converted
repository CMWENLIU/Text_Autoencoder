I confirm another review here that perfectly describes the texture and taste of this product as like chewing on a cellulose sponge! OMG! I love tofu, by the way. This is the first tofu I've eaten in decades that I did not like.<br /><br />I bought this after reading that review and thinking the person was maybe not familiar with the taste of tofu, or perhaps tried to eat this without re-hydrating this first. No, it is like chewing on a sponge (Have we all by accident done this, or is it an early childhood memory of times when we tested everything with our mouths?) At any rate, you will instantly think "sponge" if you ignore these warnings and buy this tofu. I do not mean just the texture, it really tastes like a cellulose sponge!<br /><br />I am also a fan of Eden Foods and enjoy many of their products, they make great tamari, for instance. I was looking for that texture and taste I find in freeze dried tofu pieces that come in soup mixes as in instant miso tofu soup packets or soup cups. This isn't that tofu! It will not be wasted, it has good protein and I can chop it in very small pieces and mix it with Creamy Tomato Soup by Pacific Naturals, that makes it innocuous enough. But I'll never buy this again!<br /><br />I am looking into buying a food dehydrator to make my own. The cost of tofu is much lower that this item reflects. I will update this if I have success drying my own tofu. Believe the reviews here, this isn't good.
