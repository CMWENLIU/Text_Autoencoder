For a product that sells itself behind a liquor brand, I was pretty disappointed that the candies did not contain real liquor. A coworker of mine purchased some malibu chocolates as Christmas gifts for everyone. These candies were great and contained real alcohol but, rather than asking her where she purchased them from (because she more than likely wouldn't have divulged) I decided to look for them myself online.<br /><br />The image shown on Amazon is very vague and (at the time that I purchased) offered no product description. Far be it for me to sound like some kind of alcoholic but, mentioning the non-alcoholic nature of these candies should have been one of the least of things put in the description to help inform a buyer's decision.<br /><br />I understand that it might be tricky selling things of an alcoholic nature online when it may be difficult to verify age, but those chocolates my coworker gave were so tasty that I would've been willing to jump through (some) additional hoops in order to verify mine.
