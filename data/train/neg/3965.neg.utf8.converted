I purchased this product and the seasoning is very good. I am, however, very dissapointed with their shipping charges. I had sent the seller an email stating that their shipping charge was excessive ($7.50) for such a small item. I received no response. The spice jar (3.5oz) arrived in a small box sent via USPS, and the USPS label on the front showed the cost of $2.38 for shipping. So faerie's finest makes an extra $5.12 on S&H. I suggest they notice that part of Amazon.com's success is due to the fact that they charge straight shipping costs, not inflated S%H. I won't buy from faeire's again.
