When I put my dogs on the new diet, it took about 4-5 weeks for their stomachs to adjust because they were getting extremely bad farts. After that, they were fine and healthy on it with shiny coats.<br /><br />HOWEVER, upon receiving my third Diamond Naturals Chicken & Rice, they developed awful diarrhea and stomach problems (April 15ish). A couple days later, I found out the Lamb & Rice formula was recalled, but I suspected something was wrong with the Chicken & Rice. Amazon refunded me, and I insisted they should talk to Diamond Naturals and put a warning on their site. I called Diamond Naturals and they said our dogs probably received a bad batch unrelated to the Lamb & Rice and they would be happy to pay for our next bag. We didn't want to risk it and decided to make our own food.<br /><br />Now the cat is out of the bag, and Diamond is recalling ALL SKU's (as of May 4, 2012, today), including several other brands they distribute. Humans have become infected with salmonella from handling the dog food. This is absolutely disgusting and unacceptable. I am hoping that after this event, there will be more regulations for dog food so that we know our pets can have healthy, affordable food. For now I'm not trusting any dog food brand (that I can afford) and will have my dogs on a raw diet.<br /><br />SOURCES:<br /><br />[...]
