$21 for shipping? No thanks, I prefer to not get bent over. They sell these at Walmart and Tom Thumb for $1ish a bottle regular price. $33 for a 12 pack is incredibly overpriced.<br /><br />But as far as the actual product goes, it is very good. I love that the slenderize has only 20 calories or less and doesn't have artificial sweeteners.<br />Once they adjust the price I fix my review to match.
