The tea is definitely a step up from regular tea that you get from your grocery store packed in teabags. There was almost no "dust" of broken leaves in the tea. But, it is packaged poorly, the tea seems to be overfermented or burnt. Although they say the tea originated from China, it does not have characteristic taste, it was either lost or was never present there, I am not sure. The tins are covered with plastic, but on three of the six tins the plastic burst, because it was just too thin and fragile. The tea is placed in unsealed plastic bags inside the tins. In the description it says something about the tins being collectible, and it is a joke. They all too thin to keep their shape and arrived bent.
