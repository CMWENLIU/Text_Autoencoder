Back from vet.  Vet is about 100% sure it was this chew stick that upset my dog.  His digestive tract is inflammed and will have to be on meds. He is not allowed to eat anything today. My vet said that even one is a lot for my size dog (I brought this to the vet with me), but bag said small dog, one per day (dog weighs 20 pounds). He said it obviously upset his digestive tract. He was throwing up bits of it over 24 hrs after having just one.  The vet said my dog is VERY HEALTHY except for this.  He is a little over a year old and in great shape...until he had one of these.  AND FOR THE RECORD....My dog HAS HAD RAWHIDE chew sticks before with NO ill effects.  I believe it is the inside of the chew stick that made him ill, as THAT is what he threw up.  It is distinctive and hard to miss!<br /><br />Particularly if you have a SMALL dog, I would be wary of this chew stick.  I'm not saying it would upset ALL small dogs tummies, just that it is hardly mini and if my vet said it was too big for my 20 pound dog.<br /><br />I have read a lot of dogs love this and did fine with it. Unfortunately mine didn't and it seems SOME other dogs (mostly smaller ones) didn't either.<br /><br />Just trying to save dog owners the worry of seeing their dog in distress and a big vet bill.
