I love the idea of the drawer that you can put the brewer on top of, but this thing is really lousy. The pods keep getting stuck so it becomes impossible to open/close the drawer. All of the pods fall over every time you do manage to get it open so it just ends up being a big mess.  Huge disappointment!
