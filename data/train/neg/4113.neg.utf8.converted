I purchased a pack of 12 for long term storage, and 11 out of 12 cans<br />were dented.<br />Storage cannot be "long term" if the can is dented. I had previously purchased a<br />pack of 12 so thought I should check those also. 3 of 12 were dented.<br />Looks like I will be eating a lot of brown bread this winter while looking for<br />another place to purchase.
