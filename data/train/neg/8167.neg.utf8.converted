I ordered this Rougie GOOSE Foie Gras about a year ago and it was pretty good.  I went to my account and pulled up the exact same Rougie Goose Foie Gras that I had previously ordered.  The title at the top said "Rougie Goose Foie Gras". I did not look closely at the product assuming that the title was not a lie and because it was the same product that I previously ordered.  When it came, I received DUCK foie gras with port wine.  When I checked the amazon page, it was titled GOOSE FOIS Gras, yet upon closer inspection the details said duck.  Of course this is non-refundable. Buyer beware of this BAIT AND SWITCH.
