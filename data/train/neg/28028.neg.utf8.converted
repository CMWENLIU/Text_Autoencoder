Below is my previous review.  The next bag I ordered had a few strange pieces of red plastic stringy stuff.  It made me uncomfortable with their quality control and what actually goes in the food.  I won't purchase again.  The presence of this plastic is utterly unexplainable!<br /><br />*********************************<br /><br />I think this is a fabulous product, but I do have an issue with the inconsistent product quality.  This last batch was really slimy and some previous batches had a lot of excess green flakes (broccoli?).  Most of the dogs that I know of that eat this product at some point stopped eating it (probably sick of it).  I would suggest alternating with other types of dog food.
