This coffe wasn't good at all. And it is partly my falt for not reading carefully that it was an instant type coffee. It really wasn't good at all and what a waste, I could of had a cup of instant coffee from the jar I had in my pantry. Another thing that was bad about it was that the plastic k-cup got caught in the maker every time you lifted the arm to replace the k-cup. I would never buy this again.
