I bought this dye for my son's second birthday cake. I needed the color's red, blue and yellow, which they addvertise that the color's are. I used both bottles of the blue (which is actually green) and came up with a pretty green. I used both the bottles of red and came up with a really pretty pink. The yellow worked great. I won't ever buy this brand again and wish I could get a refund for the products that I purchased. It was a waste of the $40.00 dollars or so.
