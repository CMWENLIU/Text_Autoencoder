We just purchase a roll of the Amish style butter from Minerva Co.  I agree that is has a great texture and is very creamy, however it is WAY TOO SALTY.  It may be great for foods that need both butter and salt (no need for the salt shaker) but forget about enjoying it on a plain piece of toast.  I agree with Mary "Mary".
