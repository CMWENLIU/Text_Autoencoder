Tried hard to like the Henry and Lisa's Salmon, but could not.  Often found small "glass like" particles that crunched in the salmon.  Henry and Lisa's informed me that these particles were actually "Struvite" a harmless, naturally occurring mineral in the salmon.  The customer service was very helpful and polite, however I could just not enjoy the salmon with the crunchy particles in it.  I have turned to Natural Sea and/or Crown Prince and have not had any of the "Struvite" problems.
