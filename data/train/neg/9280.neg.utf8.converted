a natural way to clean pups' teeth that isn't messy or smelly and that lasts a long time- my dog carries his around and will chew it for an hour at a time<br /><br />Editing review: my small dog, who had healthy teeth before I gave him antlers to chew, now has fractures on 4 molars from chewing. Give these chews with caution, if at all, tooth extraction is a painful & costly result of his enthusiasm for these chews.
