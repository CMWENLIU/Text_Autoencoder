The vendor used by Amazon is terrible.  I ordered a 24-case of GU over a month ago, and have not received my order.  I wasn't told that the product was backordered until after I made my purchase, and the vendor gave me three consequective back order dates.  Due to this major inconvenience I have canceled the order.  Don't order GU through Amazon.
