I guess I thought this Italian Breaded Veal Patty would taste like the ones I've had at restaurants but it does not!  It left a greasy, discusting taste in my mouth.  I thought maybe Omaha Steaks had taken very fatty veal and ground it up to make these patties.  All I know is....I think this product is awful.  I will never buy this veal product again.
