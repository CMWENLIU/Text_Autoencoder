I gave this product one star because it contains carrageenan which research has shown to proliferate cancer in animals. I was very excited to try this since I do not drink regular milk and I wanted a nutrient rich substitute for cow's milk to give my 1 year old son.  My review is not based on taste. I've never tasted this product and it arrived faster than estimated. Although carrageenan is a derivative of seaweed which I always thought was good for me, something may change in its processing as an emulsifier to make it less advantageous for the body. Nonetheless, You can research it for yourselves and make your own choice.
