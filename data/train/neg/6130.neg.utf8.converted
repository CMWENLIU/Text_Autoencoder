While I have no complaint about the contents of this order, half of the purpose for paying so much for some tea and trinkets is the arrangement. This item arrived looking like it was simply tossed together as an afterthought. The appeal of sending a gift basket is that it is supposed to look pretty (like the image). If the vendor can't take the time to properly arrange a gift basket, especially if I paid extra for wrapping on top of the cost of the basket itself, I would be hesitant to order such an item from amazon in the future. Might I suggest using FTD or your local florist...
