Research the latest news on arsenic levels in Babys Only formula.<br /><br />Unfortunately the FDA is behind the power curve when it comes to regulations. More often than not products are put on the market and the consumers are the guinea pigs. The FDA and the pharmaceutical companies that fund them and money making corporations exist on greed.<br />China is the only country that sets limits for arsenic in food - 0.15ppb. Rice grown in the US has 250ppb of arsenic.<br /><br />I am sick that I gave my beautiful baby boy Babys Only Organic Formula.<br /><br />As the company was not forthcoming about the levels of arsenic in the formula prior to being exposed by the Dartmouth study I will not buy their product. To me their responses on the website seem defensive and an attempt to put down non-organic formula rather than truly apologize for any distress they have caused.<br /><br />Naturally their self appointed testing company would show low levels of arsenic. They would not be employed otherwise. How much arsenic was my baby exposed to? I will never know. The effects can be insidious.  Did he have headaches? Difficult to prove and unless you can prove nothing will be done.<br /><br />The kicker is - it is Organic!! I know about the toxins in the non organic formula. Everyone who buys organic does. That is why they buy organic. Sadly money talks. You can't even trust organic.
