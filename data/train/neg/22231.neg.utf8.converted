I love ordering from Amazon, but unfortunately I have nothing good to say about Taste of the Wild dog food. I have been feeding this food to my 3 dogs for several years now, but with the most recent dog food recall affecting TOTW, I am switching to a different brand. Taste of the Wild is made by Diamond, which is famous for pet food recalls. There are plenty of other reasonably priced, high quality, grain-free pet foods on the market, that have NEVER had a pet food recall. No reason for me to continue risking my pet's health by feeding it this garbage. When I contacted TOTW regarding their latest recall, they were rude and dismissive of my concerns. Too bad. TOTW (and all other Diamond products), will no longer receive my business or recommendations. Suggestions: Fromm (never had a recall-in business since 1904), Orijen, Honest Kitchen, Halo, Dr. Harvey's. Try dogfoodadvisor.com when searching for a new food. Lots of reviews and good information.
