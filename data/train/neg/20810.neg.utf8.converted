These were the sweetest tasting, icky, sticky fruit twisters.  My son is addicted to candies and I thought these would remind him of fruit roll ups.  Instead they are like thick twizzlers that are very sticky and sweet.  In fact, even my son said they were too sweet and he won't even taste the other flavors!
