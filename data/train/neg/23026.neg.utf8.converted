I thought there was something wrong with these.. they are so hot! Sure enough , Chili is listed as an ingredient.  That is pretty unusual for this product and it definitely should have been reveled on the online description. I tried to return the unopened cans, (15 of them!!!) but due to it being a food item, I am not allowed! I feel stuck on this item, cheated... bc they were not as described, or expected.
