I didn't like this at all.  I found it chemical, and not nicely redolent of the ginger I O so, love.  I just gave it away, cute little tin and all.  I am adventurous, so I do happen on things I feel aren't what I expected from time to time.  This was certainly one of them.  I'm sure some of you will like like it, don't let me stop you from trying out your own personal tastebuds.  Mine said: "This tea is not a real peach, either."
