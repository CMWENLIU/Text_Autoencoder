I love Jelly Bellys, I am certifiable addict. I originally thought Belly Flops were a terrific value, I ordered 2 bags and with shipping the total was almost $22. I was at Costco the other day and happened to stumble upon a plastic tub of Jelly Bellys which were not defect and their total price for 4 pounds, the same equivalence as 2 two-pound bags of flops, was  about $15. I'd recommend getting them at Costco if thats possible--more variety, better taste, and you don't have to pay for shipping, or wait. It's a win win!
