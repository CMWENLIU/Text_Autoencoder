As others have mentioned, these arent k-cups.  Its a paper top with a filter bag full of coffee stuck to it, no plastic bottom.  So the coffee will go stale far faster than a real k-cup and they dont fit properly in my k-cup rack.<br /><br />You have to license the patented k-cup design and pay green mountain a couple of pennies per cup made in royalties, these guys seem to have tried to cut that corner.  But I wont buy them again, I buy k-cups because I want a fresh cup of coffee not something thats been exposed to circulating air until I use it.
