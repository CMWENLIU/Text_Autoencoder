I have been savoring Tony Packo's since 1968.  The Hungarian Hot Dog they serve is phenomenal! And the Chicken Paprikash (Csirke Paprikas) is excellent!  Unfortunately, this 7.5 ounce canned sauce is thin and contains a whopping  56 grams of fat (2 tablespoons is the serving size)!  I used a strainer spoon to separate out some beef. Only buy the canned stuff if you're desperate.  I had to scoop out a thick layer of fat before heating. Unfortunately, the frozen sauce is no longer available.<br /><br />The dogs served at the restaurant (2 per order with a side of Pickles & Peppers) are easily edible without a fork and have the perfect combination of  mustard, thick rich sauce and onion. The place is a well maintained institution since 1932 with friendly staff and should be on your list of places to go while in the Toledo Ohio area.
