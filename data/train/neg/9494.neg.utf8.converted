I am shocked at the positive reviews for this tea. It is almost completely tasteless, just a slight fruity flavour, it does not resemble any green tea that I have bought in the past when living in Japan or from Asian markets in the USA. There is not a hint of green colour in the tea and the leaf is dry, large and not compacted at all in the bag. In fact, the leaves are too big to fit in a tea ball.<br />Does this tea really contain more antioxidants and polyphenols? Can not find substantiation from USDA.<br />They talk a good talk but product is severely lacking.
