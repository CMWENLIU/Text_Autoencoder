Both my husband and I love to try new things and when we heard about these I immediately ordered 2 different flavors ; cheese & pizza.<br />They arrived and we hated them. They have no flavor, they are dry and they are boring. Even my dog did not want them and usually they will eat anything!<br />A waste of my money, I threw them all out.
