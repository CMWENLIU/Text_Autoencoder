There are so many artificial ingredients in this it made me ill to read it.  If you can smell the bourbon (which is just above the salt) then you have a better nose than my hound.  If you want sodium benzoate, yellow #5, yellow #6, red #40, blue #1, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, diglycerides, artifical flavor and sodium propionate, this is your fruitcake.  I wish I could send you mine.  The flavor was very disappointing but what can you expect with all those chemical.  They need to let the nuns make the cake.  I think the monestary part is just a ploy.
