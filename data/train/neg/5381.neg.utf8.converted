I have not been this incensed in a long time about a product's misrepresentation.  The primary advantage of a Keurig is not that it heats water, which can be used to make tea, hot chocolate, etc., it is that it can make real, BREWED coffee by the cup.  This product advertises itself as dark brew coffee, at an attractive price.  It is instant coffee and should be labeled as such!
