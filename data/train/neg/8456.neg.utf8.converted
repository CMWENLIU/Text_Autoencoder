the price is good but the coffee is a crap shoot.Sometimes it is fine and sometimes it is out of date and the pods are swollen and brew at a slooooow pace. very frustrating and the coffee quality at that stage is poor. I never have time to return and I am not sure how to work Amazon or who is actually selling to me. The procust is poor quality about 50% of the time. I will not order anymore. Good luck. No place to get a reply or response so this is the only avenue I see.
