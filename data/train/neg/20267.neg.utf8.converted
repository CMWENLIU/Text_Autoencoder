I had ordered two Turduckens from Lima to eat them with my friends in LA.  I have ordered two given the expected number of guests for that day. They only sent me one, which was kind of uncomfortable, since more people showed. The turduckhen was great, but it could have been better if served properly and not as appetizer size portions. I am back in Lima and the company would like to send the second turkey o LA as a solution.
