My son was born prematurely at 28 weeks.  It was very difficult for me to maintain my milk flow with all the stress, and not being able to hold him, and going back to work with him still in the NICU... so I tried this tea.  It definitely did result in producing more milk but within a week my son began bleeding out of his rectum.  After a million tests, blood tranfusions, and total hysteria for days, we discovered that it was the tea.  The main herbal ingredient is fennugreek, which acts like a natural anticoagulant. I may as well have been doping him up with massive doses of heparin.  Luckily, we figured it out in time.
