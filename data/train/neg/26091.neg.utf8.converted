We loved the Hodgson Mill 9 grain and honey wheat breads but I hope I just got a bad box in the case of the Jalapeno Cornbread I ordered.  There is so much baking powder and/or soda in this mix that it tastes like soap.  No Jalapeno flavor.  I'm going to add a can of corn, some mild cheddar and some jalapenos to the next box I open and hope that it improves; no one ate more than one bite of the first box I baked.  I just can't justify giving more than one star to a mix you have to remake.
