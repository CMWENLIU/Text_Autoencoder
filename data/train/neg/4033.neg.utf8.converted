BEWARE!! CONTAINS ADDED SUGAR--LOTS OF IT!! I was surprised when I checked the ingredient list on the cans when they arrived to see that sugar is added. Many of the reviews mentioned the sweetness of the coconut water without mentioning the sugar addition, which makes me wonder if the positive reviews were generated by Samu people. The page for this product makes no mention of the actual ingredients; similarly their web site has no ingredient listing. I thought this meant the coconut water was just that, coconut water. The taste is, yes, sweet--so sweet my teeth hurt from drinking the beverage! This is just soda pop masquerading as coconut water. Not for me--I've dumped the contents of all the cans down the sink.
