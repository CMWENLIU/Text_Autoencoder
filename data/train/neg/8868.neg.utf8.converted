So the reason I gave this product 2 stars and not one is because it is fair trade and organic however, I was incredibly disappointed in this honey in general - I enjoy crystallized honey, but the flavor on this is just off somehow.  It *could* be the plastic.  When the package arrived the plastic smell was incredibly strong, took several hours to dissipate and even days later the containers still smelled bad.  I ended up ordering a different brand, Y.S. Organic Bee Farms, and there is just no comparison in flavor and texture - I will not order the Wholesome brand again.  Incidentally, when the new honey arrived, I still had one jar of the Wholesome left, which I put in the garbage - I didn't want anyone else thinking this is what honey should taste/smell like.
