I was so excited to try this after the reviews. Sadly, I wasn't too happy with this cocoa. I had purchased it to make a hot cocoa powder to gift to people for the holidays, however, this just tasted HORRIBLE as a hot chocolate. It was only ok in a chocolate cookie when I did a half and half mix with another (good) cocoa.
