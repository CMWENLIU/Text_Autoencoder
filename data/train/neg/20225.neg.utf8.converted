These "natural truffles" are a real travesty of chocolate. Absolutely disgusting. Want to know why the package doesn't display the word "chocolate" anywhere? Because they're not legally allowed to. These "truffles" do not fit the Food and Drug Administration's legal definition of chocolate. I'm not joking. These things are composed entirely of palm oil with a light dusting of cocoa powder. Cocoa powder, aka "cocoa solids", do not contain cocoa butter as does chocolate liquor, and do not satisfy the definition of chocolate. These are a substandard imitation of true chocolate, which is readily apparent in their similarity in consistency to Crisco. The reason they are made with palm oil is because it is significantly cheaper than cocoa butter. It's a cheapness you can taste, definitely. Believe me, I am no connoisseur of chocolate, and no purist by any means. They're just plain bad. Hell, a Hershey's bar is less fake than these.
