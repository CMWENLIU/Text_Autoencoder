I was really annoyed that it took so long for the cardamom to arrive. I needed it for Christmas baking, and I thought ordering it two weeks ahead would be plenty of time. Nowhere in the description did it state that it would be shipped from INDIA and would take six weeks minimum!! Total waste of money; the cardamom won't exactly be fresh by the time next Christmas rolls around. And it's not like I can ship it back to India.
