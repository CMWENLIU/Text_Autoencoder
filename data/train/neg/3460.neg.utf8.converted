I bought a BIG jar of this coffee from the local Tesco store the last time I was visiting home in the UK. It cost about 5 GBP. When I ran out I wanted to replace it and found this listing on Amazon. Notice there is NO information  about the size of the jar. The only clues are the whopping great price tag ($15.49), the insane amount for delivery ($6.45) and the shipping weight (1.2 lbs). I reasonably expected this to be the big size based on that information. WRONG!<br /><br />I received my order very quickly, it was well packaged and the coffee IS pretty good. BUT...the jar is only the 100g size which is TINY! I expect a markup on European goods  because they've come a long way to get to the US, but this is ridiculous. I can only assume that the lack of size information is a deliberate and blatant attempt to sucker people in. So well done, Enjoy Better Coffee, you got me. However, I won't be a repeat customer and I'll happily post this review to dissuade others from patronizing your rip off company.<br /><br />UPDATED 12/08/09<br />I see they've added the size of the jar (100g), so at least you know what you're getting. But it's still a rip off.
