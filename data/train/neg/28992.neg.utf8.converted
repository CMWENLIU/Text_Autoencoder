Like another reviewer, I do not like smoked foods (cheese, meats, etc).  So, I took a gamble by purchasing this tea because I was looking for new and unique flavors.  The description says "golden black tea with a delicate smokey flavor." Delicate could not be farther from the truth!  This was shipped to me along with 5 more boxes of different Twinings flavors. When I opened the package, all I could smell was this - despite the fact that each bag is sealed in a paper bag, inside a plastic wrapped box!  The smoke smell was overwhelming. When I showed it to my husband, he said it smelled like tobacco.  The smell was so bad, I could not even brew a cup.<br /><br />Other reviewers obviously enjoyed this, but for me it was a complete waste of money. I could not even give the tea away.
