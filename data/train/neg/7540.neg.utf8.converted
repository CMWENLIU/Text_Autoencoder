I bought this from a brick and mortar baby supply chain, and I was so excited to use it! I peeled, I chopped, I steamed and pureed. I was so happy! Then I realized it took me all day to make one regular sized batch of baby food. Still, it was so easy to just throw it in and walk away, so I kept making my baby food, one tiny batch at a time. Then, the fourth time I tried to use it, it would not steam. The start, stop, and steam buttons do not work. I'd had the machine less than a month. Then I noticed (as I was dumping out my unused water) that there was a bunch of metallic looking crap floating around in the water chamber. Unfortunatly the box had been thrown away otherwise I would have just taken it back to the store. I emailed customer service and about a week later received an email that said "please provide us with a number to reach you". By looking at some more recent reviews I can see I'm not the only one having a problem with their customer service. The idea behind this product is amazing, the product itself is garbage. I don't understand for the life of me why they couldn't make the blender cup bigger than a coffee cup. Even if this product had worked beautifully I would have eventually gotten tired of making tiny batches. I've been using my food processor and steaming on the stove in a pot. It's more to clean up but I can make a large batch of baby food in much less time. I wanted to love this thing, I really did. It's just not worth the money.
