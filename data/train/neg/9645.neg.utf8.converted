They're certainly designed like razors, you pay for a lot of unnecessarily hard to replace parts.  As far as I see it here are the major issues with the unit:<br /><br />1.  Undersized failure prone pump.  We had and have pump issues, a lot of the reviews here mention it, and even their website is once again backordered.  If they'd gone with even a slightly larger pump they'd have only a fraction of these issues.  The filter is also directly placed against the pump, this dramatically drops it's efficiency and means the slightest amount of debris will completely obstruct the pump.<br /><br />2.  Underpowered lighting that forces you to either stick with the fixed times hardwired into the unit (computerized!) or buy an additional cord, because other than using a non-standard fitting (so you have to buy another cord) the lights themselves plug into rather specialized fixtures which mostly eliminates your ability to just swap BETTER units in.  The lights that come stock are neither particularly efficient or very high in output.<br /><br />There's no easy solution for the pump issue, the quality control on them is so poor it seems to be a very hit or miss prospect to find one that works long term.  The lighting is also an issue, as you'll be seriously restricted in what plants you can grow well with fixed photoperiods and relatively low light intensity.<br /><br />Overall I would not recommend this unit to anyone.  There are far better designed and less failure prone systems that have already been on the market for years.  The general design & build reminds me of the "sharper image" gadgets that would fall apart the 2nd time they were used seriously.
