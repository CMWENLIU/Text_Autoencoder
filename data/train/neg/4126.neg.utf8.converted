I ordered 3 bottles to give it an honest try because I didn't think one bottle would give me enough time to honestly review it. One bottle lasts approximately 15 days. I just opened up my 3rd bottle and I still haven't really noticed much of anything. The taste isn't too bad.<br /><br />The following comment is for the person who previously reviewed the product: I believe that what you were looking at was NOT the expiration date but rather the date it was made. I bought this product as well and was worried that I would have the same problem as you described until I realized that it had an expiry date as well as a production date. The production date was dated as "something/something 2011." And incidentally, the expiry date on my product was shown to be "something/something 2013" so that also prompts me to think that you probably looked at the wrong date and mistook 2011 for the expiry date.
