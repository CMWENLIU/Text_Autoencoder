I just received my order and I am VERY DISAPPOINTED!<br />This is going to be Christmas Present for my In-Laws to go with the Keurig Machine they asked for.<br />Silly me, I assumed that "Gift Pack+ Limited Edition Print" meant something NICE for the holidays. I was WRONG!<br />All the individual cups arrived thrown into a regualar brown cardboard box! That's going to look nice under the tree - NOT!<br /><br />I am glad that if my in-laws like this pkg that THEY will be the ones re-ordering, because it will definitely NOT be ME!<br /><br />Happy Holidays.<br />MB
