I was excited to find the "old" formula of this cat food on Amazon (at least that is what the picture is of). It was my cat's favorite canned food. The company has recently changed their formula. I received my case, opened 5 cans of it for my cats, and they all sniffed it and walked away. That is when I noticed that it said new and improved formula in small writing at the top of the can. So now I am stuck with 19 cans of food that my cats won't eat.  And Amazon will not let me return this item.  Even though I received something that was different than the description/picture.
