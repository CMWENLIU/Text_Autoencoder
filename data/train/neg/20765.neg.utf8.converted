Tried this product to help us deter skunks digging up the lawn for grubs.  It may have deterred the skunks for one(!) night but most likely they filled their belly somewhere else.  Havahart is being very generous in their marketing saying that it lasts up to 30 days.  Perhaps if the lawn was literally buried with this stuff.  Not worth the money.
