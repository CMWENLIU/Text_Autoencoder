I really wanted to like these.  Eden's Tart Cherry Juice is AMAZING and I'd hoped to add their dried cherries as a snack.  Not to be.  The dried cherries have an oily feel and taste that I do not care for.  The packaging states that the dried cherries are misted with organic safflower oil to prevent clumping.  You can really feel and taste the oil.  I'd much rather deal with the clumping.
