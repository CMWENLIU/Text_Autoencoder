I am used to the teas from twinings or other brands from Safeway or other english brands. This tea lacks of good flavor.  One sachet barely makes one cup of tea, whereas twinings and other brands  make 2 cups with full flavor.  I know flavor is a subjective matter, however if you like the flavors of brands like twinings do not buy this brand.
