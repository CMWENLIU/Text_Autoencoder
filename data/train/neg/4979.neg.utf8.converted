The item arrived in January 2012, with expiration date of NOVEMBER 2011. After few emails with dismissive statements like :"the chocolates are still good for several months after the sell by expiration dates", I decided to accept 50% discount. I have suspicion that this was not a innocent mistake, because the bottoms of all 10 packages look like rubbed off so that the expiration dates were very faint. I was not happy with how the matter was handled and did not appreciate the attitude of representative, which I did expressed in my "Sellers feedback". Today I received 2 PHONE CALLS - first to me, but after I refused to discuss anything by phone, my husband , who picked up second call minutes later (which I see as harassment !!!), had to listen the threat that if i would not remove my review, they will set the lawyer on me !!! I do have my phone companies record for that. I never heard of so offensive handling of complaint !!! I do not want anything from this company &lt;&lt;Otto's Euopean Import Store>>> and will not buy from them in the future. All of a sudden the page here has different seller.
