The two cheeses pictured here are NOT Epoisses Berthaut, which is a very soft ripe cheese that you need to attack with a spoon, not a knife. Another seller lists the same cheese for about $16.00 for the charactertistic round of 8.8 ounces.<br />By the way, this is one of the GREAT cheeses of France. Let's just assume that you'll hate it, so don't even think of buying it lest you drive the market price higher.
