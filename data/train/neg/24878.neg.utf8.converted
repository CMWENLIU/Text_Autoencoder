The fact that these were unsulphured was the biggest selling point and the price seemed fair.  Four individual bags inside a sturdy box, but each bag contains very dry raisins stuck together in large clumps.  This product is not up to Bob's Red Mill quality and we will be glad when the four bags are finished and we can purchase a different brand.
