Managers special, Amazon Prime.  a Month later the sale was canceled.  Two days before it was canceled I inquiried about the item.  Customer service said we can cancel this order and order from someone else to increase speed.  True at $10 more.  I said no, I will wait for what I ordered.  Then Amazon canceled my sale saying they couldn't get the item, but yet it is still available on Amazon.  I guess it was just too good of a price.
