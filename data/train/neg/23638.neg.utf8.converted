Exceptional service, I can't deny that. It took only a day to deliver.<br /><br />However, the end result is incredibly disappointing.<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients should give you pause. After sea salt, the largest proportions are garlic, paprika and onion.<br /><br />As another reviewers have said, it hardly tastes at all like bacon.<br />It's more like the dust you get at the bottom of a bag of Barbecue flavoured crisps.<br /><br />Perhaps my hopes were too high because of all the hype.<br /><br />Anybody who says a bacon imitation product tastes like bacon is talking out of their arse. They have either never tasted bacon, never tasted the product, or are paid very generously to write these reviews.<br /><br />Still, I spent $15 on half a pound of barbecue seasoning. Might as well sprinkle it on exceptionally bland food. Shame it goes stale in two years time.
