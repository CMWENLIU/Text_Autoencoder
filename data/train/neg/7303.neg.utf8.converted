Ok I have to weigh in here as this is already becoming a contentious discussion.  I am speaking as one of the few people who is legally permitted to be in the presence of children AND enjoys the flavor of Groundball Grape.  Rather than staunchly defending my own predilections, I must say that I have some truly bizarre tastes when it comes to food and sweets in particular.  As a child, I once broke the seal on a bottle of that horrible pink candy-medicine and drank the gooey nectar simply because I found it tasty.  I have bought 1lb bags of fine dinner mints with the intent of sole consumption, and also enjoy orange circus peanuts.  In my adult years, I have been known to eat tacos for breakfast and dunk razor-shaved slices of salami into milkshakes, a la chips n' dip.<br /><br />It is I, dear readers who enjoys the tangy, tart, unfavorably robust and chemical flavor of Ground Ball Grape.  I defend my enjoyment of it as a matter of personal taste, but would never even suggest it as a preference of others. If we are a member of this minority and wish to maintain strong opinions of such a personal nature, we must recognize not only the futility of defending our untenable position, but that it is wrong to do so.  To even imply that anybody 'should' enjoy this flavor is to betray one's own position.  By the very nature of the thing, it is absurd to like this disgusting gum.  Anyone who says that Groundball Grape is a 'good' flavor, or that it should be a 'well liked' flavor is defining themselves as a madman in the eyes of society.  Any opinions held are the product of sheer lunacy.  One must accept that the very fact of liking this flavor is unusual, and exhibit nothing but sympathy for those who despise it.  Members such as CP should be supported and consoled, and should be reconciled with their families, in time.
