I was looking forward to having these stuffed grape leaves and serving them to guests (thank goodness I tasted them first), but was extremely disappointed. I opened the first can and found every one of the stuffed grape leaves were very tough (center vein was unchewable). Well, I thought, maybe it's just this can - so I opened the second can. Exact same complaint - the grape leaves are old and tough and I couldn't chew it. I had to spit it out. I will say the flavor was good on the whole but when you can't chew it that's a big "no no"!
