Ah, it's the old rule that things that taste good are rarely good for you...well, they can be made healthier but the nutritional label on this one is sketchy.<br /><br />I think it's highly misleading to say a serving size it 2 Tablespoons. You couldn't do anything with 2 Tablespoons of sauce except for put it atop one baby red potato.  However, in just that small of serving size you are already weighing it at 7 grams SATURATED fat and 9 grams total fat.  In those 2 tablespoons you also have 100 calories...this is without the protein and rice you might add as a consumer. Tack on 230 mg of sodium in those two tiny spoonfuls and 3 grams sugar and you are likely to finish this meal wondering why you didn't have a Big Mac.<br /><br />The label says it's "family size" and you'd best have a big family who plans on cooking other dishes for dinner if everyone is only supposed to eat 2 Tablespoons.<br /><br />This rates a D minus on the health websites.<br /><br />That said, until you add meat, it has no cholesterol.  There is some good. Unless you, of course, do plan to add meat...then you are consuming basically a Big Mac and fries if you eat normal portions.<br /><br />For me that's just too much. Taste isn't everything...I believe in everything in moderation, but even in moderation with two spoonfuls of sauce you just have too much saturated fat here from the oil.<br /><br />So let's look at the ingredients. Normally coconut milk is used in curry which is a good fat...instead they used PALM OIL (vegetable oil: bad fat) as the main ingredients and then added in the flavor of coconut as a spice:<br /><br />ngredients<br />Rendang Paste (heat sterilized) Vegetable Oil (palm olein), Chili, Galangal, Palm Sugar, Onion,Shallot, Sugar,Pandan Leaf (Pandanus Amaryllifolius), Garlic, Salt, Lemon Grass, Soya Sauce (extract of soya bean, wheat, salt, sugar, carmel color), Fennel, Coriander, Cumin, Kaffer Lime Leaf, Cloves, Turmeric, white Pepper, Cinnamon Prima Coconut Premix (dehydrated) Coconut Milk Powder (coconut milk solids, maltodextrin, sodium caseinate), maltodextrin<br /><br />So basically this is a big ol' packet of vegetable oil with seasonings to make it taste more like a regular curry...and a whole lotta sugar to make ya love it.<br /><br />Not my thing.
