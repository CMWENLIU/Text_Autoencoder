This is not good, it's not sweet and it is loaded with fat and calories. It barely even tastes like coconut. It is bland, and greasy. Maybe if you are seeking some sort of health benefit you could convince yourself to eat this....but, if you like regular food, this isn't something you will want in the cupboard.<br /><br />I hesitated to post a review because I see anyone who gives this product a bad review gets lots "not helpful" votes.(funny,huh?)I just hate to see someone order this thinking it is a delicious treat.
