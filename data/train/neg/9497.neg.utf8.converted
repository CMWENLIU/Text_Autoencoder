Although I noticed in reviews of other types of bagels from this producer that they were atrocious, I decided to risk it and try the cinnamon bagels.  I toasted one today and tried it for the first time.  I could barely get down one bite before the whole thing went in the trash.  They really are very bad.  I strongly recommend against them.  There are some other low carb bagels available on Amazon that are better.<br /><br />I also don't appreciate someone patently connected with the business coming in and giving a 5 star rating and "review" to her own product.
