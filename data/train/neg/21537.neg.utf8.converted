I ordered this marzipan last Christmas, amazed by the great deal that I had found.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the old addage is true:  you get what you pay for.<br /><br />This marzipan is made with corn syrup instead of sugar, so it doesn't have the same texture.<br /><br />Even more interesting is that I froze the unused marzipan in the same bag with a 'better' variety.  Within three months this marzipan had taken on a freezer taste, whereas the higher grade marzipan still tastes great even one year later.  They were both in the same bag together, so it can only be the ingredients themselves that didn't hold up.<br /><br />This may be fine for gourmands, but a more refined palate is going to recognize the difference right away.  I am so glad that I didn't buy the ten pound block like I originally intended.  It may be suitable where the marzipan doesn't take center stage, but when the marzipan flavor is important pay the extra money for a 60+% almond paste made with sugar.
