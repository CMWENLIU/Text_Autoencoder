I normally love these truffles.  I waited until fall to buy these, being scared they would melt during shipping in the summer.  However, these have obviously sat around for a long time somewhere too  warm.  The truffles are entirely coated with that white film that happens when chocolate is stored somewhere too warm.  And the centers which should be soft are instead hard and dried up.  Tastes nothing like the ones you buy fresh in the store.  Horrible.
