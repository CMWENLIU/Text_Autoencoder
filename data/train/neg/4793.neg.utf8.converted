I followed the instructions to a tee, but in the end I found this bland and kind of gross. Which is weird because from the box and description it seemed very similar to my favorite frozen dinners (Marie Callendar's Chessy Chicken with Rice). But I was sorely disappointed. Skip this, there are far better things to do with a pound of chicken.
