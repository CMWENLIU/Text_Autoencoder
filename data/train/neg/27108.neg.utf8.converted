I remember purchasing this cereal a few years back when I first saw it on the shelf.  Although the flakes are seriously hard to eat (rice grit?), I thought they were really generous w/the quantity of strawberries.  HOWEVER, I just purchased a box the other day and they've drastically reduced the strawberry count (but kept the overall box a smallish 10 oz.).  A quick inspection of the clear bag of cereal reveals around 6-7 dried strawberry slices total.  I won't be purchasing this one again.
