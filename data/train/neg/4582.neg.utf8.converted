I assume market forces dictated that Cascadian Farms add sugar and a more "refined" appearance to their cereal, but now it's just another box of sweetened junk--albeit organic junk. Too bad. Me and my two-year-old son were very happy customers--but now we'll have to look elsewhere. And I'll have to start reading the ingredients of everything I buy from Cascadian Farms with a skeptical eye, now that I know what their business plan is.
