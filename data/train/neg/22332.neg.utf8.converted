I was very disappointed in this purchase. From the picture shown I thought I would get several different Disney dispensers. I received 10 Mickey Mouse and two Daisy Duck. Since my daughter has these two already I wasted my money, $20 plus S&H. I will say it is more my resonsibility than anyone else. The seller had a disclaimer stating that the 12 dispensers were bundled and therefore contents could not be guaranteed. But 10 of one and 2 of another. I think that all Pez dispensers that come in bulk without a specified assortment should be avoided.
