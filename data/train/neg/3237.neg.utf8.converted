The refrigerator cake made with these wafers, which my mother called "Famous Dessert" when she made it at the end of the 1930's, is what my kids renamed "Favorite Dessert" and it's now that for the grandkids too.  The delicate wafers themselves are dry and crisp.  Their taste seems nothing too special if you eat them straight -- but being layered and covered with whipped cream and a few hours in the refrigerator brings about an easy transformation into a luscious and intense chocolate experience.  There is no refrigerator dessert close to it.<br /><br />But today's packaging is less protective of these wafers than were the long metal cylinders with screw tops that protected those of my childhood memories. I often need to sort through the boxes on groceries shelves to find ones with no more than one or two broken wafers.  So I welcomed a chance to buy a carton. Closely packed and sent straight to me, I told myself, they would arrive intact, and I'd have a supply for many impromptu dinner parties.<br /><br />WRONG.  The unexpectedly large carton that arrived today proved to be part of a naive attempt at the double-boxing often used to ship fragile things. Unfortunately, Amazon's packer didn't really understand the concept.  The only cushioning included in the ample spaces between that large carton and the inner one with the wafers was one strip of 4 plastic pouches partly filled with air.  The inner box seemed to have been bouncing around a lot during transport, by the glimpses of the number of broken wafers in the boxes inside. I braced myself to go to the trouble of sending the order back -- I can find less damaged ones (at a lower price) on local shelves.<br /><br />And guess what?  After filling out a feedback report on the packaging problem, I went to arrange a return -- and was told that the product in that order was not returnable.  No reason given, and no warning on the listing either.<br /><br />Now I can understand that Amazon has no use for 12 boxes of damaged wafers.  But you know something?  Neither do I.<br /><br />Yes, I hope Nabisco continues to be carry them forever.  But I'll get mine locally from now on, and suggest that you might be wise to do so too. You can grate one broken wafer over the top and add an extra bit of that wonderful chocolate taste as well as a nice contrast to the white of whipped cream. But one is all it takes, not half a dozen or more.
