First of all, I have to say that I got excellent service for a product that was not sold by Amazon but, shipped by them.  They came in the same shipment as another pumpkin-flavored product, Carbon's Golden Malted pancake and waffle mix, that I had ordered.<br /><br />The waffles were and are wonderful!  The Pop-tarts tasted dry and stale.  The frosting kind of cracks off and there is not much filling.  The filling does not taste like pumpkin!  It tastes sugary but, not particularly like anything else.  I opened two different packets and had the same result.  They were bad.  I tasted them and ended up throwing them out.  I tried one plain out of the package and I tried toasting the other.  It didn't make any difference.  What a waste of time and money!
