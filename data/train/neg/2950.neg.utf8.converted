Does anyone here really want to feed their dogs anything made in china????  I love my dog.  I would never do it.<br />I contacted Dogswell.<br />I've done hours of research on dog food.  Here is what I found.<br /><br />Australia is trying to break into our market with a dog food called ZIWI PEAK.  Check it out.  I can't imagine Australia wanting to kill our pets as china does. This food is supposed to be awesome.  It is not dry but dehydrated.<br /><br />Also Orijen and don't forget Wellness all made here in the good old USA.
