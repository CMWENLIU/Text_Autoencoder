I have tried twice to order this product.  Both times Amazon packaging was perfect, but the manufactures seal on the bottle was bad.  The seal was still intact both times, but the liquid had still leaked out leaving quite a mess when I opened the package.  So I don't know much about trying the aminos themselves as I haven't got to use them.  Not ordering again, will try to find in store.
