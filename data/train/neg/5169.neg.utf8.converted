Received item relatively quickly with good packaging. One thing stood out, on the back of the package by the barcode it reads "Costco".  The seller has put "his own" barcode with scotch tape.  This strikes me as odd, I guess this item was purchased at Costco and is being resold my the seller .... Weird and odd, just be honest.
