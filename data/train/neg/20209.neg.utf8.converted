Hello, today I turned 21. I decided to buy a variety pack of smirfnoff ice. First we had green apple, it was damn good. Next, we had cherry lime...<br /><br />I only advise you to buy cherry lime, if you wouldn't rather burn the money. Because the idea of paying money for this pig swill is quite offending to me and my posse.
