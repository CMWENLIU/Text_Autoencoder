I emailed Nabisco regarding their new Saltine crackers that the package says "original" which are horrible and have no taste and are hard as bricks. I received a reply from Nabisco verifying that they indeed did change the recipe in December 2011 and removed original salt and are now adding sea salt. The new package is deceptive as it says "original" but once you taste the new ones, you will know that they are as far from original as you can get. I have found that Keebler Zesta saltines are really good and I have switched to them after eating Nabisco saltines for 46 years. It is ashamed that American manufacturers just can't leave a classic product alone and have ruined it.
