The description refers to the item shown in picture, the Colavita EVO in the green tin. This is the same olive oil sold in many shops and supermarkets (and in Italy, by the way) and made exclusively of Italian olives. However I've been shipped a different item, a blend of Italian, Greek, and Spanish olives, sold in a white tin. Same brand but not the item described, and that I intended to buy.
