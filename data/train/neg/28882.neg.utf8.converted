Dogs are not born to eat grains, preservatives, artificial flavors and colors. Did anyone even check out what's in this crud?<br /><br />Ground Wheat, Corn Gluten Meal, Wheat Flour, Ground Yellow Corn, Water, Sugar, Glycerin, Meat, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Soybean Meal, Bacon Fat Preserved With Bha, Salt, Sorbic Acid (A Preservative), Artificial Smoke Flavor, Calcium Propionate (A Preservative), Glyceryl Monostearate, Phosphoric Acid, Choline Chloride, Added Color (Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 1, Yellow 6).<br /><br />The ingredients here are despicable for the health of your dog. Sure your dog may like them because they're lathered with rancid bacon fat and Bha preservative. Please consider something more healthy as opposed to these mass marketed gimmicks. Your puppy will love you for it.
