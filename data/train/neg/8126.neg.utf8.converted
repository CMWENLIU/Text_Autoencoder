I was not happy with this purchase. The white chocolate chips must have melted and reformed because it was just one solid chunk...I made the recipe anyway (I chopped the chocolate) but it did not turn out well at all. The chocolate had separated.<br /><br />All three boxes of mix had the same problem.<br /><br />I'd like to try this mix again but I don't want to risk getting another bad batch of white chocolate.
