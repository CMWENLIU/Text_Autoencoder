While I adore chef Boyardee, it would be wise to remember that about 9 or so years ago they changed thier pasta sauce and made it "new and Improved" which means that this sauce would double as thier pizza sauce.. They no longer make thier orignial sauce,or thier "Boxed spaghetti dinner" which is still thier sauce for all thier other products and is perfect. This sauce is full of Italian spices that makes it perfect for pizza . If on the other hand you are looking for the taste that you get from any other chef Boyardee items,,this will disapoint you,.
