I ordered this to help my cat's digestive issues and he seemed to like it.  However, I immediately stopped using it when I found pieces of string sticking out of several of the pellets.  Like the other reviewer who found rubber inside, it could just be a fluke, but I don't like taking chances and switched to the Organix (which my cat loves).
