I was very disappointed with these bully sticks. They were incredibly skinny. I have been ordering these bully sticks from Rawhide Depot for quite some time and have never been disappointed before. There is usually one in the package that could be better but on the whole they have aways been an acceptable size.  These are priced very well.  I cannot afford to buy them anywhere else. My doggies may have to do without. I may take a chance again in the future but if I receive the same incredibly skinny ones I will never buy them again. The shipping was fast and there were no other glitches. I love that Rawhide Depot offers free shipping on this item if the minium purchase is met and it isn't very high - I think about $30 just off the top of my head. I always shop Rawhide Depot for dog treats and will continue to do so.
