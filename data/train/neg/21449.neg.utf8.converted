I usually buy directly from CoffeeBeanDirect in NJ and consider its coffee the best in quality, price and customer service.  Lo and behold, when I saw the coffee offered with "free" shipping(the coffee price was the same as CBD), an order was made.  My coffee was AWFUL!!!!!!!!  It was old, stale and had no aroma.  When it was ground, there was NO cleanup for my grinder: no coffee oils were present. I threw a $30+,5# bag of Organic/FairTrade in my compost and ordered from NJ.
