This is NOT food. Not for humans at least. Maybe a quasi-meat-flavored alternative to Ex-Lax. If you're lucky, you will only be spewing orange sludge from one bodily orifice at a time after you eat one of these. Shiva step aside if you eat more than that. On a positive note, my dog really likes them, so I give this two stars.
