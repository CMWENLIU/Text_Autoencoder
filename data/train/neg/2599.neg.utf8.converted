I bought a 12 pack of this exact product about 6 months ago.  It was not from this seller.  They were kept in a cool pantry in a kitchen that is always temperature controlled.  I used one right away. It was good. They all say Best By:Jan 27 2012.  Today is Mar 2011. The remaining 11 have all swelled up, unrolled the end, and the contents has spewed out.  I am throwing them all in the trash. I had previously purchased a 12 pack of Amore Anchovy paste and had them in my pantry for nearly two years as I used them all without any issue.  I will stay away from Crown Prince.  My packages say Imported From Morocco.
