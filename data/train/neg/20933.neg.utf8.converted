I do not know how long the licorice was sitting on the shelf before they sent it to me but when we dropped one on the floor in the kitchen it actually shattered.  They were so old.  Some of my coworkers used them as spears and fun was had by many.  But I think I would have rather eaten them.<br /><br />This seller should be ashamed of their poor quality control.  I did not send it back because it weighs a ton and shipping costs made it impractical to send back.<br /><br />Please do not waste your money.
