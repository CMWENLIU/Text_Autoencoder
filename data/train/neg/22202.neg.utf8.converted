I always by my Tabasco sauce from Amazon, the twelve oz. bottle for about $10.00.  I made a mistake while ordering and did not read the number of oz's on the bottle I was buying.  Because of the price, I just took it for granted it was the big bottle.  I was shocked when I saw the size of the bottle.  I can hardly believe I bought such a small bottle for that price.  In my opinion this item is grossly overpriced.
