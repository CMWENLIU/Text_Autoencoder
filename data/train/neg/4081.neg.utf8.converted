I can't comment on the coffee itself because I haven't tried it. I'm not happy that the three packages of this ground coffee arrived in a large zip close bag with each of the packages inadequately closed so that grounds were in the zip. Air obviously gets to the coffee, which reduces the flavor quickly. I've purchased many ground coffees from Amazon and this is the first that had no seal. The roll down tab wasn't even closed tightly enough to hold the ground coffee in!<br /><br />Amazon, however, took my first complaint and had another shipment sent within a day. It arrived the same as the first, except this time, the seal on the plastic zipper bag (an Amazon sticker) was also broken. In this day and age, I'm not sure I would consider it a safe bet to drink the coffee, but it'll be stale anyway in no time at all.<br /><br />Waste of money. I won't order from this company again since it doesn't seem to care enough about it's product to even close the package properly.
