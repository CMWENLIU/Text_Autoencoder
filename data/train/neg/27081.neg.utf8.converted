I like the fact that it uses stevia (how much of it vs. the other sugar alcohol sweetener though?? I think stevia is not toward the top of the list of ingredients) and I have used pure stevia extract before, and I can tell you they are not using very much of it. It basically tastes like a fountain drink where the syrup was running out. I would not pay regular soda prices for this product, let alone the higher retail prices at places like Whole Foods. It seems to me they are basically jumping on the stevia bandwagon and it has more to do with marketing than actually using it to make a good product.
