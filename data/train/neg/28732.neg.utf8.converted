This is the first review I have ever written on Amazon. I wish I had read the reviews before I tossed $14 down the commode. These are the most terrible tasing things I have ever put into my mouth. The texture is gritty, there is no taste except excessive salt. How can cheese, which I LOVE, be made to taste this bad? The only thing good about them is the smell. They smell like butter but taste like %@&#. One handful and the rest were flushed. I will definitely check the reviews before buying any more food products on line.
