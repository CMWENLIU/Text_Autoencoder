I heard about black truffles on cooking shows and wanted to try them.  If this is what black truffles taste like, I'm not impressed.  The flavor was so mild it was like no flavor.  I put some on a salad with lots of parmesean/oregano italian herbs, salt and pepper and it tasted good.  For 30 calories per half onze, that seemed good because at least it oiled my salad.  But then it said it was 14 grams of fat, too high for me. I bought eight bottles.  They're not eligible for return. So threw them away.  My adventure into black truffles was disappointing.
