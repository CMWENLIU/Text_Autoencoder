Based on the reviews here, I had high hopes for this coffee.  I realize it's a mild coffee, but it is really lacking taste and just seems very watery.  I tried making a smaller cup, which did help a little, but I'm still disappointed.  I won't be purchasing this one again.  I wonder if this is typical of Gevalia t-discs, cause I was disappointed in the Gevalia Capp as well (the Maxwell House is WAY better).
