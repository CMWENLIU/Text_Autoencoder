Although the shipping was quick, the taste of the actual product did not appeal to me.  The sauce packets used in these noodles (and all of their other products, it very similar) was not very good.  It was too sour and had a distinct off-flavor. I ended up not even putting in any of the sauce packets just to finish the carton off. I prefer the noodle bowls and ramin sold in supermarkets to any of the Annie Chun noodles, and the store bought versions are much cheaper, but may not be as healthy.
