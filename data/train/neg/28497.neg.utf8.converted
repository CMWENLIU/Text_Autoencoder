It says Vanilla all over the bottle, but vanilla is not in the Ingredients. This is purely a mix of artificail ingredients and other "natural" (possibly toxic) substances that resemble vanilla taste, yet there is no actual vanilla in this.<br />I would definitely spend more money and research time before buying this. Don't be fooled!
