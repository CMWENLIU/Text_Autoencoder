They listed this product as Small Bite Size.  There is nothing bite size about them.  They are slivers and crumbs.  I gave it a 1 because of the ingredients.  If your looking to sprinkle this over your existing dog food then buy it.  If your looking to use as training treats then don't bother.  I'm going to order the normal size.
