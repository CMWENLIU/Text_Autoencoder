So its been a week since I let my dogs "try" this food. We have 4 dogs so this bag went quick! 3 Small dogs, Shih Tzu and Maltese's and One Yellow Lab, all adults.<br /><br />The product states how tender the pieces are and how your dog will love it... and that they do... It also says theres no artificial perservatives and that the #1 ingredient is the beef that your dog wants.. but... is this what your dog needs???<br /><br />Just because the product looks good and colorful and says your dog wants it doesn't mean its good for him. This was more like a treat for my dogs then "food" and even then a very unhealthy treat. There is a ton of soy and corn in this food and by products. I think the colored bites are more to please the humans then the dogs! That means there are aritifial preservatives or flavors or colors of some sort to get the colors. Does a dog really need this? but mainly is it healthy.... For a 4.5lb bag of unhealthy food it is pricy too.<br /><br />You are what you eat... and if you give your dog a healthy food with NO byproducts and no corn etc.. your dog will be alot more healthy (and less gassy if gas is a factor) I'd recommend trying good healthy food for a week or two if your not already, you will see a difference and there are a bunch out there on the market. Yes they are more costly.. but think of the benifits as well. Why give your dog stuff thats unhealthy? Can lead to problems... and more bills.<br /><br />I don't recommend this food, and my dogs enjoyed their short treat while it lasted. We didn't fully finish the bag either as after a few days I didn't want to keep giving them "junk food"
