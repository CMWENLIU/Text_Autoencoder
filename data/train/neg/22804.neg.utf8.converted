My son loves these but.... the product description for this says "great price" and that these cost double at the local science centers.  This is very misleading since if it were true then the package would not contain only 1 single .7 oz package which is only two dollars and change at our local science center and the highest you will ever see is three plus dollars.  The price here is DOUBLE the science center price so they have it upside down.  My dad ordered this for my son thinking it was 3-packs probably having misread the "3 year expiration date" plus seeing that they said it was half the price that you pay at the science centers (UNTRUE).<br /><br />This is ONE pack only.  At least the one we received and nothing here says any different.  Buy it at your local center.  And forget making a comment that the review should be about the product and not the price as they put pricing claims in the product description making it part of the product and specifically misleading.
