The price jumped up almost $10 for the 10lb bag. I love my Shih Tzus but it is time to switch to a different brand. I know they will understand that their parents and the country are in financial difficulty. The $10 increase is not acceptable even in the dog world. Too bad because they have been enjoying Royal Canin for six years now. Goodbye Royal Canin.
