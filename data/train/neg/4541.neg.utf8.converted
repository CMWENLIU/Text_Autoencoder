Taste is OK for kids, but this should be called "Halloween Artificially Colored and Flavored Sweet Drink." No surprise on the Yellow #6, of course...but really, can you call it "Hot Chocolate" without even a hint of cocoa in the mix? Not in my book. Rename it and maybe it'll go up to a three-star concoction. Maybe.
