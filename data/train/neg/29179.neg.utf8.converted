First off, just READ the Ingreients if you don't believe me!<br /> This "Stevia" in the RAW is NOT pure Stevia! It's really 90%....yes 90% FILLER! PURE STEVIA you'd use 1 TEASPOON for 1 CUP of Sugar, this crap they added so much Maltdextrin to make it equal to a cup of sugar.<br />Buy NOW FOODS "Better Stevia" if you want Stevia and save money. It will use 1 TEASPOON for what normally would take you a CUP of Sugar.<br /><br />This is outrageous! To call this "Stevia in the RAW" and then add 90% FILLER and I mean 90% FILLER!....is a JOKE! Stevia is 400 Times more sweet than Sugar, these packets should be a third smaller, but NOOOOOOOOO, they add crap Filler to equal the volume out with sugar!  There other title this company sell is "sugar in the raw" and that is 100% Pure sugar, so why here do they not also have 100% pure Stevia?  This is a RIP -OFF! If you want to pay for FILLER-ADDED crap then go ahead! *****If you really want PURE STEVIA, then buy the NOW FOODS "Better Stevia".<br />1 TEASPOON = 1 Cup of sugar. Why pay money for 90% FILLER garbage! Thank You
