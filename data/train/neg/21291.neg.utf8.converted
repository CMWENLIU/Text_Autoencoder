I know - the caption is too easy.  I was very excited when I read all it's glowing reviews, as I really like BBQ sauce, but they let me down.  I liked the idea that there was no HFCS in it, so I tried it.<br /><br />It is very thin, and it tastes like watered down, flavored ketchup.  It is wimpy, and has no umph.  (I notice they now make a thicker version.)  I mix the Original with some Bullseye BBQ sauce to make it palatable, otherwise I would throw it away.  I bought 2 bottles at once based on the reviews, so I'll be giving my other bottle to a frenemy.<br /><br />The Bullseye also has no HFCS, and the only ingredient I'm not thrilled with is the modified food starch, but I do love the taste!<br /><br />Update: 7/14/12 I have to amend my review. I recently went to the grocery, as I was running low on Bulls-Eye, and I found out the main ingredient is now High Fructose Corn Syrup!  I checked on the old bottle I had at home and there was no HFCS in it....  Is the Corn Syrup Lobby that powerful?  If anyone knows of a great tasting BBQ sauce I can switch to (with no HFCS) please post it!  Thanks
