This chili sauce is wonderful, with a fresh chili taste. It's served in many Chinese restaraunts. The problem is the way it's shipped, not the product inside the (hopefully) sealed jar. I bought a six pack of Sambal Oelek from Amazon. When I opened the box, the six pack had broken out of a flimsy cellophane wrap that tears easily. One of the jars had been jostled around so much from coming out the packaging that the safety seal had broken on the lid and there was chili paste spilled in the box and all over the containers. The six pack packaging probably would have held up if there would have been adequate air packing in the box, but unfortunately there was only one air pillow pack in the box, with lots of open space in the box. So, with the flimsy wrap and the lack of packing around it, it created the perfect environment for the jars to break open.<br /><br />I called Amazon, and they were very understanding and sent a replacement 6 pack of Sambal Oelek right away. Unfortunately, this shipment had the same type of flimsy wrap and not enough packing air pillows. But luckily the jars had just broken away from the packaging wrap without opening in the second shipment.<br /><br />You take a chance of getting open products with the shipping preparations with this order. I wouldn't take my chances with it again. I'll just buy it at an Asian market in town.
