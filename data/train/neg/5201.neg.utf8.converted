99% of all cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A, which has been linked to cancer, birth defects, miscarriages, obesity, and insulin resistance, which can lead to Type II diabetes. Refer to the Environmental Working Group report on BPA.<br /><br />I consume olives and these are not large at all. 110 MG sodium for 3 olives are too much so I rinsed these Lindsay olives real well, then placed it in a container with Serrano pepper, garlic, spices and a real good vinegar from Italy, and placed it in refrigerator just like I do with all other brands. These are tasteless compare to other brands I get from Spain. It is pitted which is great but not a strong olive taste at all. Coopolvia Olives are much stronger tasty olives for the same price but regardless you still get that in a can with BPA.
