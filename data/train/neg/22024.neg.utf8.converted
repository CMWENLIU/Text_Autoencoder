A co-worker had brought in a box of Mrs. May's Trio Bars.  I chose Blueberry, My first introduction to a Mrs. May's bar.  I rated this "I HATE IT" however I never took a bite so I can not tell you if they taste good or not.  When I opened the package I first viewed cobwebs and was not sure what I was looking at until two maggots dropped out. Went back to the box to check expiration date "BEST IF USED BY JUNE 11th 2011".  I opened my bar on 11/17/10. Then I looked for company address finding none.  What I did find was PRODUCT OF CHINA. This has prompted me to read more labels from here on out.  THEY ARE TRYING TO KILL US ?  I was able to find a contact online and sent a picture of the maggot infested bar to the company. Purely customer feedback. Making it clear to the company that I do not want coupons or a free box of this product.  Thank you but no thanks.  HAPPY TO LIVE IN THE USA
