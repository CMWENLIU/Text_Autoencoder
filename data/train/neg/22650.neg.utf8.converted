I do not understand why anyone would purchase ANY pet products made in China!!! Because they are CHEAP!  Would YOU eat food made in China? All Smokehouse products were recalled in 2007, 'PetSmart has pulled various Smokehouse Brand dog treats off of their shelves. There have been reports of pets becoming ill after eating the treats, and as a precaution, PetSmart has removed the products.' Better research your pets food before you feed them if you want them to be around for awhile. Better to pay a little more than feeding your pet God only know what!
