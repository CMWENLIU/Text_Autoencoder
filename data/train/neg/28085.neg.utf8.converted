I bought it based on all the other great reviews, but unfortunately my dog doesn't like them. In the beginning he was taking a treat, but left it behind and didn't take a bite. I kept on trying and by know he doesn't even take it. I was really hoping they would be great, but unfortunately can't give a positive review.
