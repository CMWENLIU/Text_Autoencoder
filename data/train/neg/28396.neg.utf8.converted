I purchased this product thinking that it would be a good alternative to Senseo pods that are hard to find at a good price. They DO NOT fit a Senseo machine. I was not concerned since I have a nice Krups expresso machine and the pods fit perfectly into the coffee receptical. Expecting a nice Starbucks shot, all that came out was slightly colored water. The pods were expired for nearly 8 months, so there was no way I would keep them. I returned the product, but had to pay $12.00 to ship it back, after paying for shipping to get it to me! I have bought many things from Amazon, but this is by far the worst. Do not buy this terrible product.
