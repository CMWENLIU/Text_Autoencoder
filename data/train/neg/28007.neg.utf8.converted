Big disappointment, as I bought three one-pound bags.  I have always thought of ground turmeric as yellow in color, and indeed the product description page for this product says, "Our ground turmeric has a wonderful, golden-yellow color and a pungent, distinctive aroma."  As the color is not yellow, but brown, and the aroma is mild, not pungent, I assume this product is stale.  I contacted another herb vendor who confirmed turmeric should be a yellowish color.  I would rate one star but the packaging was very good.
