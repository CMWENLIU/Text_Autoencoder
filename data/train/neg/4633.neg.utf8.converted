The rating is one star because the dog liked it a lot and one star in thanks for the Vine program which allows us to try products without spending good money on them.<br /><br />My dog is 130 Mastiff and he did not like or eat the Beneful dog food that we reviewed a few months ago. Not so with this bag. He was interested in the smell as soon as I opened the bag and ate the whole bowl when it was placed in front of him. He is not a dog who is normally interested in food. He doesn't beg at the table, shows no interest in scraps and usually has to have wet food mixed in with the dry before he will eat. His preferred diet is couches, dog beds, remotes, eyeglasses, and a 9" ratchet wrench. Yet he likes this food. I wonder what the attraction is , since he usually shuns table scrap meats.<br /><br />In spite of the fancy name, the colorful textured kibble, the grilled sirloin label, this bag is full of stuff that is not good for dogs as a daily diet. Too much soy, soy products, artificial colors, etc.<br /><br />We will be using this bag as a training treat, because he seems to like the taste, but we are still on a hunt for real, unadulterated, healthy food.
