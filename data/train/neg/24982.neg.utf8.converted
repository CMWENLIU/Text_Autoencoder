I would not recommend this product at all. My son ordered it for me for my birthday and so I have to keep it. If it were not for this reason it would go back in a heartbeat. The items in the basket are very small and dollar store at best. The potpourri seems so old it has no scent, the foot pumice stone fell apart the first use, the candle was melted...need I say more..oh...except that they had the gall to charge 60 bucks for it! HORRIBLE!!!!!!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009BLNSS">Art of Appreciation Gift Baskets Ocean Mists Spa Bath and Body Gift Set</a>
