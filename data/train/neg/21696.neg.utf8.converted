I apologize to the makers of this drink for saying this, but it is just not good. At all. To be honest I think it tastes curiously like mouthwash. I can't really get past that and enjoy it. It's almost like mint tea that has waaaaay too much sugar in it or something. I am a HUGE fan of Synergy/GT's Kombucha, but I thought I'd try this because it's slightly cheaper. I have to say that the Synergy is well worth the extra $12 per 12 bottle case (I purchase the cases at Whole Foods for $35).<br /><br />Even if I could get past the minty mouthwash taste, I still have to question the health benefits of this brand of Kombucha given the ingredients list. It reads: Lightly carbonated water, sucrose, herbal tea blend, Kombucha cultures, lactobacilli, acerola juice concentrate. You don't even get to kombucha until the fourth ingredient - and that comes after water and sugar?? One can drink seltzer water with sugar and "herbal tea" for much cheaper than $23/12 bottles. Seriously. Spend the extra few bucks and buy the Synergy, whose ingredients are as follows (this is for the "Trilogy" flavor): 95% GT's organic raw kombucha, raspberry juice, lemon juice, fresh pressed ginger juice, and 100% pure love.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you want mint soda, then by all means, seize the day. If you want real, raw kombucha with health benefits AND a delicious taste, go for Synergy/GT's Kombucha.
