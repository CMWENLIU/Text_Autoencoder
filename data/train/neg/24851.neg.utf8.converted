After reading a number a positive reviews on the product, I wanted to try it.  I am glad I just went to my local Whole Foods Supermarket, instead of paying excessive ship/g costs when ordering online.  Basically, I do Not like it...don't like the taste or texture; I am not really bothered by the smell once it is rinsed.<br /><br />I eat Tofu products regularly and I also eat pasta occasionally and would rather eat my whole wheat pasta 1-2x/mth than eat this tofu-noodle regularly.  However, everyone has different tastes. So if you want to try it, get it from your local grocer (if they carry it), otherwise don't waste your money on ship/g.
