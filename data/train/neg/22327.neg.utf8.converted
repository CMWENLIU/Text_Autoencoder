It is possible that you crack a tooth with this quinoa. There are other stuff in there that I tried to ignore for a while. I did find, though, a quite big piece of clear hard plastic (hard and sharp--feels like glass). I am returning it and won't be buying again. If you have already bought a pack and you don't want to throw it away, make sure you check it before you cook it, ESPECIALLY if you have children, and eat it slowly. I ordered mine sometime in December, if that helps.
