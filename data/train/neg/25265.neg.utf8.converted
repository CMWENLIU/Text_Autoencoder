Please, please, all you pet lovers........do NOT buy this product. The Hartz smokey pork bones are hollow and splinter easily. I gave one to my Coton de Tulear this afternoon and a few minutes later I discovered the whole thing had splintered into small, sharp shards! I rushed him to the vet, had two x-rays taken (there were dozens of small pieces in his tummy) I received some medication and have to watch him for vomiting etc., for the next few days. If they are small enough to pass, it will be painful for him, but will prevent surgery.I've sworn off all treats, and feel just terrible.
