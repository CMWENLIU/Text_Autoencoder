I ordered a case of these tomatoes and when they arrived, I noticed that the can didn't say "San Marzano" like the picture showed and the advertisement said.  I contacted Amazon and they said they would send another case of the correct tomatoes.  Well, I got another case of the same regular tomatoes.  Either Amazon is cheating their customers or the company they are contracting with are cheating Amazon customers.  What bothered me the most is that Amazon didn't seem to care that I was sent the wrong product twice.
