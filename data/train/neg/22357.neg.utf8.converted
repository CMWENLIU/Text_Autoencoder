I was in rush to grab something quick from the grocery on my way to work. I usually pack my lunch but somedays I simply don't have a time for it. When I first opened up the box, they were individually packed which was a plus. However, the taste? EHhh. It was so stale. Basically not palatable at all. And more to that, as I was reading the nutrition label, the second most thing that was added as its ingredients? "high fructose corn syrup". Another big thing was partially hydrogenated soybean oils. Those two must be regulated and possibly BANNED. Of course, manufacturers still use those because using partially hydrogenated oil is much cheaper than using other kinds of oils that are still avaiable out there today. Those of you who think it's not big of a deal, ok. It is your choice to put crap in your mouth to damage your body in long run, so I don't have any control over that. Quakers obviously needs to utilize better ingredients.
