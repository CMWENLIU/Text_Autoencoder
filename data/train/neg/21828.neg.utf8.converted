Hatcho miso is made in Okazaki a town in Aichi prefecture in Japan, that's about 250 miles from Sendai for the over- excited. It is the most famous miso in Japan. Warlord Tokugawa (Richard Chamberlains 15th Century Shogun buddy) was it's most famous advocate. He drank Hatcho miso soup everyday. Japan's current Emperor is also a "customer"<br />The only authentic Hatcho is exported by Mitoku company. Eden foods are listed by Mitoku as an importer of authentic Hatcho. However, this web page proclaims in a couple of places that the product being sold is made from 100% American soybeans!<br /><br />It has a very earthy flavor. Salt content is fairly high, but, one doesn't eat a sufficiently large quantity to be much of a problem unless one has real health problems with any amount of excess salt.<br />Personally, I believe the benefits from eating miso products far outway the possible detriments.<br /><br />The price being asked is high for genuine Hatcho miso and ridiculously high if the product is in fact American made.<br /><br />Eden/Amazon need to clarify.<br /><br />Caveat Emptor.
