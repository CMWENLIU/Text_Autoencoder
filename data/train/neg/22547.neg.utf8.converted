I was hoping for a rich, creamy caramel made without corn syrup as the first ingredient - these are not that. They're a bit gritty, not to mention the use of hydrogenated oil even though they're touted as being made with milk. Being able to view the ingredients list and Nutrition Facts Label would have provided info I needed to alter my purchase. thanks
