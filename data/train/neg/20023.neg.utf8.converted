I've never had rotisseried Lemon and Herb chicken that wasn't absolutely delicious and had that in mind when I ordered this. The two are NOTHING alike! The Chicken Helper is TOO lemon and NO herb. Also, the whole grain noodles sounded good and healthy. Unfortunately, the two words don't belong in the same sentence when describing this product. Just...no.
