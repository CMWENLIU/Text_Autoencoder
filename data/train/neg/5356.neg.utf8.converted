I agree with the previous reviewer that the coffee was shipped too close to its "Sell By" date. When it arrived, the coffee was only six weeks away from expiring. In stores, usually 8 O'Clock Coffee is seven to nine months from expiration. The coffee has the typical stale smell and taste you'd expect in a product this old. Unless something changes and they can guarantee in the product description that the coffee will be much fresher, I'd pass on this if I were you. I'm slogging through all four bags because I'm trying to learn my lesson, but I bought a fresh bag at a local grocery store to give myself a break in between.
