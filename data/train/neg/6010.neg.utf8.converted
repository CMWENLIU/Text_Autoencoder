Did someone in the Walden Farms labs think this tasted good!?  There isn't even a HINT of peanut taste to this dreadful "treat". Walden Farms makes some excellent products but they fell flat on their butts with this one.  The putrid taste is indescribable!  I'd say it probably tastes similar to melted saran wrap.  Ugh!!  Word of advice.  Avoid this like the plague and purchase PB2 instead.
