Having just visited Pat O'Briens in New Orleans, I immediately ordered some of this mix to enjoy at home.<br /><br />I prepared it exactly according to the directions, including the use of good-quality dark rum (Myer's).<br /><br />It was good, but NOTHING like the Hurricanes we had on Bourbon Street.  The taste of an authentic Hurricane was still fresh in my mind (having enjoyed, um, several of them), and I found this mixer overly sweet and heavy, and only vaguely familiar.  It was like rum mixed with Hawaiian Punch if the punch was more syrupy.<br /><br />It was good, but not authentic.  It seems the only way to enjoy an authentic Hurricane is to spend $7.50 for one at Pat O'Briens on Bourbon Street.
