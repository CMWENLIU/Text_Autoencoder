I am trying to understand how Amazon can charge 17 dollars for 8oz of grated cheese. Anyone who orders this needs their head examined or something. This is one of the worst screws I have seen on Amazon to date. Its about 5 in most stores and cheaper in others so you figure it out. Just PUCKERUP cause you are getting kissed. HAHA
