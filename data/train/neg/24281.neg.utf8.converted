I totally agree with Jeremy Lynnes. This is not the Alpen I grew up with in Scotland, nor is it the same Alpen the Brits are currently eating across the pond. As my cousin so aptly put it, "it tastes like horse food"-meaning it mostly tastes like raw oats. This Canadian version doesn't have much flavor to it at all, and since I stopped eating it, my husband (who likes everything) noted that it seems like all the sugar falls to the bottom of the box, so most of it isn't very sweet, then the last bowlful is too sweet.<br /><br />If you don't have the original to compare it to, its not very good; comparing it to the original...its very bad. I LOVE Alpen in the UK and brought a box back with me last summer, but this is nothing close...so sad.<br /><br />Note to Amazon:  Can you please carry the "REAL" Alpen? I promise I'll then write a 5 star review of the product! :)
