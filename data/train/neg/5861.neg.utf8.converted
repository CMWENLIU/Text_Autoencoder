I love nuts, so i thought I would try these. Just horrible tasting, I couldn't tell if they were old or just over roasted, so much for trying to save a penny. I will never order these again. I ordered from City Nuts and Candy in Hollywood, Florida and they are the best so that is were I will continue to order from. I would rather pay alittle more to get quality that get a bad product and have to spend more money to ship the item back.
