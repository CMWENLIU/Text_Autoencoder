I agree with the other reviews that the Starbucks t-discs are superior to any other brand in their quality and design, but Caffe Verona tastes terrible! Maybe I got a bad batch, but this is bitter, nasty coffee. I love their Breakfast Blend. House Blend and Africa Kitamu are nice, but this Caffe Verona is heinous.
