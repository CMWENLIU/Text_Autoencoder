Purchased this coffee after reading many reviews about being bold, etc.  I also Purchased "Jet Fuel" also by coffee people.  Bottom line - Black tiger does not live up to its name.  It has a "mainstream" flavor similar to the big brands you find in a grocery store.  No comparison to high quality coffee.  If you have a choice between this and Jet Fuel go for Jet Fuel.  Bold and pleasant without the astringent bite of black Tiger.
