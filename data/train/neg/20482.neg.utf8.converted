My wife received these roses at work today, opened the box, closed it back up and brought them home. The colors are absolutely terrible - no red roses at all and the rest are all drab, washed out colors. There are a few yellow and pink but the rest are a pale, pale mauve color and the most horrible dirty tan color you have ever seen (those are now in the trash!!!) This was our first Valentine's Day since our wedding and needless to say, she was very disappointed.  I have ordered a completely different arrangement for her and will definitely think twice before ordering from ProFlowers again.
