You get what you pay for. These are not very good at all. If you've had good truffles, you will find these very disappointing. Costco was selling these two pound packages for $10 or was it two for $10 ?  I don't recall but I got two.  I took the one I hadn't opened and returned it and through the mostly uneaten package away.  I should have checked the ingredients first.  Good chocolates or any candy for that matter will never have vegetable oil as the main ingredient.
