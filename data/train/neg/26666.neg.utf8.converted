It is said that the Tellicherry is "the largest of the peppercorns".  The product that I received must be from a miniature variant.  Measuring in at a scant 2.5mm, my grinder turns these little corns into dust, even at the coarsest setting.  The taste however, is excellent.  I will utilize these in recipes calling for "hand-cracked" peppercorns, and will use a light hand when I do.
