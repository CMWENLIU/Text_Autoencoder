<span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:48 Mins<br /><br /></span>meant to say Thanksgiving, not Halloween. this was a fun review for me to do. thanks for watching.<br /><br />edit: October 23, 2010 (the next day) after having 2 more cups, I do agree with the other reviewer that this coffee is weak. The cup I had this morning, I added 3 teaspoons of sugar and the taste was better, but still not one of the better varieties out there. I think a mix with more coffee would have helped. If you've already bought this variety I recommend brewing it with the smallest cup setting. Peace out
