ALTHOUGH I RECEIVED MY SHIPMENT IN A TIMELY MANNER, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PRODUCT.  IT TASTES LIKE INSTANT NON-FAT DRY MILK AND NOTHING LIKE SOUR CREAM.  IT MAY BE OK TO USE IN COOKING, BUT NOT ON BAKED POTATOES.  ALSO, IT DOES NOT COME WITH DIRECTIONS.  IF I COULD, I WOULD GIVE IT MINUS 5 STARS, THAT'S HOW DISAPPOINTED I AM.  THE COMPANY MAY BE GOOD AND THEIR OTHER PRODUCTS MAY BE GOOD, BUT NOT THE SOUR CREAM POWDER.
