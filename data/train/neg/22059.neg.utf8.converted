Maybe I got a bad lot. These beans were inferior both in appearance and in the espresso brewed from them. I bought a bag in Dec 2009 and the date on the bag was Jan 2011 so I anticipated something reasonably fresh.<br />Upon opening the bag, the beans are below normal in size and a good number of them look like they should have been rejected.<br />The beans also appear to be 'under roasted' or unevenly roasted. The espresso was without the customary sweetness that I so enjoy.<br /><br />I'm back to buying Sumatra or Ethiopian locally roasted.<br /><br />I won't buy these again.
