I love this stuff - didn't know it had High Fructose Corn Syrup in it!  Grrrr<br />This is not product specific, but I have noticed that when I buy bulk on Amazon some of the companies ship out their close-dated items.  We purchase for our large family to save money, but it does not save anything to have to throw out what is out-dated after a short time.  I wish there was some way to communicate and find out what the products are dated are when I purchase here.
