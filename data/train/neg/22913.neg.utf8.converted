I called the number on the package and was told the case of Oh Henry bars I bought from Amazon was<br />out of date and that I should return them for a refund. When I find what looks like a deal it's NOT, amazon is trying<br />top dispose of old stock passing it on to the customer. Is this any way to treat good customers? I spend hundreds of dollars at Amazon and most of the time am happy but this is uncalled for. I also ordered some batteries and they too were at the end of the 6 year freshness date.
