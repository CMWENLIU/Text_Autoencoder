Easily the worst whole bean coffee I've ever tried, tasted like cheap ground coffee from a can.<br />Not dark at all more a medium-light roast. Had a nasty bitter flavor and maybe a stale flavor, pretty horrible, will be throwing it out.<br />EDIT: as it's so light, once I adjusted the grinder to quite a bit coarser, it was better and drinkable. This is a LIGHT roast, do not grind on fine.<br />Still not very good coffee.
