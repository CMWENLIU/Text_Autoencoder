Avoid buying can goods from Amazon.com.  Ordered over $1,000 worth of can goods for disaster preparedness and about 95% of them came dented.  Now, house full of boxes, packing material, and dented cans.  On phone with Amazon now to get this fixed.  Save yourself time energy and trouble.  Just go to store to buy your canned goods.  That way, you can inspect it yourself.
