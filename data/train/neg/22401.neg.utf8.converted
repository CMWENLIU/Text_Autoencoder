The saddest thing: Some jerk got paid to make this monstrosity. Hey I wouldn't have tried it if I didn't like spicy, buffalo sauce and wheat thins. Sure, i love all those things. But this is so bad... so immutably bad... that I spit them out. A day later, I thought they couldn't have been THAT bad, could they? I spit them again. Save yourself the trouble and eat moss. Wet moss. And it won't even be close.
