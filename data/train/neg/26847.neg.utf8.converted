I have been drinking oolong teas for over 40 years, not because of any claimed health benefits, but because I enjoy the flavor - at least most of the time.  After seeing how highly this tea was rated I was really disappointed with how it turned out.  It has a fairly strong bitter taste, and the flavor isn't pleasant at all.  If you open one of the bags you will find the tea has a sawdust consistency, no recognizable leaves at all.  If you want a really good oolong at a reasonable price, I recomend the Numi "Iron Goddess of Mercy" loose tea.
