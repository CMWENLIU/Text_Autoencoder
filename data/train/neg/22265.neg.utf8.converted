i perchased this product thinking it's the same as the oveltine they sell in the USA made by nestles company.this is made in thailand by ab foods for some chinese american trading company.the ingredients are not the same.under doctors care i must monitor my output of urine.usualy it is light yellow but after useing this oveltine it was much darker and it left a lot of sluge on the bottom of the urine bottle that was hard to clean out.i will not drink this anymore i can only imagine what my body went thru
