0 stars if I could!<br /><br />Do your research before you buy! I thought this food was the BEST for my spoiled cat- but after a complete urinary blockage in my cat, costing him almost his life and me out $900.00 at the vet- the food was determined to be the culprit. If you google this food and "Urinary Blockage", ect in the same line- you will find an ENOURMOUS amount of people who went through the same thing with there feline pal after giving this food.<br /><br />SHAME ON WELLNESS!!!
