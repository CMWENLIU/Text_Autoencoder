worst ready to eat indian food I ever got...it's packaged as Hyderabad Biryani..wish these guys know what a Hyderabad Biryani is all about..<br /><br />plain bad taste and waste of money..I have opened 1 packet..tried and put it in trash..trying to return remaining five if shipping works out for me.
