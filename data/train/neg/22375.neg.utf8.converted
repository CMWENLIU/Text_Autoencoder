I really enjoy Melita's canned coffee, so I figured this collection would be a real treat. I absolutely hated this blend. This is entirely a matter of taste. I believe the actual quality of the coffee is acceptable, not great, and not bad. The description does not specify the blend to region or location. However this is most assuredly a Arabican blend.<br /><br />As I stated, this is a matter of individual taste. Personally I detest Arabica blends. They leave a strange earthy aftertaste that stays with you for hours. Had I known this was Arabica derived, I would not have purchased it. That information is entirely missing from the product description.<br /><br />From the quality and freshness of this blend (taste aside) I will not be purchasing any further Melitta coffees from this bagged collection. The coffee was nowhere near fresh, the grinds were excessively dry and somewhat stale.
