I'm sure it just depends on your child and their needs. We originally were using Similac but had to go on WIC and were put on Gerber Good Start Gentle Plus. Immediately he started having horrible constipation and hard bowels. We had to put juice in the formula just to keep him regular and it was always a balancing act, especially once he started solids. Recently we were once again able to pay for formula and switched back to similac. Immediately he was regular again, irregardless of being on solids. So for some this may be great, but if your child has  constipation on it, you may just try a different brand formula, not necessarily switching to soy or a specialty kind.
