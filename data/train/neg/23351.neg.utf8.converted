Tried rooibos tea recently and loved it. Nearly drank my parents' entire supply while I was visiting over the holidays (sorry mom and dad)! So far locally this Madagascar Vanilla Red is the only rooibos tea I could find. Well I'm sorry to say I'll have to keep looking. I'm even sorrier I bought two boxes. Not only is there no rooibos taste, there is no vanilla taste, and in fact not much of a taste at all. Celestial Seasonings is my brand of choice, but they have disappointed here.
