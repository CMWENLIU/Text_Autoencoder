The taffy had very weak flavor - most of the time it was impossible to determine what the flavor was, Every piece tasted the same regardless of the color. The taffy arrived in 5 one pound grease stained cardboard boxes. I could not determine what caused the grease stains. I would never purchase any more candy from this site. Only the ants seemed to enjoy this candy.
