the seller should be ashamed to have sold all 24 mars bars that i ordered with their best by date only 28 days away. my boyfriend loves mars bars, when we are in the u.k. he eats one a day, and the expiration date doesn't matter, but this was meant to be a present to last a few months, maybe most of the year.  it is unbelievably frustrating that any professional company wouldn't rotate their stock, or consider the quality of the product they are shipping.  did they fall of a truck?  the mars bars are fine, for now. its the seller that you should avoid.  no excuses.
