After reading a lot of reviews I decided to try this stuff.  Everyone seemed to agree that you could use for any recipe as replacement for flour.  It does not work!!  We also didn't realize that it was not meant for yeast, until we got the delivery and saw on the package.  So you can't make bread with it.  We also tried things like pie crust which is pretty simple and it did not turn out either.  Will definitely be going back to Pamela's products.  They are much better and easier to switch to!!!  Buyer beware of this one.
