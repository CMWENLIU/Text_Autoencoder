I was so excited to find this Low-Carb Baking Mix and I thought that it would be of the same quality as all the other Bob's Red Mill products I've used.  Unfortunately that is not the case.  I've used it in several low carb baking recipes and it smells and tastes like FISH.  (Or is it soy, as others have mentioned?)  I don't know, but this product makes awful baked goods and the unfortunate smell and taste overpowers any other flavoring you may have in the recipe.  I imagine it must be a good coating for fish though.<br />I'm sorry I purchased this in bulk as well, as I feel bad about wasting money and food. This is not a keeper.
