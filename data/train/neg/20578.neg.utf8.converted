Can't honestly rate this item, as it was shipped to me with some sort of unidentifiable dark brown, sticky substance all over the outside of the jar and was disposed of immediately. The product might be good quality, however after reading ratings from this vendor, I wouldn't put anything edible from them in my mouth, they are downright nasty and should be investigated.
