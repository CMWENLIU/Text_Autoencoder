I spent 5 years studying canine nutrition and it's because of hype marketing such as this that dogs have such increased health issues. This is created for profit rather than for pets.<br /><br />Why do I say this?<br /><br />On the label it says "100% Real"  Note that it doesn't say real WHAT.  So then you see "No artificial flavors or colors" and you think you are giving your dog real beef, right? Nope.<br /><br />Turn the package over and look more closely.  Yes, it has beef but guess what the second and third ingredients are? SALT and SUGAR. After that we have smoke flavor, potassium sorbate (an artificial preservative...note it said there were no artificial flavors or colors. It did NOT say no artificial ingredients and it did not say all natural.) then Caramel Sodium Erythurbate, then Sodium Nitrate, (Sodium nitrate, a chemical, forms nitrosamines - carcinogens known to cause DNA damage and increased cellular degeneration. Studies have shown a link between increased levels of nitrates and increased deaths from certain diseases including Alzheimer's, diabetes mellitus and Parkinson's in people, possibly through the damaging effect of nitrosamines on DNA. Nitrosamines, formed in cured meats containing sodium nitrate and nitrite, have been linked to gastric cancer and oesophageal cancer.Sodium nitrate and nitrite are associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer.World Cancer Research Fund UK,states that one of the reasons that processed meat increases the risk of colon cancer is its content of nitrate. A small amount of the nitrate added to meat as a preservative breaks down into nitrite, in addition to any nitrite that may also be added. The nitrite then reacts with protein-rich foods (such as meat) to produce N-nitroso compounds (NOCs). Some types of NOCs are known to cause cancer. NOCs can be formed either when meat is cured or in the body as meat is digested.then BHA (The US National Institutes of Health report that BHA is reasonably anticipated to be a carcinogen based on evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. In particular, when administered in high doses as part of their diet, BHA causes papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the forestomach) It is a preservative.<br /><br />THEN ONION EXTRACT. ONIONS ARE TOXIC TO DOGS!<br /><br />It is unfortunately true that many companies add sugar as a main ingredient to treats so that dogs will crave treats...they do not brush their teeth so you are entering bacteria into their mouths on top of what is already there and this eventually actually affects their livers and kidneys. With onion ingredients you are hurting their livers and kidneys more by having to filter out this toxin on top of all the artificial ingredients.<br /><br />They are smaller than people and it's far more difficult for them to process these ingredients than it is for us.<br /><br />There are dirt cheap jerky treats for dogs that have all natural ingredients.  Don't fall for the false labeling. The very fact that they label this as they do proves what's important to them...not knowledge of getting the best for your dog, but filling it with cheap ingredients for profit.<br /><br />As someone who has studied things like this for years as well as the beneficial affects of a natural diet, this simply sickens me.
