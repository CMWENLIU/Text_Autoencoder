I have to say these taste really good but if you have any kind of environmental conscience then you can't help but feel guilty about the unnecessary individual packaging! Each thin is in it's own plastic wrapper and has a thin piece of paper attached. I just feel it's a bit rich when the companies website says 'Enjoy Nature' and they so obviously play on the nature conscious theme. They are tasty but there are other nice things out there so for this reason I won't buy them again.
