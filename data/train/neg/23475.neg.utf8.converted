Whoever Worthington Vegetarian uses to ship is a very POOR shipper!<br />Over HALF  (6) of the cans of Burger I received were DENTED.  I<br />am too nervous to use them.  What I have used is not the best Vegi<br />product I have tasted.  The Texture is pretty close to real meat but<br />WE really do not like the flavor.  I have to OVER season it with a lot of<br />Heat spices or mix it with real meat for my son to even nibble at it.<br />The entire reason I paid soooo much $44.00 for it was to help convert  my son away from real burger.  Forget that! He'll never trust me again.<br />So I will Never trust Worthington again.
