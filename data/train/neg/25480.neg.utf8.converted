for about the worst-tasting product i have even tried in the last 10 years... how this bar even made it into production is beyond me... there was a burnt, stale taste comparable to overcooked ginger bread...<br /><br />two stars off for a nasty, mealy, and flat taste<br /><br />the caloric/ingredient info is printed in pale white on a yellow panel on the side; if you wear glasses, good luck trying to read the listing off the shelf<br /><br />another star off for a poor, rookie package design (and yes, review weenies, package design is part of a review)<br /><br />i had to pull out a magnifying glass to read the ingredients; interesting to know that this product contains many if not more of the same polysyllabic chemical ingredients found in consumer and pet foods from the 'Big Boys,' such as Proctor and God, Con Agra, Kellog's, etc. There is 9 grams of sugar and 3 grams of protein in each 140-calorie 1.4-oz bar<br /><br />another star off for this 47-ingredient concoction that should have never made it out of taste-tasting<br /><br />want to punish your child for bad behavior? get a box and serve a bar - this product is *that* bad - although i'm not really that religious, i think wasting food is a sin - and i threw this box out in the trash
