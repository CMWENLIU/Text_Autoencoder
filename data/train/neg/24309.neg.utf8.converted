Unfortunately, I did not know about the warnings issued by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in Britain advising people not to eat hiziki because of the high level of inorganic arsenic that it contains until searching the internet for recipes on how to use my newly bought Eden Hiziki. Do some research before buying this product.  "Hiziki" is also called "hijiki". Most sellers now call their product "hiziki" as the word "hijiki" is the term used in the CIFA and FSA warinings.<br /><br />Of course the warnings were addressed by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare when they posted a statement July 30, 2004 on the Internet stating that, "There are no records of cases of arsenic poisoning as a result of the arsenic content of sea vegetables." AND On September 24, 2004 the Japan Consumer Press reported online that the weekly dietary intake of hiziki (hijiki), based on the daily intake of 0.9g, does not exceed the provisional inorganic arsenic level set by the World Health Organization. Well, OK, as long as I'm not feeding my family over the "provisional" arsenic level, no worries!<br /><br />Grocery items cannot be returned, even if you just found out reputable national food agencies have issued warnings advising people NOT to eat the product. Wish the companies would include "INORGANIC ARSENIC" level on the package, but understandably, this might turn some people off. Hope this review will prompt others to research this product before buying. I, for one, would not have bought this product had I known of the high level of inorganic arsenic content. BUYER BEWARE.
