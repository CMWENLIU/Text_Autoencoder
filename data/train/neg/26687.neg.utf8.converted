This looked like a great low-sugar cereal and had all of the elements I like in a cereal - berries, flax, no weird ingredients...so I gave it a try.  I poured myself a bowl of cereal the day I got it in the mail and couldn't finish the bowl.  It's like eating raw oats - which is not a pleasant experience, and it has a weird artificial aftertaste - even though it doesn't have artificial ingredients in it.  I couldn't figure out why it tasted so strange.  Sorry guys, but I may have to feed the remaining 5 and 4/5 bags of cereal to the local horses.  I couldn't even choke it down.
