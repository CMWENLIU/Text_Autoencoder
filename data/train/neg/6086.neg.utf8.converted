Look at the first three ingredients of the following products (the first ingredients on the list are the highest in the makeup of the food):<br /><br />Product A: Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal<br />Product B: Chicken,chicken meal,whole grain brown rice<br /><br />Does a product primarily composed of corn and "by-products" sound as healthy for your dog as one whose first two ingredients are chicken and followed up by rice, a quality grain? Do dogs feed themselves on primarily corn in the wild? Of course not.<br /><br />And what if I told you that Product B is sold for $30 per 40lb bag at Costco, while Product A is being sold at $36 for 21lbs worth of inferior food? Which sounds like the better deal to you?<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and save yourself some cash while also providing a healthier meal for your loved one. I'm not here to push Costco's Kirkland brand dog food, which is Product B in this comparison and is clearly a better value then Beneful. Blue Buffalo, Taste of the Wild, Canidae,etc are other examples of much higher quality foods that can be had for a lot cheaper. For once you can eat healthy AND save money.
