I ordered these dark chocolate-covered mini pretzels for my husband, and we both were very disappointed. They arrived mostly whole but very dry and coated in white spots. Both the dryness and spots were probably due to age and/or air exposure. They looked like something left over from last Valentine's Day. Needless to say, I won't be ordering any more.
