I sent these as gifts to mom and grandmother.  My mother called to tell me what was in the basket and how late it was received.  She told me that she felt bad, but wanted me to know considering what was paid.  The items were tasty though, according to her.  The items seemed shorted as to what was pictured.  I've ordered baskets before, from two other companies on Amazon, and got much better reviews from the recipients, including mom.  Broadway seems much better.
