Autumn Mix is my MOST FAVORITE CANDY IN THE WORLD...I only eat it around this time of year though..The candy came melted and nasty and i was very disappointed. There is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON this candy should have been melted as it is cold outside. That means that the candy was old and melted in the sellers warehouse and they should have never shipped me such a defective bag. DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE...I spent $10 on this candy and it was SUCH A WASTE.<br /><br />To the seller: YOU SHOULD CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMER MORE!
