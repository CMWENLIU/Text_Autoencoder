I've developed a taste for licorice over the years starting with the Italian licorice chips, wonderful strong licorice flavor there.... then I tried the Australian licorice, soft and chewy with good flavor, then I tried the licorice coins, firmer texture but strong, very good, unusual licorice flavor, and finally the Haribo Licorice wheels, firm , almost crumbly texture I didn't care for, and definitely the weakest licorice flavor (but good fragrance).... reminded me of the automatic bread maker I had a while back, the bread always smelled better than it tasted!
