Be very careful when selecting this product.  The picture shows mary janes, tootsie rolls, charleston chews, etc.  What I recieved was wax lips, pixie sticks, Reeces peices cups (not classic at all) and the clincher candy cigarettes! (something I would have never ordered and clearly not on the picture.  The only thing I saw the same in what I received to the picture was the Necco Wafers!
