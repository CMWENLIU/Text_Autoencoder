I am a bit disappointed with this tea. It has little of the aroma I expected, and the taste was somewhat bitter. I am a consistent hot tea drinker and love good tea. I will keep this one and try it iced in the summer. I will also experiment by mixing it with some of the other loose tea I have.<br /><br />EDIT: I've experimented several different ways with this tea. It is tasteless and bitter. I wish I could say differently.
