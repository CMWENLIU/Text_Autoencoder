I'm quite angry that they don't mention anywhere on here that they produce this product in a facility that uses milk. It says they make this product on a dedicated milk-free line, but you know what that means....tiny amounts can float into it or spills can happen, but since the government allows a certain amount of allergens (also same thing with rat excrement, spiders, etc.), it's still labeled Milk-free.<br /><br />I realize that not everyone is so violently allergic to milk products, but I literally start to bleed within hours of ingestion, and this product was no exception. I ended up having to give all the bags to my parents while I endured the 1-3 month healing process. VERY upset that companies are still allowed to flaunt allergen-free advertising when they KNOW they have small amounts inside. Some day, I'll take my revenge on these stupid companies that make allergen-free products in facilities that use those allergens. This product NEEDS to have more accurate warnings in the description, since it says it right on the bag.
