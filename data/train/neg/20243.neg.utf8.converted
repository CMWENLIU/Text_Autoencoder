My husband loves the Kona and I am always looking for a little variety.  I thought this would be perfect, except that when I opened the box, there was no Kona.  Instead there was Tullys Breakfast Blend.  Yes, there was the French Roast.  Yes, there was the Italian Roast.  Yes, there was Tully's special House Blend.  But the 4th variety was NOT Kona, it was Breakfast Blend.  I purchased this from Amazon, and believed the photo.  I should have read the details a little better.  We are very disappointed.
