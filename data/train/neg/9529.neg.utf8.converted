I bought this product at BJ's for 1/3 of what the Amazon seller is charging here. I cannot believe the seller is even charging almost $20 for this when you can get it for under $6 at some discount retailers. But my issue with this product is that it claims to be "Soft" Peppermint when the candy is so hard you might break your teeth biting into one. These are not the restaurant style soft mints that melt in your mouth at all. You literally have to bite into them and continue to chew them to get them to melt. If you don't mind having harder than typical soft mints than this candy does offer an OK minty aftertaste.
