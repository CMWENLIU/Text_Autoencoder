I used this product for a few years because i thought it was organic and did not have the junk common to other broths.  How false that was.  This product is chuck full of MSG, a neurotoxin known for its adverse excitatory effects on the brain.  The word Spices means MSG in food industry, so as other crap in it, including hydorlyzed vegetable protein.  This product is total fraud and health hazard.  Shame on you for your greed.
