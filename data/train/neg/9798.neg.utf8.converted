I know that Indian desserts are traditionally very sweet (I've eaten my share of them), but this is a case where Kitchens of India could have and should have opted for less traditional.  The pumpkin in this dessert is good, but it's so hard to actually sense the flavor because of the overwhelming oil and sugar (so dense that it's gritty still).  I can't really recommend this product to others except for curiosity -- you could very easily make your own pumpkin "pudding" dessert that is much more palatable and satisfying.<br /><br />And my gosh, the calories & fat content - ouch!  It's so hard to imagine those numbers are real, but the nutrition you see listed here on Amazon is exactly the same as on the individual packages.  The only hope is to mix it in with something else that is very light (in calories & fat) to make a much larger dessert.
