My Boston thought these were AWESOME, and stole a second one from the package after I'd already given him one a few hours before.  After getting halfway through the first one, he threw up the entire thing.  That evening, he had pretty yucky diarrhea.  For that reason, I haven't given him any more since then.  In general, he's got a touchier stomach than a lot of other dogs, so maybe it's just him.  However, if you're going to bill this as offering digestive support, it better not cause my lil man to throw up and have diarrhea.  Wouldn't buy again.
