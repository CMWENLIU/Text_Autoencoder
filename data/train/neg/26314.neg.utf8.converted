Well, like most foods that someone brings to the market and tries to convince<br />you it is a great substitute for the real thing... the fake is worse than the real.<br />Add this bar to the list!<br /><br />We tried this just yesterday.<br />Admittedly, they are not horrible to the taste. Of course, sweet taste overrides most<br />other tastes on the tongue, so anything sweet will taste okay upfront.<br />They taste like one of those sugar wafers (the ones you can get in vanilla, strawberry<br />or chocolate really cheaply in the stores) dipped in chocolate flavored coating.<br />It had an odd aftertaste I could not pinpoint.<br /><br />Then I decided to look at the ingredients. That made the decision that I wouldn't be buying<br />these again. Why do mfgs continue to make chemical cocktails for us, shape it like a treat<br />and tell us how great it will be for us?  I guess because we keep buying them. I'll pass!<br /><br />INGREDIENTS OF THE SKINNY COW HEAVENLY CRISP 110 CAL BAR:<br /><br />SUGAR, whole wheat flour, hydrogenated palm kernel oil, nonfat milk, cocoa processed with alkali,<br />high oleic canola and/or sunflower oil, chicory root fiber, partially hydrogenated palm oil,<br />maltodextrin, milk, baking soda, corn syrup, partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil,<br />vegetable emulsifiers (soy lecithin, sorbitol tristearate), salt, natural and artificial flavor,<br />TBHQ (?) to protect flavor, ground peanuts.<br /><br />Wow - what a cocktail of garbage!<br />anything partially hydrogenated are the artery cloggers and should always be avoided.<br />I checked the wrapper and did not see peanuts mentioned anywhere except the ingredients list,<br />so if you have a peanut allergy, you should not eat these bars, but saw no warnings on the label.<br />Sugars, oils, salts and junk, made to look like a candy bar.<br /><br />All in all, have a real chocolate bar. Those have sugar too, but they'll taste good<br />and not be nearly as bad for you as these things.<br />I'll never buy them again.
