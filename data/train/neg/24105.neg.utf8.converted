Based on the reviews, I bought this; it is pretty bad, and reeks of the tin/metal can it will have been in for weeks or months by the time you get it. The sauce is made in Taiwan and is bizarre. Sorry, but not even the French can save this one. Food like this needs to be fresh or not at all. Take bread, cheese, and wine on a picnic, not this. I'm giving these away to the homeless.
