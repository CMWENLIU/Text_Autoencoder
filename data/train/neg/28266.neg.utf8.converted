Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty seemed like a good option as I keep my hair a bit longer and it does tend to be dry at the ends and occasionally at the scalp.<br /><br />Pros - It works well on the dry ends and if it were marketed as a product this way then I'd probably give it 4 stars.<br /><br />Cons - It has LOTS of oil content (starting with mineral oil) and arrived with no directions on how much to use, when to use, how often to use, etc.<br />When applied to the scalp in a small quantity the hair gets an oily appearance and sheen. Since that area of my hair is normally fine, just dry once in a while, that appearance wasn't needed. If you have VERY DRY hair then you might want to apply it there. I used the product twice in one week and my hair then looked greasy.  Cutting back to once a week and applying it to the dry hair in a small quantity worked better and it looks as though it might be just as effective if only used every 10 days.
