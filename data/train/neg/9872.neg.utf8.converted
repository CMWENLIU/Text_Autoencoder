My family loves these beans and I have ordered them before. The first shipment had 2 or 3 cans with small dents. My last order had 9 of 12 cans that were severely dented. This did not happen in shipping. The box was in good condition and packaged well by Amazon. Most of the dents are on the inside cans of the package.It seems that they come this way from the manufacturer. Amazon is sending me a replacement case and I hope they are in better shape.<br /><br />UPDATE: My replacement case came and 11 of 12 cans have dents. Amazon has refunded my money. I contacted Walnut Creek and they said they only sell Amazon first quality products and they are not sure how the cans are getting dented. I would not suggest purchasing these beans from Amazon.
