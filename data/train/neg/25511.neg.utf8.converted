These are NOT a long lasting chew! It took my standard poodle all of five minutes to completely finish a ChurpiChew where as it took her days to finish a Himalayan Dog Chew.<br /><br />I do NOT recommend buying this brand as it just doesn't last along as other brands do!<br /><br />I paid almost 10 bucks for a five minute chew.
