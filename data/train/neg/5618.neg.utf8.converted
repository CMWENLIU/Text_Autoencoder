I love this coconut water. Other waters are too bitter. This one is perfectly sweet. I usually get the glass bottles but the cans were on sale at my local store. I was sad to find that the canned coconut waters were not as good. There is definitely a funky taste to them that is almost unpleasant. I can see where other low reviewers are coming from. I'll stick to the glass bottled coconut waters from now on.
