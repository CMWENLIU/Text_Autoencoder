I have had about 9 flavours of Celsius products, which I believe is all of them.<br /><br />My ranking (Best to Worst) based on my preference:<br /><br />Sparkling Ginger Ale<br />Green Tea Peach Mango<br />Strawberry Kiwi<br />Iced Lemon Tea<br />Sparkling Wild Berry<br />Sparkling Orange<br />Sparkling Cola<br />Green Tea Raspberry Acai<br />Apple Orchard (Stevia)<br /><br />The Ginger Ale, Green Tea Peach mango, and Strawberry Kiwi are top notch to me, very tasty!  Everything up to the Cola is really good in my opinion.  The Raspberry Acai doesn't taste nearly as good as the others to me, but most friends like it.  The Apple Orchard is SOOOOOO incredibly BAD that it makes me feel nauseous, and makes me like the Raspberry Acai (which I previously detested) much more.  A friend who usually likes the Stevia sweetener flavour found in the Apple Orchard describe the flavour of Apple Orchard as 'monkey urine.'
