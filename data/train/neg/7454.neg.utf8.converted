I ordered these to use for a craft. I was expecting an assortment of colors as shown - bright primary colors. What I got was all pale yellow. I got in touch with customer service. Carmina was very nice. She was apologetic and agreed to send me an assorted shipment. This second shipment was assorted but the colors were silver, black, pale pink, and a goldish brown, still not as depicted. Due to time constraints I decided to make due with what I had. The capsules are fine. Just be forewarned that the colors shown are probably not the ones you'll be sent. If the product description had said "colors vary", then there would be no issue.
