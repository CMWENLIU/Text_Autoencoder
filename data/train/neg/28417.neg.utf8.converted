Please note that this product's ingredients contain whole wheat flour in addition to the quinoa.  In my opinion, the product listing is not clear about the inclusion of whole wheat.  The product photo is a small size and it is not mentioned in the product description.  Unless you see whole wheat in the ingredients list, you may think you are getting quinoa-only grain pasta (which Ancient Harvest also sells).  This could be a problem for those who are gluten-free.<br /><br />As for the cooking time, the instructions say 6-9 minutes, but as with other Ancient Harvest pasta products, I find that 12 minutes is the proper time for al dente noodles.<br /><br />Other than these quirks, Ancient Harvest quinoa pastas are a great alternative to traditional pasta varieties!
