I started purchasing matcha about a year after they started selling it at Starbucks and Jamba Juice. live near San Francisco's Japantown and have tried several brands, varying in price from about $6 to $11 for approximately 1 ounce packages. I was happy to find what I thought was a great deal on Amazon, which with the subscription discount works out to less than $4 an ounce.  The package shipped quick, but as others have noted, comes in an unsealed package. I wouldn't freak out about that, but all things being equal, I'd have more confidence if the package was sealed. Bigger complaint is the quality is not up to snuff. It does not mix properly and tastes bitter compared to the matcha that I'm used to. I tried it twice (once with soy milk, another time with non-fat milk), and on both occasions it created a strange mixing effect, with the top half of the glass mixing nicely and the bottom half a murky mess that wouldn't mix properly. Both times the drink left me naueseous.  I don't claim to be a green tea expert, so I'm giving it two stars instead of one, but I've never had these problems with store-bought matcha in Japantown (or at Starbucks and Jamba Juice, for that matter). I would not recommend and have cancelled my subscription.
