The thing that I like best about this product is the container.  It is a compact, convenient way to use loose sweetener at home rather than all of those paper packets.  The downside of the container is that measuring 1/4 tsp. can become more cumbersome and inaccurate than convenient.  As for flavor, there is little advantage over other sweeteners on the market.  Sugar is a significant ingredient along with erythritol.  This sugar alcohol has minimal impact on diabetic blood sugar levels but can cause problems for people with IBS or sensitive guts.  Other reviewers commented on the extreme sweetness but that was not my experience when using it with oatmeal.  1/4 tsp. of Nectresse was not discernable while 1 tsp. of sugar added just a touch of sweetness with no aftertaste.  This product left a decidedly unpleasant residual taste when added to coffee.  All in all there was little about Nectresse that would get me to consider buying it or to recommend it to anyone else.  I suspect that this is more about increasing sales in a sweetner saturated market than it is about providing a particularly unique product.
