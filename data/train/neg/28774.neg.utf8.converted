I have enjoyed your product for many a year but why send these e mails to people about ordering online knowing full well that they can't. Waste of my time and yours. If you dont send to NZ then remove us from the selection of countries in the account set up. You guys haven't thought this through have you. Nice beans but not worth the hassel. Im never buying your product again.
