There are those that will say I do not know what I am talking about concerning this new name the food industry is using for hydrogenated oils, but let me assure you, mono-diglycerides are hydrogenated before separated into mono-diglyceridies. The "mono" means they are a combination of various oils mixed together, hydrogenated, then certain fatty acids called diglycerides are then separated out. It is truly amazing how many people when confronted with the truth will still try to convince others the opposite of the truth.<br /><br />Mono-diglycerides remain the most widely used emulsifiers in food production. They are called mono-digylcerides because they are made from oils that have a high mono saturated fat content, but they are still hydrogenated. These are used in a wide variety of food manufacturing such as, breads, bagels, muffins, cookies, cakes, pies, donuts, pasta mixes, potato chips, ice creams, almost all packaged desserts, nearly all margarines and other spreads. Your local grocery bakery including Walmart bakeries use these oils. New margarine spreads Benecol(tm) and Take Control(tm) contain hydrogenated oils . Just read your label. Remember...its' your health!<br /><br />There are many food oil companies that produce mono-diglyerides. So when you read mono-diglycerides on packaged foods, it is nothing more than hydrogented oils. Below is a sample of one product listings from Gillco, oils manufactured by Quest International, one of the largest food oil producing companies worldwide. Gillco's url address is [...]. They sell mono-diglycerides using these names, Myverol
