It does not take a coffee expert to notice this. Before this, I had Dunkin Donuts' ground coffee. For the same amount of coffee, this 8'clock one generates much less aroma and coffee-taste. I had to put in so much more to feel some taste of coffee. In this regard, this is not worth the money. I am even wondering if they blend non-coffee things in it. I really do not understand where the good reviews comes from.
