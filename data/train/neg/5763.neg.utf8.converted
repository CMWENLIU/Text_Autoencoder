I bought this because the description said "No added sugar".  This is a blatant falsehood.  The second ingredient is 'evaporated cane juice', which is a fancy way of saying 'sugar'.<br />If what you're looking for is a peanut butter made from peanuts and nothing else (like Smucker's Natural) then don't buy this.  I am amazed that Amazon allows such blatantly false advertising.
