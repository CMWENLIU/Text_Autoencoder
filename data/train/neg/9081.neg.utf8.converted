I gave this to two aunts (85 and 95 years old). I always ask them to be honest when I send things like this in the mail ( I think most poeple are not honest when they receive something as a gift). Anyway, thier comments were: "the soup was OK, just powder, nothing special". For the money this item cost with shipping you would be much beter off purchasing gourmet soup mixes at specialty stores and making your own gift basket.
