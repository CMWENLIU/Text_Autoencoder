I am very upset. Not about the food, but about the way it was sold. This product <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00371V2V0">NTRA EVO HERR/SLM CAT 5/6.6#</a>, had me understanding that I would be getting 5 packages of 6.6# of food. I have gotten 1. The list price is 249.27. It for 27.99. What a deal until I only got 1/6.6# bag. That is not a savings, its a rip off. There is no way that 1 bag is listed for 249.00 and other heavier bags i found was less the price. I'm sure the food is excellent, but my cats will never find out. unless they send me 4 more bags or will stay full for the next month on 1/6.6# bag of chow.
