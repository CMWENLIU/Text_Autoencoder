This particular item is not kosher, if you take a close look to the picture you will notice that kosher is not writen on it. it also mentions that it's a porcine gelatin, which is pig gelatine.<br />How ever there is a Kosher gelatine listed on Amazone but it's more expensive than that item, $19.95 I believe. and you can see on the picture that it's a kosher beef gelatin.
