The bonsai plant itself looked like it could have been beautiful.  Unfortunately, when it was shipped to South Dakota around Christmastime, the state was experiencing extremely cold temperatures.  Only packing peanuts were used for insulation, and the plant died.  Restrictions should be placed on shipping these type of products to cold climates or packing material that provides better insulation should be used.
