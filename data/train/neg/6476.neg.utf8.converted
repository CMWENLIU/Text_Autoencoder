After reading the reviews, I ordered this extract.  I now have 3 bottles of almond extract that has absolutely no taste whatsoever!<br /><br />While it does smell like almond extract in the bottle, there is no flavor at all when added to my recipes.<br /><br />I've tried using lots more than the required amounts and still nothing.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend purchasing this item.
