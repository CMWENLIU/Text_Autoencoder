My one star rating above is not for the coconut milk itself but for the way the product arrived. I use this coconut milk all the time and was excited to see the price that Amazon was offering it at, but like one other reviewer reported all six of the cans came with dents...and not just tiny ones. The box they came in was in perfect condition so I can only come to a similar conclusion that Amazon is trying to offload the undesirable cans without disclosing their compromised condition. Pretty lame and shady if you ask me. My first thought was to return them, but apparently grocery items are not eligible for return.
