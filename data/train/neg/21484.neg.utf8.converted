I bought a box of these to take care of a clothes moth problem we had. The moths were the small clothes moths that this trap was supposed to attract. The only moths that were caught in this trap over 30 days were ones that landed elsewhere, and we manually put the trap over the moth so it had no choice but to fly through the trap. Even then, it took a couple of tries to get them to stick inside. Our cat killed 4 moths (that we know of) in the same period. Save your money and buy a cat instead.
