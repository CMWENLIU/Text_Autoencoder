I haven't bought a lot of Easter candy beyond jelly  beans and chocolate rabbits for a long time. But this year I wanted something different, so I started looking for these candy coated marshmallow eggs.They were a favorite of mine in the past, but I guess they have fallen out of favor. I cannot find them anywhere locally, so I thought I'd check online. Amazon is my go to site for things I can't find, but $9.00 for a 7 oz bag of candy? I don't think so. Jelly beans again this year.
