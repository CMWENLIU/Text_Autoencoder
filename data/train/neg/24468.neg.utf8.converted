When my tea bought in London ended I bought this tea in supermarket. What a disappointment! The tea is tasteless and very weak compared to the British equivalent. I ordered the same tea from Twinings.com, which came direct from England. It is in a black box. The tea I got from the official site steeps properly and has a much more distinct taste than this American version.
