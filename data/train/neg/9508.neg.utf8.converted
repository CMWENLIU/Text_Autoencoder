Tea is great, but it the description is FALSE and you will receive only one box of 16 tea bags, NOT "6 Packs" as advertised.  I wish I had read the reviews first, as I too was expecting 6 boxes.  There are other sellers with 6 boxes that are available with free shipping with my Prime membership.  It appears that Amazon doesn't even read the reviews or they would have fixed this description. I will order this product again, but probably from a different seller with truth in advertising.
