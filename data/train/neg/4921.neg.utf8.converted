I bought this cereal recently. The flakes are good-they don't get too soggy. The chocolate, not so good. It left a thick waxy coating on the roof of my mouth. I didn't think the taste was bad overall, just didn't like the waxy feeling. I will finish the box, but I doubt I'll buy it again. I guess that's what I get for trying to eat chocolate for breakfast!
