I purchased a three gal water bottle thru Amazon from EverBlue.<br /> first they sent me the wrong bottle not the one I ordered bu a totally different style.<br />Second when it arrived (they did ship quickly) I filled it with water and placed in my fridge<br />the plastic seam of the bottle leaked so bad it ruined a bunch of food.<br />In short untill this company gets a better handle on thier quality control<br /> I strongly reccommend to stay away from this product<br />Rjohn01@hotmail.com
