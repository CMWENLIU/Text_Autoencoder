This looks like a better deal than it REALLY is, and I wonder how many people who actually did the math for themselves would truly be pleased.<br /><br />This product is listed as 64 ounces, for a cost of $39.75, and they break it down as $0.41 per ounce. This would be a fantastic deal.<br /><br />HOWEVER, $39.75 for 64 ounces means this costs over $0.62 per ounce! This is not cool. I'm not sure if this was done intentionally, but it's bad business.
