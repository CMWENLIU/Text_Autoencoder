At first I loved this gum.  I have read a lot about the benefits of xylitol so I was very reluctant to believe anything bad about it.  Then, by process of elimination, I found out that every time I got a migraine, I had been chewing this gum.  I experimented by chewing extra for a few days and then going back to xylitol.  Indeed the xylitol days were marked with severe migraines.  I know I am just one person and a single person's experience is not scientifically rigorous.  That said, if you notice yourself getting headaches, ask yourself if it might not be the xylitol.  Also, please be cautious if you're giving this to children.  They might have a bad reaction to it even if you don't.
