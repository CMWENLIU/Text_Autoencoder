Great flavor but just can't stand the hard pieces of sand (I think it's sand anyway)<br />I have sensitive teeth and this sand will actually put tiny chips your teeth.  It's not just one piece of sand per teaspoon either, it's several.  Maybe I got a batch that's worse than normal but I'm not ordering anymore.  If there was a way the company could filter this out it, this salt would be great!
