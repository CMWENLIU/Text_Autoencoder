Although the flavor of the coffee is good, the K-cup is not properly sealed.  The cover seal breaks when brewing, resulting in coffee grounds in the brewed coffee and coffee coffee grounds in the Keurig brewer.  This necessitates a thorough cleaning of the brewer each time a new K-cup is used.  I ordered and received two boxes of Tullys House Blend.  I have not opened the second box because of the inferior seal on the K-cup.
