I was considering buying this product until I noticed it has MSG.  "Yeast Extract" is another name for MSG for those that don't know.  I don't necessarily have a problem with MSG.  What I have a problem with is manufacturers using different names to conceal the fact that an ingredient is in the product.<br /><br />And just to play both sides, MSG is actually considered safe for 99% of the population according to several studies(please do your own research to confirm).  However, I don't like being lied to, so this food is off my list.
