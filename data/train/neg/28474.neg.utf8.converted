Our family loves these granola bars normally. The shipments we have received have gotten worse each time. The current shipment we have, the bars are mostly hard but the chocolate chips are not good as well. They are very light brown and turn into a crumbly mess when you bite in. I recommend just buying them at your local store or to try another brand. Sorry for the bad review we really loved these at one time!
