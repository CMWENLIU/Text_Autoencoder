The image shown is not what is actually delivered. Why does this matter? Because the Berry Berry Kix formula is also different. It tastes NOTHING like the original version. This was why I bought the item to begin with. Many cereals have been infused with higher and higher amounts of whole grain, and it's ruining the taste. That's why I bought it from Amazon, thinking it was the original formula, which it sure as hell isn't.<br /><br />Oh, and the seller of this cereal has a 20% "restocking fee" for any returns (can you say ripoff), as well as you (the buyer) having to pay the shipping fees.<br /><br />In sum, I will never buy from these people again. And to the sellers, UPDATE YOUR DAMN IMAGES!
