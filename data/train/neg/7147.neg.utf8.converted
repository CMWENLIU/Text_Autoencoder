I see many of the reviews of this product were for PUPPIES.  Maybe they aer good for PUPPIES, but NOT FOR DOGS!!  I purchased 6 Quado dog bones. The dogs loved them and devoured them in only an hour. I was disappointed and disturbed that they went so quickly and went back to read the packaging to find a small blurb on the back of the package on the bottom right "Quado is to be consumed over a period of time and not in once sitting or even on day." (1) I paid about $8 for each bone with shipping.  This was for a bone which lasted only an hour.  I expected it to be a "bone" not a "treat."  I could have taken my dogs out to dinner for that price.  (2) If the bone is meant to be consumed over time, please make that obvious on the front of the package and not in some small print on the back.  It worries me now why they printed the statement on the back.<br /><br />I can appreciate the fact that they created environmentally-friendly products and trusted that I would be satisfied with my purchase.  I buy the best for my dogs despite not being a wealthy person.  I bought these bones because the shape is a great design.  I expected a bone that would last.  I am disappointed.  I would requested a refund for my purchase price. I have yet to hear from the company N-Bone.
