This was my first purchase of this product - and my last. I prepared a hot "cereal" with it, and as I began to eat it I noticed that there were bits of sand (or something like sand) within the seed. It was inedible. I tried the second package - same thing. I threw it all away and contacted Nutiva customer service and told them of the problem. They quickly agreed to replace the product, but I'm not sure I even want to try it again.
