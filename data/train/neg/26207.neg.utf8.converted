Greetings fellow amazonians I purchased these for a party I was having with for one of my neighbors. He had just got out of rehab so I felt monster was a good substitute for the beer and tequila that we normally had. Well the party was going great; everybody from all the other trailers were coming over; I had the girl with three boobs from the freak show sitting on my lap.  Then it happened I guess this energy drink gave my neighbor flashbacks of drinking jager and redbull or something because he ran off and we found him three hours later about a mile away past out behind the wheel of a truck that he didn't own with a bottle of rumplemitz net to him. So back off to rehuab he goes and I get to watch his trailer while he's gone which is great because he gets hbo. Beware of this drink you might not be able to handle it!
