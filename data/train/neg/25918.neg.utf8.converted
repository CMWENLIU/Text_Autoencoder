Hey this Iced  tea 2 Go has 2 Versions one with Splenda and no Warnings on the package and one with Aspartame & a FDA Phenylaline warning on the Box.<br /><br />I like the version of the product without a FDA warning on the side.<br /><br />Be sure you get the right product on this one, I was fooled too..
