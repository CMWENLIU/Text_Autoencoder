Order these every year for the holidays. The box arrived without a mark on it, perfectly intact, except for the contents.  31 of 72 cherries were broken.  The box was soaking wet and the entire box was unusable. Being the cellophane around the box was filled with pink liquid, I have no idea how it was not noticed that the box was bad before it was shipped. I will never purchase from this company again.
