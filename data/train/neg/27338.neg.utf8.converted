i WAS PRACTICALLY DISAPPOINTED AS BEFORE I ORDERED THE PRODUCT I WAS GIVEN THE IMPRESSION THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COCNUT MILK AND COCONUT CREAM IS THAT THE CREAM IS 100% COCNUT MILK WHILE THE MILK IS 70% WATER<br /><br />WHEN THE PRODUCT WAS DELIVERED TO ME I SAW IN THE CONTENTS THAT THIS WAS ONLY 70% COCONUT MILK.
