I was really disappointed in this product. Although the aroma is very nice, fresh and green smelling, there is a distinct bitterness in the flavor. This is not the peppery finish you find in good olive oil. I like the peppery finish. This is bitterness, plain and simple. I recommend that you try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET63MK">Barbera Frantoia Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 33.8-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)</a> instead. It has all the good attributes of the Bariani with none of the bad.
