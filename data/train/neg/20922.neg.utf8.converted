I love the Alba products because they contain lots of natural ingredients and are a great value for the price, plus I've always had good resutls with them.  I use the sea kelp products and really like them but decided to try something different for the summer, so I ordered the Jasmine moisturizer and the hibiscus facial toner.  The jasmine cream is wonderful and works great on my dry skin but, unfortunately, the hibiscus facial toner caused severe burning to my skin. After I read the entire ingredient listing, I was shocked to find this toner contains sodium hydroxide which is used in such harsh cleaning products as oven and drain cleaners.  I do have sensitive skin which, I am certain, caused the reaction.  I don't think this product is for sensitive skin, but be sure to read the entire ingredient list before you decide to purchase it, and if possible, try a sample of it first.  I went back to the sea kelp facial toner and have had no further problems.
