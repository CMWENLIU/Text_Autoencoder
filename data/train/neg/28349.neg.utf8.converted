I'm wondering if the positive reviews are by employees of these companies. I've heard that goes on. WHy would one customer say it's just like coffee house chai and other say it's not even tea. The reality is it isn't very Chai'ish. Weak and not very flavorfull. I think its impossible to extract true chai flavor without a very well made extract concentrate in each pod. I haven't found that in this or any of the other chai cups. Very dissapointed. Wish I could get my money back because I'm throwing them out. I'm a S-bucks Chai addict and no way does this even remotely come close. I'll stick to dumpong concentrate into breakfast tea.
