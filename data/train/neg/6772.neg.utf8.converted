I ordered 3 bottles of Heinz Yellow Mustard (17oz Upside down).  What I received was 6 bottles of Heinz Spicy Brown Mustard (17oz Upside down).  I have tried to contact the shipper but to date........No response.  I wish I could make these purchases all of the time.......Pay for 3 and receive 6.  Amazon Marketplace really DOES NOT work for me.  I would not suggest using Amazon Marketplace to anyone.
