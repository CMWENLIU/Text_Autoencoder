The smell of this bread in the bread machine was amazing.  Unfortunately, that's about the only positive thing I have to say about this product.  It did not rise, so what came out of the bread machine was a misshapen clump of doughy stuff that tasted horrible.  I use my bread machine frequently with the Hodgson Mill White bread mix and it turns out great.  This Honey Whole Wheat mix was definitely disappointing.
