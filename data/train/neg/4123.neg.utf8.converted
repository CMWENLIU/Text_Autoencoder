I began purchasing this brand at my local walmart store on the suggestion of a friend.  The lable suggests that feeding your animal this product will make their waste firmer and less frequent.  That part was certainly true. Unfortunately the ingredients in this food are shown by a variety of other websites to cause allergic reactions or worse in animals.  After a visit to the vet's office to treat a severe case of rash, ear-ache,itching and loss of pet hair in my cat Frisky I did a web search and tried to contact natural life pet products.  No response has come from the company, but I was able to find an article about the RECALL of this product from national chain stores last month because of possible instances of pet death.  Don't feed this to your pet if you love them.
