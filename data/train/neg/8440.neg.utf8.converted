I hate to say it, but lately my dogs are having problems with their bowels. This product is getting to the point I am going to go with another brand. I have been spending the bigger tag because I was believing I was doing something good for them. I have 5 Dogs. 4 of them over 50 pounds and 1 under 20. And only the little one seems to be ok on it. I am not sure what else could be complicating their diet. I assume, every dog is like every person, not all are going to have agreeable stomachs. But buyer beware, any product we buy that is pre-packaged you always run the risk of it not living up to the standard you might expect. For 40 bucks a bag, I expect my dogs to not be sick and not act like they are still starving. Hope there are more positive experiences for other people!
