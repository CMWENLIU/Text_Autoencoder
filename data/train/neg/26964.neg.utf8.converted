The 0810 sell buy date on the packets is a FAIL, these are already past their prime. I will not purchase this again.<br /><br />Nice big walnut and pecan halves perked up my taste buds. However, the nuts in this mixture were STALE and made the overall mix taste yucky. The rancid taste had permeated even the cranberries, raisins etc. Needless to say my healthy TV snacks were a major disappointment.
