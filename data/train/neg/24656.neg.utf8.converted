The box shows just plain lasagna and what I got was Italian.  I do not like the Italian and can get it at any local store.  I ordered it because I wanted the plain old fashioned lasagna, not Italian. Now I can't even contact anyone to try to tell them what happened.  Returns are not allowed on food, even if they show one thing and send you something else.  Now I am stuck with a product I will not use.  Don't care for bait and switch or a customer service group you can't reach.  I will be very careful what I order or not order again.
