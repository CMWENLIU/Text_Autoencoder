The picture looks like a nice bonsai tree.<br /><br />The product is a branch cut to about 4 inches in length and a clump of brown dead needles to it and spray painted.  The pieces are glued together with a big clump of white glue that runs all over the branch.  Whoever glued it together obviously felt more was better. because it's all over the place,<br /><br />this is not a preserved tree.<br /><br />It looks more like a second grade class project where the students took branches and glued them together and then spray painted the top green.<br />Wait, I'm sorry.  That is exactly what it is.<br /><br />I bought this for my wife for her birthday.<br />It's now hidden in the basement so I can ship it back.<br /><br />If they don't take returns I will throw it out.<br />It's that hideous
