Unless you're a die hard chocolate fan, I wouldn't recommend this product. Even then it's just way too overdone in the flavor department. It takes like a old candy bar that's been sitting around for 10 years, covered with sawdust and protein powder, and then frozen. I've tried almost all of the arctic zero flavors and it's definitely the one that tastes the most like chemicals. Chocolate flavored chemicals, but chemicals nonetheless. On a positive note it's still better tasting than protein shakes I've had that have the same nutritional value but that's not saying much.<br /><br />If you're looking to try arctic zero for the first time, head over to maple vanilla. It passes for frozen yogurt without a problem and has an awesome taste.
