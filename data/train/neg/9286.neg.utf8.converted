I love chocolate chip cookies.  I love Chips Ahoy! chocolate chip cookies.  So, CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE chocolate chip cookies should be just about perfect, right?<br /><br />WRONG!!!  CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE chocolate chip cookies truly could not be more disgusting.  The cookie is mushy not chewy, the taste is like cardboard, and the chocolate fudge smells and tastes medicinal.  They are not at all sweet.  They are tiny, highly caloric, and have a strong, weird aftertaste.<br /><br />I've offered samples of CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE chocolate chip cookies to just about everyone who has entered my house in the past few days, just to see if it was me or if it was really the cookies.  It really IS the cookies.  My family (husband and kids ages 6 and 14) were not impressed.  Friends and neighbors were equally disappointed.  The best thing my kids said about CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE chocolate chip cookies was that they tasted like Kellogg's Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars.  Now, that may very well be, but I ask you:  who wants their chocolate chip cookies to taste like dry, low cal cereal bars?  Not me, that's for sure!<br /><br />It is possible that the packaging and shipment may have contributed to the disastrous taste and texture of these CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE chocolate chip cookies.  These cookies were shipped to me, cross country in 100 degree weather.  They sat in my broiling mailbox for most of the afternoon.  But, come on, if you are going to offer a product that you ship nationwide or worldwide, then it needs to be able to  stand up to any and all possible conditions.  Hey, Nabisco, you need to seriously rethink this product.  NOT RECOMMENDED.
