This is the second moss "killing" product that I have tried for around a few trouble spots on the front lawn.  The first brand was safer brand moss killer.  It did absolutely nothing to even alter the mosses condition and smelled like I was doing little more than spraying orange juice on the lawn.  I decided to give this brand a go since it actually has more "chemical" properties to it rather than having an active ingredient of citrus.  Per the packaging instructions I gave the moss a thorough soak down with the product as I did with the safer brand product.  At first it looked like the moss was starting to turn a yellowish color at around day 2 and I thought it was working great.  That was until it rained out.  A few days later I was unhappy to determine that more moss has grown and what was starting to turn yellow has now come back full force.  *Note* It did not rain for at least a week after I sprayed this.  So, it's not like I sprayed it and then it happened to rain out a few minutes later.  Combined with the other reviewers complaints about it staining concrete and other surfaces I would suggest to try something else.  I will be trying scotts brand granules next, that actually rely on being wet down.
