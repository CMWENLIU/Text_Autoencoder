If you have bought Betty Crocker Potato Buds in the past, you probably liked them and that is why you would consider buying a case of 12.  This is not that product!  Betty Crocker has retained the name, but completely changed the product inside the box.  These are no longer "buds", but flakes that make up into an awful, heavy, sticky, gummy, pasty, mass.  The box says, "fluff with fork" like it always has, but fluffing this stuff would be akin to trying to fluff thickened wallpaper paste.  Plus, even if you are oblivious to texture in your food and on your tongue, the flavor is unacceptable and leaves an unpleasant aftertaste.  Potato Buds have gone from the best instant mashed potatoes I have ever tasted to the very worst, without exaggeration.<br /><br />To literally add insult to injury, the representatives have defended these changes by talking about things like "...coming into line with industry standards..." and,<br />"...assuring continued availability..."?????  What?  Bottom line though, is that they, rather than taking their customer's responses under advisement, defend their position and indicate that they have no intention of changing back to the original formulation.  They have the effrontery to suggest that consumers who are complaining just didn't follow the directions correctly.  I made them a second time, before I threw out the rest of the box, just to make sure I had not made a mistake in following the directions.  Nope.  They came out just as bad the second time as the first.<br /><br />To find out what others have to say and to see the company's responses, go to bettycrocker.com, click on "forums" in the drop-down menu under "home" and check out the thread, "New Potato Buds Are Terrible".  While you're there, look at what they've done to "Betty Crocker Supreme Brownie Mix."  You won't want to buy that product, again, either.
