I bought a case of this as part of my canned survival food storage. Needless to say it tastes awful and won't order anymore. I love molasses but for some reason I just can't stomach this. I was hoping it'd be a "canned comfort food" for a survival situation, but the only comfort would be not opening it in the first place.<br /><br />There's so many more options ouch there, canned bread is just not a good idea.
