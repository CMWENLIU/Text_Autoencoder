These are great chips but this is an outrageous price.  I grew up on these chips and will sacrifice much for a good hot chip. I used to live on OV barbeque fiestas which were introduced when I was in sixth grade in 1967.  I remember them well and with Dr. Pepper, and to this day nothing has ever matched the originals.  However, this is not a good buy, no way, no how. There are other brands that I buy from other places I have lived which are comparable in size and weight and pay about thirty dollars for sixteen bags with shipping.  If you need an Old Vienna chip fix, mail me back and I'll get my mom to hit me up and give them to you for considerably less.
