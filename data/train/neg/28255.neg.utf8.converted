Before using this hair oil or serum I was confused.  The name of this product refers to the "scalp," but anyone using hair oils or serums knows you don't put that stuff anywhere near your scalp.  That's where you're hair is healthiest but also the first hair that gets oily.  Additionally, I see it's for natural and relaxed hair.  I don't understand how it can be good for both.  Relaxed hair is usually very delicate and/or damaged, and natural hair is usually less so.  Another problem, I received a bottle with a label covering any product details without any directions how to apply or what it's for.  Do I use this as a treatment or a serum?<br /><br />Looking over the list of ingredients, which I had to look up on the internet, a major red flag jumped out at me - the first ingredient is mineral oil!  That's something most people would not want to put anywhere near their hair.  More importantly, "ultra shea" is shown on the label but you only find it listed as the seventh ingredient.  Avid label readers know the further down on the list of ingredients, the less of that substance is in the product.<br /><br />This product is a blend of various oils:  mineral, coconut, palm, shea, wheat germ, sweet almond, sunflower seed, soybean and argan.  So I would strongly advise applying very, very little of this to your hair, and mostly to damaged sections (bottom half).  I caution anyone who doesn't have very dry hair that this is not for them.<br /><br />Onto the packaging.  It's cheap and downright awful.  This bottle reminds me of the developer container you get w/ box hair color which is destined for the garbage after one use.  Product junkies prefer something esthetically pleasing in their packaging, and there's absolutely zero here.  Also, as others have mentioned, the fragrance is unappealing.  Do NOT like it.  I have fine hair so this stuff just weighed it down.  If you have fine hair, my recommendation might be to use this as a pre-shampoo or overnight treatment (you might want to protect your pillowcase) that you can shampoo out in the morning.  Will update in this regard.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I do like this stuff as a treatment for my ends.  It does a nice job of smoothing them and makes them feel less dry.  So I'll nudge up my rating to three stars.  (Still not loving the fragrance.)<br /><br />CAUTION!  I'm taking one star off this.  Last night this stuff fell off my dresser and broke open, leaving oil all over my parkay floor.  Only confirmed my comments about the EXTREMELY cheap packaging.  When does a plastic bottle break upon dropping?  For a hot minute I thought about salvaging the remainder of product but instead just tossed it.  Whatever you do, don't drop this stuff unless you want a dangerously slippery floor!  Could only imagine the serious situation something like this could present for an older person with osteoporosis.  Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy:  a lawsuit could certainly be in your future!
