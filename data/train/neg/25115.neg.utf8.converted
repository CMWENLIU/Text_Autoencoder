Although this is a negative review, you will not find a bigger fan of Celestial Seasonings tea than me, which is why this variety of tea disappointed me so. The original blend without white tea was so much better. It was a perfect balance of tartness and sweetness. This new blend, on the other hand, tastes like lawn mower clippings. I would expect that from Bigelow or Yogi tea, but not my beloved Celestial Seasonings. Although I can understand the desire for innovation, sometimes the adage holds true: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." CS had the perfect forumula before, and they ruined it. Sadly, I will have to break my monogamous relationship with CS and try other brands of green tea. Good thing that I received a free sample of this tea to try and didn't waste my hard-earned money on a whole package of it.
