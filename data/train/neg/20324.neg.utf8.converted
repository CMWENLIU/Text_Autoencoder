Love the taste, but called the company and found out that there is BPA in the can lining.  Personally I will not spend the extra for Organic food if there is chemicals in the can lining.  Good news is that they are phasing out the cans with the BPA lining and going BPA free.  The lady from consumer relations said that in about 6months they will have BPA free cans on the shelves exclusively.
