I bought this particular water kefir because I had spoken to and watched the video from Cultures for Health.  This company is using their logo, but it is NOT from Cultures for Health! It came from another company in a different state.  I emailed CFH to tell them about this impostor and they were aware of it.  Why is Amazon allowing this? Anyway the grains were not dehydrated and there was not a sufficient amount (in my opinion) to get good kefir. I do not appreciate their false advertising. AMAZON, check this out!
