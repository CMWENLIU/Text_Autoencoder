I, too, noticed a change in the Ovaltine with the new packaging.  It is extremely disappointing.  The flavor seems a little different and the texture is definitely different.  I'm not sure why they changed something that didn't need changing.  I am no longer a loyal Ovaltine customer -- it doesn't seem much better than Nesquik anymore.
