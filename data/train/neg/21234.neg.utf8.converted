I loved this bread WHEN it was a reasonable, economical buy, $9.60 for a carton of six 1 LB boxes.<br />Without any notice of a price change coming or explanation of why the price was being raised to such an extreme, the exact same product is now a whopping $16.01!!! Retail prices on whole wheat flour have gone up, that's no secret. But not almost double... In my book, this price hike is way over the line of reason and that ate 4 of the 5 possible rating Stars. Terrific bread, outrageously priced.
