I like the juice.<br /><br />But all the cans, even in the case packaging, every one is bent.  This is the second subscription delivery just like this.<br /><br />That means these are clearly 'seconds.'  Amazon is shipping Seconds!  Not the good product that this is.<br /><br />Once the cans are bent, the seal between the aluminum can (the inside of which is sprayed with a protective coating) is compromised.  Making this unhealthy to drink.
