The smell is wonderful.<br />I like ginger. Granted, I don't just pick up a chunk of ginger and toss it in my mouth and start munching.<br />That is what I think I can compare this to. *I don't know; maybe this is what this tea was made for: those kinds of people.* According to the packet, you just pour the packet (implied ALL) into a cup, add 250ml (a little over 8 oz) of hot water into it, and presto! PURE. NASTINESS!<br /><br />This is the strongest tea I think I've tasted/tried to drink in a LONG. TIME. >.&lt;<br />I tried to dilute it, which helped some, but the overall taste was just.....AWFUL! The first time or two I sipped it, it tasted bad, but then I thought it was due to something I had recently ate; so I drank some (regular, non-flavoured) water and waited a minute or two - also allowing time for tea to cool down. But none of that helped. :(<br />It was just too strong for me. It wasn't bitter, but it just left a nasty, almost dirt-like taste in the mouth. It was just too much. I couldn't drink it and ended up pouring it out.<br /><br />I would NOT recommend this unless you are a ginger-LOVER...and even then I'd be hesitant. : \
