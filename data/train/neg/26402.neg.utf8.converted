My first mistake was ordering this during the summer. It did arrive in a timely fashion but it ends there. I could smell the salami before I even opened it and it didn't smell much like salami. The inside of the package was very greasy and the outside of the salami was really gross. You could see where the grease was oozing out of the ends. It smelt off, not like it was suppose to, and I know since I have had this salami before. I called the company that sold it and they kept telling me that it was fine, the heat made the grease come out and the smell was nothing. They hang salami up for months without refrigeration. After pressing him on this for about 20 min, he finally said that I could send it back at my cost, and they will check it to see if anything is wrong with it. If there is, than they will replace it but he doesn't think there is. To me, that sounds like throwing good money after bad money. So I'll be out more money and still not have a salami.
