I purchased this charger and it was delivered as advertised.  Placed it in the daylight for three days as directed and set it up on our corral fence.  Unfortunately, from the very first time it was turned on the charger did not work correctly.  A call to the company yielded two solutions.  (1) Place it in the sun for three more days or (2) Send it in for repair.  Instead, I chose option (3) Send it back to Amazon.com (which was done in fine fashion, thank you) and purchase a Zareba LIS3B which has worked and is still working perfectly.  I would not recommend the Fi-Shock SS-440.
