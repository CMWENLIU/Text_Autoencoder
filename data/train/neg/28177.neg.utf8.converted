I love Timothy's coffees, orange tea, chai tea, etc... This is first Timothy's product I didn't like.<br /><br />Nothing is more soothing than a cup of hot peppermint tea; it's like a hug from the inside out. I order fresh loose tea leaves from a website I'm probably not supposed to name here. Steeping the loose leaves in a glass teapot with an infuser is a pleasant ritual--but inconvenient for work. So I bought these k-cups to make peppermint tea at my desk.<br /><br />Yuck! What a disappointment. The tea is awfully strong and bitter. I added half again as much water, ice, a little Splenda (my fresh peppermint tea never needs sweetener), and drank it as iced tea, but it still had an edge to it I didn't enjoy.
