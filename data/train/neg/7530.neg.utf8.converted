As many other one star reviewers have posted my unit's blender function did not work.  It is a brand new unit right out of the box.  Steam function works great, but the motor would never turn the blender blade so my food just sat there.  Luckily there's an easy fix.  I took the entire unit apart and found that the belt from the motor was not engaging the turnshaft that would in turn enable the blade to spin.  After properly aligning the belt I put it all back together and the unit now blends like it is supposed to.  My guess is that this is the same problem that caused others' blender function to not work.  I would futher venture that the Brezza knows about this issue and has done nothing to correct it.  It's hard to believe that after multiple complaints about the same problem that Brezza does not put its units through some sort of inspection process to prevent this from happening.  It is very frustrating to have to fix a brand new product that has just been taken out of the box.
