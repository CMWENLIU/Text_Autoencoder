Well for reasons I will not go into here I needed to give up my morning caffeine habit.  This was a major problem for me since I am a coffee lover!  I don't just drink coffee for the kick, I also drink it for the flavor which I adore.  When I say adore, let me explain that further by saying I have worked in the coffee industry and tasted some of the best coffees on the planet! My favorite of all time being sun dried, Tanzanian Peaberry! So, suffice it to say, I'm a bit of a coffee nut. I mean, I'm the black no sugar coffee guy, and I've been drinking coffee since High School. So, having to give it up coffee completely was a horrifying thought!<br />  After my thoughts of suicide subsided I decided to look into some of the coffee alternatives just to see what's available.  I thought, "If I can't have coffee, maybe I can have something that tastes like coffee?" Right?  WRONG!!!  I reviewed several products, and coffee substitutes paying close attention to the reviewers comments regarding product flavor.  I realized that these products would not taste exactly like coffee, but I was looking for the product that was "Most Coffee Like", and Teeccino was rated highest in these categories.  I believed that I was onto something grand!  A coffee substitute that actually tastes "like" coffee.  I mean what is the point of a "Coffee Substitute" if it doesn't actually taste like coffee? Boy was I in for a let down!<br />  Upon receiving the product I immediately read the instructions on how to "Brew" my Teeccino.  I put on some water to boil and waited with great anticipation, almost like a kid on Christmas morning.  In the past I have used a French Press for coffee, but for this application I thought manual drip would be a better fit. When I began to pour the water over this concoction, I began to smell something tangy, almost sour.  It did not smell anything like coffee.  Once my cup was brewed, I brought it to my nose, and the Teeccino smelled burnt, liked burned sugar and raisins.  The taste? Well, Teeccino has all of the negative qualities of bad coffee, but without actual coffee flavor. It is very acidic and bitter with an after taste that can only be described as tasting like bug spray smells.  Honestly!  The lingering flavor in my mouth really reminded me of the smell of bug spray!  It was so foul that it gave me a sour stomach and made me nauseous for about an hour after trying it. If I could give this product a rating of zero stars I would.  Take it from me, do not believe what other reviewers have written, Teeccino tastes and smells nothing like coffee!  This has got to be the worst hot beverage that I have ever tasted!  I didn't even bother to return the Teeccino, I was so disgusted that I threw it out in order to prevent further damage to any of Amazon's other customers!
