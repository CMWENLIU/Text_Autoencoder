I love dark chocolate. I don't even bother with milk chocolate much since I turned 40, cause dark is where it's at!<br /><br />I love Valrhona, and I've also bought other high end chocolates over the past decade over at my gourmet shop or Fresh Market. I even love those chocolate truffles that are the store brand at Whole Foods (365 brand). But I've been moving into organic foods (and preferably local when possible) over the last year plus. One of the things I decided to do was try to replace my fave chocolate snacks with equivalent ORGANIC ones, including chocolate cookies.<br /><br />Well, I tried this high cocoa content of Green and Black's and their Mint Chocolate bar. I threw out both before I finished them. Neither did it for me.<br /><br />I really find them to be highly bitter. Not bitter as in the normal bitterness that a high cocoa content has. A really unpleasant bitterness, like coffee that's sat too long in the carafe.<br /><br />I've tried a couple other organic chocolates I picked at random at Whole Foods and have yet to find one that makes me go, "yes, this is it!"  Green and Black's 70% is soooo not it.<br /><br />So, FWIW, that has been my experience with G&B, which as you can see differs from the previous commenters who love it. YMMW.<br /><br />Back to Valrhona.<br /><br />Mir
