I decided to try this, and bought a bottle since I was up from 8:30am on a Sunday, and had to work a double (4am -Midnight and Midnight - 8am), and wouldn't be home till around 9am.<br /><br />It has a horrible taste.  I gagged and chugged down some water hoping to get rid of the taste.<br /><br />I chugged it around 5am, hoping the "5 hour" energy drink would last till I get home.<br /><br />Felt absolutely zero pick up, zero energy.  Didn't work for me.
