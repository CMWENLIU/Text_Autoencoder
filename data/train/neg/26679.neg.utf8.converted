I normally love everything made by Annie's and often buy the bunny grahams and fruit snacks for my grandson. However, I was stunned by how much I hated this mac and cheese mix!! It's absolutely awful --the cheese sauce tastes artificial and leaves a weird aftertaste. Sorry Annie, but won't purchase this again. I will give it one star for being organic.
