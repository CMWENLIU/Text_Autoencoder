My husband brought home a pumpkin spice k-cup for me to try. I was excited, as I love pretty much anything pumpkin. One sip of this, and I nearly gagged! It was so awful! Whatever spices they use to flavor this are way too overpowering. My husband thought I was over reacting and he took a sip and choked too! It really is one of the worst flavored coffees I have ever had. I would rate it a 0 if I could.
