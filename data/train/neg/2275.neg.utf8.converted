I was quite excited to try these cocoa roasted almonds out. I love almonds and I love chocolate. And most reviews of this product imply that you get your fix of both, without the extra sugar.<br />Well there's definitely a whole lot less sugar in this thing - it tastes pretty bad to me. And I was quite shocked. I guess I need at least a little more sweet. But I'm shocked because I'm not THAT much of a sweet tooth. It's the bitter after-taste that really bothers me with this product. I really couldn't take it.<br />So just fair warning to those who might think this is going to be a great combo of chocolate and almond. Think again! This is really just cocoa and almond, and, for me, that left a very bad taste.
