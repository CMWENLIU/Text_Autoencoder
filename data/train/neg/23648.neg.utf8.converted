If you're dealing with food allergies as well as celiac disease, be warned: the reformulated Devil's Food Cake Mix now contains soy flour. This is possibly the nastiest thing Betty Crocker Corporation could have done. "Hey! Let's take a product made for the specialty celiac market, and make it unsafe for up to 40% of celiacs, those who react to soy protein!"<br /><br />Bad move, BC.<br /><br />Prior to this recipe change, I would have given it 4 stars, as it is easy and convenient, but not great.
