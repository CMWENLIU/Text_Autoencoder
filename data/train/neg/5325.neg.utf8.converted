i subscribed happily but was very disappointed. I'm from South Asia so I'm familiar with this kind of food.<br /><br /> Dal Bukara - Black Lentil Curry : this was alright. I had to put more spices to make it better<br /> Palak Paneer- Spinach w/Cottage Cheese: alright; not too special<br /> Rajma Masala - Red Kidney Bean Curry : I didn't enjoy this and ended throwing it away<br /> Navratan Korma - Mixed Vegetable & Cottage Cheese Curry; I couldn't eat more than a few bites. it smelled really bad and tasted WORSE. all i tasted was cumin.<br />pav Bhaji - Mashed Vegetable Curry:<br />Pindi Chana-Chick Pea Curry: this was the ONLY packet I actually enjoyed from the 6 but not enough to make me buy this brand again<br /><br />all i tasted for most of the 6 products was cumin and more cumin. if you've never tried indian cuisine before; I wouldn't advise you to have your first impression from here.
