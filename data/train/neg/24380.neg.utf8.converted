I don't understand all the hype on this product.  I bought 6 bags and prepared one for my husband and I for dinner with shrimp.  Followed the directions to rinse well. The noodles were chewy and the texture unappetizing.  My husband hardly ate any and went without dinner.  Maybe I was hoping what they promised was true, but I wouldn't recommend these to anyone who enjoys food.
