I really wanted to like these nut bars.  My mouth started watering as soon as I ordered them.  Unfortunately, the reality didn't live up to the anticipation.<br /><br />The first thing I wanted to know was the nutrition information, which I was unable to find anywhere online before ordering.  Each bar contains 220 calories, 13 grams of fat, and 3 grams of fiber.  For comparison, that's 5 Weight Watcher's Points(tm), where most granola bars I eat come in at 2 points.  This wasn't far out of line with my expectations, since this bar is primarily made of nuts, and a tasty snack is occasionally worth it, but it does keep it from being an every day snack for me.<br /><br />The taste of the bar was okay, but way too chewy, with a sliver of peanut butter spread across the bottom that adds mess without adding much to the taste.  It was less messy when eaten upside down, but my jaw still hurt by the end from working so hard to chew it.  I was also expecting the bar to be either sweet or roasted salty, but this was neither.  Unless you are a huge fan of practically raw peanuts, give this nut bar a pass.
