I am a HUGE fan of honey, I've never found a (or thought there existed) honey that tasted bad. This honey is absolutely atrocious. It tastes like somehow it sat out far too long and soured.. of course this is honey so it's not possible, it's just the natural taste of the honey. Like the bees took it straight from ivy and bark.<br />I most commonly use honey for my tea in the morning and the rancid portion of this honey is so overwhelming that it ruins the tea, so I tried using it for cooking thinking that would be better, so I baked banana bread with it, after it came out of the oven I couldn't even taste the banana, the honey completely overpowered everything else.<br />Now I'm stuck with five unopened bottles of this useless honey, what now?
