I bought this for my wife who is an avid coffee drinker.  Here are her thoughts:<br /><br />As a coffee addict, I anticipated that this blend of ground coffee and vanilla beans would far surpass the cloyingly sweet fake vanilla coffee flavors currently on the market. My expecations were raised further upon opening the bag with the deep aroma of both vanilla and coffee bean. However, once the coffee is actually brewed, the vanilla is nothing more than a strange aftertaste--and not even a vanilla taste. The coffee itself is strong, as one expect with Starbucks brand, but it's not as full-bodied as their House Blend or other blends, such as Verona. Something just seems to be missing. I'm not sure if they're using a lower quality bean or the ground vanilla beans and/or Indian sasparilla root (the other ingredient in the blend) is throwing the balance of the coffee off. Or, maybe it's my perception of vanilla coffee being sweet; this coffee most certainly is not. I will stick with Starbucks House Blend for regular coffee, and if I'm in the mood for vanilla coffee, I would opt for Dunkin Donuts
