First of all, you can get this same item (5-13 oz cans) for less than $10 at Sam's Club, so this product is ridiculously overpriced, even if you factor in free shipping.  Secondly, as another reviewer pointed out, this chicken is extremely bland, in fact I think it is the most bland chicken imaginable.  It just tastes like nothing.  I honestly use it for dog treats.  It works great for this purpose.  For some reason my dogs will not eat specially made "dog treats", no matter what kind I try to use.  This stuff though is bland and lean enough that it works great as a dog treat.
