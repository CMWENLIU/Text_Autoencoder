I purchased these for my vegetarian college student with Subscribe and Save.  They were a bit pricey, but as a parent, it at least seemed like a good balanced meal for her (an edamame AND hummus lover) to have on hand.  She didn't like it .. at all.  She said everything tasted "funny" (her word) except for the little fruit pack and told me to cancel the Subscribe and Save subscription for them, because it was a waste of my money.
