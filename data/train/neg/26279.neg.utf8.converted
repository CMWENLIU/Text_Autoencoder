Last October I purchased a 3-pound bag of this product at Costco and stuck it in my panty until my French Bulldog puppy was old enough to chew it. At seven months, I unsealed the bag and gave her one piece. I could tell that she loved the taste as I watched her consume it.<br /><br />The next day, she wasn't at all interested in her morning feeding (this never happened before) and she was acting very weird. She was making very strange postures with her body (in hindsight this was probably a mild seizure). Then I noticed that during the night, she had had some bouts of diarrhea out of her dog potty on my laundry room floor. I took her to her vet and she sent in a fecal test to the lab. (The next day, the test came back negative.) The vet told me to feed her rice and chicken and gave me a feeding schedule along with Fortiflor powder to put on her food to build up the "good" bugs in her digestive tract. The vet diagnosis was that of Colitis.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't associate the eating of the chicken jerky treat with this incident so about two months later, I gave her another one of these treats and like before, she relished it. The next morning, again she was acting listless and wouldn't go near her morning feeding. This time she had fresh blood stains around her anus. I freaked out. I went to the laundry room and there was bloody diarrhea all over the place. I immediately took her to see her vet. Again, the vet sent in a fecal test which came back negative the next day. This time the vet prescribed a medication for Giardia (just in case) and an antibiotic and told me to put her on the rice and chicken diet again. My puppy was on this medication for a week to 10 days (I don't remember exactly).<br /><br />I STILL didn't catch on to the chicken jerky/bloody diarrhea association, so last week I fed her another one of the chicken jerky strips. The next morning, I  saw that she had bloody diarrhea again and FINALLY realized the association between feeding the chicken strip and my puppy getting sick! I am 100% POSITIVE that the treat caused my dog all of her gastrointestinal problems. I know that she is NOT allergic to chicken. I googled "Kingdom Pets Chicken Jerky" and found all kinds of reports of people experiencing similar reactions with their small dogs after feeding this treat. I only wish that I had realized the association earlier, and I could have spared my little girl a lot of pain and discomfort (and about (...) in vet bills).<br /><br />I read the FDA warning on their website, I called Costco to report it, and I left a message on the Kingdom Pets Voicemail. I also phoned the FDA complaint coordinator in my area (N. California) and spoke to the S. California coordinator who told me that MANY similar complaints have been made about this product. I wonder how many complaints have to be reported before this product is banned? If this was a "people" food, I'm sure it would have been recalled immediately. However, since it's only for dogs... .<br /><br />The Kingdom Pets man called me the next day and told me that the product had been thoroughly tested and found to be safe. He did admit that he was aware that some dogs were not able to "tolerate" the treat and that those owners should just NOT FEED IT. Of course he had to say that so his company would not be culpable. What a crock! I just hope that my nine-month old puppy hasn't suffered permanent damage to her organs.<br /><br />FDA WARNING:  (...)<br />DON'T RISK YOUR DOG'S HEALTH; DON'T FEED THIS TREAT TO YOUR SMALL DOG!!
