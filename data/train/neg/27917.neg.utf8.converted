I got this basket today and it was the biggest waste of money.<br />There were two small truffles, 1.43oz and 1.60oz. 4 thin small biscoffee .85oz, almonds 1oz, peanuts 1oz. Bag of ginger snaps 2.13oz. Chocolate napolitan milk and dark chocolate 6 pieces each at 1oz each. Stoned wheat wafers at 1/2oz. nuts and fruit 1oz, carmels flear de sol 6 pieces, and Italian herb cheese 3.5oz that was overpowering garlic flavored.<br />Basically what you paid for was a basket and cellophane with samples inside.<br />The price was outrageous. DO NOT ORDER THIS BASKET FOR A GIFT, YOU WILL BE EMBARASSING YOURSELF.
