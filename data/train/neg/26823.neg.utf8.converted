The Cote D'or Dark 86% Brut Chocolate Cocoa, 3.5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 10) is close to the worst chocolate I have eaten, if not actually the worst.  It has just about no chocolate taste.  It's not spoiled, it's not rotten, it doesn't smell like skunk or anything bad like that.  It's just plain tasteless.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon's return policy doesn't allow grocery items to be returned.  I have e-mailed them, and unless they let me return it, I don't plan to buy food from Amazon in the future.
