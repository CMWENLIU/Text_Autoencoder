The AAP says not to make your own green beans, spinach, squash etc. due to the higher levels of nitrates so I thought this product would be great to introduce green beans to my 6 month old. The product contains FISH OIL, so it is not a suitable candidate for a 6 month old or an introductory food for any age. It is also not returnable.<br /><br />While the amazon site lists the product ingredients as green beans and water only, the picture of the product says with DHA. The DHA comes from fish oil. After contacting Amazon to clear up the fact that this was not the product I thought I was ordering, they refunded my money. They offered to send out a new (replacement) item, but I think I would get the same mislabeled product. While I was not happy about the trouble this mislabeling caused I think Amazon's customer service did a great job.
