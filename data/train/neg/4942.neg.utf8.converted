I was looking for some vanilla powder for my homemade lattes. I saw this was offered via Amazon prime (ie, i'd get it fast). So, I went with it.<br /><br />Well, there's 20 bucks down the drain. This is good-sized amount of what is essentially a tasteless, sweetish powder. No beautiful vanilla scent. No beautiful vanilla taste. I ended putting 2 teaspoons worth trying to get some vanilla flavor (without much luck).<br /><br />Spare yourself. Skip this. Find a different vanilla powder. I totally regret buying this.<br /><br />Mir
