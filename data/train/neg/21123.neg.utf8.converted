Pamela's cookies have long been the gold-standard for gluten-free treats and their chocolate-y goodness has gotten me through many a sad gluten-free day. When I saw these bars I snatched them up: sometimes you want a snack and a girl can eat only so many cookies and still keep her figure. Sadly, these tasteless, not-very-good-for-you bars fall short of the mark.<br /><br />TASTE: Blah. Sort of a raisin-studded sawdust is how I would describe it.<br /><br />NUTRITION: Also blah. There's some token chia, but the fiber, vitamin and mineral content is lacking. Plus the calorie count is high for such a tiny bar.<br /><br />THE SUGGESTED REMEDY: More spice (a tad more nutmeg and a dash of cardamon perhaps), swap out the raisins for cherries, increase the size of the bar and more fiber please.<br /><br />THE GRADE: C-<br /><br />It ain't worth the price my fellow gluten-freers. The search continues!
