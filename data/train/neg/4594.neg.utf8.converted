I have been buying Purely O's for the past few years.  Yes, I was paying a premium, however it was worth it.  The ingredients were organic, these was a decent fiber content, and most importantly, there was no corn or sugar.  Recently General Mills (company that owns Cascadian Farms)decided to covertly change the formula, add a bunch of sugar and corn, and pass it off as the same cereal.  I opened the box and thought that that there was a packaging mix-up.  I thought they put the Honey O's in the Purely O's box.  I called the customer service number (which I have never done before) to let them know.  To my surprise I was told that it was not a mixup, and that they had changed the formula.  I was stunned.  I had finally found a fortified cereal without all of the junk in it that I liked.  Now it is just another overpriced mainstream sugar cereal.  Obviously General Mills is trying to maximize profits by cheapening the ingredients in their line of foods.  Poor form in my opinion.  I agree with the other reviews.  At the very least, inform people.  They have lost me as a Purely O's customer, and I question whether or not I can trust the brand in general.  Don't bother with this cereal.  It's no longer worth the premium you need to pay.
