This lefse' isn't even worth one star, but that was the lowest Amazon would let me go.  There is no flavor to it what-so-ever.  You can't taste the potatoes or the butter, all you taste is flour and it's very dry.  It used to be better years ago when it slightly resembled the taste of potatoes, but as it is with many items, they must have found ways to save a buck at the expense of the quality & flavor.  Don't waste your money!  You're better off investing in the equipment to make your own, or finding a website that sells an authentic "home-made" variety.  I grew up in a Scandinavian household that made traditional lefse' for family gatherings, trust me when I say Mrs Olson's is absolutely horrible.
