The probe has a braided metal outer jacket on the cable that causes any flexing of the cable to strain the cable where it exits the probe.  This condition causes failure (shorting of the sensor wires to the jacket) at that point.  I have had 2 other probes with this type of cable that failed in that mode.  The best type of cable is a thick silicone jacket like used on microwave temp probes.
