We got these at Costco, but same brand and size.  Our dog didn't get sick immediately, but a friend at the dog park mentioned some issues with this brand so we looked around and saw mixed reviews, but most of the really bad reviews were old (2007 or so), so we didn't stop giving them to her altogether, although we didn't give her many either, although she seems to love them.<br /><br />A few days/weeks went by, and then last week we noticed that she was peeing 3-4 times in the morning and in the evening, when she normally would go 1 or 2 times depending on how much running around she did.  At that point we decided to stop giving her any of these treats, and within a few days she was back to normal.  Since other people complaining about these treats mentioned renal failure, and urinating often is a sign of this condition, I'm assuming there's a direct connection as it was immediately after giving here these treats that she started having any issues/conditions with urination.
