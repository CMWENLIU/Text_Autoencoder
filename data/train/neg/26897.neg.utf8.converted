There needs to be a choice for ZERO stars.<br /><br />While the pictures are nice, and their website (www amazingclubs com) specifically bolds the statement that they have the "freshest and most mouth-watering desserts" it is the complete opposite. The first month we received dry brownies that were slightly smashed and crumbling. The second month was a small dry marble bundt cake (no way would it serve 8-12 even if you wanted to) and just now received white chocolate chip cookies that were (you guessed it) dry. Hard to believe that they are getting away with selling a dozen or so average-at-best brownies and a few more cookies for $28 a pop. This is a great racket for them, but hopefully I can post this review in enough places that they won't take anymore people in. Definitely NOT gourmet - do not order this.
