Any food with excessive salt in it will react with my<br />medicine and cause my ankles to swell to elephant size.<br />So,  please, cut down on the salt;  maybe just a little means a lot.<br />Remember 'Bones' in Star Trek?  He used too much of something when he could hve used a smaller amount.  Thanks,  Jim S.
