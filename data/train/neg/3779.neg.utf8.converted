Aspertame causes alot of problems including preventing weight loss<br />It gives me a headache and causes my Mom's blood pressure to go up<br />I would rather get it with out any sweetner added or have honey in it.<br /><br />The FDA knows it's poison and denies it.<br /><br />I don't like to see people being hurt by the lies concerning what they eat and drink.<br /><br />We should get in the habit of researching all ingredients in what we eat the less ingredients the better.<br />I hope this helps someone, if you drink sugar substitute and feel bad it could be the culprit.<br /><br />msg is another bad one.
