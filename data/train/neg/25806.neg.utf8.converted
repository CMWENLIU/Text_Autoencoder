We bought the coffee storage drawer to store our K-cups under the Keurig coffee maker. The top of the drawer is supported by "ribs" that run underneath from front to back. When you stick the pods in the drawer, the pods in the middle row don't fit easily because of the supporting "rib". In our case, this rib kept tearing the top of our K-cups. This is not a good design for a K-cup drawer.
