Greetings fellow amazonians I just love indian food! I have always said that if I had to go vegetarian I would move to india for all the great flavors that the put into their food. Being on the road so much has limited my availabity to great indian restaurant and when I saw this on amazon I thought wow I must have these. Well the shipment came quickly (as always) and I was excited to share these great flavors with my trailermates, mongo and eugene. Mongo was in (he always is when it invloves food), but eugene was going off to a local comic book show because he wanted to get an autograph from one of the original borgs from some star trek show. Anyhoo I decided to make mongo the pav bhaji and myself the palak paneer. I loved my and mongo had eatten his before I even sat down. He screamed "more! more!" And started to beat his head on the table so to stop him I quickly put together the pindi chana and he scarfed that down too. As I was cleaning up mongo started to hold his stomach and make gurgling sounds. He wheeled himself into the bathroom and for the next two hours I only heard what sounded like his intestines giveing up what ever that had stored in there. I actually left because my trailer started to smell too bad. While outside I realized that mongo had irritable bowel syndrome and the indian food must have. fired that up. Wow let me tell you I made sure to wait until eugene showed up to clean up the mess that mongo made before I reappeared. At least I had some good paneer tonight
