My daughter is 6 mo.  I nursed my daughter until 5 1/2 mo when I went back to work and have been doing partial formula and partial nursing (night and morning).  We started with Similac Organic and that was great and then it got recalled.  I next tried Earth's Best and she was really fussy on it.  We switched to Babys Only because the reviews were great.  Unfortunately, after 2 days on the formula (during the day only) she had serious constipation.  She was in a lot of pain and had several very solid and hard BM.  It has taken about 24 hours to get a normal BM.  We didn't switch her food so we know it is related to the formula.  Our daughter was in so much pain it had me in tears.  The formula mixed well, she loved the taste, but she just did not tolerate it well.  If you try it and your baby gets a solid BM, stop immediately.  My Dr said to give a formula 7-10 days but two days caused a lot of problems.  I regret not stopping immediately.  I am not saying this isn't a good formula for some babies but it was not good for mine.
