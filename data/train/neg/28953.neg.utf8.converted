Honey Nut is my favorite flavor of Cheerios, and while I will do generic of a lot of things, I have got to have brand name Cheerios.  They're just so much better than the off-brands.  However, the price on this item is often outrageously high.  I've seen it over $25, today's price is about $18... I've been watching this for about 10 days, and I have never seen it the same price two days in a row.  I managed to score mine at about $7 last week, but I'm thinking I just got lucky.  Definitely not a better value than just getting them at Sam's or using a coupon and buying them at the grocery store.  Lame.
