THIS PRODUCT AND THE HORSERADISH I ORDER BOTH (CASES) WERE WITHIN 15 DAYS OF OF THEIR EXPIRATION DATE. THE HORSERADISH HAD NO TASTE. CASES SOLD TO INDIVIDUALS SHOULD HAVE SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE EXPIATION. THIS  IS BAD INVENTORY MANAGEMENT. I NORMALLY DON'T READ DATES BUT THESE JUST DIDN'T TASTE RIGHT. THEN I CHECKED.
