Echoing other reviews, performance is not consistant.  One time we did get excellent coffee, this morning it jammed the Senseo machine with a steam lock and there is not telling when we will be able to re-open it.  Considering the price of these pods, even only one bad pod makes it impossible to recommend the product.
