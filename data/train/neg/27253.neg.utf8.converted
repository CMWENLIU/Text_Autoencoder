Having given up sugar, I tried the traditional artificial sweeteners. Not wanting to poison my body with chemical sweeteners, I turned to Stevia. I didn't realize it would have such a strong aftertaste. It takes away the flavor of my good coffee which I find hard to drink unsweetened. Won't buy this product again.
