This is by far one of the worst beef jerky I've EVER tried. I bought this because of all the positive reviews but remarkably, the other one star review is most accurate. It boggles my mind how this product is so loved. I was so excited thinking I found the perfect jerky: organic, reasonably priced. So what's wrong with it: Mainly the taste. It has almost no flavor other than meat. Although it's organic it, has the texture and taste of being highly processed. Again, I don't mind that if it tasted good - it doesn't! And the after taste is -- ugghghhh!!! get the mouthwash! like roadkill exploded in my mouth.<br /><br />So I ended up spending over $40 and got 8 bags of which I couldn't finish even one. I tried to find a way to use it somehow, I tried deep-frying it, only intensified the horrible taste - this time more chemical like, I think it may have been the preservatives. I'm tossing them all out. Don't buy this.<br /><br />PS: I purchased this from Amazon but "verified purchase" is not showing up for some reason.
