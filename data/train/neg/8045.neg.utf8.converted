Okay first, I'll admit, I have no idea what I thought this "should" taste like. I guess like chicken, only not, but then I don't even really remember what real chicken soup tastes like anymore since I haven't eaten chicken in 5+ years now.<br /><br />But anyway, I tried this and thought it was just nasty. I can't really describe it, other than that after the first sip I poured the rest of it down my sink drain and the sesame seeds clogged it. :(
