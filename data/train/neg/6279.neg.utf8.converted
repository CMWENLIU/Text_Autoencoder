I have been drinking really good Irish Breakfast tea for the past ten years and when my provider was backordered, I decided to give this tea a try since Irish Breakfast has to be Irish Breakfast right? Found out that this is not true with this tea. The tea comes well packaged and is very much a whole leaf tea but when I took a smell I smelled something that suggested it was tea. I immediately became worried and made a cup the next morning and soon discovered how bad the tea was. The tea has the orange color of Irish Breakfast but there is scarcely any aroma or flavor. The tea was very weak and it doesn't get any better by adding more leaves. I liked the idea of a subscription for tea but this one loses my vote.
