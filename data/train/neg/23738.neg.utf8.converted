I guess everyone has to do their own trial and error to see what works for their little fur friends. After researching alot about the best thing for dogs to eat, Wellness is one of the brands that has my respect... but...<br />it makes our little BOM (beagle/pomeranian) & our rough coated jack russell mix<br /> THIRSTY, FARTY & WEEPY. (that sounds like a bad mix of creepy dwarf names)<br /><br />To be fair, THEY LIKE IT... This small breed kibble is happily gobbled,then they insist on drinking aLOT! and then they fart a little bit, too....and it makes my terrier's eyes weepy, too... with those icky rust stains, and she NEVER has had that problem.<br /><br />So, we are back to our other favorites, which is the rabbit kibble from Nature's Variety Instinct, and the frozen PawNaturaw beef medallions, and of course, their fav breakfast is<br />a Stella and Chewy's Dandy Lamb dehydrated steak. (those don't make the girls thirsty!)<br />These choices are a little closer to the raw diet which I prefer to feed when I can.<br /><br />So, sorry, Wellness, we tried ya! We will finish the bag, but won't be buying any more...<br />I figure we got about a week of dog farts to suffer through yet.
