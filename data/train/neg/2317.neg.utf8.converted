Kellogg's does not disclose that the ingredients in their cereals contain GMO's. That means the corn and sugar have had their DNA spliced with another species, usually a toxin or a bacteria. Kellogg's has contributed over 600,000 dollars to prevent laws that would require labeling of GMO's. But most Americans agree that they have a right to know what is in the food they are buying and feeding to their children.
