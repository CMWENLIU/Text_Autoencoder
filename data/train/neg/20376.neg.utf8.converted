The popcorn arrived quickly via Fedex, but it was clear the rush shipping was a waste of time.  From the minute I opened the box, I could smell a strange stale odor.  I opened one bag and sampled it, hoping against hope that I didn't just waste my money.  The popcorn was stuck together, chewy and had a funny after taste.  I didn't bother to open the other packets. Just touching each one told me the other bags were in the same condition.  I would have been better off going to a department store and buying last years tin can of caramel corn.  I threw the rest away, fearful if I returned it, it would only get sold to some other unsuspecting soul.  Steer clear of this vendor.
