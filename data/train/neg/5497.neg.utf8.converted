WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT FILL UP A "SUPER BIG GULP" CUP WITH 5 HOUR ENERGY AND CHUG THE WHOLE THING.  MY HEART HAS EITHER STOPPED COMPLETELY OR IS BEATING SO FAST THAT I CAN'T FEEL MY OWN PULSE.<br /><br />CONS:<br />I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN 72 HOURS.<br />I CANT FEEL MY FACE.<br />I PEED THIS MORNING AND I'M PRETTY SURE IT WAS 99% BLOOD.<br /><br />PROS:<br />I'VE DEEP CLEANED MY ENTIRE APARTMENT.<br />I CAN READ MINDS.<br /><br />SUPER BIG GULP=44OZ, 5 HOUR ENERGY=2OZ.  THAT MEANS I DRANK 22 5 HOUR ENERGYS IN LESS THAN 2 MINUTES.  22X5=110 HOURS OF ENERGY.<br /><br />GOD HELP ME.
