I just cannot understand why this company chooses to add sugar to a fruit that they claim is tree-ripened.  I am truly baffled.  The added sugar leaves a crystalline sweetness that is not mango-flavored to the fruit and renders it a ridiculous replacement for mango.  It ends up being too sweet.<br /><br />Why buy dried mango?  If you cannot get fresh mango, it is the next best thing.  Canned mango, because the canning procedure demands heating the food above boiling point, dismantles all enzymes and antioxidants, but the drying process does not.  There are 3 fruits that are particularly valuable for the enzymes found in them: kiwi, pineapple, and mango.  These enzymes are not made by our bodies but are particularly helpful for the fast transport of calcium, boron, magnesium, phosphate, and manganese into cells whose membranes have been damaged (e.g. by circulating toxins, poisons, both of which we are always bombarded with, even if we do not recognize the symptoms).  These ions, and thus the fruit enzymes, are critical for repair of those cells.  Since bacterial infections leave poisons behind, good dried mango is especially helpful for fast recovery from infections.<br /><br />The best mango is thoroughly dried, making it quite brittle.  If you want to snack on it or make mango ice cream, you reconstitute it by adding just enough water to cover a few slices (in warm weather it will take about an hour to reconstitute 1/2 cup).  Keep some in the refrigerator for just that purpose.  They last in that form there for at least a week, unless you live where there is an enormous amount of wet weather and thus a lot of mold.  Prevent mold survival in the refrigerator by keeping there a small plastic container with holes punched in the top half full of vinegar. Your fruits and veges will last a lot longer.<br /><br />However the best way to eat it is to add chopped mango to your entree or salad.  Thus this stuff this company is selling is just too weak in flavor, but the sugar will come off in the liquid found in the meal.
