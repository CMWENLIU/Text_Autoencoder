I recently picked up a couple of packs of this mix at a local dollar store.  Like most people I am familiar with Marie Callender's products and I figured for a dollar, how bad could it be.  Well now that I have sampled it I am afraid that I have to agree with the other reviewer here that says its taste is downright weird, and honestly speaking, not like cornbread at all.  I followed the directions by adding an egg, milk, and oil, (1/4 cup of each) as directed, and even though it said it could be cooked in the microwave in a couple of minutes, I opted for the oven figuring it would come out better.  It cooked up easy and fast enough but that is where the pleasure of this mix ended its virtues.  Unlike most cornbread I have baked it rises really high in the cup and is very light and fluffy.  And it's is not crumbly like most good corn bread is either.  As for it's taste, there is next to none in my opinion.  I was taking big bites of the muffins with a generous amount of butter on them and still couldn't get a hint of corn bread flavor. And trust me when I say I have tried many different corn bread mixes in the past.  Everything from Jiffy to Larry The Cable guys brand. What taste I did sense was truly downright strange.  Not really awful, but as tasteless a cornbread I have ever had. It reminded me more of a cheap cake mix in texture and taste than a cornbread. I'm not even going to bake the other pouch I have. In conclusion, I would not recommend this mix to anyone, at any price I'm afraid... : (
