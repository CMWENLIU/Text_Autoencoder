As someone who has lived in the Caribbean and is therefore very familiar with coconuts in all forms, I am very disappointed with this product.  The coconut is dry, stale and lacking in flavor.  None of the mildly sweet, deliciously unique flavor of dried coconut is present here. Save your money and look elsewhere for a superior product.
