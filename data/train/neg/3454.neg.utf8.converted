My cat wouldn't even touch this. He sniffed it, looked at me, and tried to bury it.  (Digging at the kitchen tile, unfortunately for him, did not work.)  I tried on three different occasions, thinking that maybe his belly was just upset that day from the CRF. He never would eat it.  Now, I've got a case (minus three cans) of it.  Guess I'll donate it to the local animal shelter.
