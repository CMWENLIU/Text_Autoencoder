I have opened 6 cans now. Each is primarily water with tiny, shredded bits of chicken meat floating in fluid. Sorry, but if you own a cat that's probably where you'll donate this product. It is so watery you can shake the cans and they sound like there's nothing in them but fluid. This was an expensive disappointment.
