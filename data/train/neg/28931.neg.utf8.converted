I love Hormel Compleats. They're all very convenient, since I can stash them in a cabinet in my office and not worry about remembering to bring something from home, or about it getting stolen from the communal refrigerator.<br /><br />This is about the saltiest of the Compleats I've tried. The potatoes are pasty and have little flavor. The meatloaf isn't bad, except for the salt factor.
