The initial taste does hint of black cherry, but then the apple and grape juice filler comes to fore and dominates the after-taste.  It has a slight metallic taste and is not very pleasant.  The carbonation offers no benefit in the taste or feel category.  The price is high - about $1 per 8 oz can.  If I want juice, I'll stick with real juice without the carbonation.
