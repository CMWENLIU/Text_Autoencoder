I got a case of this and the box now says "white tea for smooth taste" and the ingredients are Green Tea, White Tea and Raspberry flavor with other natural flavors.  The tea leaves an almost chalky, blah taste in your mouth.  I very much enjoyed the old formula with the picture of the angel on the package and am sad to see this go and HIGHLY disapointed with Amazon for not warning me I was not getting the same product.  The ingredients list and picture on this webpage are wrong!!! DON'T BUY IT!
