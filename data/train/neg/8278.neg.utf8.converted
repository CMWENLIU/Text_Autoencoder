Just received this item in the mail seconds ago.  It shows two tins and is titled 2x on my order sheet but read carefully because you only get one tin and it is whichever one they decide to send you.  I saw these identical tins last night at Toys R Us for $1.98 each.  These prices are totally inflated and the photo is misleading.  I bought three (I thought 3 sets) and ended up paying $17.97 for three of these small tins!  Live and learn!
