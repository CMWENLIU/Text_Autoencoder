These are sweetened with crystalline fructose and sucralose (a.k.a. Splenda). If you're sensitive to the taste of low-calorie sweeteners, you won't like these. The drinks are too sweet. I was hoping for the same kind of refreshing taste you get from mixing a splash of fruit juice with seltzer, but it turns out to be just another cloying soft drink, only with supplements added. The ingredient list should be given on the Amazon product page, but it's not.
