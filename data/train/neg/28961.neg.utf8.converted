I purchased these bones for my two bullmastiffs.  I thought they were like the other bones previously purchased, but these were brittle and splintered.  After paying the $880 vet bill for the bone fragments in my bullmastiff puppy's stomach, I threw them away.  I would not recommend them at all.  My male bullmastiff chewed threw 1 bone in about five minutes.  An expensive lesson.
