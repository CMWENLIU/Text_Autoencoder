Ordered this recently and had 1 box last week. It did not taste at all as it usually does. I used to get this regularly at our local natural food store, but they stopped carrying it. Upon further examination, the whole case had a Best Before Date of Feb. 11 2006!  All the individual boxes of noodles said the same!  I would strongly recommend no-one orders the remaining cases.  I am asking for a full refund and will never buy food from Amazon again (this was my first time buying food from Amazon).
