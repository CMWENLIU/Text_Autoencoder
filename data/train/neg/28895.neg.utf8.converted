My dog loved this toy/treat, and then I noticed in the fine print on the cardboard it came in that it was made in China.  While my dog has consumed 2-1/2 of these treats with no adverse effects, I cannot continue to buy them because of the concern that I might get a bad batch that will make her sick.  I'm disappointed and so is my dog.
