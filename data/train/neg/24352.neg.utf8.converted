I was not happy with at all with these clams.<br />When I received them all the ice was melted and the clams felt warm to the touch. I put them in the refrigerator right away.<br />We were having friends over the next night to cook them.<br />When I went to open the bags and cooked them the smell was hard to miss. It smelled like they were spoiled.<br />I ended up throwing them out fearing that they would make us all sick.<br /> I will never order from this seller again.
