I have been eating 3lbs bags of Haribo for years, enjoying this candy exclusively. Tonight I ate a handful from the bag and nearly gagged, this stuff was disgusting!  I looked on the back of the bag and saw MADE IN TURKEY!  Amazon has never cheated me before, but this was shameful.  I will NOT eat Haribo products again, and have already tossed that worthless bag of gunk into the compost.  Shame on Haribo for producing candy in Turkey and sending the filth to the USA!  Shame of Amazon for being part of that scam.
