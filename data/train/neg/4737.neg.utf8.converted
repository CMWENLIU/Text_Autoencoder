As someone who enjoys eating fish and sardines, I was very disappointed in these sardines.  I have tried most brands of sardines and eat about 5-6 cans of sardines a week.  These sardines were extremely salty and the fish had a slightly off taste to them.  The sardines were almost as salty as anchovies.  I looked at the sodium content and noticed that it was same as some other tins of sardines that I had on the shelf but for some reason these were much more saltier than the other cans.<br /><br />I tried two tins thinking that it could have been a tin of sardines that were over salted.  The can was also difficult to open but I've noticed this problem with other sardines from Portugal.  A difficult can does not bother me as long as the sardines are worth the effort to get the can open.<br /><br />I had read a review online about these sardines and wanted to try them.  I usually do not write reviews but wanted to warn others.  I would suggest buying one can and trying it before buying anymore.<br /><br />One of my favorite sardines for the price is the Matiz Gallego Sardines in Olive Oil [...]  The Matiz sardines are nice and plump and have an excellent flavor with great texture.  The quality to price is excellent for these sardines.<br /><br />Da Morgada sardines are my favorite as this current time, but Amazon does not carry these and they are expensive at other online retailers.  I would suggest trying a can of Da Morgada, if you have a chance to pick up a can.
