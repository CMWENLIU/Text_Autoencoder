This has been my least favorite coffee purchase so far for the Keurig. My husband came into the kitchen and thought I had been conducting a science experiment as it smelled like chemicals. The flavor is also a combination of plastic and chemicals. I would have been happy if it even had a cafe mocha flavor like other reviewers have called it, but I don't even begin to get that. Very disappointed.
