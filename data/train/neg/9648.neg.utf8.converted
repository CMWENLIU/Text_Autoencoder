I purchased this for my dad as a Father's Day gift because he likes to cook and he's always had a green thumb. Unfortunately, it's been over two months since he had it and nothing ever grew. He followed all of the directions to no avail. I contacted AeroGrow but they didn't seem to care and were zero help. I do not recommend this to anyone, unless you're one of those people that enjoys throwing your money down the drain? Instead, if you want herbs for the kitchen, I recommend buying dry herbs. And, if you want to grow herbs (or vegetables) then I recommend doing it the old fashioned way.
