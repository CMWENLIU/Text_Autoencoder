I have used these for smores and they just don't work, they are to crumbly and have that grity taste that some gluten-free baking has.  I use Kinnikinnick brand for a lot of things and really wanted to like these but I just don't. These are fine for gramcraker crusts and I usually buy them to use for my cheese cake crust because when you put the butter with them to make the crust it helps with the gritiness.  However if you are looking for taste and a good thick graham craker that will work for smores, use the Jo-sefs brand...nothing compares.
