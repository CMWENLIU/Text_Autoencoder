Really High in salt (3,250 mg/box) and a third of the calories are from FAT.  The package states that it contains less than 0.5% of MSG, etc....again with the neurotoxins!!!  The flavor is not really cheesy as you'd expect from the hype on the box.  The potatoes do remain firm though.  It's hard to describe the flavor.  Creamy yet artificial tasting. No, I really must NOT be sucked into buying these awful scalloped potatoes again.  Buy it at your own risk.
