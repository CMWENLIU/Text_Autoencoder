I am a big fan of chai lattes and the spices in this blend are quite tasty. If you use the recommended 8oz setting, it has a full enough flavor. My biggest complaint is the artificial sweetener. It leaves that horrible chemical aftertaste that diet sodas do. If you don't have a problem with Splenda and you like spiced chai, this is the K-cup for you! If you are like me though, and have an aversion to artificial sweeteners, it looks like we are still stuck with brewing the tea (such as Celestial's India Spice Chai) and adding our own milk and sugar.
