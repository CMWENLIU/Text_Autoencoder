My dog eats Merrick food, and I thought it would be more convenient to start ordering it from Amazon in cases instead of hauling it home from the pet store every few days. Plus, it's a couple of dollars cheaper to buy it here versus at my neighborhood store. Unfortunately, though, the case of cans didn't survive shipping well at all--of the 12 cans, 4 were so severely dented that I don't think it's safe to feed their contents to my dog. I'm not talking about a little indentation at the rim, either--they were totally crunched and bent, completely trashed. I have no idea whether this was because the cans were too delicate, whether the Amazon box wasn't properly cushioned, or whether the package was abused in shipping, but I have noticed that even when I buy this brand at the pet store, I have to check really carefully to make sure that the cans are in good condition. Whatever the reason, this shouldn't happen, especially for a pricey brand like this--when cans get dented, it can let in air and bacteria that can spoil the food and make your dog sick. Given that 1/3 of what I bought was unusable, I ended up paying roughly $28 for 8 cans of dog food. That's way, way more expensive than supporting my local pet store. If these cans don't survive transport very well, it makes a lot more sense to me to buy them locally, when I can avoid the bad cans.<br /><br />Shipping headaches aside, however, I do recommend the food itself. My dog is a picky eater, but she seems to enjoy Merrick products well enough. They are made of high quality ingredients, and even though she has a sensitive stomach, they don't give her any trouble. I just wish that they'd pack the stuff in a container that could survive the transport to my house!
