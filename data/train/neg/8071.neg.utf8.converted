I wanted to try the products from 100% pure. The eye cream I ordered made my eyes swell up really bad. I contacted the company via e-mail to find out how to return it. I followed their directions and mailed it all back to them with a copy of the e-mail. I did not hear from them, and weekly e-mails were not returned for 3 months! Not only did they not honor the original promise to refund my money after returning the products, they said I could call in for a credit instead. So here I am with no products, and a "credit" for more of what made me miserable. There are better natural cosmetic companies out there. Stay away.
