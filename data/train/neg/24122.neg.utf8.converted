This product arrived quickly and in perfect order.  The jar was as pictured and much larger than I anticipated.  My giving of only 2 stars for this product is due to the fact that, as a jam, it was very much too thick.  Cranberries have so much natural pectin that adding more was a big mistake.  It had an almost waxy feel in the mouth.  Very disappointing.
