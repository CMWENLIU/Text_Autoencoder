Ok, as a long time battler of the bulge and then some, I have tried LOTS of energy bars, protien bars, meal bars, healthy snack bars, low fat, low calorie, low sugar and low carb.  Not all of those have tasted like amazing candy bars..oh no.  But this one?<br />This one takes the "worst tasting" reward.<br />I think honestly this has been the first one that I've had to throw away less than half eaten becuase it was so awful tasting.  Again, I wasnt expecing a amazing taste that would make me want more and more...I tend to have little expectation with things like this.<br />Gross gross gross.  Cant even fathom putting anymore of that into my mouth and will end up tossing 3/4 of the bar.<br />No wonder they were the least expensive one...thank god I only bought one.
