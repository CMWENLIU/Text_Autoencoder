I love basmati rice but this one is not my favorite. I did not like the packing - it is packed directly into yellow bag (shown in picture) without any liner and thus it also tastes like a bag, lol. But seriously, you can smell & taste that artificially yellow-colored bag in your rice. I would not buy it again.
