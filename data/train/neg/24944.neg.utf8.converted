I tried to look up information about this product on the Emerald Cove website before I ordered this wakame, but did not succeed in finding what I needed.  I am used to fairly large leaves of wakame in my miso soup.  This wakame is TINY BITS in the package.  It would be helpful if the seller defined "Ready-to-use" and posted this information since Emerald Cove has not.  I ordered this because I did not want wakame from the NE Japanese coast where, before the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the world's best macrobiotic quality wakame was harvested.<br /><br />I spoke with Great Eastern Sun who has the Emerald Cove brand.  They assured me that this wakame is 1st quality and that they have tested for heavy metals and pollutants, as it comes from a large bay off the coast of north-eastern China.  The tiny bits swelled up to perfect bite-size pieces after putting them in boiling water.<br /><br />In addition to grabbing heavy metals in the body, wakame prevents hyaluronic acid in the skin from breaking down so fast.  This acid keeps skin youthful.
