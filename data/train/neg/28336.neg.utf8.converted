Amazon should list the country of origin.  Why can't I have a choice of what country I buy any products from?  Surely there is someone in the USA producing hog casings. The manufacturer of this product assures its casing safety and has a impressive protocol.  I don't mean to deride this company, but they are operating out of a country that has a third world mindset about the cleanliness of processing meat.  It must be a continual up hill battle for them.  Did you know that 90% of all casings are imported from China?  The FDA doesn't recognize imported hog casings as food and has no oversight powers.  You really have to depend on the processor's integrity.  This company may live up to its claims but consider it's sourcing do I want to take the chance?
