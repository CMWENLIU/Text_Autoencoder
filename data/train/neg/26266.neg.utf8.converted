I have purchased these bones for my dog in the past, and they've worked great. The three that were sent to me this time were not "fully pressed". If I can pull the pieces apart with my fingers, what are the chances my dog could bite off a sharp piece, swallow it, and become injured? It's terrible to put dogs at risk by having such poor quality control.
