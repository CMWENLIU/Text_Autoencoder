I really relied heavily on reviews on this one.  Unfortunately after receiving the bars I was sorely disappointed.  I like the RAWness of these bars but they don't taste like coconut, they don't taste like pecan pie.  They taste like a slightly tart pecan date nut log.  I LOVE pecans and dates but I like my dates sweet.  These aren't.  Too bad for me but hopefully I can help the next guy out. Great deal though for those of you that like these bars.
