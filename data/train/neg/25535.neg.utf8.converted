We picked this up on a whim, thinking it would be nice to not have to dirty a bowl on the occasions that we pop popcorn. In my house, one less dirty bowl is a wonderful thing!<br /><br />This stuff is the most greasy popcorn I've ever had! Not only that, but the big is a pain to open as another reviewer mentioned. You have to hold it at the bottom of the side, then pull the plastic cover off, and even then you only have about a 50/50 shot of it coming off in one piece. Then once you actually get it open, the popcorn has a hint of plastic to it. The top and bottom of the "bowl" aren't paper like a regular bag of microwave popcorn - they're thin sheets of plastic - and that taste comes through in the popcorn.<br /><br />All that said, the popcorn is edible, but it's not as good as regular microwave popcorn. We'll eat this pack, but when it's gone, we'll be back to the standard microwave popcorn!
