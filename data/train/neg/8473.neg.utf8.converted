We repeatedly tried Muesli # 11 but it smelled (and tasted) rancid. In response to our complaint, the US distributor confirmed that the smell is due to a problem with an unrefined sunflower oil that was used when toasting: Quote "Now there should not be anything you smell upon opening a bag of the muesli.  If you tasted it, even with the smell, you would see<br />that nothing tasted wrong, old or rancid. It was only the smell." Unquote.
