The product description makes a big deal out of what a wonderful chocolate company this is. Would you believe the Candy Rocks are sugar coated jelly beans, raisins,  stale nuts and who-knows-what-else? There is no chocolate. The nuts are absolutely foul. I have had a stomach ache since last night when I got an especially nasty one. The package lists hazelnuts, but they taste like soggy old peanuts. I can only thank G-d that there is no one with a peanut allergy in my household. The lack of disclosure about the nuts in the product description has deadly potential. Shame on Koppers. These things are horrible. I strongly recommend against anyone buying this product.
