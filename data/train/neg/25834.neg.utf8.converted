If you are actually a low-carber, you probably want to avoid this product.  Read the ingredients list.... it just is not low-carb. All the reviews that say that they like the taste are not for you.  If taste was the only criteria that matters, that would be different.  But low-carbers make choices first based on whether the food fits their way of eating and only second on how it tastes.<br /><br />If you are just avoiding "whites" because of diabetes or other health concerns, this may work for you and is a definite improvement over Bisquick.
