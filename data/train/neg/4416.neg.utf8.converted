This is a great product but it is item is way overpriced here.  The can is much, much smaller than it appears in the photo.  I thought for sure that they had made a mistake when I opened the box.  This can is less than half the size of what they sell at my local health food store.  This is a very, very, small can.  It is only 1.06 ounces.<br /><br />At my local health food store, normally very expensive as it is a small store, they charge only $1 more for a 2.82 oz can.<br /><br />ALSO, YOU CAN NOT RETURN THIS ITEM.  THEY MUST KNOW THEY ARE RIPPING YOU OFF SO THEY MAKE IT A DO NOT RETURN ITEM.<br /><br />SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BE RIPPED OFF.
