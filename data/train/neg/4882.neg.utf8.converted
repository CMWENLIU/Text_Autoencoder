When Starbucks came out with the "blonde" roasts, I got pretty excited because I prefer lighter roasts (as do 40% of coffee drinkers, according to the barista at the store)... light roasts are a little earthier, not as burnt tasting.  So I scored a bag each of the Willow and Veranda.<br /><br />This one, the Veranda, didn't do a lot for us.  Subjectively speaking, it was so smooth it was boring... it had no snap, and was kind of mixed and mushy, not a definitive flavor.  It's supposed to have "delicate nuances of soft cocoa and lightly toasted nuts" - really?  We missed that.<br /><br />On the other hand, we really liked the Willow, which had a brighter citrus-y note and was more flavorful.  The taste was (for lack of better words) clear, defined.  You buy a light roast to taste the bean, not the roast.  The Willow was flavorful, not acidy, and had a clean finish.<br /><br />Your tastes may vary, but if you like a snappy light roast, or a "breakfast roast" the Veranda probably won't be your pick, but do try the Willow.
