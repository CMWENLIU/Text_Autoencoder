I don't mean to imply by my one star rating that it isn't a great product. I just wanted to point out that it's not for every cat. One of my cats did fine on this food, and the other had very bad diarrhea for over a week until I switched to another food. My vet said that this was not uncommon and that, like people, all digestive tracts are made differently. If your cat has a problem on this food for more than a couple of days, it's probably best try another.
