After all the good reviews I read about this salt (due to its having a higher % of truffle than the others on the market) I was excited to give it a try.  Unfortunately - my opinion is that it was a big waste of $$.<br />It has a strange chemical smell to it... and the truffle smell/taste, like the others I've tried, faded to nothing within a month.
