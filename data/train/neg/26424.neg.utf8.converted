I decided to try this water after reading the rave reviews. I have only tried the Raspberry-Lime, so I cannot comment on the other flavors. I cannot understand how anyone could enjoy drinking the Raspberry-Lime flavored water. It's awful. I bought it for half the usual price, and it is still way too expensive for water with a barely perceptible (or "hint") of unpleasant flavor. Do you yourself a favor, buy Fruit20 instead. It tastes much better, and costs 75% less.
