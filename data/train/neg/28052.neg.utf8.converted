This stuff is AWFUL! I bought it based on another reviewer who said in combination with the coconut popping oil it would give me that nutty theater popcorn taste...NOT!  What it gave me was a distinct metallic taste that took two days to leave my mouth. Even after trying mint, toothpaste, orange juice, anything I could think of to get rid of that taste. Cost too much to return it so it went in the garbage. I hate to even think of this load of chemicals going into the landfill. :-(
