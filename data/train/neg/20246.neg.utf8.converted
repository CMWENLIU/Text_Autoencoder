There are two main problems I see with this product... number one, squeeze bottles of any kind are just terrible for mayo and salad dressing. Number two, miracle whip's formula has changed over the years to remove most of the fat from it. I've stopped buying miracle whip and buy the off brand 'salad dressing' for this reason, they still have full fat formulas. Just a heads up. Full fat stuff works much better for stuff like pea salads and the like. Much richer flavor.
