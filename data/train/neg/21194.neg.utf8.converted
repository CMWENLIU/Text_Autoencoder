I broke my own rule and read JUST the ingredients on the back of package. Sounded Great! I gave my dog one of these "treats" and she loved it. The next day I read the package more carefully - and guess what? Made in China printed right there in plain view. I am very disappointed in AKC for putting their name on these products. A bag of twists and a bag of chicken jerky went right into the trash.
