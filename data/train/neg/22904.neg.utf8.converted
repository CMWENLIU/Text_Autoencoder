I ordered these for my family and we had them as a snack only to have us all come down sick within a few hours. It was very painful and my 4 yr old spent the night vomiting. We know it was these since no one ate any dinner that day and lunch and breakfast had been different for everyone. It was no fun to be 9 months pregnant and have a family of 6 be sick all night.
