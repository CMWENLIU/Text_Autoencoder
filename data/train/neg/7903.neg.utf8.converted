"But it might be nice to have it delivered."<br /><br />When the price was much lower I tried that -- only a few pennies more per can. It came with several cans crushed and leaking through the cartons -- which were soaked through. I had to clean the whole mess up before I could take it inside. I complained to Amazon. (And it was HARD to find anyone to complain to on-line.) No customer follow-up or apology. Though this nice link appeared today, with a price 50% higher and asking if I might be interested. I'm not.<br /><br />This is still my energy drink of choice, by the way. The one star is for price & service.
