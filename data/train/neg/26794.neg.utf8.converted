I received the pods and after several days am very disappointed. Several of the pods I've used are defective.......they do not brew the appropriate size coffee (pressing the largest cup size I get less than a quarter cup), it comes out in single drips from the very start of the brewing process and many, many grinds in my cup. Now,I don't want to us the remaining pods (I never know which will brew as described) for fear of breaking my Keurig brewer.<br />Having grown up in Brooklyn I was very anxious to try these Keurig pods. I loved the packaging design and the fact that it was  avariety pack. That's where it ends.
