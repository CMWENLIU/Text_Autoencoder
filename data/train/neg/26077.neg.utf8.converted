I bought Twizzlers Cherry Pull-n-Peel on an impulse while shopping in a discount store. Stupid me, I didn't realize that all Twizzlers are not created equally.<br /><br />The first bite was OK. Then, I got this overwhelming feeling that I was consuming chewy cough medicine. I know it's candy -- but this was soooo outrageously artificial and medicinal tasting that I wanted to gag.<br /><br />Blech. Live and learn. Next time, I'll stick with the strawberry.
