I used to travel in Canada mostly Quebec City, Quebec. There I discovered Leclerc Maple Creme Cookies they were absolutly the best I have ever ate.I recently ordered 3 boxes of them from Amazon grocery.They arrived stale and broken I will not order any more unless they come from Quebec City.The cookies that I received came from and were made in Tennesee.<br />They were smaller than the ones I had in Quebec City and did not taste half as good. I will not buy anymore that are made in the states unless they are certified by Leclerc. Leclerc Canada makes excellent cookies their USA counterpart<br />does not.
