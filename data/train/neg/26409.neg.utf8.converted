Whoever thought to ship 5 pounds of sugar crystals in a 2 piece cardboard box, held together by only a rubber band should be forced to travel to everyones home to sweep up the sugar crystals as they hit the floor when the outer shipping carton is opened.<br /><br />I got about 2 useful pounds of sugar out of a 5 pound shipment.<br /><br />The sugar however is excellent, but I would certainly never order this type of package again.
