I really don't know what's wrong with this version of tropicana. I used to consume tropicana all the time but there is seriously something wrong with this version. I left an unopened bottle in my car overnight (~40 degrees Fahrenheit) and it had a greenish hue to it in the morning. I haven't contacted tropicana or anything but it's quite odd. Also, it tastes different and it's an odd texture. That's all I have.
