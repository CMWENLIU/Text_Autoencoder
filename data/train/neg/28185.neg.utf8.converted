I expected a bit more from the photo on the package.  We all know they exaggerate a bit, but this was ridiculous! I am not kidding, there were maybe 5 kernels of corn, 6 peas, and broccoli??? NO broccoli was in this... there were some green flakes and maybe 10 tiny dried tofu cubes.  The oriental noodles are spaghetti and mushy at that.  We did NOT overcooked them.  The flavor itself if tolerable.  If you get it, be prepared to add a significant amount of veggies to it for it to resemble the photo on the packaging.<br />We won't be buying any of these products.
