Upon opening the bag, the aroma of the whole beans was very good, the beans looked good (but maybe covered in a wax?), but looked almost artificially glossy.  Was expecting high hopes, as some of the best beans I've had are Sical 5 Estrelas that are from Brazil (though not very easy to find since Nestle bought the company) for espresso.  Well, the taste of these are not good.  Brazilian beans are known for mild flavor, these are some of the most bitter beans I've tried.  My suggestion is to pass and keep looking for something else.  If you're looking for Brazillian beans, I suggest looking for Sical Vera Cruz or 5 Estrelas or the Lavazza brands.
