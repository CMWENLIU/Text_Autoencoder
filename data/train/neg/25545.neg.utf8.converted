I gave it one star for the concept.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Dave's hot sauces. His combination of smoky barbecue flavors and invigorating heat always gets my saliva going. But this spray was disappointingly lacking in both respects. I'm not exaggerating when I say there was virtually none to speak of. It tasted like bad watery vinegar. Why buy the stuff if it doesn't taste good or get your endorphins pumping??<br /><br />The oleo-resin from the habaneros comes out of solution and collects at the top of the bottle. Instead of a homogeneous red color you see in the photo, you get a blood red color floating on top of a murky yellow color. You need a paint-shaker to get the spray looking normal again. I called Dave's about it and they told me that's typical of this product!<br /><br />I was excited about this sauce because I wanted a way to evenly coat  pizzas, but all I got were over-priced spray bottles filled with something I really can't describe as edible. I'd fill it with another sauce but it'd probably just clog the nozzle.<br /><br />It's also intended for use as a natural pest repellent. Dave's suggest spritzing some on your garden to keep the rodents & birds away. I never tried so I don't know if it works as claimed. I hope it does or else this product is completely without merit.
