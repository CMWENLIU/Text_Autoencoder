I have to agree with the first reviewer on this. While I'm generally not a fan of fruity or floral teas, I love rose in tea. When I first opened the bag, I almost gagged at the overpowering aroma of citrus and florals - although tazo uses natural ingredients, it seemed almost synthetic. Luckily, the tea (unsweetened and brewed as suggested) does not taste nearly as strong as it smells. Still, I couldn't get past the fact that it smelled overwhelmingly like a funeral home / aunt gertrude's perfume while tasting like a bowl of froot loops.<br /><br />I suppose I had hoped for a more neutral base with subtle accents of flavor. If you don't mind in your face citrus and florals, then you will probably enjoy this tea.
