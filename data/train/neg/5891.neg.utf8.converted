After researching brands of vanilla bean paste, I decided to go with this one as it consistently has the best reviews. However, I'm not happy with this product at all. The vanilla taste just isn't there. It's great for adding the vanilla bean "look" to my recipes, but I found that even if I use a lot, I still can't achieve a good level of vanilla flavor. I used about 1/3 of the bottle for a frosting recipe but it still didn't have the vanilla flavor I was seeking. I had to add vanilla extract for that.<br /><br />I thought it would be thicker and have more vanilla beans in it, but it's about the consistency of maple syrup. It shouldn't be called a paste, as it really isn't. Pastes are very thick and don't run. I won't be buying this again.
