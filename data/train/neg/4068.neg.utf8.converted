Get the carrot & apple or pear & mango flavor from Plum Organics instead.  This was overwhelmingly sweet.  Like giving my babies candy.  The "Yello One" is almost as bad.  I recommend sticking with the other flavors, especially carrot, parsnip, apple.  And frankly, I think Plum Organics makes better tasting blends that are delicious but not too sweet.
