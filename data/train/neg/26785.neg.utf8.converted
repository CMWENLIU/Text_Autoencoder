Don't believe the hype about this coffee being strong and flavorfull. I was looking for new options besides Jetfuel, Emeril's Big and Bold, and Donut House, and thought BB would be the one, based on the reviews. I'm not sure what coffee they got, but the Fuggedaboutit and Cyclone are both really weak and without much flavor. I even tried the smallest size setting, thinking it might make the coffee more concentrated, but it was still weak and dissapointing. I can't speak for the other coffee, but Fuggedaboudit and Cyclone were a waste of my money. I have a machine at home and at work, so I will just take them to work as an option for people who like weaker coffees.
