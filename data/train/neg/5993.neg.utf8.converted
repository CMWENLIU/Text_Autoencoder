I really wanted to like this product.  And in all fairness, I eat many other things people may not find palatable, like hemp protein powder and chia seeds, so I was a little surprised by my reaction to the taste of this powder.  It did mix up into a thick, rich looking smoothie.  I mixed in a banana, hemp oil, orange flavored aminos, stevia, and raw cacao powder (as I commonly mix into my hemp protein smoothie), and it still managed to really taste like nothing.  Well, I shouldn't say it tasted like nothing, it was reminiscent of grass clippings, which actually made me gag a little just thinking about it.  I plugged my nose and chugged it down, and it was filling, and full of good nutrients, but the taste....ugh!  I will definitely NOT buy this again.
