This stuff tastes great but after doing some research, it's got a bunch of fats that are not considered healthy.  The first item on the list (which means that it is the highest mass ingredient) is partially hydrogenated oils.  If you have any problems with cholesterol, I suggest talking to your doctor.....  Or maybe you might want to be like many Americans and just increase your Lipitor dosage so we can enjoy these tasty but potentially unhealthy creamers.  Godspeed.
