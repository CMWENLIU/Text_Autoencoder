Recently I bought a 6 pack of San Pellegrino Chinotto from a local supermarket. Upon sampling a bottle of the item, I promptly grimaced and gagged explosively. While the initial flavour is tolerable, with hints of orange and lemon, the first impression quickly fades into a rather unpalatable bitter taste, rather like melted plastic glad wrap. A definite acquired taste.
