This is a great product but unfortunately the price has continued to rise.  It is now cheaper for me to buy this product at Walmart ($13.63 including tax) for a package of 24 instead of paying the $14.44 (Subscribe & Save).  When I add my $1 coupon the price was $12.63.  The price of this product on Amazon used to be $11.12 less than 6 months ago.  Since then it has continued to increase and has gone up by 29.86%.  I rated this product a 2/5 due to the high price and the unreasonable increase in price over the past 6 months.  I will buy again if the price goes down to that of Walmart.<br /><br />-JON-
