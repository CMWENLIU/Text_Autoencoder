The Maille mustard available in the USA is produced in Canada and not the same recipe as the original French type.  I recently visited the Maille Boutique at place de la Madeleine in Paris to find out why their French products are now not avilable in the USA.  I was told that several years ago the US Government imposed a 200 percent import tax on any mustard produced in France.  I assume some lobby of US mustard producers induced Congress to impose this duty.<br />So the Maille name was formed as a Canadian company, not associated with Maille of France, so that the mustard can be imported into the USA from Canada without this import duty since it was now being produced in Canada without the original Maille famous recipes. The taste of the Canadian produced Maille is not as good as the Maille mustards from France.  So thank you to Congress for your interference in commerce from the great mustards from France.  I did bring some various Maille mustards back with me from France but packed up in my checked luggage as customs will not allow you to bring them in carry on luggage.
