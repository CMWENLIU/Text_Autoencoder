I prepared this according to directions on the bottle:  One squeeze of MIO liquid (about 1/2 teaspoon) in an 8 ounce glass of water.  I was put off by the color immediately:  Why this stuff has to have so much artificial coloring in it is beyond comprehension.  I guess the manufacturer thought people might believe they're drinking something that tastes like peaches if the liquid has the color of a ripe peach skin.  Guess what?  This product doesn't taste like peaches or mangos.  I just tastes sweet.<br /><br />This is basically the adult equivalent of Kool Aid.
