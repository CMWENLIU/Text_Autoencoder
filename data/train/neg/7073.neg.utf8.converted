I ordered this coffe directly from The Bean Coffee Company using a Groupon and have been profoundly disappointed.  When I was shopping and ordering their website said 1.25 lb bags, but I was only shipped 12 oz bags and now the website has changed.  I can't even get someone from the company to contact me.  In addition to this, the coffee lacks the depth of flavor I expect with espresso and it leaves a very bad aftertaste in my mouth.  I would not recommend ordering!
