While I like their spaghetti-style pasta, the shells don't seem to cook right.  No matter how long I boil them - the package says 6-9 mins but I've gone up to 12 - they seem hard, chewy and uncooked.  Then they go straight from under done to falling apart in hard, still under-done bits.  save your money!
