The anchovies are packed in tightly.  The jar seemed like an improvement over the standard tin - less messy, easily stored leftovers - but the mouth is too small for easy access.  In order to remove them from the jar, you have to tear a number of them apart.  This isn't that difficult because they are mushy to begin with.  They taste fine, but by the time you get then on your pizza, they have become short strips or anchovy dots.
