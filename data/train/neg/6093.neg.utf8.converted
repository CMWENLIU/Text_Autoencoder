First of all, the color of the powder is an "old" yellowish-green, not the bright green of fresh matcha. After whisking, the foam was "pebbly", not fine and even as it should be. The flavor was so nasty and bitter that I threw it out after one sip. During my evaluation of the dry powder, I thought that it might serve OK in cooking, but after sipping the bowl of tea, I was reluctant to even introduce it to the compost heap.
