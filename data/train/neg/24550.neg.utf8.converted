Why would I pay $46.75 for this product, when the contents is equal to roughly 4 boxes of same type cereal, which, by the way, even here costs $19?  The added convienance of the individual bowls?  Still not worth it.  A pack of 60 disposable bowls runs at or about $6.  Sorry, this doesn't add up.  I would maybe go for this if it was under $25, but close to $50 is defintely out!!  Its a shame though because Special K is my main food source (eaten twice daily) in my current diet, and I've dropped 5lbs in 1 1/2 weeks.
