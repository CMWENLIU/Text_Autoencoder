I had been feeding Blue Buffalo Wilderness wet food to my dog for about 9 months with mixed results. Two months ago, I noticed white chucks of matter that I did not recognize and had not seen before in the food. After contacting Blue Buffalo customer service, I was told that these items were bone fragments (even though the BB website claims that they use no animal by-products). Last month I discovered a 2" x 3" piece of packing tape/heavy paper inside the can with the wet food. I did a fair amount of research online and decided to stop feeding my dog BB and only use dog food from companies that do not outsource their manufacturing.
