Let me start by saying...I am a huge supporter of the Nature's Variety brand.  My cat, Flea, is on instinct and my dog, Mystie, is on prairie dry.  I've tried nearly every variety of both product lines and I love how they have been so great for my fur-kids.  However, when I began to feed the Chicken Prairie to Mystie, she would throw up the food every morning after eating. She hasn't had a history of sensitivity to food and it's a real shame because she LOVES this flavor the most.  It just keeps making her sick.  We have given her the Lamb and Beef versions of this that we have on hand to test and see - but it seems to be only the Chicken that causes an issue.  She does not get sick on any of the other flavors we try.  Let me say again, I love this brand!  However, I felt I should share my experience should there be any other consumers who may be having the same problem with this flavor of Prairie.
