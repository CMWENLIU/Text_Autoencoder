OK, so some people like it, some people don't. I'm one of those who was excited about the prospect of getting iced tea from my Keurig, but was sorely disappointed by the taste from this tea.  It had a very artificial flavor, much like instant tea, and was no comparison to actual brewed iced tea.  I can only recommend getting the smallest box you can to see if it suits you.  Like the other reviewer, I can't bring myself to use what's left, and will probably end up throwing it out at some point.  My husband agreed, and he's a big iced tea drinker...and not all that picky about the taste.  He won't drink it, I won't drink it, and the cat won't drink it, so out it goes.  I do want to add that I use the hot teas and have liked them very much (especially the green tea).  There's just something about the iced flavors that don't work.
