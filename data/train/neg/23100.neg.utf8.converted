I try NOT to eat GMO foods, which are genetically modified organisms.  They were created by Monsanto and other companies to withstand huge amounts of their pesticides.  These foods are unlabeled, untested, and dangerous.  They are harmful to the environment and are causing Superweeds all over the world which now are so huge they break farm implements and require massive doses of other more dangerous pesticides in addition to the Monsanto Round Up. I called the Hava Corn Chips company and they did verify that since their products are not organic that they may very well contain these GMO's, which, by the way can cause food allergies and also have caused sterility in lab animals.  THEY ARE UNTESTED.  I do NOT recommend eating corn and soy which is not organic-it's almost all GMO.  Read your labels, don't eat these!!!  Shame on the Hari Krishnas!  For a few pennies more they could sell organic products.
