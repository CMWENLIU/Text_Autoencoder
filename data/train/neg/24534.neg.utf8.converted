I'm always looking for a single-use coffee that is strong enough for my taste without using two pods ... this isn't it. In fact, I've had cheap instant coffee that taste better.<br /><br />I use my pod  for a quick cup or take them with me when I'm traveling, so I don't expect the product to taste like my fresh ground brewed coffee. But I do expect flavor. The flavor of this coffee was similar to re-used grounds.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality about this  Marley product is that it is a free-trade, organic product.<br /><br />I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the left-over packages because I don't want to insult guests by serving it. It seems a waste to just throw it away.  Maybe I can use it in the garden.
