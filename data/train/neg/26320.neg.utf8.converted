I have never left a review before, but I am doing one now in hopes that it may help someone else. This item comes up when typing in K Cups. This led me to believe that it was for a machine that uses K Cups. IT IS NOT. Now, I have spent money on something I just need to throw away because there is no way to use it. This is a single serving in a flat round filter. I have no way to try the product, so my rating is ONLY for the fact that Amazon has it searchable by something it clearly is not.
