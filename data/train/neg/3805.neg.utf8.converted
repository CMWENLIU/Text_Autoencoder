Original review appears first.  Please read the bottom for the updated edit.<br /><br />I've never given my dogs any type of rawhide product, so I can't tell if they like these any more or less than other similar products.<br /><br />The size is described as mini, but they don't look that small.  I thought the sticks might be too large for them but they each happily managed to pick them up and run to their corners.  I never heard a peep from either for the next two hours, when they only budged to trace spots.  They managed to eat about 1/3 of their stick in that time, and I took them away to save the rest for another day.<br /><br />I read the review by the other customer who was worried after his dog became ill.  If my dogs get sick, I'll update this review and the rating accordingly.  But otherwise, they just spent two hours in doggy paradise.<br /><br />UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE<br />Unfortunately we are not as happy now.  I gave the dogs the minicongo treats again the next day and they loved them just as much.  This time I took them away after they had eaten about an inch.  Later, both dogs vomited the mixture and both had really weird poop.  I threw away the rest of the package.
