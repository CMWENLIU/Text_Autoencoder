I was really excited to find this salt, because it is supposed to be so pure, but I was really disappointed. I realize that the company refers to the grit as mineral, but to be honest, the impression I got was of trying to eat after a sandstorm. Possibly I got a particularly sandy batch, because after I gave up on eating this, I used it for bath salt, and the tub looked like I had been to a beach party. To be clear, for me it isn't the idea of dirt that bothers me (I have used clay-based toothpastes), but this grit doesn't even break up and is unpleasant to chew. All in all, I'll stick to Himalayan Salt.
