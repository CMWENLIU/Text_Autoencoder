I was looking for a weekday bean so I could drink something decent while on-the-go and differentiate from my high quality weekend coffee. This option was less expensive and had great reviews on Amazon but this coffee is gross and not good, people! Honestly, Folgers is better tasting and less bitter. I grind my beans for each pot so I worked a little with each pot and zero change, still bitter/acidic and with a slightly bad aftertaste--this IS better than Dunkin Donuts brand take home beans. So, my hunt goes on for an inexpensive weekday coffee. Until I find something, I'll stick with my Alakef brand weekend brew all week long!<br />Good: Price, free home delivery with Prime<br />Bad: aftertaste
