I'd like to make it clear that I really like pistachios. I eat a lot of this particular nut but these Setton Farms pistachios were beyond bad. There was a large percentage of nuts which were hard as rocks. The nuts which I could actually bite into tasted rotten. Also there were more empty shells than in any purchase I have ever made. I decided to check the expiration date and found that the date is not printed on the bag, but instead is on a stick on label. I carefully peeled back the label and discovered parts of other labels beneath. Imagine that?! No wonder these were totally inedible. I returned them for a refund. If anyone has any suggestions for good quality pistachios, please let me know.
