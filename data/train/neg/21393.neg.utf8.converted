I didn't get these through Amazon but I did find them at my grocery store. I got a box of 18, I think, for some crazy price like $5.99. Well, there was a good reason for that. It's pure crap. For starters, the K-Cup doesn't even feel like there is anything inside it. When you brew, a brown liquid (I can't call this coffee) comes out for a second or two, then nothing but water. I have to choke it down. Easily the worst coffee I've had in a long time. I'm throwing the box away. No sense in drinking this drek when I have good stuff in my cabinet.
