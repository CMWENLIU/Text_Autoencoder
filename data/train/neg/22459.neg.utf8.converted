I have tried all other teas from Davidson's, and love them all, but this one is the worst. Is too dusty and has lots of sediment.  I know i am in a minority in my negative review but this review only applies to this flavor. In fact i am ordering my third bag of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SARJF6">Davidson's Tea Bulk, English Breakfast, 16-Ounce Bag</a>  and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SAPX6S">Davidson's Tea Bulk, Herbal Cranberry Orange, 16-Ounce Bag</a> . I know that it is futile to argue about tastes but this tea is hard to brew and i get small sticks in my throat. Don't give this to a toddler.
