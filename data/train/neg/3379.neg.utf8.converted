I have bought these numerous times over the years as a 'backup' quick lunch at work if the need arises.  Frankly it was my favorite flavor since I tended to vary the noodle flavors I bought over the years for variety.  But this last order convinces me I wont be buying this flavor again.  What once was a good "Peanut Sesame Noodle" is now a horrible "Lemon Noodle with peanuts".  They changed the recipe for the peanut sauce and it's now just overpowering lemon grass. I don't expect fine dining when I get these, but I do expect edible and it's nearly not.
