This product as packaged was advertised at $14.99 but I was billed $19.99.  That's $6.66 per 7.05 ounce pack.  Had I checked the Carr website I'd have found that any local CVS Pharmacy carries the same product in 7.05 ounce packages, and had I visited my local CVS I could have bought the cookies for $3.69 per 7.05 ounce pack. Duh!
