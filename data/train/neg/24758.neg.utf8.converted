I ordered the three pack of the Lime Coolers after hearing about them on the Paula Deen show.  When they arrived, I opened the bag and there were only 6 or so whole cookies, the rest were either in pieces or crumbs.  Amazon is great about keeping the customer satisfied and after I complained in an email, a replacement was sent.  The second shipment was in a similar state--they were packed tight, so who knows why they were in pieces.  They taste good but only order them if you like eating cookie crumbs and pieces.
