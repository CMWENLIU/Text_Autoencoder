This is my first experience with this product so maybe I have a bad batch. These seeds have no flavor and the shells are limp and difficult to crack. The shells are tiny and if you aren't careful you or your children could choke on them. I read about the benefits of adding raw sunflower seeds to a healthy diet and I'm disappointed that it didn't work out. I will try another brand of raw sunflower seeds and see if that works out better.
