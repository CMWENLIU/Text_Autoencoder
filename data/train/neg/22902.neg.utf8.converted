It gives you the runs and is the worst sugarless candy I have ever eaten in my life.  DO NOT BUY IT TO SAVE ON THE CALORIE INTAKE!!!<br /><br />I ate about 20 pieces and the rest of the bag now goes in the trash!!!<br /><br />Amazon and Haribo should get rid of this product. I never saw this in Germany and the runs are probably why.
