I purchased the chia seeds, I did not realize it said 1 oz.  If I would have realized it was 1 oz instead of 1 lb.  I would not have purchase the product.  11.95 for 1 oz of chia seeds is over priced.  Shiping for 1 oz. is even less then the price I paid.  When I order chia seeds I look forward to making bread and smoothies I know next time to read a little closer.
