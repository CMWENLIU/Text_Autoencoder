First time I decided to try this out. For Kona the price is great of course, and the freshly opened bag is fragrant, and yet it's one of those "you get what you pay for" situations (except here you get much LESS than you paid for): the brew barely tastes like coffee (even with five teaspoons to a small cup it still tastes like boiled cardboard). You will buy a better coffee in a supermarket; any kind you pick will be better and cost about the same. Bottom line: not recommended (I won't reorder).<br /><br />***<br />05/07/2012: I'm so pissed I paid for this crap, I'm trying to get a refund. The ground matter itself, when dry, smells nice, but the brew... you could brew sawdust with the same exact result. No taste, no aroma, no caffeine kick, no matter how much you use per cup. Black sludgewater. Horrible, and should be against the law to sell it. The only use for this junk I can see is to sprinkle it around the house dry -- 'cause it smells nice while dry. This product is a quintessential ripoff; stay away.<br /><br />05/14/2012: Sent it back and just got a refund. Whew! So that's that. At least I can thank them and Amz for the complete lack of hassle with returns.
