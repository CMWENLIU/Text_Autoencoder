I bought three cases of this stuff. It is all going back. Unfortunately, I did not notice the tiny TRUVIA label on the picture of the can when I bought this from Amazon. When I got this stuff and saw the label, I did several hours of internet research and found the following:<br /><br /> This sweetener is NOT from stevia.  Natural stevia sweetener is a mixture of extracts of steviosides and rebaudioside-A from the leaves of several varieties of stevia plants and has been used and studied worldwide for decades and is classified "generally regarded as safe" by the FDA though some may not care for the taste.<br /><br />Truvia on the other hand is a Coca-Cola/Cargill partnership brand name for FAKE stevia sweetener; a mixture of .9% rebiana (not even an ingredient of steviana) and 99.1% erythritol sweetener derived from corn plants grown by Cargill, who have admitted that 30% of their corn is Genetically Modified. Regardless of the fact that the FDA is allowing this on the market, like many products these days this substance has not been properly tested and reviewed for negative or dangerous side effects of which many have already been reported by consumers of it. If you are smart you will not buy this, and if you already have... I suggest you GET RID OF IT in any manner besides drinking it. It may well be dangerous to your health!<br /><br />I will also be contacting Blue Sky Natural Beverage company about this unnatural ingredient in their "100% natural, no calorie, no artificial sweetener" sodas. Since my main goal in trying this soda with was to get away from genetically modified foods such as high fructose corn syrup and aspartame, I now do not trust Blue Sky enough to even try their regular sodas which they claim are made with "real" sugar, since nowadays that usually means a percentage of cane sugar mixed with sugar from genetically modified sugar beets. It is infuriating that companies like this can lie through their teeth to sell a phony product with no regard for the buyer and face no legal consequences.
