I bought this along with some arborio rice. The rice and the tahini were placed in a box and an airpack placed on top. So there was lots of room inside the box and the packing wasn't secure. During shipping, one of the jar tops of the tahini came off, soaking the box and its contents in tahini. I contacted customer service and they sent another shipment of tahini. It was apparently packed the same way and arrived in the same condition, leaking tahini. I did not open the box and refused to accept it and FedEx sent it back. I again contacted customer service, told them I was done with the exercise and they issued a credit. The tahini itself is acceptable but buying this from Amazon is not worth the effort.
