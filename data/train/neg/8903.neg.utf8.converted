Our dog loves this dog food. But, after my experience with ordering this product online through Amazon the dog may not get it again, as I am not only upset with Amazon for allowing it, but also the manufacturer who passes on their damaged cans to the public through an online site.  I ordered a case of this product and every can in the shipment has large dents in the can.  And because of the location of the dents, on the inside cans, in the packaging, you can tell it wasn't damage done during shipping.  These cans we packed that way. Never again will I order anything like this online.  It has actually soured me on using Amazon.
