If you are anticipating peanuts, salt and nothing else, this is not for you.  Sugar is a major ingredient as well as some type of added oil which I assume keeps the naturally occurring peanut oil in suspension (i.e., you don't have to stir this one to mix the peanut oil back into the peanut butter). Sugar may make this more appealling to the kiddie set, however.  If you are mixing true "natural" peanut butter, try using a hand mixer with a single blade; hold the jar tight, and mix away and in 30 seconds you're finished (unless you didn't grip the jar tightly enough, in which case you have to clean the kitchen, too).
