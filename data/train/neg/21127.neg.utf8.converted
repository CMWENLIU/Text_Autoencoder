I called the Customer Service line to gain an understanding of the cryptic manufacturer date stamp.  M&ms are rated safe for 12 months from  manufacturing date.  The first three digits of my product code are 132.  This was explained as 2011 - 3rd week - 2nd day.  We have about 7 weeks left out of a whole year for safe consumption.<br /><br />Having purchased three giant CHRISTMAS bags expecting to have about 6 months of m&ms, we are very disappointed.<br /><br />7 weeks left out of 52 weeks.  Of course, this means that Mars manufactured these Christmas m&ms last January for the following December which already limited their freshness time after Christmas.  SEEMS LIKE A DUMB CHOICE TO US.  Thought you ought to know.
