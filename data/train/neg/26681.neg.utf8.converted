I bought these after reading all the great reviews and I would not advise you to do the same -- not to the tune of 12 boxes anyway.  I've foisted as much off on friends as I can and I still have one box left.<br /><br />It's funny that everyone raves about it being free of chemicals, etc. because to me the taste makes me think of exactly that.  It's just truly awful -- does not resemble a cheese taste in the slightest.  Just a weird sharp and very unpleasant taste.  The sauce is thin.  They are even worse is you try to reheat.  Obviously, this is just my opinion, but I warn you not to buy 12 boxes if you're a first-timer!
