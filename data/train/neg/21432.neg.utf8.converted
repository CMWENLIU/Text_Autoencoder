i used to like kerns when i was younger. it was thick and fruity and delicious. guava was one of my favorites. recently i bought some and when i poured it on my glass right away i noticed it was syrupy and transparent when it used to be opaque and thick. i tasted it and it wasn't fruity at all, it was pure sugar and what's worse it wasn't real sugar it was corn syrup.<br /><br />i looked at the ingredients and corn syrup was the second ingredient after water. seriously? second ingredient? that's just sad and gross. i will never touch this brand of drinks again in my life.
