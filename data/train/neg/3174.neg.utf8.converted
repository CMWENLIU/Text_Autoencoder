to get this to taste anywhere even close to what milk tastes like requires 5 tablespoons per cup.  that means this powder milk costs close to $7 a gallon of milk.  and it does not taste like milk.  what's worse is it is a complete nightmare to prepare.  the powder is liquidy fine and goes everywhere and sticks to everything.
