My wife ordered this, so I'm not sure if she was aware that this product came from China.  When we got the pkg and learned that this was from China, we wanted to return it.  But this product cannot be returned even if you haven't opened it.  We will be throwing this in the trash.  We just felt that food products from China are questionable, and we didn't want to risk this with our 8 month old son.
