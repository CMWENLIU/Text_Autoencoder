Crystal light has always been carbohydrate free. This product has carbohydrates which will elevate the blood sugar in people with diabetes.<br /><br />Amazon made a BIG ERROR in not revealing that this product has carbohydrates.TOTALLY misleading and this should have been explained. We will be contacting our credit card company for a refund due to their negligence. Is there a lawyer out there who wants to start a case. This is deceitful to those who believe that this product is safe for those with diabetes. Shame on you Amazon.
