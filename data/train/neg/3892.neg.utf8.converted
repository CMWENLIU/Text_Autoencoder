I was terribly disappointed when i popped one of these almonds in my mouth and felt like i was chewing rubber.  The almonds came stale.  I did order these together with back to nature's salted and roasted almonds and those were very good.  Guess I wont be buying any more of these though<br /><br />Edit: Amazon decided to give me a refund on the almonds without me even requesting for it. Thank you Amazon! Thats real customer service and thats why I will continue being a loyal customer.
