I enjoy this product a lot when it is fresh.  The problem is that the quality of the product varies and you don't know if you are going to get a box of fresh cuts or stale (hard as rock) pieces.  When fresh, i think it is one of the best tasting jerky out there.  However, when it is stale and hard, it is not edible.  Because of the inconsistency in the quality, I will not be purchasing this product again.  Its a shame, but they need to work on quality control.
