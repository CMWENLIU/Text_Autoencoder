I ordered this brand from another company other than amazon. I ordered a 15lb box and was shocked as to the quality of these chews.some had sharp edges that could cut you plus they smelled far worse than any others I have tried and I've been buying hooves for my dog's for 35 years.I tried one on my dog and with in minutes he had shattered it into pieces and was devouring it.Normally it Takes him about a week to polish off the ones you buy at petco or petsmart.On my box it said they were a product of Chili. Mine were not polished or that clean looking. Looked like they had just come from a slaughter house.I've never seen any this bad before and am sending them back. From now on I am sticking to the ones that come in bag's and are cleaned and polished.I've also noticed the smoked type don't smell as bad when they are chewing them.
