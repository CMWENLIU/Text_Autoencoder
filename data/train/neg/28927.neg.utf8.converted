I am an enthusiastic fan of Sorghum. Have spread it on toast as if it were jam or jelly for more than 50 years.  And I was down to the last eighth of an inch in a jar a friend had picked up for me at a farm stand in Ohio.<br /><br />When I unpacked my 42 once jar of Amish Sorghum I noticed the label message that "Cirtric Acid added to prevent crystalization."<br /><br />That puzzled me, but I was looking forward to finishing off the old jar so I could try the new sorghum. When I dipped my spoon in I found it to be very thin,similar to a rich pancake syrup.  Most pure sorghum is much thicker and doesn't need to be treated by citric acid for any reason and I have had an open jar on a cupboard shelf for months without problems.<br /><br />This tasted fine, but at the end it had the aftertaste if honey. I believe these folks may be cutting their sorghum with honey. This is not the first time I have purchased a jar that was not pure sorghum. I have purchased it direct from farmers and found it was not the real stuff.  And that's what I think is the case this time.
