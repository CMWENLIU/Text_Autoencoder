I love the flavor of these dark chocolate crispy wafers! I love the flavor so much, that I often will drink a cup of coffee and savor one or two of these treats when I need a quick pick me up.  Sometimes I break off a small bite-size piece of cookie and place it in my mouth, then quickly sip my hot coffee, allowing the wafer to melt, and the two flavors to meld into a lovely mocha blend.<br /><br />This morning I was aghast at finding tiny intruders ruining my mid-morning break.  Granted, these interlopers did not willingly join me in my private tasting, they had died long (?) ago during the baking process of these Famous Chocolate Wafers.  This morning, not only did I encounter the lovely mocha blend flavor on my tongue, but also small chunks of what I initially thought might be coconut.  IT WAS NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />What I encountered was larvae (about 1/8" in length, light yellowish brown)as well as full-size bodies of the adult bugs (also about 1/8" long)and husk-like fiber --- none of these are easily confused with coconut. I couldn't believe my eyes (or tongue), so I took an intact wafer from the box, placed it on a saucer, and melted it in a small amount of tap water.  Again I made the same startling discovery -- GROSS -- and immediately called the phone number on the box.<br /><br />I requested that someone follow-up with me to report the findings, but apparently, Nabisco/Kraft does not wish to be held accountable to its customers when dissatisfaction occurs. So BEWARE . . .
