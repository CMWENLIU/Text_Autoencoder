The product is fine. The pricing is an issue. Ordered under subscribe and save for the time, the price was $6.43, great bargin. Checked on the next shipment, the price jumped to $12.23. Nearly doubled. I cancelled that subsciption. This isn't gasoline for crying out loud. WATCH YOUR FUTURE SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE ORDERS
