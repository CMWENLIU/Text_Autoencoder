I'm sorry, but on my first mouthful of this beverage, I gagged and almost choked.  I mixed it according to the package directions, adding the amount of hot water listed on the package (which turned out to be 1 cup of water).  It had a very appealing color and a strong ginger smell that was very aromatic.  I was really looking forward to trying this beverage.<br /><br />Then, I actually took a swallow, and it was so awful I could barely get it down.  The initial taste is of a nice ginger beverage, but then this unpleasant aftertaste took over, rising from the back of my throat and quickly encompassing my entire mouth.  It was accompained by the worst tingling/burning sensation I've ever felt in my life.  And that was when I began to choke.<br /><br />After I got that initial swallow down, I decided to wait a few minutes and try it again.  Same result.<br /><br />Reader, I poured the rest of this vile concoction down the drain.  And my drain now runs quite a bit better.
