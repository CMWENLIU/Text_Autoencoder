Yes, I am a coffee snob. But this is only because I have discovered that I very much enjoy the differences gained from the effort and the investments of time and money...it works so much better if one uses the consistent grind of coffee that can be achieved with a conical burr grinder (my purchase of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001804CLY">Hario MSS-1B Mini Mill Slim Coffee Grinder</a> was a crucial step towards coffee nirvana) versus the mixture of chunks and powder that comes out of a cheap electric blade grinder; the kind of smooth, rich, full-bodied nonacidic brew that comes from steeping evenly and quickly, like a real espresso machine can achieve or that I've been experiencing with the far less fussy and amazingly engineered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047BIWSK">Aerobie AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a>, completely surpasses drip or French press; and the beans matter. In fact, it is really all about the beans. And they have to be fresh, for starters.<br /><br />This crap -- and I do mean crap! -- is anything but fresh.<br /><br />It tastes to me like the batch I received recently was roasted two years ago and sat on some shelf in a warehouse the whole time. No thanks!<br /><br />How do I know this? By taste, of course. And there is no "best by" date on this package to refute my claim.<br /><br />Since purchasing the Hario grinder and the Aerobie press, in July of this year, I enjoyed two other very good French roasts from "Just Coffee," purchased at my local cooperative grocery (yes, organic), and one purchased here, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001KL1YI">Volcano Dark Roast, Organic Kona Hawaiian Coffee, 8 Oz, Whole Bean</a>. Every last cup brewed from these was heaven. During that time, I periodically washed the Hario grinder to remove the coffee oil buildup whenever I would begin to detect the effects of rancidity, and before trying this batch from Altura, I washed it again. So I know that everything necessary for a great cup of coffee was in place and ready to go.<br /><br />Except the beans this time were the deal breaker. A brew using freshly ground coffee beans stored in vacuum canisters should not taste bitter. The first cup was reminiscent of gutter water. I will not be falling for this again.<br /><br />To Amazon's credit and with my deepest gratitude, customer service responded to my feedback. But in all honesty, I believe this product should be removed from sale here.
