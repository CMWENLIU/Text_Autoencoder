Having tried Vegetable Hyderabadi Biryani in Hyderabad few times, I expected the same taste to atleast some extent.  But this smells very strong in Indian spices (the whole house, including  basement smelled for next 6 hours when microwaved) and when I tasted it, I got the feeling of a non-vegetarian dish. I had to add lots of raitha (side dish made of yogurt, onions, tomatoes, cilantro and diced serrano peppers) to overcome the strong taste. I have tried 3 other items from Kitchens of India and very satisfied and that's why I wanted to try this one. It is not that bad a choice if you have strong preference for that non-veg masala taste.
