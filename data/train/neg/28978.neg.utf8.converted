Our 11 week old Bullmastiff puppy, Jolene, died this week after playing with this toy.  She was able to get the chicken treat ball out of the toy and got it lodged in her throat.  She received prompt emergency vet assistance but died in the emergency room.  Please do not purchase this product for you pets.
