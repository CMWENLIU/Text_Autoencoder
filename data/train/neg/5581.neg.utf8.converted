After having been reasonably successful with the initial herb seeds that came with the garden, I thought tomatoes would be a nice next step.<br /><br />The tomato plants grew quickly and required a lot of trimming and pruning.  They also do require support to keep them from falling over.<br /><br />After 5 monthsI saw some yellow tomatoes (the kit comes with 2 red tomato pod and 1 yellow one).  I have not harvested them yet, since they still show hues of green.  So I cannot comment on the taste.<br /><br />The red tomatoes never came to fruition.  One of them became sick or certainly looked sick so I pulled it. The idea is nice - unfortunately the execution lacks.
