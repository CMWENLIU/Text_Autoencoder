I ordered 2 packages. But, I received 1 package of Red Tart Cherries and, like another reviewer, the second package was a package of Gooseberries. Plus, each and every can of the Cherries was dented badly. So I could not use anything from this order. I must say that Amazon was wonderful with this issue and gave me a refund with no hassle. This is my first problem with an order from Amazon after many years of service. So for that I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 star.
