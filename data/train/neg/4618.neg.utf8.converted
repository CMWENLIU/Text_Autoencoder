Nespresso does NOT officially distribute their product through Amazon - what you are purchasing here is a re-sold product from third-party seller who has purchased it directly from Nespresso (exactly what YOU should be doing) and is now re-selling this product to get a nice profit from simple-minded customers. Buy it directly from Nespresso, people - you WILL get a cheaper price and you WILL get a more fresh coffee (you can't know how long this coffee was stored at third-party reseller's location).
