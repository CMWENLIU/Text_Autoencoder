We get this all the time at pet stores, and our puppy loves it. But the cans from Amazon were dirty, dented, and gave him... output issues. And he soon refused to eat the food from them.<br /><br />We checked the dates on the cans, and they were less than a year away. The cans from the pet stores expire about 3 years in the future, so the Amazon cans were probably 2 years old.<br /><br />We threw them all away and switched back to buying the exact same food from the pet store. No issues since then. No more buying perishables from Amazon.
