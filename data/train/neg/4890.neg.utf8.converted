Apparently the ORIGINAL Twix Peanut Butter (PB) bar has been discontinued and was replaced with this inferior version (I guess at least a couple of years ago).  Wish I had known that before ordering these bars!  Yet another perfectly GOOD product needlessly messed up by the manufacturer!  This version has a dark chocolate cookie, which I guess is okay; but it does not taste near as good to my tastebuds as the original PB bar with the standard cookie!  I guess I will have to look for something else the next time I get a peanut butter candy/cookie urge that needs satisfying.  Again, for whatever reasons, companies just can never seem to leave well enough alone, go figure?
