Zoe Lifestyle Treats for Dogs are a healthy alternative to the typical high-calorie dog snacks which you find in stores today. The product is gluten-free and is a good source of soluble fiber. These treats are as hard as a rock which would probably be troublesome for older dogs with poor teeth. I tested these treats on a 2-year-old lab and a 9-year-old golden retriever. Keep in mind...they will eat just about anything. Both dogs threw the sticks on the ground and proceeded to sniff them.  I am not sure, but I think the cinnamon spice flavor threw them off a bit.  After rolling the sticks around on the ground, I am happy to report that they ate them. The next day, I offered them another treat and they didn't seem too excited. Overall, if you are into healthy dog food, these snacks are sensible treats. Personally, I wouldn't buy them again due to the price and the firmness of the product. I would be concerned that my dog would break a tooth.
