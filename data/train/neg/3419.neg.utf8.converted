Inever want to orderagain from the company, if it is a company, that Amazon sent my order from.  The product took forever to arrive; bag was spilled all over the box and you could smell the staleness from the box,<br />Although, I was reimbursed, I never want anything ordered from Cheapees.  It is too much of a headache.<br />MattD
