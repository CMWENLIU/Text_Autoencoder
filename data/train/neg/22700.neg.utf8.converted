The first ingriedent is Corn Syrup! It does not say this on the listing, it mentiones all sorts of good vegetables but not the corn syrup which is listed first on the ingriedents and so that would be the main content of the product. I am very dissapointed, as I thought this would be a great way to make soup without making my own broth from scratch. Guess I will stick to the old method.
