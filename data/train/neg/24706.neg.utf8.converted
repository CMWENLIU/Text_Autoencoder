This is the WORST TASTING Baby whole clams I have ever had!! Being a Bumble Bee Brand, I thought there is no way I could go wrong.. I love their tuna. I make clam chowder once or twice a month {cold weather} for family or friends.<br /><br />We had company coming that night. Thank goodness I tried it before they arrived. I ended up throwing it out!!<br />I e-mailed Amazon and told them the problem and wanted a credit to my account..Less than 30 minutes I received a e-mail from Amazon.<br /><br />Was informed that a credit would be giving. Will show on my account in two or three days, which it did. Told not to send the two cases back. Get rid of it anyway I wanted.. Our cats would not eat it, not the dog!!  I took it to the dump!!<br /><br />I could not believe the speed in how Amazon handled this problem!! I have NEVER dealt with a company that moved this fast!!!! I made a mistake ordering a dvd. E-mailed Amazon and it was taken care of with in a half-hour!!!<br /><br />I have NEVER received a dented can , nor crush package.. Also the boxes they send the items in , have saved me money from buying from the post office!!<br /><br />Needless to say I`m Very Happy dealing with Amazon!!
