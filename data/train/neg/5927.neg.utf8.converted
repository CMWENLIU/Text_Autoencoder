I wouldn't call this protein powder. The particles are way to large. Maybe protein granules? Protein grains? Guess it just doesn't have the same ring. It doesn't taste bad, in fact it doesn't really taste like anything when I mix into a shake, but it's almost like sand and never really dissolves at all. If you don't mind eating sand though, this is the product for you!
