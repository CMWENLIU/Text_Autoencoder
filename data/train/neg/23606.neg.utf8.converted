This was the first of the two litter pearl products I tried.  It sounded great.  It cost a little more, but the whole concept seemed wonderful.  I scooped it out every day and thought it was great until I hit day 22.  Then the crystals soaked up the urine, turned yellow, stayed wet, and then became very malodorous.  I had to change the whole thing out at 4 weeks, which kind of changes the long lasting, no odor idea and GREATLY increases the cost.  Maybe my kitten (who loves his litter box) is different and I am never going to find kitty litter that works.  I can't believe he continued to use this when I couldn't even stand to be within 10 yards of the box because of the smell.<br /><br />I was very disappointed.
