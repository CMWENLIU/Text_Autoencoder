Years ago, they used to sell packaged brownies at the dollar store, dime stores, etc. They came 12 or so to a flat. They were the cheapest treat you could buy in the store, at about a nickle each. That's what these brownies remind me of and that's not a good thing. These things are very dense, not in a GOOD "chewy-chocolaty-moist and gooey" kind of way, but more along the lines of "grainy-gummy-rubbery and nasty. The is very little flavor and no distinction between the cream filling and the chocolate shell. These are not terrible, but for the name Oreo and the steep price point, I expected much, much, much more!
