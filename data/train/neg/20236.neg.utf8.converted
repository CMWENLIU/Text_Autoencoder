I thought these were the same as I purchased at Christmas time from Costco.  I purchased these for Valentine's Day and they are just awful - they taste like cocoa covered lard.  Don't care what the price is - I'd rather have a delicious taste like the ones from Costco (they don't have them anymore).  I don't know how anybody can say these taste delicious !!  They have no taste at all.
