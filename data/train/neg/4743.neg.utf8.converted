We included three Natura dog food brands on our List of 10 Best Dog Foods.<br /><br />P&G says the move allows it to "expand into the attractive holistic and naturals segment of the pet food category", complementing the company's current pet food brands and helping advance an overall growth strategy of "reaching more consumers in more parts of the world more completely."<br /><br />Procter and Gamble says it plans to close the acquisition of Natura in a month or so. Natura has about 140 employees, located mainly at its production sites in Fremont and San Leandro, Calif. Specific terms of the deal were not disclosed.<br /><br />Natura was founded in 1989 by John and Ann Rademakers (now in their 70's), and Peter Atkins.<br /><br />John Rademakers says, "Its time for the right company to take our brands to the next level of growth. P&G is that company. We know that P&G will honor our history as they capitalize on their strengths to build these brands."<br /><br />Press Release: P&G Acquires Natura Pet Products.
