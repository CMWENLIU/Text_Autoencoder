"From Nantucket to Jamaica & Vienna to India, this sampler box has every exotic location you've ever wanted to visit. Due to availability some flavors may be substituted without prior notice."  Sounds pretty good doesn't it?  Makes you believe you are going to receive coffee from all over the world.  And just a small notice, nothing major, but we may not have every coffee in the picture available when we put together your box.  Though, never fear, we will replace it with something equally exotic and exciting.  That doesn't sound like a terrible trade off so I placed the order.  Here's what I received, a white box with what looked like a home made label with all the coffees jumbled inside without any packing to keep them organized.  Now for the flavors, more than half are doubles, a few triples and more than 50% are some variation on "French Vanilla".  Defnitely do not recommend.
