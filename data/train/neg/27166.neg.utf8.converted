I ordered this product expecting at least a pound of candy.  There is no information on the bag to tell you the amount you are getting but it is not near a pound.<br /><br />Each jelly bean is separately wrapped to make it look like more and when you get in at them they do not taste good.  You are probably used to Jelly Bellies, but these are not Jelly Bellies.  There flavor is medium at best.  I would not buy this product again.
