I ordered one of these paprika jars along with their granulated garlic.  When I opened the paprika, it had mold running through it.  Obviously, it was completely unusable.  Now I'm nervous about using the other spices I bought from these guys.  Maybe it was a fluke, but my experience was that I purchased a jar of mold.
