I was so pleased with the herbs I grew in my standard Aerogarden I bought a second one so I could grow both herbs and cherry tomatoes. Wrong! The herbs did fine again, but what they fail to tell you is that the tomatoes require 8 hours of absolute darkness. If you want to have the two gardens in the same room, or even in your living area, forget about the tomatoes. Lovely greenery, no blossoms = no tomatoes. I finally just threw them out. I'll grow herbs again, and maybe try another kit, but I can't recommend the cherry tomato kit.
