We've been ordering Wellness for one of our cats who was diagnosed as insulin-dependent diabetic a few months ago.  After reading many reviews on the internet, we chose Wellness chicken and Wellness turkey canned products.  This has gone well enough.  We though we'd give him a change of taste, so ordered a case of the beef & chicken canned food.  He projectile vomited it all over the kitchen.  Maybe it's the beef, but the remainder goes to the local pound where it will hopefully be appreciated.
