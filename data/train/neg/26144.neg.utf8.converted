I was very excited when I saw this product and it stated it was sweetened with honey.  I did not see anywhere that it also contained sucralose (sweetener) which I dislike very much until I actually received the product.  I also found out at this time that this is a purchase that cannot be returned to Amazon.  PLEASE, in the future, list all ingredients on products.
