Based on the copy, which boasts awards, I was excited to try this tea. I should have known I was in trouble when I couldn't get the plastic off the cap. I'm sure that's a safety measure, but it's not exactly "save the earth," now is it. The pungent smell was the next clue. It's supposed to taste like passion fruit but it tastes like chemicals---and it probably is. The ingredient list states passion fruit "flavor." I only had a few sips, and I cannot get the taste out of  my mouth. The final straw is the globs, and I do mean globs, of aloe vera gel that are floating around, waiting to assault your mouth.<br /><br />With 19 grams of sugar, you'd be better off having a cup of water and a cup of fruit yogurt instead. Blech.
