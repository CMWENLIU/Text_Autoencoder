I ordered one case a number of months ago and was really impressed -- some of the best coconut milk I'd had.<br /><br />Then I received a case a couple weeks ago. I noticed it had a bit odd consistency, no cream on the top, but made a curry with it anyways, and was unable to finish it! I later tried to make a smoothie with it and almost vomited. What the hell happened to this product?<br /><br />Disappointed, and not going to order from Roland again, even if they improve -- I don't trust their quality control.
