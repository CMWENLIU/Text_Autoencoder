I bought 5 bags of it thinking it would be great for working out, energy and it's protein and mineral content.  The first bag I opened was okay and I could tolerate it in shakes and sprinkled on food with hemp protein powder.  But when I opened the next few bags and shared it with a friend we both horrified from it's bitter and nasty taste.  I don't know if I just got a bad batch of this stuff.  I would only try one bag of it becausew now i am stuck with 5 bags of it!!
