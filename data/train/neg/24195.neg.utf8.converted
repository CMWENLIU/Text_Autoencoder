The outside of the box gives the impression that this is a "natural" and organic-type of product.  Sorry to report that this product contains genetically modified ingredients.  If you go to the website of this company and look at the second page of their FAQ's, you will see that they believe in bio-engineering.<br /><br />The name of this company is quite misleading.  There is nothing "natural" about using gmo foods, and a wolf in sheep's clothing is still a wolf.  For those people who think they are getting a "natural" gluten free product, I suggest you look at Mary's Gone Crackers or other truly organic products.
