the only reason i gave salad cream 1 star is because of the price. i love miracle whip and this tastes exactly like kraft miracle whip. if you look at the label on miracle whip it is also called a dressing which i promise you heinz salad cream tastes just like miracle whip. so save yourself at least half the money that this product costs and just buy miracle whip.
