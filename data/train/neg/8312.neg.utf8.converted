I have used SAF yeast before-had it in the freezer for over 3 years without a problem. I ordered this yeast 6 weeks ago from Amazon, put it in an airtight container, and refrigerated it. It worked great-was using it to make a loaf of bread one at a time (not a new recipe) over past 12 hours and none of them rose. I decided to proof the yeast and it was dead. I then checked the packaging which I had saved from the original container and there was NO date next to "Best if used by". Now, I am going to a Christmas party to which I was going to bring homemade bread, and its too late to make a fourth loaf. Please, check for dates when receiving this product. I am very disappointed.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Z7VYXW">Saf Instant Yeast, 1-Pound Pouches (Pack of 4)</a>
