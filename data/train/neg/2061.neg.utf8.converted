I received my order a couple of weeks ago.  The shipment has live bugs -- Sawtooth Grain Beetles.  I have had to move the bag from my pantry to the garage.  I have sealed it and placed it in a closed can but still not sure how to kill them without contaminating the seeds.  Usually I place a bay leaf on the top of any grain to keep bugs out.  This bag was received with live bugs already in the shipment. The seeds sprout okay after rinsing them so they deserve at least one star.
