I would like to hear from Smokehouse as to "country of origin" for the chicken they use in this product - since all the other products they sell (like regular chicken strips) are from China.  Is this basically the same Chinese-processed chicken imported and then combined with some vitamin E inside a US factory? Made in USA doesn't equate with product country of origin.<br /><br />I wouldn't be suspicious except that they are a huge importer of chicken from China.  Why would this product be any different?
