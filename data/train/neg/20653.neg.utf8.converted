Just got back from Meijer & happend to buy one of these. To "find" the nutrition the label asked me to "write" to their place of business. Below that it says "PRODUCT OF CHINA OR TURKEY'. Just thought it would be worth while to note though. I bought it for 1/10 of this price. Let's see here... The sticker says 5.96. They don't taste exceptionally good. I would only use them for cooking. Not worth the purchase as $6 (or $60)can get me a whole canister(s) of "Deluxe" mixed nuts from a name brand. Perhaps I should sell mine as "used". I only ate 2 nuts out of it so far and would easily settle for $20 :)
