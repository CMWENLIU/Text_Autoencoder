I have three cans left of the Original Snows Clam Chowder and when I purchased the modified "Snows Clam Chowder" I knew right away something was terribly wrong so I compared the Original can with the modified version.<br />The original can says "Authentic New England Clam Chowder" and the modified can says "New England Clam Chowder".<br />Also the original can shows a sketch of a New England Trolling or Shrimp boat while the modified can shows a photograph of the soup in a bowl.<br />The original which was creamy and thick says "Snows/Doxee Inc Cape May,NJ 08204-5400" while the modified looks to be made with skim milk and very thin and little potatoes and clams says "Bumble Bee Foods, LLC San Diego,CA 92186 USA. I think the clams are from Indonesia or Thailand or Vietnam or possibly made in these countries and shipped to the USA. Also the tuna that Bumble  Bee sells in those small cans is from Asian Countries and it is a watered down version with only 40% of the can has actual tuna while 60% is water. Not to go on a tangent but went to Costco and bought their Albacore Tuna cans made Costco Wholesale Corp. in Seattle, WA with the can comprising 99% of tuna and 1% of water.<br />I think Bumble Bee Co is the company owned by Nancy Pelosi and her husband. They own 5 companies that "manufacture", and believe me this junk they are passing off as New England Clam Chowder is manufactured, seafood products.<br />In this new modified version of Snows Clam Chowder the can still says the clams are from the New England coast which I feel is a lie.<br /><br />This present modified New England Clam Chowder is junk food and a distortion of what was a very good quality soup. I will no longer purchase this and all my friends whom I told to buy this product are now being told not too.
