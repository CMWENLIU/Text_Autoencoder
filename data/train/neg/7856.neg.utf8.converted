I haven't even tried the truffle yet, but the lid was made so poorly that it had opened (when?) and the very small piece of foil tape was ripped.  Silly me, I am keeping it --don't want the hassle of a return.  But the jar was dry which I didn't notice until I re-read the discription of the product where it said "in liquid".  The lid only had like 4 small stops and so turned easily.  The truffle wasn't totally dried out.
