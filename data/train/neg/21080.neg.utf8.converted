I was very exited to try this flavor, but was a bit disappointed with the experience.  First was the texture; it was a bit off.  Granted, anything cured in sugar is gonna be a bit sticky, but the meat had this "unnaturally" soft texture to it as well(maybe to much preservative and/or texture enhancer).  The flavor was ok, kinda like panda express Orange Chicken.  I was definitely sweet, but beyond that the flavor was bit muddy. Both me and my GF came to the same consensus, which that in itself is a feat.  I definitely like the direction Golden island is taking with their jerky products, and loved their BBQ pork jerky.  But this needs a bit more refining.
