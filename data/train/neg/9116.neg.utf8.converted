I spent a lot of time looking through gift baskets to send my kids a nice gift basket..$40.00 later they get a pretty small basket with very little product. Now I would probably pay $20.00 for this basket but not a penny more. First time I have ever been disappointed with anything I have purchased from Amazon.com And I have never written a review on anything. Just thought it was my duty:(((((
