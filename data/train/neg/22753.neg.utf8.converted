Man, this soup is foul! It's not even the taste that's so bad--it tastes fairly ok, even though there's a slight cardboard aftertaste--it's the consistency which just makes it terrible. It's like some kind of sludge: no amount of mixing or altering the microwaving time/level does anything, believe me I tried. The reviewers who said it's filling are right: I swear I could feel the sludge in my stomach for the rest of the day. Do not buy this!
