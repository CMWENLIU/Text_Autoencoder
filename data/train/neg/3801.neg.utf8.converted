Charleston Vanilla Chew must have been subjected to very high heat as each bar opened so far had the inner part melted and partially leaked to the outside of the chocolate.  To make things worse the melted inner part has welded itself to the cardboard wrapper and cannot be totally removed.  You therefore are eating cardboard with the candy. It is not warm outside so I would be very surprised if the trucking company who delivered it was at fault.
