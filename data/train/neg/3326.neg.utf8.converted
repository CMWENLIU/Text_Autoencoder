This is some really nasty tasting stuff. I just tried this one "illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappucino, 8.45-Ounce Cans" before trying this one. Of the two, this is definitely the worst. But saying the other one was better isn't really saying much because it was really nasty tasting too.<br /><br />  The closest thing I can compare the flavor of this to is a pot of coffee that was left cooking on a hot plate till there was only a cup left in the pot. Then sat for 2 days. It has a nasty burnt coffee flavor with a strong metallic twang to it like it has boiled for hours in a aluminum sauce pan. It left a bitter burnt after taste stuck in the back of my throat and a foul metallic yuck coating my tongue. And neither one wants to go away. It might supposed to have a espresso flavor and I'm not real sure what that is since I haven't had one in several years. But, if real espresso taste's like this stuff, then espresso certainly wouldn't be as popular as it is. Except as a tar remover or something like that.<br /> On the can it says "DO NOT SHAKE" and that made me wonder why? After trying to drink it I'd have to say its probably because it still has a bunch of coffee grounds settled in the bottom of it. And if I shook it up then I would have the chew it instead of drink it. I thought about cutting the top off of the can and see what's in it, but decided that I really didn't want to know. I used to call bad strong coffee battery acid, I think this could actually be used for that.<br /><br />The only plus I could say about this is,,,mmmm. There's only 6.8 oz. of it to drink!
