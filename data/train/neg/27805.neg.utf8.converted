When I saw that Amazon was selling a SharkBanana, I thought this was some sort of genetically engineered hybrid, perhaps the equivalent of childhood favorite sea monkeys, but for the new age.<br /><br />I ordered a gross of these using Prime 2 day shipping, and as I am very busy as the CEO of a major corporation, I didn't have time to fully research this item. But I expected something like this: You receive your SharkBananana embryos, put them in water, and watch them grow to be full fledged SharkBananas. I planned to include these in the gift boxes I send to my best clients, along with a Coach wallet, some Godiva chocolates, and a few other high end goodies that go with that sort of thing.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise, and disappointment, when I got my pallet of boxes from Amazon and all each contained was this stuffed animal thing. No embryos. Not even any real bananas, which I sort of figured that--for the price they're asking--they'd probably include. In fact, I specifically ordered a banana essence truffle from Godiva to go with these.<br /><br />There is no way I am going to be able to put these in my gift boxes.<br /><br />Buyer beware: These are neither real sharks, nor real bananas.<br /><br />'nuff said.
