I enjoy coconut milk and have no complaints about coconut milk or Thai Kitchen coconut milk.  I find it to be delicious.  My complaint is about quality control in the packing plant.  6 of the 12 cans I received were dented, and the box they were packed in showed no damage to explain the dents, which means that they willfully put damaged cans in the box.  I am not able to return this item for a refund either, as it's not eligible under Amazon's refund policy, so I have no recourse.
