The price on this is pretty good, but it seems the adage of "you get what you pay for" is also true. There is only the most mild smell of peppermint when you open the bag, and crushing some between your fingers doesn't release any additional scent. I've tried several brewing methods, and the peppermint taste is weak even with steeping it a long time. The only way to get a cup that approaches a decent flavor is to use a lot (couple of tablespoons) for a brew. Still, even with using a lot per cup, the taste is more grassy than minty.<br /><br />I really enjoy peppermint tea, and often add it to black teas to temper their strong flavor. While the price on this bag was great, I won't be buying it again - way too weak. There are several other brands out there that cost a bit more, but are a far better value.
