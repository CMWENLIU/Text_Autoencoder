I bought these cashews in a 48 count pkg & was disappointed in a few points. First the cashews were mainly pieces & few whole cashews & they were small in size. Second the taste of the cashews were ok but not great. For nine dollars a pound, these cashews were not worth the price. Will not purchase these particular nuts again.<br /><br />D.Martinez<br />Dearborn Heights MI.
