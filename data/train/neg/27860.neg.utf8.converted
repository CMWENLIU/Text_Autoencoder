The previous reviewer is totally on point. Watery, not cheesy, very hot.<br /><br />So, the only thing they got right was the "hot." Flavor is horrible, texture is nasty ( not cheesy yumnmy).<br /><br />Skip it, and you won't regret wasting your money the way I did. These went in the trash.<br /><br />Mir
