I thought the bonsai was a cute little tree at first, but I noticed little bugs on my desk where I kept the tree.  I didn't think about why they were they at first, but after 2 weeks, I noticed the tree was crawling from little mites that were coming up out of the soil.  I'm sure the seller didn't intend on this happening, but I'll never order another bonsai.<br /><br />Addition - Seller was great.  They recieved my email about the bus & offered me a full refund.  They explained it was not intentional & that flooding in their area may have caused it.
