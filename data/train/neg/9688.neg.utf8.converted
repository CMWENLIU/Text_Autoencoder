First let me say that I just got an order in of 5 different spices, all are great except the cayenne, I do allot of cajun cooking and know cayenne very well, I have been using the no salt cajun mix for almost a year now and it is as good as the mixes I get in Louisiana ( Tonys ), I wanted to get some cayenne to bump up the heat for marinades and was disapointed with this product, has more of a parika taste than a pepper taste. If it was a prime item I would return it.
