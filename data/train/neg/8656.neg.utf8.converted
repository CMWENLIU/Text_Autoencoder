I bought this tonight - and after having some - I washed my mouth out and looked online to see if there was a recall... No, there is no recall on this "con queso" - it's just bad. It smells like a foot and it tastes like a vinegary slime with chunks in it. I like Newman's salsa all right - but this... This is a mistake in a jar...<br /><br />Thank you everyone who previously reviewed this - you gave me a sigh of relief - I was worried I was going to get sick.
