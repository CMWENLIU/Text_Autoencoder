I've used this product over the past few days and it has had no effects on my eyes.  I visited my doctor a few months back because I have a bag under one eye that only shows when I smile.  My doctor says that it didn't form because of premature aging but b/c of the way I sleep.  I thought that this cream would work resolve the issue but it hasn't had any effect on my undereye bag.
