I was looking for an inexpensive way to get pure hibiscus tea, as I'm a big fan of it.  A pound of it at this price seemed like a good deal so I gave it a try.  Upon receiving the tea, I discovered some other ingredients in this tea, particularly orange peel and cinnamon, that overpower the hibiscus (the eponymous and most important ingredient, as far as I'm concerned) and made it more like potpourri than hibiscus tea.  Fortunately, the components are in recognizably large pieces (which I see as sign of high quality) that I can pick out the undesirable bits.<br /><br />So if you're thinking of buying, be advised that this tea has cinnamon and orange peel.  I wasn't able to find that description anywhere on the product page.
