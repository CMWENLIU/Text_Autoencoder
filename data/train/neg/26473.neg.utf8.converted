I bought 5 lbs of this instead of my usual order from Sweet Maria's.  I had some of each on hand to compare, and right away I saw that the Coffee Bean Direct beans were full of misshapen beans and even a few stones.  When it came to roasting, it was much more difficult to get an even roast in my iRoast2.  When I drank the first few cups, the difference was even more striking.  I will be pawning this off on my relatives who don't know better, and ordering a replacement from Sweet Marias.<br /><br />As bad as this review is, there is nothing horrible about the beans, but with an equally priced and far supperior competitor out there, there is no reason to buy this one.
