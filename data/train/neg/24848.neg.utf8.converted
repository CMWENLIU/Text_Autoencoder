Anyone remember making those gelly-like bugs in a mini extruding machine when you were a kid?  Well, these noodles, though basically adopting the flavor of the sauce you dress them with, have that same, chewy, rubbery texture.<br /><br />I didn't find the smell offensive, and I was pleased with the appearance, since they looked very much like the real deal when I used them for lo mein.  But after a few bites (about 50 per forkful) I decided it was just a bit too rubbery for me.  I purchased 8 bags, and put the remaining 7 in the trash.<br /><br />I have to say, also, the "8 oz" package size is the prepared weight, not like with dried pasta...so 8 ounces of this stuff goes only half as far as the real thing.<br /><br />If you don't mind chewing, go for it...they will taste like whatever you cook them in.  But I felt like I was eating creepy crawlers and just couldn't get beyond that.<br /><br />:&lt;(
