Thai Kitchen makes one of the most visually appealing sweet chili sauces around.  Unfortunately, its merits end with its appearance.<br /><br />A good sweet chili sauce balances sweetness with a full-bodied chili burn.  One could argue that the Thai Kitchen sauce achieves balance because each side of that equation is a big 0.  There is no discernable sweetness.  And there is no burn.  In fact, foods to which I have added this sauce are unchanged by it.  I have used it in several different recipes just to ensure it was not overwhelmed by another ingredient.  It is consistently absent.<br /><br />Compounding the insult, the bottle says it must be refrigerated after opening.  This is the first of many sweet chili sauces I have used to make such a demand.<br /><br />I can only urge people looking for a sweet chili sauce to look elsewhere unless your only interest is in having a good looking bottle sitting on your shelf.
