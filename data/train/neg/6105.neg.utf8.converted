My husband and I visit the Florida Keys quite often. We always make sure that we treat ourselves to some wonderful Key Lime Pie. In the past we have always brought home fresh Key lime fruit from some market in Key West. Due to flight regulations and restrictions, we were unable to bring it home this past December. So I decided to purchase some online and this is how we found this brand and used it. It was a real disappointment.The juice tasted like any ordinary lemon juice and lacked that floral bitter tang that Key Limes are famous for.I don't know how this brand can call themselves the famous and original.The juice is from concentrate and who knows what kind of process it went through but it definitely lacked freshness and I will never buy it again.
