Normally I really like Sprout Baby Food for my child.I always have a little taste before giving new baby food to my child.  The third little noticed ingredient is mint. Mint gives it a very bad taste and I wouldn't have purchased this product if I had noticed it also contained mint. I am disappointed with this I was not expecting mint with peas and green beans. I wish I hadn't purchased so much.
