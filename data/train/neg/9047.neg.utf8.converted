I too was fooled, but apparently there is no such thing as truffle oil made with truffles.  They are all made with a chemical compound.  See this article from the New York Times:<br /><br />Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles<br />By DANIEL PATTERSON<br />Published: May 16, 2007<br />http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/16/dining/16truf.html?_r=1&ref=dining&oref=slogin<br /><br />As the article notes, it's not possible to infuse oil with a truffles and ALL oils claiming to be made from truffles aren't. Don't feel too bad, even rather famous chefs fell for the idea.  But all of this explains the "one-dimensional flavor" of these oils.  One might argue if it tastes good then it doesn't matter.  Perhaps, but that doesn't explain why the oils costs so much.
