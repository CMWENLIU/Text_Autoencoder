Feeding our 6-month old baby formula was not a choice my husband and I had anticipated having to make.  After comparing reviews and ingredient lists, I thought this formula was the best choice.  And perhaps for other babies, it is.  However, this formula brings our girl's digestive system to a stop.  I suspect that it is the brown rice syrup, as whey-based formulas do not cause any problems for her.  It is not an allergy to brown rice, either, as she has not had any problems with rice cereal.  Unlike other formulas, Baby's Only never full dissolves in water; it remains slightly gritty, no matter how much we stir it, or what temperature the water is.  No wonder our girl is unable to digest it.<br /><br />After a few weeks of "Let's see if her system adjusts to it", we gave up.  It may be a hexane-free organic formula, but it is not worth the discomfort it causes our baby.  We have started giving her Earth's Best and she has responded very well to it.  I had high hopes for Baby's Only and was disappointed by our experience with it.  I am wary of feeding a brown rice syrup-based formula to an infant and in the future, if we have to buy formula for our other children, we will not choose Baby's Only.
