I really wanted to like these dressings/marinades/rubs, but had to give upon them before I wasted a couple hundred in other ingredients trying to salvage the experiment.  Maybe they're good as rubs or marinades?  I made the various dressing mixes listed on the side of the bottles, but I didn't have the heart to put them on meat.<br /><br />I had two big problems:<br />1) All of the dressing recipes are super, super, super vinegary.  Even if you cut back on the vinegar, you're still left with super, super vinegary.  If you're from South Carolina, this might be your thing.  I'm not, it isn't.<br />2) They all smell and taste similar!  You know how every variety of Sam Adams tastes like, well... Sam Adams?  These mixes have the same issue.  If I had to guess, I'd say that "herb blend" that's the first ingredient on each bottle is the same blend - something proprietary that the makers spin off in different directions to make the different dressings.<br /><br />They are relatively healthy, without any scary fillers or sugar or whatnot, but Annie's, Wegman's and Brianna's make whole lines of relatively healthy dressings that actually taste good.  I'll be going back to those, or making my own herb mixes.
