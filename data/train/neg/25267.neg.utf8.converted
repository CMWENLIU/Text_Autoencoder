i bought these for my shih-tzu and pom, the did ok with it, but they are rather flimsey, my pit bull got ahold of it and there were splinters every where, so if you have mixed dog sizes be careful of this one. Hartz has a nice big thick ribeye bone that walgreens sells for 2/$5.00 usually, these are thick enough that they do not splinter or break, and there is lots of yummy marrow in the middle that the small dogs can get to, try those.
