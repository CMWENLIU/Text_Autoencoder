Seems most people love these Orgain shakes.  This fact really, really makes me wonder.  I don't normally like to leave negative reviews of anything, but I feel it's my duty to express my difference of opinion.  I have tried only the "chocolate", and I use quotation marks because it tastes like no chocolate I have ever tasted in my entire life, and I'm a girl who knows her way around chocolate.  It was absolutely the most disgusting protein drink I have ever tasted.  If you put bark mulch, lawn clippings and a little bit of manure in a blender with milk and drank it - that might be a close comparison to the taste of this stuff, in my humble opinion.  I can't even believe I spent money on these, or that anyone else does.  Maybe if you're one of those people who drinks wheatgrass or eats carob like it's really chocolate, or one of those other "healthy" and a way too earthy concoctions, you'll like it.  If you have normal tastebuds, run - don't walk -  the other way from this stuff.
