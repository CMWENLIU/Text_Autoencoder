I bought a two ounce bottle today because I have to stay up all night finishing up a paper. I've never had one of these before so I followed the directions and drank only half the bottle first. After just 10 minutes I noticed my breathing was getting stronger and I felt very strange. My heart feels like it's racing so fast and it's making me feel very uncomfortable. I notice I'm not as tired as I was before, but not as focused and alert as I get when I drink a can of Amped. Besides that, I know it claims to be sugar free, but when I looked at the bottle I noticed it had a sugar substitute. To me, anything with sucralose is equally bad for you. Several people told me not to drink this and I foolishly ignored them. I will not drink this again.<br /><br />Ps. I drank this on a full stomach
