I have been buying Genova Tonno Solid Light Tuna In Olive Oil (5 ounce) for years it was always good and dependable with the exception of an occasional can being somewhat saltier but still good. In the last six months(July-Dec 2010) the quality has declined significantly. I thought that perhaps I bought a bad can or so and I foolishly continued to buy Genova Tonno hoping that possibly it was just a change in processing or suppliers and that I could once again buy Genova with the confidence that it was a quality tuna. The best by dates on the cans is 2014.The Genova Tonno of the last six months can only be described as dry and tasteless.I will NOT be buying Genova Tonno it has gone from what I considered the best tuna to the absolute worst tuna.
