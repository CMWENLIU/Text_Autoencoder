IF YOU HAVE CELIAC DISEASE OR SOY ALLERGIES, THIS IS NOT THE PERFECT SOUP YOU WERE HOPING TO FIND.  The list of ingredients on Amazon is not correct!!<br />  My children have Celiac disease and soy allergies.  I thought I had found the perfect soup.  I was sadly mistaken.<br />  The listed ingredients here on Amazon (AND on the manufacturer's website) is different from the cans that arrived in the mail from Amazon.  The picture looks the same, but the ingredients are NOT.<br />  This soup is NOT SOY FREE (contains soy sauce) OR GLUTEN FREE (Yeast Extract and Natural Flavors).  Here's what the can label ACTUALLY lists:<br />"Filtered Water, Organic Mushrooms, Organic Cream (from milk), Organic Rice Flour, Organic Mushroom Concentrate (Organic Mushrooms, Organic SOY SAUCE [Organic Soybeans, Organic Maltodextrin], Organic Mushroom Powder, Organic Butter [Organic Cream, Lactic Acid], Organic Molasses, YEAST EXTRACT, Organic Potato Flour, Organic Flavor, Natural Flavor), Organic Rice Starch, Salt, Natural Flavors, Organic Canola Oil, Organic Onion Powder, Organic Parsley, Organic White Pepper, Organic Thyme.  CONTAINS MILK AND SOY"<br /><br />Notice it doesn't warn about the possible wheat/gluten from the Yeast Extract or Natural Flavors.  I called the manufacturer to find out if their Organic Soy Sauce contains wheat.  They claim it does not.  THEY COULD NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE "NATURAL FLAVORS" WOULDN'T CONTAIN GLUTEN.  I wouldn't risk it if you have Celiac disease.  I forgot to ask them about the Yeast Extract sources.
