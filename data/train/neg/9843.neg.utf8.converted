Everyone is offering a peppermint mocha today.  Just take a drive down the road at all the major chain coffee shops and even the local ones.  You can't miss it this time of year.  Well now Maxwell House wants to bring that popular holiday flavor to your home.  First off, the recommended serving size is too small of a serving.  Your going to have to double it.  Mixing is easy, add powder to water.  The end result is a very weak latte or a strong hot cocoa.  The peppermint flavor over powers any chocolate or coffee taste.  It's nice to have the ability to make something like this at home, but I think it's a concoction best left for the experts.
