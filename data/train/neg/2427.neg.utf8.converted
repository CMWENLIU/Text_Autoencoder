I ordered the Milka Alpine Milk Chocolate and the Creme chocolate, but was very disappointed when I got my package. The chocolate was completely melted and packged VERY poorly. There was no ice pack in the box at all to help keep the items from melting. I ordered chocolate from other companies on Amazon and all their chocolate arrived in excellent condition, but this was horrible. I'm sure the chocolate will taste great once it reforms its melted self though! Just watch when you order from Euro Food Mart cause you might get melted products too or you might have to additionally pay for an ice pack to be added to your order.
