I saw the other review and hoped that it was a fluke. My dog adores these treats, and my local pet shop no longer carries them.<br /><br />At the time I ordered, this product listing was quite clearly for 15 packs of five. Instead of the 15 packs the product listing stated, I got one, and now the seller has edited the page. (My order history still shows "15 packs"--I'm not inventing this.) The price is fair for one pack, but for nearly $6.00 in shipping, I could have ordered these from any number of other places online that have ethical standards.<br /><br />The treats are a total 5 star, by the way, but don't buy them here.
