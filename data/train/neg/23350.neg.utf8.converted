I wanted to love this tea. The reviews here were so motivating. I was seeking a tea I could drink daily with no caffeine, that also would not upset my sensitive stomach. Rooibos sounded like the answer. However, I absolutely am repulsed by the smell (both out of the box and after tea is infused), as well as by the taste and after-taste. I wish I loved it - I love the benefits it is supposed to have for health - but I loathe drinking it. I tried it (1) straight and hot (2) with sugar (3) with sugar and milk. All were horrible. It tastes strangely fruity - but there is an earthy taste that I just can't place that rises up and fills your senses. The aftertaste is like an artificial fruity taste, maybe artificial vanilla. Oh my it is awful. The color is quite pretty - it looks like a cup of pumpkin pie when you add milk - but I just can't down this beverage. Maybe if you like herbals as a rule that are fruity - you will like this beverage. I on the other hand love the flavor of black or green teas. I tolerate the taste of chamomile and peppermint. But this is just too much to ask. No rooibos for me. Sorry!
