The dry product is extremely fine, almost powdery. The cooked product is mushy and doesn't even taste like grits to me. I like the coarse stone ground grits which haven't been de-germed. Regular white grits from the grocery store is preferable to this product. I will donate the three unopened boxes to our local food bank.
