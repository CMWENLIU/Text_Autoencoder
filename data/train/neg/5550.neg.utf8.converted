I was so disappointed with this product I immediately contacted the company.  I am not surprised that I did not hear back.  This is not soymilk, it's 95% maltodextrin.  The label indicates only 1 gm per serving is actual soy protein -- the rest is starch!!  It tastes peculiar.  I am using it up in my soups and baking and will never buy it again.  A much better alternative is WholeFoods vanilla soy protein -- 100% rapid-dissolving protein plus flavoring, no added starch or sugar.
