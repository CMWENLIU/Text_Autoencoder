I am not a happy camper. This website says "pure xylitol". What did I get? A box of packets that say "Xylitol Plus" which is Xylitol and Stevia. And, most of the time, I find Stevia to be nasty. So now I likely have to throw this whole box away and I am pissed. This seller is not worth your time. Go to your local health food store where you can hold the box you want in your hands.
