I'm a mother of 19 months old and started using this formula when my son was about 9 months and used it for about 3-4 months till he switched to a cow's milk. I did tons of research before deciding on this formula. I thought it was the best one on the market. I have recently found out about a study that published horrifying results about organic brown rice syrup (the main ingredient in Baby's Only used as a sweetener in organic food products as an alternative to high fructose corn syrup). The researchers found that the two baby formulas that contained brown rice syrup had arsenic levels that were far above the EPA standard for drinking water and more than 20 times greater than each of the 15 formulas that didn't contain brown rice syrup. These products were Baby's Only Organic Dairy Toddler Formula and Baby's Only Organic Soy Toddler Formula, both made by Nature's One.<br />Arsenic levels in the two formulas were also higher than the World Health Orgnanization's "maximum tolerable daily intake" standard for babies, who are particularly vulnerable to arsenic's neurological effects because of their small size and developing brain.<br /><br />As a mother, I feel dreadful to realize I was giving my child something that could be harmful to him.
