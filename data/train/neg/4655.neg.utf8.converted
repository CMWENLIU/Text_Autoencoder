I bought a lot of boxes of vita coco from Amazon these past few months due to the sale/special offers lately. 2 boxes (both were the small size) tasted great! (1 carton had a weird taste).<br /><br />I said whatever and bought the larger size. YUCK! I drank the first two and they tasted sour. I compared them side by side with the other vita coco I had (the smaller cartons) and these taste really different. I opened a few more to try, and some were okay, and others sour.<br /><br />UGH. I don't care how good some of these boxes are! If they vary this much, it's not worth it to me to try again.<br /><br />*Edited to add:<br />I emailed vita coco and told them about this and they told me they had a bad batch. The rep then mailed me a free box of 12 cartons. This batch was good! (They sent me some funky flavors instead of the original though...still nice of them).
