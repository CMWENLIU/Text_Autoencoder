I had ordered a specific item but was sent something different without being consulted prior to it being sent. I ended up having to pay double what I had initially paid to return it. When I contacted this seller to try to remedy it, I was basically ignored after a couple of back and forth emails. Very unprofessional business practices. It is my opinion they are not trustworthy.<br />I didn't want to write this but feel I now have no other option as they clearly don't care about their customers.
