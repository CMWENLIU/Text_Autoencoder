I bought these chicken treats after receiving several articles about dogs getting sick from other chicken breast treats that we're made in China.  I bought these specifically because they were made in the USA and I assumed they would be safe.  They were so hard I could barely break them and my dog wasn't chewing them well.  He started choking on a piece while eating it and that was the end of that.  These are terrible and dangerous.  The pieces are so sharp I became concerned about him cutting an intestine or something.  Now I make my own chicken treats.  It's pretty easy and I know exactly what is in them.
