Seriously, these newly formulated potato "buds" are HORRIBLE!  Taste and texture like drywall spackle.  Yes, this used to be a great product--they best dehydrated mashed potato product on the market.  But since they changed the formula--sickening.  They are no longer "buds" but just a box of tasteless powder.  Save yourself the money and pass this one by.
