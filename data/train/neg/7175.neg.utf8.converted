... consistently bad.<br /><br />--- EDITED 11-27-2010 ---<br />Has anyone read the ingredients? This product contains corn maltodextrin (which I have an allergy to), vegetable glycerin, and Indian sarsaparilla root. This is probably where the odd and nasty taste I am getting is coming from.<br /><br />And why the hell are these in coffee? Shouldn't it be JUST coffee and whatever flavoring is added?<br /><br />Way to go Starbucks! 1 star!<br />--- EDIT ---<br /><br />I've tried many different Starbucks coffees, from morning blends to more flavored coffees and not one have I enjoyed or liked.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor in Starbucks Natural Fusions is a joke. When you first open the bag you are hit with this amazing aroma of nice fragrant coffee with a delightful hint of vanilla. When brewing, you completely loose the vanilla smell. And once tasted, the vanilla is GONE. And I don't think I should be expected to have to add something (be it milk, cream, or some other product) to bring out the flavor of the coffee. A good coffee can stand alone straight from the pot.<br /><br />No matter how weak or strong I made it, it had a not so pleasant taste to it. I'm thinking that it had a lot of quakers in it before the coffee was ground, thus this odd taste was present.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality is the look and design of the bag, initial smell, and the fact that it gives me my caffeine for the day, even if I have to chug it.<br /><br />Back to the drawing board Starbucks and come back with a better tasting blend.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Smells great!<br />Didn't get a bitter taste from it (oddly enough).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Didn't taste like vanilla by any stretch.<br />Isn't all that palatable to my or three other peoples taste.<br />Pricey for mediocre coffee.
