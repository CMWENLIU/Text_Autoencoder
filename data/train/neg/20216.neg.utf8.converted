If you have used Nestle Cerelac (Stage 3 - Mixed Veg and Mixed Fruits) from India, you will be disppointed by this Nestle Cerelac European version. This is becuase the Indian version contains small fragments of fruits and vegetables in the wheat flour suspension. That maks an interesting blend for the baby to eat and try new feeling for the food. But this European Cerelac is just a powdery mix and produces a blend paste like result.
