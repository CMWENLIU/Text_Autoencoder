I was sold on this formula for a few reasons. Some are true, some need further investigation.<br /><br />I was only going to feed my newborn organic, so I looked at the choices:<br /><br />Earth's Best (made by Hain Celestial)<br /><br />Baby's Only<br /><br />Similac Organic<br /><br />I ruled out Sililac right away because the FIRST ingredient is CANE SUGAR. This is a very cheap way to introduce carbs into the formula. I firmly believe that Sugar is the culprit of many our ails as a society today...Including the out of control type 2 diabetes in children under 18. The last thing I wanted to do was to feed my child "fast food" formula. Organic or not.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the Earth's Best and the Babys Only. In reading the Baby's Only website, I liked a couple of things that they stated...(which really were knocks against Earth's Best). One was that the cows used for the dairy for Baby's Only were small run family cows and that these farms commitment to organic farming and practices were sound. As opposed to Earth's Best which sourced its milk from Horizon who is owned by the Huge food processor Dean Foods. Dean is one of the largest milk producers in the country. The Baby's Organic people insinuated that cows from Dean are not treated well and may not be truely organic like their cows due to watered down USDA regulations. Maybe true, maybe not. They would like you to believe this because it supports their product. Truth be told, Horizon is the largest purchaser of small run , family farm milk in the country. It is estimated that half to 3/4 of their milk supply is obtained this way.<br /><br />The other thing that really bothered me is that Baby's Organic claims that their Carbohydrate source is superior. They use brown rice syrup which they claim breaks down slower because it is a more complex sugar, thus lowering the "spiking" of insulin levels. Now, whereas I believe that compared to Cane sugar or corn syrup, this is a no brainer, I would choose brown rice syrup....but here's where I think that they are totally wrong. Earth's Best uses Lactose as their primary sugar (carb source). In human breast milk, lactose is almost the exclusive source for carbs...exactly the same as Earth's Best. Again on the Baby's Only website they claim lactose to be inferior to their brown rice syrup. How can they do this?? They show no evidence to support their claim, especially when Lactose is what's in breast milk!!<br /><br />The reason I bring this point up is because I did not know all of this and I fed my baby Babys Only from weeks 2-6 of her life believing their website that brown rice is better. She had SOOOO much gas...burping, flatulation...she was so uncomfortable using this formula...we switched to Earth's Best and all of the problems went away. I really think that the brown rice syrup used is much harder for the baby to digest and thus messes up their fragile systems. Lactose is the same ingredient found in human breast milk. I cannot understand how the Baby's Only people can deny this. They are the only formula maker that I have found that stands by the claim that brown rice us better than lactose.<br /><br />Furthermore, they call it a Toddler Formula and maybe for a good reason. I read in a few places that Whereas all of the nutrients are the same as infant formulas, they called it toddler because they wanted to be politically correct by stating that all babies under 12 months should breast feed. But, now with experience I do not think that it is as well tolerated as other infant formulas because of their ingredient choice.
