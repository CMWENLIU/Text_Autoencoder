My husband bought this donut mix for me to try with our mini donut maker.  We had been using recipes for our donut batter and thought we'd try something different. Unfortunately, the donuts we made with this mix were disgusting.  The texture was okay, but the taste was artificial and left a bad aftertaste.  The chocolate was fake and chemically, the frosting being even worse than the donut itself.  We'll stick to making our own batter and using real ingredients.
