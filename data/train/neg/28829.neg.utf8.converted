Use this stuff for cycling. It's hard to explain, but when you've burnt 5,000 calories in a day sweating under the hot sun, strange things sound good, and to a lot of cyclists, some nice strong Tang sounds really, really good. Sure, there's Gatorade mix and Naan, but a strong orangy citrus punch packs killer refreshment. But... what the hell!?! Artificially sweetened? That's not good for cycling *or* for kids. What's with the obsession with trying to turn every drink into "Shasta"? We hate Shasta. We're not skinny blonde bimbos trying to look cool on the beach and hook up with Mr. Moneybags. If the market has spoken and people have declared they wanted anything, it's good, old fashioned sugar. Not HFCS. Not sucralose. Not Nutrasweet. Not friggin' Sacrin. Sugar.
