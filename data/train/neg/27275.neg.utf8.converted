It works for just for about two or so weeks. I followed instructions to the T and actually double applied it just for safe measure since I was going away for two weeks. Well, after coming back, I had over 10 new large holes. It puts crop circles to shame. I turned to an animal control expert and they said, the problem I had, the tunnels are too deep. The product only works if the tunnels are close the surface. Anything greater than 2-4" is useless.
