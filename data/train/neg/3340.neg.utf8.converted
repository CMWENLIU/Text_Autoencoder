Lavazza Qualita Oro (Gold Quality) USED to be better, more authentic, more robust, more pronounced, more reliable as one of the traditional Italian roasts from Italy.<br /><br />In both a classic espresso, and when making a latte or a cappuccino, this label was an old reliable.  I found my recent purchase to be a huge disappointment, lacking in aroma but more so, a weak, flat and downright dull cup of coffee.  I do not know what has been done to lessen the quality, but I now regret not spending a few more dollars and getting something much more enjoyable, such as Illy.<br /><br />Be aware that as a grocery item, Amazon will not accept a purchase such as this for returns.<br /><br />Very disappointing.
