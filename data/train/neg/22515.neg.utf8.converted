My son doesn't like peas.  I've tried feeding him the Gerber Organic peas and he dodges the spoon.  So since all of sprouts food is good, I thought - hey, I'm sure Tyler Florence's peas are better than Gerber.  Boy was I wrong!  It started when I first opened the bag - it smells absolutely horrible and the color is a yucky brownish green.  So I warmed it up and sampled it before giving to my son.  OMG, I almost had to wipe it off of my tounge.  It is really really bad, and that is about the kindest thing I can say about this pea/greenbean/mint mix.  I tried to give it to my son and his reaction was as bad as mine.  I just coulnd't force feed him somethign I couldn't stomach myself.  So far all other Sprout flavors are 5 stars, but leave this one on the shelf - - - it is BAD!
