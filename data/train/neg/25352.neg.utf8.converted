We have been using the Dynamic Health Organic Goji Gold Juice for a few years now (purchased elsewhere). We saw that it was a lot cheaper if we purchased thorough Amazon.com and used Autoship. So we have received 3 shipments so far but 2 of the 3 shipments were "Spoiled". I felt like I drank poison! It tasted (and smelled) like Vinegar! This is a storage issue, I am certain. If this juice is not stored at the proper temperature it certainly will spoil.<br /><br />I am going back to Vitacost.com which is a few $$ more in cost, but for over a year, I NEVER received "spoiled" product from them. Buyer Beware...it's not all about the cost when you are putting it in your body!
