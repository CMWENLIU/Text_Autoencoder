I absolutely love this cat food. Since my cats have been on it the change in their coats is remarkable.  They also leave way less solids in the cat box since there is no corn in it.  It is great for cats with urinary tract issues as well.  My complaint is the price they have listed....RIDICULOUS!  At a local pet store I pay $35 for the 12 pound bag and even Petco, which is listed in the ad has it cheaper.
