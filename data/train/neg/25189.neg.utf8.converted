I buy all my high end coffee on amazon. I have had great luck for years with organic and decaf whole bean coffee. When this came, it smelled wierd and we brewed and also tried expresso. This stuff is rank. Also, it is worth stating, it is near the exp. date. Amazon sent me more without asking if I wanted a refund, and it is bad too. I am going to ask for my money back. I can not afford to buy expensive organic coffee that is not drinkable. Please consider my review before wasting your money on this stuff
