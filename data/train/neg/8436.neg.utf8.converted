Pam spray is incredibly fast and easy to use, but at temperatures above 350F, it burns on and leaves a layer of sticky orange mess which is a pain and a half to scrub off.  On a stainless or aluminum pan, steel wool or a magic eraser will remove it with considerable elbow grease.  On nonstick surfaces, you can't remove the burned-on Pam without scrubbing off the delicate nonstick layer.  The burned-on Pam will also wreck the ability of the nonstick coating to release foods.  Of course, if you use spray every time, you won't notice this until you try frying an egg without it.<br /><br />The cause of the problem is soy lecithin, which professional-grade pan sprays do not use.  I have switched over to the Bakers and Chefs (Sam's Club store brand) baking spray, and have never had a problem since.  As an additional plus, it costs half as much!
