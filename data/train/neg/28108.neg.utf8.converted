Having first purchased these about a year ago, they were fantastic for all my poppy seed needs. They were raw, dirty, unwashed, and tasty. However, this has not been the case as of recently. The seeds were dry, flavorless compared to their predecessors, and appear to have been rinsed of flavor already. Also, some times they sent me something different than frontier seeds, an apparently common complaint on here. Overall, NFPST.
