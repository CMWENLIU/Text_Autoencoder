I think this product listing is clear-enough - Both the title and the product image read "6-pack." The delivery arrived at my door in a box large enough to fit a microwave oven. I open it and found layers and layers of wrapping - half of my box was filled with bubble wrap and plastic cushion bags. Inside several meters of bubble wrap was - ONE JAR of Alfredo sauce. Not only do I feel cheated from not receiving what I ordered and paid for, but I am absolutely astounded by the environmentally-unfriendly product packaging. There was no invoice with my order, simply an advertisement for another of VitaCost's products (you can be sure I will not buy it). Needless to say, I'm not feeling too happy with the product nor the company right now.
