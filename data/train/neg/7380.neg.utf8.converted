I would say I am a professional coffee drinker.  I have been grinding my own beans for over 30 years.  I like strong dark coffee.  At Starbucks I usually order 1/2 cup of regular coffee spiked with a double shot of espresso.  That being said this product was a huge disappointment.  I don't doubt the quality of the beans they used.  The beans looked like they were of excellent quality.  My complaint is with the roast.  This was supposed to be an Dark Espresso roast and clearly it was not.  I think this company needs to re-evaluate there roasting quality control.  There finished product was light in color and coffee brewed from confirmed this.  I tried several different methods of making coffee.  I doubled the mount of coffee used per cup, I doubled up the filters.  The coffee roast was not a Espresso Roast plain and simple.  I have been disappointed with the whole bean coffee I have been buying at my local market and was looking to improve on what they sold.  This coffee did not even reach that goal.  I know all this sounds very critical and it is also my honest opinion!
