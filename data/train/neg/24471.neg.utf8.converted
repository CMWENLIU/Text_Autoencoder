I am a long time lover of Celestial Seasons tea, and loved Raspberry Gardens Green Tea until this shipment.  They changed the formula of this tea and their other fruit flavored green tea to taste more like green tea.  Doesn't make sense to me, the reason people buy flavored teas is for the flavor.  I love the benefits of green tea but not so crazy about the flavor so I tried and purchased several green tea brands and flavors.  I spoke with Celestial Seasons and they decided to change the blend to make it more of a green tea flavor.  If that is what we want we would just purchase their green tea with no flavor blends.  Very disappointing.
