I buy this tea often (it is very good) and am aware of three quantities it is sold in: 120 gm (0.25 lb), 227 gm (0.5 lb), 454 gram (1 lb). The description of this item says 1.5 lbs which I have never seen before, so thought it was a typo and was probably 0.5 lb. This was substantiated by another reviewer's experience where they received 0.5 lb instead of 1.5 lbs.  The price for 0.5 lb was a good, not great, but I still opted to buy a quantity of two 0.5 lb tins instead of one 1.0 lb tin from another Amazon vendor. My rational? The price was nearly the same $8.50 for each 0.5 lb tin from this vendor or 17.50 for one 1 lb tin from another vendor. I thought having two tins would preserve the freshness of my 1 lb total Jasmine Tea for a longer time. How surprised was I when this item arrived in the even smaller quantity of 120 grams (1/4 lb). I tried to return it, but the I got stuck in an Amazon do loop. After filling out the return form I was given the message that this product required special handling and must be returned through customer service (link provided).  I clicked the link, filled out the form, but at the end it referred me back to the return processing center (link provided). I clicked the link and it took me back to where I started. I've already proved I'm gullible so it's not unexpected that I thought that some switch was now flipped by the visit to the customer service area that would allow me to use the return processing center... nope. It again required customer service involvement.  I decided not to waste any more time and wrote this review instead.  I'll drink the tea and enjoy it, but I paid more than I needed to. Oh yeah, the packaging was terrible too.
