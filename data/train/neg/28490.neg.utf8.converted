I see others enjoy this tea.  Perhaps I received stale tea?  The packaging is poor.<br /><br />I just had my first cup and will throw the rest of the box out.  The tea has a flat taste and no aroma. An oolong should have a little smokey, little spicy, interesting and aromatic taste.  Very disappointed in this tea.
