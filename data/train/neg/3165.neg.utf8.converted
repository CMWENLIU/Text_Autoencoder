While these arrived fresh, freshness isn't the only hallmark of a quality product.  You can get the same results with a good food processor (i.e. a Kitchen Aid). This is NOT a fine, even grind.  If I sift the product, I find a lot of chunks.  I want a fine EVEN grind when using nut meal/flour (the terms are used interchangeably in the industry) as the main or only flour in my baked goods.<br /><br />Since this brand is easy to find in many supermarkets, I do recommend it for some uses.  It's good for folks who don't do mail order, those non-GF cooks looking to lower the carb count of their bread coatings, and those looking for an easy GF or a no-carb "breading" option, but only when a coarse coating is suitable. For instance I like fine coatings if I'm going to "pan fry" a white/light flesh fish fillet.<br /><br />When used as the main or only flour for baking, the batter will look lumpy and the finished product will taste a bit gritty. It won't perform well in some recipes because the chunkier nature of the grind will affect the way the batter handles moisture, which could result in a dense rather than light texture.  It could also yield products that fall severely upon cooling.<br /><br />In order words, disappointing outcomes might not be the recipe or your culinary technique, it could be your choice in ingredients!
