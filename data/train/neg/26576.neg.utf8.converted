I'm not trying to offend anyone, but this soda is definitely an aquired taste!  I just had my first bottle, as I was drawn in by the amazing packaging and love for anything Italian.  Ugh!  I swear I threw up in my mouth.  Stay away from this if you cannot tolerate the smell or taste of vomit.  Heard it tastes better with bitters in it, but I cannot stomach another sip.
