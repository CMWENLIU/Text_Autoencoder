My own fault for not reading the ingredients - but the marketing info on this product is extremely misleading.<br /><br />Basically, it's a $10 bag of blueberry candy. High Fructose Corn Syrup is the second ingredient - oil and flavoring also added. I don't have anything against candy but this stuff left my teeth tingling for hours after I ate it - I actually had to brush my teeth twice. This product should not be in the natural and organic category - don't waste your money.
