I ordered and received 2 bags of belly flops thinking that I would get a good variety. I was so disappointed!! I got 2 bags of an identical mixture - 60% cappucino, 35% french vanilla and the other 5% was sour grape. It was a waste of money and wouldn't be interested in ordering Belly Flops again. The advertisement for Belly Flops suggest you'll get a good variety, however, the opposite is true.
