Manhood Tea claims to contain the herb or made of broomrape (cistanchis herba)(Rou Cong Rong- supports the kidneys) which it does not contain!  It's described as having made of broomrape (cistanchis herba) in it but the side of the box doesn't list it and I called Health King three years ago to ask why they no longer have the broomrape (cistanchis herba) in the tea and they said broomrape is an endangered plant species and by law they cannot put it in Manhood Tea so I asked them why they continue to advertise that Manhood Tea contains broomrape and they wouldn't give me an answer.<br /><br />One is better off buying another product like the single herb Panax Ginseng which helps all of the body as an adaptogen verses not really knowing what Health King puts in their tea as they would not give me a list of ingredients by percentage so this makes me think that many of the other herbs listed in Manhood Tea may also not be in it and it's just more false advertisement.  This is a low down trick the company plays and I'd think some lawyer would want to make some money off from false advertisement and someone probably will in the future.
