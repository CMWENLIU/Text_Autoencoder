Oh am I absolutely heartbroken that these are so terrible.  I thought from the reviews - so many, that these would be different than all the other natural, allergy free, gluten free, wheat free blah blah blah that I've tried.  When there's one or two 5 star/4 star on this kind of product I don't order it because I chalk it up to either people who never enjoyed "fully loaded food" but have always been limited in diet and so in comparison to the other choices, they probably are good - or people like some I know who really don't care about taste, as long as it says the right thing on the package, they think it's great.  Me, I've been modifying my diet relatively recently (a few years) due to severe allergies that literally make me feel like I might not recover from the reaction to some foods I have always eaten.  Everything I eat since this started is like a cross your fingers and hope it's ok, pray while I suffer through a reaction and be thrilled when it's over, or add to the list of food I can still eat and do the "I can eat it " dance. Certain preservatives are a huge culprit but so are other things so it's always a test.  I thought maybe I found one of those nothing bad in it foods that I could tolerate and would taste good.  These are terrible -I won't know until tomorrow if I can  tolerate them but it doesn't matter, I didn't even want to finish the first cookie.  They deserve a star for being soft-that's rare in low allergen foods.  But they don't taste anything like a snickerdoodle, they taste like a day old bran muffin with cinnamon on top and you can absolutely tell that they are "nothing in it" food - if not while eating it (which is obvious to me) the after taste is an absolute giveaway, just like all the rest.  The only decent thing beyond soft is a little cinnamon taste but that can't overcome the non-sweet sweeteners that curse all allergy free products in my opinion and nothing can help the grainy texture.  I'm truly heartbroken. I want a DECENT sweet that is safe! These are so grainy, cakelike but dry - not like a glass of milk could cure it dry - just grainy dry - must be the flaxseed. It's better than some products I've tried but not edible-at least not as long as I can eat other foods.  My experience with allergy free food has not been the greatest so I try everything I can and some foods that are not free of everything are tolerated while some foods that are everything free can still give me a reaction, just less likely so I'd rather have low risk experimental food-it's just such a bummer when they aren't any good.  I envy all of you who can enjoy them, I wish I could but the taste, the aftertaste and the texture are three strikes and just too much for me.
