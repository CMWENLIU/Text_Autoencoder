I was under the impression that this cake had a creamy pudding filling but I was wrong. I ate only 5 pieces since that is how much were in there, the picture for this product is not accurate because there is no 6 pieces. The taste is like twinkies dipped in candle wax. Do not buy this horrible thing.
