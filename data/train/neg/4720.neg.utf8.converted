A snickers is a snickers, not much to say about it.<br />However, the expiration date is for three Months from now which tells me that these snickers have been sitting in the warehouse for many Months already.<br />When I bite into the snickers it is quite obvious that this candy is not fresh at all...(ex: the caramel is not chewy, the chocolate flakes off into pieces when I bite into it telling me it is stale, etc.)<br /><br />I have been shopping on line for well over 10 years due to my being disabled, and I don't drive so I do almost all of my shopping on line, including, most of my food.<br />This has been the slowest shipping I've ever experienced with a seller...<br />So, let's see, I have very slow shipping from the seller, add to that the snickers are almost out of date and very stale, (in fact  I am going to toss them into the trash), I am left with a very terrible experience with this seller...what a rip....seller must be judeo/christian as money seems to be the bottom line!<br /><br />So needless to say I'll never, ever use this seller again, I would rather go without!<br /><br />Edit: problem is NOT with Amazon, I love shopping on Amazon, the problem is with D+J.<br />Amazon issued a refund for the stale candy....Amazon is the best!
