Since I haven't tasted the product in the packets the rating may be misleading. This is a comment about the choice of packets over canisters. The coffee itself is a wonderful (and, when purchased in the canisters, AFFORDABLE) treat. It isn't bitter or have an after taste like many instant coffees do.<br /><br />I was given a sample of the plain decaf packets when I made another purchase. They are a mess to open at your desk and get sticky trapping coffee as you are pouring them into a cup of hot water. No - Nestles - I don't think I should have to run the around the building with a cup full of instant coffee particles so don't even go there. I use a tablespoon of coffee. Bottom line is using packets will be a pain and very expensive.<br /><br />Perhaps if enough of us complain Nescafe will bring the canisters back. If you agree send Nescafe a message. I don't know if Amazon allows pasting other's web links but it is found by typing "Nescafe coffee" on a search engine.
