I had high hopes for this product after reading so many great reviews.  I purchased this for my 9yr who really needed the extra fiber.  Who doesn't like chocolate, right?  I knew as soon as I opened it I would probably have a challenge on my hands.  Although it did smell of chocolate, it was rather overwhelmed by a 'vitamin-supplement' kind of smell.  Made a smoothie with one of the recommended recipes and after one sip, she refused to drink it.  (she's not even a picky eater)<br />I thought it was only ok, but one of those kind of things you might shiver down when you are on a diet.  In desperation, I tried 'doctoring' it with Hershey's syrup - no dice.  Then I even dumped in chocolate icecream - now, no nutritional value and no amount of cajoling or threats could make her drink it.  Like I said, I had high hopes... but this just did not work for us.
