Very dissatisfied with the arrival of the truffettes because they were melted to a liquid form, they should have been shipped in a cool container or dry ice.  I did not appreciate them nor was able to enjoy them.  If they were to be in a ball shape with cocoa powder dusted around them and arrived melted away to a liquid texture, how can you taste the dusted with cocoa powder that they advertise?  Will never order them again!
