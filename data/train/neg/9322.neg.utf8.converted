I almost hate to say it, but I really love this product. But Nestl&eacute; doesn't seem to care about what its customers want.  They care more about the higher profit margin that is generated by the new 20-pack box.  (Today's 20 cup of packets - $3.39, yesterday's canister used to get about 100 cups for $5.29 in my area.  I guess this is the way of the corporate world these days - just look at AIG and other lending agencies.<br /><br />Nestl&eacute; - please bring back the canisters...
