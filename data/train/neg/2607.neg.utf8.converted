I have to say after getting two tins of these New Recipe Spearmints, I will not be buying Altoids anymore. I cannot believe you went from Natural Oil of Spearmint to "Natural and Artificial Flavors". I cannot stand this new flavor and Callard & Bowser you have lost me unless you bring back the "The Original Celebrated" Spearmint recipe. The new flavor is aweful and bites back.<br /><br />This is very sad. I hope you wake up and realize the All Natural was the way it was meant to be. Leave the original recipe alone!
