I've had a goldendoodle puppy for about two months (the dog is 4 months old).  The first 6 weeks after I used this product I had no problems.  The past two weeks, hoewever have been tough.  After ruling out a possible infection, I determined that the this product was causing diarrhea to my dog.  When reading the nutirent information, this kibble is very rich in protein and fat.  I think my dog is stating to change and the food is no longer agreeing with him.
