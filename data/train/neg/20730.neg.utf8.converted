I have been trying to use several kind of instant Korean ginseng tea and this one is the worst. It's lacking flavor, insipid, not having or showing good taste like some of the others that I tried before such as instant wild american ginseng tea..For a cup of water, you have to use at least 2 bags of tea to encrease a bit of taste.<br />This product is cheap so no wonder why it is not tasting good as I expect.  It is a waste of money
