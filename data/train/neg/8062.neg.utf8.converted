I read the reviews before purchasing this product and purchased it anyway because I know every person is different. Unfortunately this did nothing for my dark circles. It is a great lotion: it isn't too heavy, lasts all day and isn't sticky like some eye creams. I do not find the smell overpowering nor do I mind it; I really don't know how to describe it but "cookies" seems to fit. I use it daily but basically all it is at this point is a lotion I'm trying to use up. I won't purchase it again.
