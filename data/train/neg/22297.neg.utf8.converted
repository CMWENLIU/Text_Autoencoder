I was looking forward to trying these crackers but when they arrived, I found that the product contains sunflower oil, which is off-limits for my very allergic son. At the time of ordering them, the product info indicated safflower oil, so beware if that is a concern for you. Besides the mislabeling, which may not matter for most people, the crackers were totally broken due to inadequate packaging. I can't comment on how they taste since I threw them away.
