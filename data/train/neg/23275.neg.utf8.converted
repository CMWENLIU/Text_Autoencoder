Not only was it not moist, this product wasn't even cake! Rather I found myself confronted with an odd powdery substance which had very little flavor at all, even when mixed with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00032G1S0">Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz</a>. Fortunately through Amazon.com I can sell my slightly used copy to what will most certainly be some other very unsatisfied customer.
