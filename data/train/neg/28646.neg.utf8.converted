The fish are quite big, about 3 in the can.<br />The vertebrae  are big enough to pop when you bite into them, a little unpleasant...<br />Lots of thin sauce, which is not very spicy.<br /><br />I was hoping for a tin that was ready to eat, but for me these need some more prep work, cleaning the spine out and adding more sauce.
