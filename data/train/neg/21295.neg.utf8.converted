Amazon sent them with 'ice' packs, very heavy ones, placed ON TOP of the boxes of delicate chocolates!!<br /><br />They were not only crushed, but the styrofoam was so thin that the ice packs completely melted and were useless by the time they got here, even though I brought them inside the minute they arrived.<br /><br />The boxes of chocolate were crushed.<br /><br />If it's over 75 degrees where you are, don't bother to order them. They're not returnable.
