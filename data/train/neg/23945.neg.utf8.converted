I really wanted to like this water. I'm a huge fan of RHONJ and wanted to support the Manzo/Laurito cause. I will first say that I had to mentally prepare myself beforehand. I imagined it being muddy water or tainted (I may just be weird like that). I made the mistake of smelling it before i took my initial sip, BIG mistake. It smells like an old penny that has been at the bottom of your purse. So, I grinned and took a sip. It has a thick and oddly slimy consistency. It doesn't even TASTE like water. I don't know what it tastes like, but it's not water.<br /><br />Overall, I would rate it a half a star if I could. Just horrible and quite creepy.
