While Earth's Best produces great organic products for kids, these use some but not all organic ingredients. All Earth's Best products that are organic will have that word below their logo, this does not. We were disappointed to see these marketed as organic on this website but then noticed the legal disclaimer that Amazon will not be held responsible if the information on the site does not accurately describe the product. If you are looking for good, healthy cereal bars for kids, these are an excellent choice. But if you want a 100% organic cereal bar, keep shopping.
