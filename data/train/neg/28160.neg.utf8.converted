I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 83 year old mother-in-law.  I thought it would be a fun, different gift.  It was definately different - the plant was dead within a week.  She didn't tell me until a few weeks later..she didn't want to hurt my feelings.  I was extremely disappointed when she told me about the plant.
