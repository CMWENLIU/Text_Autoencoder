I can't possibly review the quality of the product.  When it arrived, the packaging was so horrid that the candy bars had melted into a gooey mess and were inedible.  When I contacted the seller, I was told it was my responsibility to be aware of warm weather and request special packaging.  And that's the response from a company that ships out of Las Vegas Nevada, which is hardly a temperate climate itself in the summer!  In all my years of dealing with online purchases, that had to be about the worst customer service I've ever received.  I won't be ordering from them again anytime soon.
