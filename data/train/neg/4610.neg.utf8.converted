I checked several sites trying to find the ingredient list for this product before I purchased it, but couldn't find it.  Unfortunately this product contains many artificial ingredients and aspartame!  We made drinks with this once (my husband made them) before we read the ingredients.  The taste was pretty good, but left that aspartame aftertaste in our mouths.  If you don't care about your health or putting chemicals in your body, then this would be a good product for you.  Wish I could find a more wholesome substitution.
