One must be really careful buying some things (like cat food) on the Internet.  All of my past reviews for products on Amazon have been positive, but this one defies logic.  The food is wonderful and we have used it at our animal rescue for over eight years now.  We usually buy 4 to 6 bags at a time.  A month or so ago Amazon raised their price for it from $15.59 a bag to $24.44.  Amazon still sells the same around $17 a bag through other vendors (such as Petco) but then you get socked with high shipping charges and sales taxes.  I realize that, generally, prices for products tend to increase over time, but this price increase seems particularly onerous, especially when one can obtain the product from other providers for aorund $16 with free postage.
