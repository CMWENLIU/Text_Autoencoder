This pre-ground coffee's roast date was two months old when it arrived. It tasted stale, nothing like the rich, fresh taste of the beans I'd purchased at the coffee bar in Venice Beach. I see another reviewer complained about the same thing. What's up Intelligentsia, using mail order to "move" your older product??  Well, I won't be duped twice, I can tell ya that! :(((
