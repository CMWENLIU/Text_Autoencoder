I agree with the woman from Arizona: Starbuck's Espresso Roast is burned and bitter. I already knew this but, like her, purchased a bag of whole beans when I ran out of my favorite (Black Cat from Intellegentsia). Starbucks beans were burned (black and oily) and the Starbucks espresso from my Expobar was terrible (virtually no crema, bitter, sour.) I can not believe Starbucks gets away selling this crud. Anyway, shipment of Black Cat came in a few days later and the difference is night and day. If you have a good machine and you are using Starbucks in it, then do yourself a favor. Seek out truly good coffee and give it a try.
