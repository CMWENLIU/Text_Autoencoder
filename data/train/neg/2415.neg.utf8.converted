Generally I don't buy candy, not even in bulk. So i decided to save some money by buying these candies which are a COMMODITY, that means, same brands that ALL retailers sell all over the country!!!!!! Then I bought a couple of bags here .....THEN yesterday  I saw the same chocolates at a third cost of these prices!!!!!!!!!!! WALMART WILL SELL YOU A BAG OF 95 CANDIES, THE EXACT SAME BRANDS AT $8 !!!!!!!!!!!  I PAID HERE $25 FOR A BAG OF 150, YOU DO THE MATH !!!! THE SAME CANDIES AT A PRICE WHICH IS A THIRD BELOW THAT!!! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY AT WALMART OR PUBLIX OR WINN DIXIE ....THIS IS THE HALLOWEEN RIPP OFF ...
