This decaf iced-tea mix reminds me of Kool-Aid.  In order to make it taste like something, it tastes like a drink mix--too sweet and not very much like tea.  It's one of those products that people buy because of clever marketing -- green tea, decaf, low calorie, honey and Acai-- what could be better?  Actually none of it is good.  Lots of artificial sweeteners, no real honey to speak of, and an overly sweet taste.  Not healthy.  Not that great.
