So after reading all the reviews I had really high hopes for this meal. To my shock and true disappointment this meal was terrible. The salmon tasted like vomit and the crackers were flavorless. The Edamame were very dry and tasted like raw black eyed peas. The only decent thing in the meal was the fruit and nut mix which I mixed with Edamame to make those edible. I'm in Afghan and was looking for a healthy quick lunch. What I got was an overpriced disappointment. The chocolate wasn't even very good.
