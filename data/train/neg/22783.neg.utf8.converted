Arrived in the professionally packaged brown paper bag. One item was broken.<br />Poor variety with 6 of the same item of a few flavors, and obvious trying<br />to get rid of other seasonal flavors. One item slit down the side with coffee<br />in the bag, and when contacting this seller, told me to take it up with Amazon.<br /><br />Never again with this shipper. Amazon should be more careful on who they share there<br />name with.
