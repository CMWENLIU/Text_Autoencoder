When I saw this particular bag of coffee pop up so highly in the search results, and saw the high reviews, I hesitated a moment due to its high price.  But then I decided to go for it, since I'm always up for trying a new coffee, regardless of price, if it's really something spectacular.<br /><br />I received the coffee promptly, and loaded the beans into my high-end burr grinder.  I then brewed the grounds in a french press.  I expected something pretty amazing, or at least an above-average coffee.  Unfortunately, I found neither in this bag.<br /><br />Though I hate to say it, I'd put this coffee on par with Folgers, or some other budget American brand.  It completely lacks flavor...  It's very mild across the whole spectrum, and even lacks body/mouthfeel.  Simply put, it tastes about like cheap diner coffee that's been sitting on a burner for a while.  Really, really disappointing.<br /><br />The only reason I can come up with for the high price is that the quantity is quite high; the bag is enormous (2.2 pounds).  Unfortunately, the quality is exponentially lower.  It's a shame, too; given that British Columbia is so close to Seattle (a place that prides itself on excellent coffee), I expected this to be a great one.  Unless you really need a (giant) cool looking coffee bag design, I'd avoid this one.
