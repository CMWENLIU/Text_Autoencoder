Like so many other reviews, I must add my displeasure to the list. The cups are certainly not what I am used to using and I have used just about every brand out there. Mine either fall apart or don't brew. I don't recommend them at any price.<br /><br />UPDATE: After leaving the above review, the company rep made a big deal out of working on things to fix this issue and most importantly promised to fulfil replacement of the bad cups. It has been a month now for those replacement cups, doubt I will ever see them. No response to emails either. I still stand on what I said, "I don't recommend them at any price."
