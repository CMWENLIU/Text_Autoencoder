I bought the Kettle Corn variety Pop-Up Bowl. The first bag I tried to pop totally burned within 12 seconds (with smoke pouring out of the microwave), well before it was even fully popped, and the second bag, which I set on a lower temperature (even though it specifically says to use HIGH) actually caught on fire! Avoid this fire trap product at all costs. To avoid throwing all the rest of the bags out, I settled for cutting the bags open, scraping the contents into a heavy, lidded-skillet, and cooking it old-school. Those came out fine, as there's nothing the matter with the popcorn, just the packaging. So, unless you have a desire to destroy a perfectly good microwave, and possibly burn down your house in the process, avoid this packaging at all costs. Mark my words, this is going to come up in the future. The Orville Redenbacher brand is going to see lawsuits for this one! I wanted to give it ZERO STARS, but the program wouldn't let me! Be forewarned!
