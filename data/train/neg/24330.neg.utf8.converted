About a year ago I decided to put my dog on a better food as she was (at the time) 11 yeas old and I want her to live the longest, healthiest life possible, much like everyone else, as she is not just a pet to me but also a daughter. I stopped at my local "mom & pop" pet food store and asked some questions. I knew little about the better brands as she's always been on grocery store brands. I was directed toward Orijen as it is one of the better brands out there, it's very high in protein, you can understand all of the ingredients and it's "so healthy, a human could eat it". Of course I bought it, and my dog loved it. Little did I know how damaging the food was to her, as quite honestly, she exhibited no symptoms. Back in January my dog had to be put in the ICU due to an accident. It was during that stay where the vet noticed how high her liver levels were. Her alkaline & phosphatase as well as her calcium levels in the kidneys were all very high as well. The vet put her on 3 different liver support medicines and we had to follow up every month with more blood work to reassess the situation. After the 3rd month, the vet was suspicious that cancer was present. When I hear that, I immediately did some research on the food. It was then that I noticed how high the protein content is and what that much protein could do to a body. I presented my research and concerns to the vet, who wasn't as convinced as I was. After the 4th blood draw, and still no changes, we made the mutual decision to wean her off of Orijen and on to Science Diet (although just about any other brand would have worked too). A month later after the switch, and my dog was presented with a clean bill of health. Her alkaline & phosphatase levels are still slightly elevated, but I'm told there is nothing to worry about now. We concluded it was the food that was damaging and slowly killing her, as she was deemed healthy at the start of feeding her the food, A few months prior to all of this, she went though a full work up in order to get her teeth cleaned.<br /><br />I write this not to slander Orijen, I only want to educate others on my own personal experience. While it happened to my dog, that doesn't mean it will effect all dogs the same. Just please keep in mind, my dog showed no symptoms while on the food that anything was wrong. If it weren't for her stay in the hospital, we never would have known how much damage this food was causing her. If your dog is presently on this food, maybe a precautionary blood draw at their next exam would be worth your while.
