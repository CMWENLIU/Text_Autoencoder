First I want to say that this company has fabulous customer service!  My item was originally lost/delayed in the mail due to no fault of the seller's.  They were quick to respond to my concern, and sent another item to ensure that the sprinkles would make it in time for my daughter's birthday.  But here is my concern (and it is a big one!) - the sprinkles came in an unsealed, unlabeled jar that just had a slip of paper with the ingredients hastily scotch taped to the bottle.  I now see that this was also the case with another reviewer's item.  I will not be willing to use these sprinkles - even though they are exactly what I was expecting and wanted - because I have no idea where they came from or who has had contact with them!  I am not willing to give these to a group of toddlers and their parents.  So basically I paid for something that I will not be using.  And if I attempt to return them to the seller, will they just resell them to another person without knowing if I could have opened the item and touched them?  This is just nasty.  I am very disappointed, especially since it is too late to order something similar to this for my daughter's party.
