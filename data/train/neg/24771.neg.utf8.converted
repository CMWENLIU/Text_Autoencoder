Ordered with another chocolate product which was fine.  The Monds looked like they had bugs or were stale, yuck. I am waiting for he replacement box and will update review then, customer service was EXCELLENT as always.  I wish I could order everything through them! Update: They sent me a replacement which had bugs all through it!!!  They haven't even pulled these!!!
