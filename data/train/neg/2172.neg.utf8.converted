This product does not work on cats and skunks.  Save your money.  I gave it one star because you can't give it minus five stars<br /><br />Cats were sleeping under a bush in my yard on hot afternoons.  I applied a lot of granular Critter Ridder.  It had absolutely no effect on the cats.  I finally removed the bush.  I have a skunk who digs a hole under my fence every night to get into my yard.  I applied a thick layer of the product on his "digging area".  He dug right through it the first night.  I applied more Critter Ridder.  He dug through it again.  He still visits nightly.
