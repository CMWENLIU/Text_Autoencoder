I used to love this mayo and ordered it on shop and save and got it twice a year. The last two shipments have been a disappointment. It now has a strong soybean oil taste. I don't know what in the process has changed. I thought it might had been only the one shipment but the last batch tasted off as well.  I no longer order this.
