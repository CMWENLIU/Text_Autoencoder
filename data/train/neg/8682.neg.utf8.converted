It doesn't taste like traditional Huy Fong Sriricha it tastes like a thicker version of Crystal's Hot Sauce.  It leaves a weird, coated after taste on your tongue and almost tastes a little chemically?  I got an order of 6 bottle, I threw every single bottle away today after putting some of it on my hamburger helper,  it ruined the meal entirely!  My biggest mistake to date on Amazon was buying this sauce, I have no idea how it got so many 5 star reviews.  THIS.  IS.  NOT.  SRIRICHA.
