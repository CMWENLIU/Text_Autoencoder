Over the last year we've tried to up our "coffee cred" at work. I purchased an Aeropress here on Amazon and we've been making amazing coffee ever since. The problem is it takes a little bit of time and some mornings you are running late for meetings and need something fast. We've started experimenting with Kcups for those quite pick-me-ups. I've tried almost every brand and flavor so far and Brooklyn is by far one of the worst! Terrible quality and taste. Flat and bland coffee. Don't waste your time.
