I love my AeroGarden and was thrilled with the herbs and even happier with the cherry tomatoes.  When I discovered the green bean kit, I couldn't wait to try it.  My five-year old son loves green beans, and I was looking forward to having fresh beans to give to him.  When I planted the green beans, they grew rapidly just like the other kits.  However, the plants just grew and grew.  They became overly bushy and never produced any beans.  I waited and waited for the beans to grow and then finally tossed the plants out and replanted tomatoes.  This kit was very disappointing, and I am hesitant to try it again.
