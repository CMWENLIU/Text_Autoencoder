Tropicana has gone the way of others in reducing the real juice in their product and adding flavor enhancers hidden under the words "Natural Flavors" which means the additions of a vegetable extract called glutamic acid. This extract is bad news for your body. This allows them to add more water and less juice. Buy another brand. The apple juice flavor is weak at best.
