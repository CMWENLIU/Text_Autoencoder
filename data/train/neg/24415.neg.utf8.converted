I was happy to see varieties of Starbucks coffee here in Amazon especially my favorite kind, so I ordered it right away.  However, I underestimated the size although it comes in 3 bags.  But for $27 something, I'd rather buy it directly at Starbucks stores because they are cheaper there.  Otherwise, very good coffee.
