This powder showed promise with the strong recommendations it received on this site.  At first I thought it was just me and that after a while I would get used to the taste.. not so! I've tried every which way to mask the strange hemp flavor and there is nothing out there that makes this hemp powder taste good.  I love that its an Organic Protein Powder from a plant source but when it comes right down to it, it needs to be palatable and this powder simply isn't.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  There are better organic protein powders available then this.. it would be worth it to buy something you can use.. I have half a jar that's useless sitting in my refrigerator since I can't stomach the idea of another shake with that strong taste.<br /><br />Keep looking.
