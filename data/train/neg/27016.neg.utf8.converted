I fed Beneful to my last dog for 13 years and he lived to be almost 14 years old so it obviously isn't going to kill your dog.  But my current dog has really bad skin allergies and the vet said to try switching food first. That was the first time I looked at the ingredients in Beneful and was shocked! Corn is the first ingredient? That's ridiculous. If you can't afford a better food with less junk in it, this food will suffice. But definitely if your dog is prone to allergies like mine don't feed them this food. It isn't healthy at all. Personally, I'm finding it costs just about the same to make my own dog food with natural ingredients and real meat.
