I use well-filtered water and followed the directions to grow herbs and then salad greens.  both have failed.  why?  white fuzz aka fungus/mold.  even tried to pull out any seed casings or seeds that did not sprout to avoid the mold.  kept water levels high at all times.  even added hydrogen peroxide to the reservoir.  failed!!  called support at aerogrow and they said they cant do anything about it except send another seed kit and I should disinfect the system again.  did disinfect with hydrogen peroxide not bleach for my second planting.  very disappointing...salad greens look like they are limp and dying.  roots are becoming brown.  mold is greatly reduced however salad greens look sick and dying.  will try to plant my third set of seeds after using chlorine bleach this time.  very frustrating.  no clear answers.  would not recommend purchasing the aerogrow.  i unfortunately stuck with the pro200.
