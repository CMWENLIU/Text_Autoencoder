Prior to visiting New Orleans I drank the usual national-brand, plastic-jug coffee sold in supermarkets across the country.  After visiting New Orleans and developing a liking for C&C (coffee and chicory) I've tried numerous brands of both medium-dark roast and dark roast C&C.<br /><br />Of the two roasts I found I like the dark roast more (which Cafe du Monde C&C is).  I was excited to try the brew from the coffee stand we visited several times near Jackson Square but was disappointed when I made my first pot of Cafe du Monde C&C.  It has kind of a burnt taste to it (while the French Market City Roast I tried - which is also a dark roast - has kind of a chocolate taste to it).<br /><br />Cafe du Monde may be the preferred brand if you're going to serve your coffee 'au lait' style with 1/2 hot milk (as they do at the actual cafe near Jackson Square) but it's not the best if you're going to have your coffee with just a touch of cream and/or sugar.
