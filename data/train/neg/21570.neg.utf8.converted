I liked the blueberry flavor of these cracker bars, but the cracker itself is somewhat bland and way too crumbly.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good taste like a mini Pop Tart<br />Only 100 calories<br />Zero transfats<br />Convenient size<br /><br />Cons:<br />Expensive packaging that is wasteful<br />Too expensive for what you get<br />Made in Mexico...sad for Quaker<br />Too much sugar (first filling ingredient is high fructose corn syrup)<br />Too many chemicals and additives<br />Crumbling, dry cracker is messy
