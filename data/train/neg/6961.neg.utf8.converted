My cats became violently ill after eating the Instinct Rabbit Dry food. They were throwing up and stopped eating. They had to be force fed and nearly died. After several vet visits they recovered. I wrote a letter to Natures Variety and sent them a sample of the tainted food for testing. I was hoping I could save other cats from getting sick. They replied that they would not do anything until more cats became ill.
