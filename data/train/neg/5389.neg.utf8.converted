dont buy this stuff, the price might seem attractive but I was so pissed when I opened the box and heard the rattling inside the k-cup, its not even packaged correctly, not filled to the top of the kcup and no coffee filter, no coffee grounds, and when using it in the Keurig machine you just get a yellowish colored watery instant coffee, not even the real thing. shame on them! I would give a negative rating if I could, they dont deserve a 1 rating.
