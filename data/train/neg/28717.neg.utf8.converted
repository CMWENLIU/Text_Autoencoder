I bought these for my pregnant wife.  They look pretty and fit nicely in her purse.<br /><br />She had to use one of them for the first time while we were driving today.<br /><br />Within maybe 10-15 seconds of her beginning to vomit, the bags started dripping liquid out of one of the bottom corners.  It dripped all over her lap.<br /><br />The bag only has one purpose: Contain vomit.<br /><br />IT LEAKS AND DOES NOT WORK AS ADVERTISED!!!
