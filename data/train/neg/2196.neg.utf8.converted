I'm not sure why these are labeled as super mini bulbs.  These bulbs are larger than standard incandescent bulbs and will not fit in many of my fixtures.  I suspect amazon has mixed up the bulbs they are selling.  I checked the manufactures website and this model bulb is not the item number that matches the super mini bulbs.  EP2357AE bulbs are listed as 23-Watt Full Spectrum Bulbs.  E2352AK is the product number for 23 Watt Super Mini Bulbs and they are not full spectrum bulbs.  As of the date this review was typed the manufactures website is not showing a Super Mini 23 Watt Full Spectrum Bulb.  I'm returning these.  I also purchased the 15 Watt Super Minis and they are not the correct item either.<br />If you decide to purchase these bulbs you may want to check the manufactures website after you receive the bulbs to make sure you did in fact receive the right item.
