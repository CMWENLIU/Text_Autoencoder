I am rating this as a one because it is not GF. I had a different experience with Barry Farms than the previous person. I called Barry Farms as soon as I received my product. I,too, needed GF. They were extremely friendly and are giving me a full refund. The woman explained to me that their distributor for the GF product stopped producing, and they are trying to resource. They know that they need to change the Amazon picture.
