Horrible coffee, terrible bitter taste and a lingering aftertaste that I can't even describe!  Tried a lot of brands of K-cups and none have ever been so bad.  It's in a class by itself.  I love strong coffee,  and I gave this brand a try.  Guess I'll try another, I'm turned off of Emeril.  No Bam, just bust!
