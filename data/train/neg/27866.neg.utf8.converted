Please read the article. I gave Enfamil formula to my baby thinking it's the best out there, till I heard about GMO presence in Enfamily as well. GMO effects are not known but it is banned in rest of the world except US. FDA has permitted these big corporates to not label about presence of GMO, since these big corporate lobby with thr millions.. It's sad what world has come to, these monsters don't even have conscience of think about millions of baby or future genration they are putting at risk. Please switch to Babys only Organic formula.. it's the best and they have taken care that thr packaging is BPA free too.

A mother has every right to know what she is feeding her little know.. its right to information.<br /><br />[...]
