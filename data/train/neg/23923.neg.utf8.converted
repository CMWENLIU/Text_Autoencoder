i was very suspicious with all the 5 star reviews on such a nasty product, so i looked at the 5 star reviewers pages, & most of them only had one review, blk water. now i would understand a few of those, but seriously, in the first 6 pages of reviews & 13 of the 5 star reviews are from people that have only put a review on BLK! i would not be surprised if those manzo boys were the ones doing it. they did put a lot of work into BLK. too bad the product is gross.<br /><br />these are the "people" that left 5 star reviews for BLK & only had 1 review total: weezy, Cheyenne, kim singleton, Zadora, kat6722, Grant, Konnor, LCG, thedew, Jessie Brogden, Mommyawns, J. Murana, Azureblue.<br /><br />coincidence? i think not.
