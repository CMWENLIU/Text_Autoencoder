I am pretty upset about the recent pricing change on this product. I have been buying this for years and have had this on S&S for sometime.  My S&S was recently cancelled by Amazon at the same time it was suppose to ship (hence i ran out of Olive Oil).  I went on to re-order the product and thought at the time it was cancelled due to Amazon Frustration Free Packaging (yes I should have paid closer attention to the ounces when re-bought)however to my dismay when opening the package today the tins were HALF the size than the old ones.  So basically I am thinking ok - I wont be buying this brand again, I'll have to find a new one. Now I am even more upset as I just came on here to write a review and when I search Zoe Olive Oil - the 1 Liter tins came up - but are no longer on S&S <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0060JNAE8">Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 1 Liter Tins (Pack of 2)</a> and they are 50 cents more than the 25.5 ounce 2 Pack on S&S.  These are basically a rip off now.  I hate to leave a negative product review about something that I like, but this one bothered me so much I felt completed to inform other consumers about the recent changes.
