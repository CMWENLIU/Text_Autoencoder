I won't order these again.  I was pleased to be ordering something that said "sustainable agriculture", but these are not good.  Half the cans are dented.  I'm afraid to eat these unless they are cooked, so cannot use them in salads.  They are not quartered, as near as I can tell, but are in tiny bits, lots of tough outer leaves and all the cans I've used so far are full of extremely mushy, teeny artichoke pieces.  I wish I had even one good thing to say, but I don't.  I've throw out over half of every can I've tried to use so far.
