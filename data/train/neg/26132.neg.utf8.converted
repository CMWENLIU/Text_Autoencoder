Sparkling ICE Black Raspberry Mountain Spring Water would be great if they stayed with the natural ingredients but they add Red Dye #40, Potassium Benzoate (a chemical preservative) and Sucralose (which  makes it super sweet and leaves a funny taste in your mouth). I NEVER would have purchased this item if I had known what they actually put in it. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I won't ever purchase another Sparkling Ice product.
