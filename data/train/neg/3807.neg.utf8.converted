This is not the original Swiss Muesli that made this company famous and I've found that in a lot of the stores in this area this is now the only Familia Swiss Meusli available.  In my opinion, what they've done is an attempt to make a less costly product ( for them that is} by adding large volume puffed type cereals to the mix. This makes for a lighter product , but with the same size box. The original box weighs 32 ounces, compared to 21 ounces for this new product. Unfortunately, this results in an inferior product, both in taste and nutrition. The real original product is still available in a red box , but I fear they might phase it out if they can get people to go for this cheap imitation.
