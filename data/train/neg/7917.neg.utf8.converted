What is this stuff and where did it really come from? The taste of this is so gross it makes me want to puke just thinking about it! What do you do with it? I mixed it into yogurt and just couldn't get past the smell. You should definitely try a sample of this stuff somewhere before you buy it. Now I am stuck with a whole half pound of this stuff and there is no way I am going to be able to use it up. :(
