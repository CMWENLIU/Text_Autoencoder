This flour stinks of Garbanzo beans, and I like Garbanzo beans on any other occasion, but for some reason the smell is so strong when ground, I have learned to read the labels of GF products and if beans are the first ingredient I will not but it.  My guess is some people are more sensitive to it then others, it almost makes me gag when the flour is wet.  I do have friends who don't mind it or don't notice it, but me and my non Celiac boyfriend think it's nasty.  Since we love to bake, I have found that equal parts white rice flour and Tapioca flour with a teaspoon of xanthem gum work great in place of flour.
