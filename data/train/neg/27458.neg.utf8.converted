When I adopted my rescue lab/chow mix, Sammie, the shelter said she was eating Purina One Lamb and Rice. So that is what I kept feeding her without knowing what I know now that I have read this site. But it seemed ok - she had really hard poops sometimes but otherwise seemed great and her coat was soft and shiny, enough so that people commented on it. THEN after the formula change this year, the itching started and the poops became worse (hard more often.) She developed red spots in her ears and a yeast infection in each one.  Then her fur got rough, dusty looking and then started shedding more than anything I'd seen in the 2 years I had her. It seemed like she lost 1/2 her fur! The vets told me this was not likely the new food formula of her same food...well after hundreds of dollars of vet bills and a miserable summer for her all itchy all of the time, I decided to change her food. I picked Halo after talking to a friend who is in to nutrition (people and dogs.) I changed her over slowly - about 9 days. The itching and fur remained a problem...until the day she was only on Halo. Poof! No more itching - that very day no more itching. After a month her fur was shiny and soft but sparce (I'd added Halo's Dreamcoat supplement too.) After 2 months her fur is shinier, softer and more full and lush than ever. Her poops are regular like clockwork and soft - like they never were on Purina One. And she *loves* the food! (I do a mix of canned and kibble.) She has a passion for that food she never had for Purina One - even before the formula change. I wish I'd listened to my instincts and switched the food after the first symptoms! Whatever Purina did to that food is a nightmare.  Read about in on line - you'll see many people have had very bad results since the formula change last summer.
