I was so excited to try these out but the obscene amounts of sugar shocked me out of my delight. Does a nut bar really need 5 different sweeteners? There's the bane of my existence - corn syrup, followed by sugar, evaporated cane juice invert syrup, honey and brown sugar on top of that, excuse me Planters but why are you poisoning us with this? These bars are so sweet that my cavity was singing the day I tried them, I mean blaring pain and the bar itself isn't so spectacular, the nuts are mostly chopped up into random pieces with sweet syrup on top and some sort of bread crumb like stuffing in between.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend these to my worst enemy and I would advise to stay far away from these. Corn syrup is packed into 90% of processed foods; even jarred pickles have this stuff in the sauce they swim in, I feel like a science project when I get anything that isn't raw these days, and this is another bad, shameful product that people will eat for sure and pay for it with their poor health twenty years later. Cheap food is expensive, it makes us sick later, and this is yet another product to add to this problem.<br /><br />- Kasia S.
