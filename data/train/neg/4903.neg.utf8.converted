The american and european (UK, Canada, etc) market products are very different. Heinz messed things up for us americans by replacing genuine sugar and molasses with "high fructose corn syrup" which leaves aslippery gumminess on the tongue and a basically slimy aftertaste. The "other" (UK, Canada)sauce is clean, sharp with distinct flavor layers and a beautiful, long-lasting aftertaste. Sorry. I order my product from Canada for the same cost, and hope Amazon soon offers the "foreign" product.
