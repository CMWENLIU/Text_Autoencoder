I too had severe stomach reaction to these. The flavor is poor, hardly any flavor at all. They are so hard you can chew them w/o risking damage to dental work. I can imagine anyone wanting these.. I gave them all away at work rather than just tossing them in the garbage. DONT WASTE YOU MONEY THEY ARE AWFUL ALL THE WAY AROUND.
