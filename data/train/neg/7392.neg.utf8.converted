I purchased this product along with several other syrups. I have to say, out of all of them I found this one to be the most unimpressive. It tastes way too sweet and does not taste like cream soda. I took a sip then dumped the rest. Aside from the orange soda, the flavors offered by Sodastream are not very tasty at all.
