I saw this on sale and ordered it based on about ~3 positive reviews if I recall right.<br /><br />Now I question those reviews as the taste is like chemicals (to me) and quite honestly would not even finish the first one even given how frugal I am about finishing any food I buy. The remaining ones have went in the garbage.<br /><br />Its good to see other people also bringing down the ratings so people are aware that this certainly is not something many people like. Honestly I have no idea how anyone could score this 4 or five star. It seems impossible to me.<br /><br />I'm sadened I also bought some of the other products on sale from "Kitchen of India" and am going to throw them away with out even tasting them.
