Das Salt fleur de sel is the best of those I've tried. Awesome as finishing salt and a touch on chocolate ice cream can't be beat.<br /><br />Update 5/10/2011:  Amazon will not let me delete the review I wrote in 2010 (it keeps the date) and start over, so all I can do is give this added information.  Since my first purchase, I've tried a few other brands of fleur de sel de Guerande.  Das Salt is the best.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the salt sold by Spice Lab is NOT Das Salt even though he uses a Das image and description & says it is by Das Salt. Seriously, if it ships from The Spice Lab it is NOT Das Salt. What you will get from The Spice Lab is repackaged salt in an unsealed container and a lot of trust-me-trust-me-trust-me crap about how honest the seller is -- from him, of course. No real surprise the seller misrepresents the product -- would you buy it if he advertised it as it is: repackaged salt, who knows how, from who knows where?<br /><br />This section is product reviews, not seller reviews, so buyer beware.  My first review was for Das Salt fleur de sel, not the stuff you will get from The Spice Lab, but you'd never know it.  I guess because Mr. Spice Lab says he is selling Das Salt, the reviews still apply but as noted, he is NOT selling Das Salt.  Some of the reviews here were written for the real deal and not for that you will get from Spice Lab.<br /><br />Update 5/19/2011.  After multiple complaints, it must be that Amazon made Spice Lab take down their falsely advertised product because Amazon is back to selling Das Salt from Das.  The reviews follow the product, not the seller.  I will leave this post as negative in case dear Brett from Spice Lab tries his trickery again. My praise for Das Salt is HIGH.  My low rating is for FAKE Das salt sold by Spice Lab.
