I have used other brands of Maca with no problem.  This one made me very, very sick to my stomach with pain and nausea.  It took me a few weeks to isolate what was making me sick - had a full gastro work-up and everything - that's how sick I was!  Today, after being healthy again for 2 months I tried 1/2 tsp of maca to test and am sick and nauseous.<br /><br />I know many people take maca with no problems.  I only post this so those who get sick will hopefully not struggle as long as I did to figure out what is causing it.
