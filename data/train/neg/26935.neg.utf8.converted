This used to be a reliably consistent product that was like a roughish pate of real ham with some pickle flavors.  I'm not even a pickle fan, and I still used to enjoy this product on occasion over the years.<br /><br />I hadn't bought it for several years, and just recently tried it again.  It is entirely different than it used to be - and it's awful now.<br /><br />Now, it is a can of mushy fat with some flecks of (presumably) ham mixed in.  It is much saltier and less pickle-flavored; actually the pickled ("deviled") flavoring is pretty much gone from the product now.<br /><br />As you can imagine, not only does it taste disgusting, it looks and smells disgusting.<br /><br />If you either have never tried it, or like me, you haven't had this product in a while, I strongly advise buying ONE can only at the grocery store first, before you commit to buying a whole pack of cans.
