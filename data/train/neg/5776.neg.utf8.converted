I purchased Diamond pecans in their shells in December '06 (note, not these, already shelled ones) and discovered AFTER the kids were eating them that they were all rancid.  Be sure and check the dates (if you can, there weren't any on the in-shell nuts) because there's not much worse than ruining whatever you're trying to make with rancid nuts.  I have learned to only purchase pecans from places with dates on the package or where I can smell and taste them!
