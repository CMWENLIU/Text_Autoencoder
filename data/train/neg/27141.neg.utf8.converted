This seller is NOT certified organic as advertised.  I was suspicious of the product and made several phone calls.  "Certified Organic"  must contain an actual label from the agency itself.  The purchased product contained no such label and instead had a description as "Certified Organic".  As much as I would like to believe that this was an oversight, Im afraid from my direct experience with the owner/seller that he was simply preying on the grey area of "Certified Organic". QAI has been informed of this misuse and false advertisement and is taking action.  If you are curious about this product, call the agencies before you decide to buy from this seller.
