Greatly appreciate Amazon carrying this product, as it affords customers the opportunity to evaluate this product.<br /><br />The case arrived without the Dr. Zevia (Dr. Pepper cans).  Ginger root beer had been substituted and doubled.  Unfortunately, I bought this specifically to try the cola, ginger ale, and Dr. pepper equivalents.<br /><br />The grape and orange are the better products, although they have no coloring.<br /><br />Unfortunately, almost all of the soda's have an aftertaste...reminiscent of saccharin in some peoples opinion.<br /><br />Some found the taste to be cloying.  No one found any taste to be fresh, crisp, or refreshing.<br /><br />I had such high hopes for Stevia in soda.<br /><br />Even Canada dry diet ginger ale has more ginger taste than Zevia ginger ale.  Zevia cola did not remind me of any similar cola I have ever had.  In fact, a blind test would have revealed a mildly sweet beverage with no outstanding taste markers and of benign flavor.
