Wow. This has been my favorite creamer for about three years now. I drink 5-6 cups of coffee a morning and may have a few during the day. A 'serving' of this is about two tablespoons for my coffee. I like it white and sweet!<br /><br />So what I've just learned it that I've basically been injesting a lethal dosage of trans fat every single day.<br />1 gram of transfat for every cup of coffee I drink. I had no idea.<br /><br />WAY TO GO FDA!! Wonder what they got paid to make this minor exclusion.<br />Thanks Nestle for expoiting the system. Should be attempted murder.
