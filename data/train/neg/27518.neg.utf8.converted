I also received the shortbread swirls in a crumbled state. The almond ginger cookies arrived fine in the same box and are excelllent. I didn't realize food products could not be returned until I just tried to return them.I wouldn't mind if these were simply broken, but they are crumbs. Pretty expensive bird food! Pamela's are the best Gluten Free cookies I have found, but I guess it is better to buy them at the grocery store for a higher price, than feed a whole case to the birds.I rate the cookies 5 but shipment of them 1.
