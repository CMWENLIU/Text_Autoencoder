The ad for this non returnable item is so misleading.  There is no mention of corn flour being the main ingredient.  I wanted a product made out of  quinoa, not corn.  The price was high enough that I assumed it was  quinoa-based.  Corn flour is the first ingredient and it is possible that there is very little quinoa in it as they don't even list the percentage.  This is very deceptive and I feel cheated.
