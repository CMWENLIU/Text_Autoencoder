I googled Sucralose and found plenty of research to indicate toxicity.<br /><br />I wish Oregon Chai would make a chai which has no sweetener; most people would prefer unsweetened chai these days, wouldn't they?<br /><br />This company's chais are too highly sweetened. This is unnecessary. I have tried them and find them undrinkable.<br /><br />NOTE to potential chai product makers. Make a highly spiced liquid chai which is unsweetened in any way, using only organic or at least natural ingredients. You would sell it.
