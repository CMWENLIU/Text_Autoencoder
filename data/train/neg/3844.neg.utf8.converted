I actually received this gift.  half of it was inedible (processed brie cheese?  seriously?) and the rest was a low-quality product in fancy packaging (honey-roasted peanuts?).  it is totally absurd to pay $50, let alone $20.  if this had been the package of food you paid $5 for as an "in-flight meal" i'd have been disappointed.  you could do *much* better at whole foods with a $20 bill.
