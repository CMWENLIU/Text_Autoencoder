We bought this stuff on occasion (loved it) for quite some time, but now it has changed.  Bought some recently and found it to be very mild and tasteless.  Used almost the whole jar!  Still no flavor.  Thought something was wrong and bought a jar a few months later, someplace else.  Same result.  Won't buy again, have tried another brand (A Taste of Thai brand Curry Paste, available in 4 different flavors), will stick with that.  Liked that this came in a nice sized jar, versus a packet, but without flavor, what's the point?  Hope this is helpful...
