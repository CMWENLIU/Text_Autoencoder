I was very upset when I received this item. I ordered it as a gift to my husband, as this candy is not available in our area. It was shipped in a regular old cardboard box, and I was home to receive the package. Thank goodness I was, because it was 90+ degrees outside, and the candy was already sufficiently melted. He can't even enjoy his favorite candies, as they are melted to the sides of the package. I was not happy to have spent nearly $20 on candy, only to have it arrive in an indigestible condition.<br />With that being said, this candy is delicious in it's true, unmelted, form. It's one of our favorites. However, if we were to ever buy it again, we'll have to go out and search for it, since shipping is apparently a terrible idea.
