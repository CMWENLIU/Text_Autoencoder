When I found the product on Amazon it was Origional Bottle and origional Label from many years ago, and across the page the new label "Perfect Pinch" as you show it. I clicked on the old origional and believed that, that was what I would receive. It was not what I received and I was very saddened to have been deceived.. I received the "Perfect Pinch" which I had seen in stores and tried. It is not even close to the same. The "McCormick Perfect Pinch Origional Chicken Seasoning" is not perfect...much more sage than the origional, totally different taste.<br />The origional was, "McCormicks Fried Chicken or Chicken Fried Seasoning". It was pulled off the market, but came back claiming to be the origional but the name had changed from "McCormicks Fried Chicken Seasoning", to just "McCormicks Chicken Seasoning", but it was okay. Now this "Perfect Pinch" is all wrong. The origional was a perfect seasoning<br />This is a perfect example of "If It Ain't Broke Don't Fix It". I truly regret this has happened when for 15/ 20 yrs or for as long as the origional was out there, I would buy every bottle on the shelf. My entire family and numerous friends lived by it....If you get one thing perfect...you'd think you'd have the sense to leave that "One Thing Alone". Trust me , it was a top seller..I've searched every store front from The Mexican border to Canada, and East Coast to West Coast trying to find the origional.."BIG MISTAKE MCCORMICK"!<br />TLFLP
