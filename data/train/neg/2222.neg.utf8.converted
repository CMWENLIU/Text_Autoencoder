I assumed that, like most natural peanut butters, this would contain peanuts and nothing else. Wrong! After tasting the first sugary bite, I checked the ingredients. Not only sugar, but salt and palm oil! One of the reasons I eat peanut butter is that the real kind has no cholesterol. Palm oil, on the other hand, is a tropical oil that is high in saturated fats. I'm very frugal and it takes alot to make me throw something out, but this stuff went in the trash. Unhealthy and unpleasantly sweet!
