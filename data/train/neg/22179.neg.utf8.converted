DO NOT buy from this seller...the "prime Grade" tenderloin we recieved was full of sinew; gristle and other "bits" of stringy things!!!!!<br /><br />Caveat Emptor!<br /><br />[I took most of this beef trash and careefully trimmed as much of the "things" in the meat, and chopped fine to include in one of the dinners for my two Pemproke Welsh Corgi's...<br /><br />BAD, BAD seller!!!
