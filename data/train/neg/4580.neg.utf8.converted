I have bought this product for the last 18 months because it had no sugar and it was great for my toddler.  Well what a shock I had when the latest box I purchased said it now contains SUGAR too!!  The only organic cereal now out on the market with no added sugar or evaporated cane juice is Barbara's Organic Cereal o's.  Make a statement and do not buy this again!!  Very disappointed with Cascadian Farm...why ruin a perfectly good no-sugar cereal???
