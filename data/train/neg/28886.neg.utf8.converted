I've been gluten free for about 10 years now and didn't have time to order my usual Schar Vanilla Sandwich Creams prior to a camping trip.  These Kinnitoos were unattractive and crumbly which is no big deal but, to me, they tasted like thick communion wafers with thin, grainy icing.  Sort of mealy and way to sweet.  If you weren't crazy about these, you might try the Schar cookies.  I like pretty everything from them.
