Green tea may be a valuable part of the diet for many people, however, consuming green tea is either a knowing or unknowing choice of suicide by those of us who need blood thinners. Because of its vitamin k content, it reduces or eliminates the affect of blood thinners such as Coumadin, Plavis and even low dose aspirin. Vitamin K, present in extremely high quantities in green tea, promotes coagulation and consequently the formation of clots. Clots kill through stroke and heart attack.<br /><br />If you have either been prescribed blood thinners of any type or a family history of vascular problems, green tea should be regarded as a powerful and potentially deadly poison.
