The chocolate coating on the crackers was oxidized and had turned a greyish color.<br /><br />Also, it was apparent that some of the chocolate had melted as some of the crackers were fused together.<br /><br />Finally, there was no expiration date on the box, so it was impossible to determine just how old these crackers were!<br /><br />Any food item should always have the expiration date mentioned in the item description on Amazon as well as printed on the packaging.<br /><br />Amazon was gracious in refunding me the entire purchase price.  But, it was such a disappointment that these crackers were not edible as I was really looking forward to enjoying them!
