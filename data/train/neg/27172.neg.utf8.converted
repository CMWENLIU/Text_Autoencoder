This is one of those times when I wish I had tried the product first before buying in bulk.  The coffee doesn't have a lot of aroma or flavor.  While nothing can be done with lack of scent, I thought I can get more taste out of it by using more coffee.  The result is that I now have a still basically flavorless coffee, except it's now also bitter!  Lesson learned...
