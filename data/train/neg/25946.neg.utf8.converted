I received my most recent order of this item today, and am very disappointed that the can from Thailand is only a pop-top; the cans from Italy could be opened with a regular can opener, although a so-called "easy open" tab was also supplied.  The reason I have purchased the Genova from Italy many times is because I could use a can opener, having once sliced my hand very badly trying to open a can of Starkist tuna with a pop-top.  Even though I bought a special opener for these pop-tops, they are extremely hard for me to open, and had I known that the supplier is now in Thailand instead of Italy as I expected, I wouldn't have taken a chance on the can being changed and not ordered it (long ago I got the Genova from Italy in an Italian deli in Santa Monica, California, so knew I could use a regular can opener on them).  I did manage to get one can open from this new shipment, and the contents are very different also from my previous orders.  There is a huge amount of oil, instead of just a small amount, and the tuna is a different color and texture.  The oil and tuna are tastless compared to what I had so many times before from Italy.
