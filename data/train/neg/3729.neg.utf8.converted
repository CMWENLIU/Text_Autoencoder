Great, I bought the 6 pack of these things, not realizing how awful they taste!!  The reviews gave me the impression they'd be good, but trust me, these are nasty!!  They are not sweet enough, and have a weird after taste.  Sort of like a peanut shell aftertaste or something.  Not very pleasant.  Not a lot of chewy-ness to these either, just big pieces of rice and very little chewy texture.  The berry variety of these seem to have great reviews, stick with those ones if you HAVE to try the Crispy Rice Bars!!!!
