I had high hopes for this product when I purchased it since everyone was singing its praises.  Some background on me; I don't eat gluten or dairy of any kind.  I have food sensitivities so I'm used to eating things that don't taste great.  I watch my weight and love peanut butter so I thought this would be perfect for me.  I first tried it mixed with a little water like the instructions said.  It was horrible and I didn't eat it.  Next I made the peanut butter cookies on the PB2 website.  They were not good.  I could barely eat one.  I shared it with my dog and she liked it.  Maybe if you make your own dog treats it would work for that.  Lastly, I tried it in my morning protein drink and it was fine.  I may add it from time to time to have some extra protein.  This is the only way I will use it.  I can't believe so many people liked it.
