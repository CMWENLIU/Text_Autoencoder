Just so that you know what you are buying - the ingredients on the back are clearly shown to be olive oil and "truffle aroma".  As another reviewer said - this is olive oil and chemicals.  It's very disappointing to have paid this much for a wee little bottle (and it is wee!) of olive oil and chemicals.
