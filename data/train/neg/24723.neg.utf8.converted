As one who enjoys various types of granola bars, I was looking forward to trying the EAT THINK SMILE all natural granola bars. At 160 calories, with only 35 calories from fat, these sounded like a great alternative to other higher fat items. After the first bite I was not impressed but I decided to finish the bar to give it a fair chance. The verdict.... it tasted like berry flavored styrofoam. A nice berry flavor was evident, but it was not sufficient to overcome the cardboard - styrofoam textured base.<br /><br />Aside from the displeasing texture, I found the box rather misleading in that it states "the natural antioxidant power of cocoa". I assumed from that statement that these bars were loaded with antioxidants, but the nutritional facts do not prove that true. Each granola bar has only 2% of vitamin C, 4% of vitamin E, and no vitamin A. Not an antioxidant packed product in my opinion.<br /><br />Try them and judge for yourself, but for me... I give them thumbs down.
