These taste really good and I couldn't even tell the difference between the regular and these sugarless.  I don't know what they use as a substitute (mine came without any ingredients listed) but whatever it is gives you really really bad gas, and sometimes diarrhea.<br />It was very painful too.<br />I tried eating them twice and both times the same results.  The Gas i have to say is the worse of the two, it lasts for hours and hours and it's extremely embarrassing.  I would not buy these again.
