Check on the web FDA WARNING, I bought this for my 10 pound Havenses, he only had 2 of these and got deathly sick. Went emergency to the vets over a 1,000.00 bill, and my dog is still not well, but he is alive. 70 dogs have died this year from this product so I guess we were lucky. Please BEWARE my little guy was so sick, he could not stand or walk he had watery bloody stools,vomiting, shaking uncontrollably. This was nearly 2 weeks ago, he is still sick and not eating well. I know for fact it was this product that made him so sick as I home cook his meals daily and this was the only new thing I ever gave him, with in hours of giving him this he was vomiting, and throwing this POISON up. The dog is never out of our sight, we have to watch him even when he is outside, to many coyotes here. Amazon Please, don't sell this, the MADE in China is so small I could not read it with my glasses on, larger it says Dogswell dist, Ca
