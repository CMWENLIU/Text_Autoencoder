I admit I have not made any vanilla extract with these beans yet. If it smells different than the beans do, I will update my review. When I smelled the vanilla beans through the single layer plastic they came in, it smelled...almost like tobacco. Not cigarettes, but a tobacco plant...mixed with vanilla. A friend of mine who recommended these to me said they did NOT smell right when I let her smell them today. She's been making her own extract with these beans for a while. I hate to think I wasted $20. It really doesn't make me excited to try this company again. Not sure I want to waste vodka trying to make extract from a bad batch. So buyer beware. I probably just got unlucky somehow.
