This is a totally enjoyable dark roast coffee, but Baronet has chosen to sell it in a "fair trade" bag that contains 8 unprotected pods and drastically shortens the shelf life of the coffee once you open the bag.  If you drink 3+ cups of coffee a day and only drink this variety, this is fine because you'll use up all the coffee pods in less than 3 days.  But if you like to choose from several varieties of coffee pods, and drink only 1-2 cups a day,it's a definate minus and totally anti-consumer.  One of the most important advantages of single-pod packed coffee is the freshness and aroma that's assured when you tear open the bag.  This form of packaging is the equivilent of using your mother's Maxwell House coffee in a 1-pound can that often stayed around the house for months.<br /><br />At least give the customer a choice of packagings!<br /><br />SUGGESTION FOR CONSUMERS:  DON'T BUY ANY COFFEE SOLD IN THESE BAGS!!!<br />SUGGESTION FOR AMAZON:  DON'T SELL ANY POD COFFEE THAT'S NOT PACKAGED IN SEAL INDIVIDUAL SERVINGS!!!
