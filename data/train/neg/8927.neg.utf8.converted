I can honestly say that I am not sure how i feel about this product yet. I have two Corgis and one loves it the other not so much. BUT ... i give it to my dogs only when i put them in the crate. My corgi that loves it is a boredom chewer so it makes sense that she would enjoy it, especially since it has "bonus treats" in the bottom. My other one just lies in the crate looking angry, as if to say " you think that treat is going to keep me happy while your gone?"<br /><br />I give it three stars because it is fair.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />The company must have changed the formula or something because it made both my dogs sick (both ends).
