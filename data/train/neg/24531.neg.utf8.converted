I love coffee but don't always need the caffeine so I thought I would try this "Herbal Coffee", well I just wasted my money because it's going to the trash.  I can't even think of anyone I dislike enough to gift it to.  Its got this strange flavor, like its sweetened with stevia(which I am not a fan of either), and it resembles the appearance of coffee, but the taste and smell is not even close.  Blah!!!
