Do not buy this product from this vendor. It's theft. The ad states that you are buying Dog Treats (note plural) and that the shipping weight is over 3 pounds. What you get is just one Greenie, for nearly seven dollars. I returned it immediately. Whoever is selling this is trying to steal from you.
