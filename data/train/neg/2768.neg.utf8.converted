I had to return this item, because it was represented on the website incorrectly.  I was looking for the original beef recipe, not the new one, and was delighted when I found it on Amazon (both versions were shown as available).  My cat has a health problem that requires this specific food.  I compared the ingredients, the label, and all the details for a match before I placed the order.  I was very careful.  When I received the cat food, it was the new recipe (not what I wanted).  Apparently, the old recipe is not available at all anymore, so the item should be removed from the website.
