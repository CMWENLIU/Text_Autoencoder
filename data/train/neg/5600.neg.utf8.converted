The green beans were my third or fourth seed crop from the Aerogarden folks. Had great success with the herbs, and have been trying other crops to gauge my success and interest. Sadly, the green beans I considered a bust. I got one meager handful of beans from this; no more. I'm going back to the herbs after this.<br />One thing that is a challenge with the beans - once they flower, you have to be your own "bee" to get them pollinated.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Would not recommend this seed kit.
