Though not especially clear in the product details here, the primary ingredient is cane sugar and the taste reflects that.  "Honey Crystals" is very misleading.  The listed details of this product would indicate that this is pure crystalized, dehydrated honey.  One would hope, great for tea or coffee drinkers who are tired of having honey packets sticky-up their purse or pockets... unfortunately that is not the case.  This is a bag of cane sugar.  Using this product in a recipe to replace sugar is pointless, because again, it's mostly sugar.  The only thing this will add to your baked goods is cost.<br /><br />Whether you're a foodie with an especially refined palate or just someone who can sort of tell the difference between real honey and a packet of Sweet N' Low, you will likely not mistake this for anything but sugar. Twelve dollar cost - two dollar standard sugar!<br /><br />If you're seeking genuine honey, in both substance and flavor, but without the sticky, keep looking.  If you have no qualms about paying nearly twelve bucks for a bag of yellow cane sugar, purchase on.<br /><br />One positive:  It does dissolve fast (but so does super-fine sugar found in any grocery store for a buck fifty).
