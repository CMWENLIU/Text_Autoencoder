These USED to be an excellent value but in Sept/Oct 2011, Seasons changed their can design (which itself is a good thing because the old cans were difficult to open), BUT they put in less sardines and the sardines are now of an inferior quality. The old can had a printed net weight of 3.75 oz, and there were in fact about 3.8 oz of sardines in the can...6-7 tender, moist yummy sardines. Now, in the new cans (which open from the corner), the actual weight of the sardines is about 3 oz...almost a 1/4 loss of product (the printed weight is STILL 3.75 oz)...AND THE PRICE IS STILL THE SAME. What makes it worse is that the sardines are big (2-3 sardines vs the older 5-6 sardines, dry, tough and have an off smell. If you get a can which opens from the top, you're good to go, but if you have the newer can which opens from the corner, you're getting an inferior sardine and paying more for less. Another example of an American company sacrificing quality for higher profits.
