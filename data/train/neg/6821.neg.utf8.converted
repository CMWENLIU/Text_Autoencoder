I am not sure what to say... I am rating 2 *'s because I wanted it.. otherwise its not worth it. even if its free!<br /><br />1) there are no instructions if you need to take special care. If its seasonal it should be mentioned when to buy it.<br />2) I read it online and did everything possible and followed every instruction with the best soil but there is nothing even after 2-3 months...<br /><br />I am not bothered about if I am paying 1$ or 1000$ for this but its a waste of time when you have high expectations and nothing comes out.<br /><br />Disappointed!
