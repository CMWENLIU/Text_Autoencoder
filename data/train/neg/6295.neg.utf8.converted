We appreciate you taking the time to inquire about our product.  Our Kona Blend is not 100% Kona but is a blend of beans from various origins that match the taste profile for the Kona bean.  Although our blends and percentages are proprietary, you can be assured that this blend meets or exceeds the Kona taste profile and at a much lower cost.<br /><br />Again, thanks for taking the time to inquire about our product.  Your feedback continues to help us produce the highest quality product.<br /><br />Copper Moon Coffee, LLC<br /><br />(800)-486-1198
