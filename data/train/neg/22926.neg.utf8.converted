The gumballs are good for about a minute. That's about it. Not a whole lot of flavor. The picture shows the container filled almost to the top. The one I received is 65% filled, just a little above the top of the label. Plus it barely fills the King Carousel gumball dispenser barely half way. While the gumballs taste good initially, the flavors wear off quickly, so I give this product one star for that and for the deception of the photo of the product which shows the container fills to the top when the actual product is filled partially above the label, and lastly for the heavily markup of the price which undoubtedly will increase soon. Quite a  disappointment.
