The directions state 1 squeeze per 8oz of water, so two squeezes for your average bottle of water. The drink label also says 24 servings in the 12oz bottle. Not sure if I squeezed too much, but this was far too sweet for me. I tried just one quick squeeze, but it still tasted too sweet. I wasn't expecting that problem from a product boasting zero sugar. I tried removing the label to check the level of the energy drink, but the bottle is opaque.<br /><br />When a drink uses the word "energy," that is exactly what I expect, but despite all the vitamins I didn't feel any boost...I wouldn' even call it refreshing.<br /><br />I would rather drink plain water.
