I purchased 50 Timothy K Cups, Breakfest Blend.  Although we very much enjoyed the taste/quality of the coffee, half of our K-Cups were defective and released so many coffee grounds as to make those cups of coffee undrinkable.  In other words, we only got half our money's worth.  This is very problematic because although we enjoy this particular blend of coffee we can't afford to discard half our purchase because of defective K-Cups.  It would be nice if Amazon.com/Timothy's made good on this purchase.  At least then it would be worth our while to make another order and presume that this was an "isolated" defective batch of K-Cups. Otherwise, it is not worth the risk to make the order again.  That's a losing proposition for the customer.  Customers ought to get what they pay for. Seriously, this just isn't right.
