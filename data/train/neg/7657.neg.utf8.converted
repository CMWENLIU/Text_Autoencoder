Terrible vodka pasta sauce, Mr. Puck should have never put his name on the label of this product.<br />For a good vodka pasta sauce, I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004V6A6EE">Newman's Own Pasta Sauce Vodka, 24-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>, plus all profits after taxes go to charity.
