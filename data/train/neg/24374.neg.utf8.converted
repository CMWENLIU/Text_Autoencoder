I, too, have eaten noodles in Japan, China and South east Asia. In fact noodles are one of my favorite foods. Amazingly I have never tasted anything as foul as these. Rubberey and disgusting. I parboiled them, stirfried them, microwaved them; tried every way to cook them to eliminate the awful flavor. Others have said they like them, I suggest you try one package to make your decision. I think this is a food that requires a less sensitive taste mechanism to eat.
