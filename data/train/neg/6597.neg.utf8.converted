Nearly $8 for a little tin of curry powder? Amazing.<br /><br />Either make your own (many recipes online) or buy another brand in an Asian grocery store or online for $2 or so.<br /><br />And Malaysian curry powder is VERY different from Indian or other curries. If a recipe calls for Malaysian curry powder get the real thing or the taste will be very disappointing.
