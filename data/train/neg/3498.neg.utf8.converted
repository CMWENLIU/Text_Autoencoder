This product is very HARD to eat! It is semi-transparent, so it really resembles TAPE WORMS. It doesn't taste bad. It's just very difficult to look at while preparing and eating. I've tried it with no sauce and I've tried it with Spaghetti sauce and it is just bizarre looking. Still have 3 packages left and am hoping a white sauce will disguise them better. Maybe they are meant to be eaten by very dim candlelight. :-{
