I like the product and have been pleased with it from other vendors. I looked at all the vendors on amazon and found this one to be the best value on a delivered price per ounce value (assuming you have amazon prime). However, the savings was very small compared to the next best value and this particular vendor shipped me containers that the date stamps showed they were already at least half expired. So if you are planning on storing this and not using it all within 6 months, I suggest you buy it elsewhere. If you plan to use it all within 6 months than it is the best value for your money (maybe because it is discounted for being old stock). BTW, amazon does not allow the return of these as the are classified as "Grocery Items" which are non-returnable.
