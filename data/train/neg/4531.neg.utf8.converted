This item was very important for my small baking business and not only did I never receive this item, I had to call them for a refund. The response I got from them regarding the no-show? "Oh, did you want to re-order it?" Uh, NO! I had to tell them they needed to return my money asap, which they did do (the very least). I will never do business with this company again and if their ratings are to believed, I'm not the only one very unhappy with them lately. I gave them a single star only because they did return my money.
