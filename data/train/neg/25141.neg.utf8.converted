I have been feeding my cats EVO Duck for the past 5-6 years. I recently changed back over to Wellness and Felidae as I have noticed that the EVO food has been changing colors. It (EVO Duck for cats) is now a nasty gray color, no longer the rich red/brown color duck is known to have. It also has no congealed juice/gravy on the top of the food any more. This is usually found in good cooked food made with fowl.<br /><br />Over the past 2 months I have noticed a change in smell, color and consistency. Another clue that something was different was that my cats had started getting sick after eating, lots of vomiting. It was starting to smell like regular old rancid cat food where with old EVO you could actually smell what meat was used (it actually smelt GOOD). It makes me wonder what kind of rendered crap is in there now!<br /><br />I have written P&G and was promised that there would be no change made in recipe, meat sources and other ingredients within the first year. The year anniversary for the buyout was in January 2011. I had been assured a few months ago that they would still be procuring everything (same grade) from the same sources that EVO had used before being bought out. With that year over with, I have seen new changes every time I look in a can.<br /><br />Having worked in a vet hospital in the past, I know that pet food industries are NOT required to make changes on the food label until 6 months AFTER the change has been made in the formula. I am very aware of the mess P&G got into with the Melamine a few years ago and I don't want to risk it. I have opted to go back to Wellness (yes they had a recall recently, but were great about quickly buying back food. They also have put in other measures that I am comfortable with to prevent this from occurring again)and Felidae. Both of these foods are manufactured by original owners who have set standards with both brands.<br /><br />I will not risk it and I would advise anyone thinking about EVO to do a little homework before purchasing. It looks to me like they are charging top dollar for sub standard quality.
