Don't buy this. I use Sugar in the Raw and thought every once in a while it might be better if I used this alternative. Personally if I put a spoonful of mud in my coffee I'm sure it couldn't taste worse than this stuff.<br /><br />Real Sugar in the Raw is somewhat granular in texture and light brown. This stuff is white and powdery, like confectioners sugar. The taste? The worst.<br /><br />I threw the entire package away and will never buy anything like it again. I'd rather drink my coffee black. I'd never use it in any recipe, as I'm sure the taste will be 'off' and all your ingredients will be ruined.<br /><br />Find something else or do without sugar.
