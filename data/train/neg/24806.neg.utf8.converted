There's almost no meat in this at all.  Look at ingredients:<br /><br />Whole grain ground corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, wheat middlings, rice bran, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols and vitamin E), natural chicken flavor, salt. Vitamins, minerals.<br /><br />In case you're wondering what chicken by-product meal is, look it up:  necks, heads, undeveloped eggs, feet, intestines, lungs, and some feathers.  Often, these parts come from chickens that are not fit for human consumption, meaning they are diseased or decayed.
