These rice cakes arrived  ( 6 boxes worth) with a short shelf life of just about a month.  Jan 2012!!!  Had I known this I would never have ordered them!  They are nearly stale and Amazon does not take back food items as a return.  I do not expect food bought on Amazon to be such that the  short shelf life will mean wasted money and food thrown away because of staleness.  Terrible practice.  No one to contact because of the no return policy on food.  If Amazon is going to deal with food items they should have the policy of fairness and send out only  foods with s reasonable shelf life.  120 rice cakes eaten within 1 month is a bit much in my opinion.  I have ordered and received these rice cakes earlier and they were fine.  Tasty and good shelf life.  It is frustrating not to be able to request a refund for this item.  I would not chance buying any of this product ever again unless I could be assured of  freshness and a decent shelf life.  Do not take a chance on this if you want fresh item  and are watching how you spend your money.
