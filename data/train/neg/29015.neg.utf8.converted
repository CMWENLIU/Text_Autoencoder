Taste is typical of popcorn, but when the kernels pop in my air popper, they are so forceful that they push unpopped kernels out the chute. In the end of popping, about 50% of unpopped kernels have gone unpopped. This makes this popcorn twice as expensive. My local co-op organic popcorn pops so nice and is a good price (just far from my house), I am regretting ordering this product in bulk. Bad mistake :(  I will take the drive into town and get the co=ops popcorn over this brand in the future...
