I was really excited about being able to grow garden products in my kitchen all year long. Unfortunately, the results were not what I expected.<br /><br />I started with the standard herb garden. All of the seed pods sprouted on schedule. One of the bulbs burned out within 2 months. Aerogrow guarantees the bulbs for six months (which, by the way is their recommended lifespan), so they sent me a new pair.<br /><br />Now on to the garden products themselves. Don't get me wrong, they all tasted the way they were supposed to, but there wasn't the intensity I would normally get from something grown in the ground. I was hoping that the nutrients that come with every kit would provide the elements needed for the flavor. They didn't.<br /><br />Since then, I've also tried the cherry tomatoes and the salad greens. In every case, even with normally tasty cherry tomatoes, there was absolutely nothing exciting about the flavor of anything I grew in the garden.<br /><br />I won't be using it anymore. I'll be better off using regular small pots and good potting soil with a little fertilizer.<br /><br />I can understand where hydroponics would be necessary and even taste good in the right situation, but using water exclusively for growing vegetables at home just doesn't do it for me.
