I have an absolute passion for deep, dark hot chocolate. I want chocolate which tastes like *chocolate*, rich and flavorful, with a hint of a bite. You can savor chocolate like that.<br />What I have an aversion to is hot sugar. And, most hot mixes taste just like that; you might as well suck on a cube of sugar with a sprinkling of coca on top than drink a cup.<br />Regrettably, McSteven's Dark Chocolate European Coca Mix fell into the latter category. It had a bit more chocolate than, say, Nestles mini marshmallow or Swiss Miss Yodel, but all in all...sugar cube. Nicht goot.
