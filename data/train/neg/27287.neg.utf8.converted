We had been feeding our baby for weeks using this formula, but then realized the studies recently found.<br />I guess we did not want to believe it but call the company after all. First it was hard to get someone qualified about the issue, the lady was nice but couldn't help us.<br />So she toke our number saying someone would get back to us, but nobody ever did, do they want to stay away from the arsenic issue???<br />Nutrition is so important in a babies first few months of life that we now use another brand and have moved on from this one.<br />It's so dissapointing that they have to add sweetner anyway! I mean it's a baby formula, and being one of the first ingredient it tells you a lot.<br />We now use the Holle brand, it was very hard to get before but fortunately now avaiable on amazon! Much better quality, more organic and especially no added extra useless stuff that should not be in a baby diet!
