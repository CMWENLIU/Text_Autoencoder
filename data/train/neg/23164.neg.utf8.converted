I ordered this product a few weeks ago, believing it to be the six-star, aged sweet vinegar as clearly pictured in this listing.  What I received was the "regular" Colavita less-aged, no-star vinegar, which is an ok product, but not as good as the six star sweet product.  When I contacted the seller, they claim that Colavita does not make the six-star product anymore, which might be true, but they certainly should have changed this picture then.  I'm still trying to negotiate my return and refund.
