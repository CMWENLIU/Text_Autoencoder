WATCH OUT! You would be surprised at just what food products have artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />READ THE INGREDIENTS!<br /><br />The people at Swiss Miss added ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS to the REGULAR SWISS MISS.<br /><br />I was drinking it because it was the one without artificial sweeteners. Then it began to TASTE FUNNY.<br />I read the INGREDIENTS. You can't trust anyone these days.<br /><br />SWISS MISS is NOT advertising this change.<br /><br />I guess the FDA is letting it slide when companies add artificial sweeteners to NON-DIET food.<br />Maybe that's the government's way of putting people on a diet.<br />Makes me wonder if they are putting it in the food in schools.<br />As usual the gov't doesn't get it--artificial sweeteners make you sick, NOT SKINNY!
