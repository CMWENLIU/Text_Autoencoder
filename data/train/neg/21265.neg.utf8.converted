From crazzeto's wife:<br /><br />My 5 month old preemie baby (born 2 months early due to preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome) needs special formulas for her feeding problems and they taste HORRIBLE. So, we've been adding a 1/4 teaspoon vanilla powder to each bottle so she'll eat it. We've tried several different brands but this is the absolute worst! When I opened it, it didn't even smell like vanilla - it smelled like they had sprinkled artificial sweetener onto some cardboard, toatsted it until it was burnt, then crumbled it into a very coarse powder and bottled it. Then I tried to scoop some out and found that it was ROCK HARD! It had all clumped together in the bottle like brown sugar does when it gets dry. I managed to scrape a few clumps out and taste it and the good news is that it doesn't taste like cardboard. The bad news, though, is that it doesn't taste like anything at all! And to top it all off, the seller doesn't allow returns! I'm stuck with this overpriced junk so bad I can't even put it in coffee much less my baby's formula! PLEASE do yourself a favor and save your money rather than buy this. The best powdered vanilla is the Cook's brand, also available on amazon. It's not the greatest either, but it's the best I've found so far and 1,000 times better than this stuff.
