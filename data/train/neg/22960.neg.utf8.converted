This is the only hog casing in small bag Amazon carry. So I don't have choice since I don't want to spend extra $$ on shipping. it's say for 25 pound on their bag but I could only fill with 15 lb. yes, if you include all the broken part, too thin or too thick part. the only thing I can say it is usable.
