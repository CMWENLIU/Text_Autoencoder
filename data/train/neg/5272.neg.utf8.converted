This product is not ground sufficiently finely for use in an espresso machine -- it just makes coffee, not espresso. I'm not sure how other reviewers are comparing this to Lavazza or Illy, as it's a completely different grind from those brands. Since I have no need for moderately-finely-ground coffee, I have to figure out what to do with the rest of this stuff.
