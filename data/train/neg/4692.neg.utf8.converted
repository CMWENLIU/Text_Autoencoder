I bought these to take by mouth, but after seeing the thick covering decided I didn't want to ingest that material--then decided to use the oil inside the capsule on my skin.  When cutting a small hole and squeezing out the oil, I noticed a small pellet that wouldn't melt on my skin in almost all the capsules.  Not sure what that material is, but am glad that I decided not to take them internally.<br />Also after doing some reading on Titanium Dioxide (listed as an ingredient)found that it is "Classified as Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans" by IARC.  Now I plan to stop using it on my skin and throw away the rest of the bottle--should've done my research before buying.
