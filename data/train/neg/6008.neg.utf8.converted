This stuff is the worst.  It tasted like chemicals not peanut butter. I didn't want to waste it so I mixed it with some sugar and flour and cocoa powder to make some "chocolate, peanut butter" cookies.  They were not good either but after I frosted them they were passable.  Sort of defeats the purpose of a calorie free spread.  If I didn't have to pay for shipping (bought the peanut butter product at walmart) I would try the other products mentioned by the others that reviewed this product in a similar light- at least I know you all still have your taste buds.  As for the others that gave this high marks, I'm not not sure but I think you should see a doctor as there could be something wrong with your mouth.
