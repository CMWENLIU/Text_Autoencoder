Very tricky. I used to buy Dorset all the time, then they went out of stock.  When they came back on Amazon I re-ordered a pack of 5 and I was very surprised:<br />1.  This is half the size the previous ones used to be and for the same price.<br />2.  It's toasted wheat and flakes. It's like Granola not the Muesli such as Steinbracher and Mumu's where you get rolled oat and barley.<br /><br />I though Dorset was good, but not anymore.  Last time!  If only Amazon sold MuMu, the best cereal in the States at least made in the USA, up state NY.  Why import cereals when we have the best one here... We are paying a premium to ship a bad product trans the Atlantic ocean and contributing to air pollution and CO2 emission.
