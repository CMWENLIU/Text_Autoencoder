Started using this salt. After 2 days I got this terrible headache. Check my blood pressure and HOLY COW!!! It's was the highest it had ever been.<br />The only thing I changed in my eating habits was this salt.<br />A word to those who may buy this Celtic Sea Salt, I'm not saying that it definitely will, but it MAY increase your blood pressure. So be advised.
