I purchased this product to spray the yard and immediately upon turning on the water it fell apart.  The blue attachment came off the bottle.  I turned down the water pressure and reconnected it only to have it happen over and over until plastic pieces came flying out and I got soaked.  This is a flawed design that should not be on the market.  Look elsewhere.
