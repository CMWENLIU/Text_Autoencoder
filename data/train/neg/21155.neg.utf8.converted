I got my almond butter in the mail and opened it.  too my surprize i found chunks of almond butter<br />all around inside the box.  the almond butter become unsealed and splattered all arround inside the box during shipping<br />the shippers never heard of wrapping the almond butter in bubble wrap.  in order for it to arrive to my house safely from<br />amazon.com.  the bottles where never comletely inclosed in bubble wrap.  i called amazon.com up and they dont want me to return the broken jars of almond butter  i can not eat them after this<br />amazon.com says they will refund  my gift cards<br />i am sure glad they take my word for it<br />amazon. is great they reallystand behind what they sell at amazon.com<br />i will continue to shop there
