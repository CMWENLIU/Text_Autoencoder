I purchased a quart carton of chamomile tea at a street fair about 2 years ago.  I started using it a few months ago and it was excellent, in spite of its age.  It had a great calming effect on me and I went to sleep about 20 minutes after drinking it.  Thinking it was "cheap" (after all, I bought it at a street fair), I ordered Two Leaves and a Bud brand from Amazon and it was awful!  I had to use 3-4 tea bags in a single cup  to achieve any degree of strength or taste or desired result.  In my opinion, the packaging is gorgeous; the product leaves a lot to be desired.
