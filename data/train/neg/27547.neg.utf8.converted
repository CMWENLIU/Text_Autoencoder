I bought this for my wife to help her nurse; I had high hopes for this product, but it fell short in several areas. First, the taste of the tea is awful. The Fennel seeds are way too overpowering. There's a reason that common teas do not include "fennel" as a flavor enhancer; it has an overly strong and odd smell. Yogi has made no concession to balance out the flavor, in fact, it tastes like they just put fennel seeds in the tea bags.<br /><br />Which brings me to my next issue, Yogi is trying to achieve "aqueous extraction" with this tea. Aqueous extraction works well with leaves, but does NOT work well with unground seeds. Seeds have extra natural protections which will not allow for the best extraction of nutrients using hot water alone; this is why coffee beans need to be ground during preparation. The Fennel/Fenugreek/Anise seeds in the tea bags are simply "broken up", not ground. With this product, Yogi has accomplished the equivalent of putting ungrounded coffee beans in a tea bag and calling it coffee. The Fennel, Fenugreek, and Anise in this product are not leaves, they are seeds; for it to work in any sort of effective way, the seeds would have to be completely ground, not just broken.<br /><br />Besides the poor execution in delivery of the nutrients, I was concerned to see that the product had lavender in it. Which, I don't think is all that safe for babies to be even indirectly ingesting.<br /><br />I can give Yogi credit for acknowledging the wonderful natural properties of Fenugreek. But, I'd advise buyers to take it through different means. My wife uses <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KNHHL8">GNC Herbal Plus
