Please see my extended (with video) review of the Pro-Pest product.<br /><br />I keep and use industrial felt which is 50/50 wool/synthetic material. No bug problem in the first 2 years I have started using it. In the last two weeks, I start to see moths flying around the felt. Oh, oh, trouble, trouble. Googledee peck, peckity google.<br />Identify malefactors. It's not so easy catching the little buggers on the fly so I bought both the Propest and the Safer sticky catchers. $40 worth from Amazon.<br />It appears I have plain Clothes Moths. Light brown wings, less than 1/2" long. No mottling on wings.<br />Both moth catchers I received, are triangular open cardboard tubes with the sticky lining inside and their own little tiny strip of bug alluring super secret squirrel perfume inside. Did taxpayer money fund the research for this secret stuff? We want to know.<br />Neither brand captures all flying moths like a magnet as at least one reviewer has stated. In fact, if you snore through the lit, only male moths are snagged. Mommy moths are laying eggs all over the place. Yeaah, Grrrrrh.<br />You don't have to be a brain surgeon to notice that moths fly like drunken sailors. Amazingly, in the course of a week, two Propest tubes each caught a dozen moths. Two Safer tubes were almost useless. One caught 2 moths and the other caught none. I moved all of them around a little every day. The Propest tubes are twice as big as the Safer ones and I think this is a factor.<br />I, as a senior citizen, am on board to try to do the Green thing as much as possible. Clearly however , once moths are flying all over your house, you are not going to get rid of all traces and iterations of them with any shade of Green song and dance, pyramids, good vibrations, force of argument and certainly not the inevitable cursing. Very much alive female moths, now bigger, flew around my face annoying me and raising my blood pressure to dangerous levels.<br />Killing all the boy moths is productive and fine with me but leaves, presumably, an equal number of maybe pregnant and/or very horny mommy moths. Hmmm, maybe a plot for a Japanese horror flick.<br />The last time I had moths, 15 years ago, long and short, I used pesticides to finally rid myself of these pests. I cannot tolerate these pests, and now, regrettably, for practical reasons, I have decided to take the advice of my wool felt supplier: Raid Max Deep Penetrating Fogger. Stay tuned.
