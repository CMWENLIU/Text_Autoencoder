I make all my daughters food and thankfully she prefers what I make over jar food.  I do have those times when I need something quick to grab on the go.  Ella's Organics is a great go to. Paying this much for one pouch is a huge huge rip off.  Usually Babies R Us has them for $1 - $1.40 most likely on sale for a dollar though.  I am really happy with the Happy Baby brand too ... also almost $2 a pouch but usually on sale. Just last night my local grocery store had a 10/$10 sale on this brand.<br /><br />Seek out this product just never for this price!! Yikes.
