I'm STILL looking for something to give my infant to snack on that will melt in his mouth.<br /><br />I can't believe anything specifically made for infants has sugar as the second ingredient, or as an ingredient, period.<br /><br />I'm shocked this product has so many good reviews. Do parents not read labels?!
