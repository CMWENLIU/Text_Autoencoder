Why ruin great Irish oatmeal with additives that could be derived from GMO sources. It popped up in my recommended items and I ordered it without checking ingredients. Big mistake. I can't risk eating it since I can't eat anything from GMO corn or soy.There are other good organic oatmeals out there that don't add questionable ingredients.
