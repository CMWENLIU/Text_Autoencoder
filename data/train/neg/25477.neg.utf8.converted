These were the dirtiest, filthiest, silt-ridden oysters I have ever bought in my life. Even after scrubbing, it was almost impossible to open the oysters without getting silt inside. So many of the oysters were stuck together, and they were so barnacle encrusted it made shucking VERY difficult. I spoke to the owner Ron before ordering, and since he had been so nice on the phone, I called him to tell him of my experience and he offered to make amends when I told him that I wanted to buy some shucked oysters. But instead of $20 with free shipping, Amazon's price is now $25 plus $22 shipping. Wow!<br /><br />Buy oysters at your local fish market or supermarket where you can pick out your own. I would never buy from this vendor again.
