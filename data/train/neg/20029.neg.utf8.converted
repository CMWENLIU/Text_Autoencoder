I have purchased this product in stores before, so I knew I would like it and decided to buy a case.  Everything was as expected, but the "Better if used before" date on the case and the individual boxes was February of 2006.  Now, I realize that these things don't go bad quickly, but I still think selling something THREE AND A HALF YEARS after the "use by" date is unacceptable.  I will hesitate to purchase more food items from Amazon.
