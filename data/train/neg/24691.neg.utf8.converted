I've got both hands and 9 of 10 fingers on the pulse of my mutt, as I'm sure most people reading this do. One must assume that a person reading reviews on dog treats loves their buddy.  I've tried a few varieties of duck, chick, beef, wrapped around sweet potato and the result has not varied,,,, ever,,, till now.  It was one short sniff for "product verification" and then "Let the attack begin."  I saved this type of product for the super treat.  However this brand was met with my mutt's suspicious snout, followed by nose nudges and paw swiping.  Finally, unless my mutt is real hungry, the treat was abandoned.  I can smell, feel and yesss, taste the difference.  Inferior food product!!!
