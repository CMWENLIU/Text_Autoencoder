This stuff is really gross - I tried the lemon-lime and the berry. Neither were good, but the berry was a little better. I have also tried chilling them and transfering to a glass. Nothing seems to help. Add that to the fact, that I got nothing from these. Nothing at all. Not worth the money to me. By reading the label, I can see why - they contain vitamins, enzymes, and a little caffeine - products I ingest daily anyway....maybe if you don't take vitamins or drink caffeine, these can help you.
