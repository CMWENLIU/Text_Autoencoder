Just got my mustache lollipop in and am anything but pleased. First of all, the picture clearly shows TWO mustache lollipops in its package. What just arrived is not only just ONE lollipop (for which I would have never paid 5 bucks), but also is it thrown into some clear bag labelled "Ready to Ship" and not at all in the funny packaging shown in the above picture. As you can tell, I am very unsatisfied with this product. One star for trying to fool people.
