Amazon is scamming all the customers who buy this based on the reviews.  This webpage used to be for the Sugar-Free "Caramel" syrup made by Torani which I have been buying for years.  Recently, however, Amazon has been shipping the "Classic Caramel" flavor instead.  Classic Caramel, however, is a different product, and the taste is terrible.  I cannot get anyone in my household to drink coffees made with it.  Note that Amazon does not allow returns on grocery items.<br /><br />Please also see the review "Flavor not what it usually is."  I complained several times to Amazon that they were shipping the wrong product.  They assured me it would not happen again.  Appalling, but what Amazon did was to rename this SAME page to Classic Caramel and even change the picture.  But, note that the UPC is for the original "Caramel" product.  You will also find an occasional reference to "Caramel" on this page, but note that the reviews you see here are for a DIFFERENT product.<br /><br />Finally, do yourself a favor and get the plain Caramel and not the Classic Caramel.  It is 10X better.  I can go through a bottle of the regular Caramel in less than a week.  The regular Caramel is sooooo good.  In comparison, no one will drink the Classic Caramel.  Shame on Amazon.  They should have just made this Sugar-Free Caramel page "No longer available" (which it is elsewhere).  Note that they also added a second "Classic Caramel" page (with the correct UPC), but the description, etc., cut-and-pasted from this one.  Don't buy that either.
