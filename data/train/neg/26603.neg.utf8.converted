$13.95 in shipping (5-7 days) for a $26.00 order!?!?!?  Do the math, that's OVER 50% extra on shipping alone.  Are you crazy?  We're not talking about Scharffen Berger chocolates here and they only charge $9 for 3 to 5 days (for a $30 order).  I don't care what chocolate you buy, but don't get taken on the shipping for a cheap product!!!
