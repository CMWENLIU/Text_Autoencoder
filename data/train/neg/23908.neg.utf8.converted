SNAKE OIL ON TAP! Just like all those companies that claim to sell "alkaline" water. The body does not need help balancing its pH. The body's pH is normally between 7.35-7.45 (this is the blood and body cavities; stomach pH and certain other areas might have their own unique acid-base balance). Any deviations form this and you're talking SERIOUS health consequences (metabolic alkalosis/acidosis for starters).<br /><br />There is NOTHING on the market and approved by the FDA for food use that will alkalize the body - nor should you want something like it. This is purely a market gimmick, that will fade over time. This water is a waste of money!
