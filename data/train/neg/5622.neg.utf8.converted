I have never had packaged chestnuts before, but fresh ones are never sold where I live now and I decided to try this. It was horrible compared to the real thing. I can't compare these to other brands of preserved chestnuts, but the flavor was strange and I was surprised to find the chestnuts dark brown and sticky. Then I found a chestnut covered in a green film of mold. Needless to say, I will not be purchasing these again.
