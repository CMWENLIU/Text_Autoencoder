I did not find this movie at all entertaining. I am not a huge fan of Tim Burton but I though it might make a cute Halloween movie. Didn't do it for me. It also says the "F" word and that is not a word I care to listen to or allow my children to listen to in my home.  It seems that things that I found fun and entertaining in my youth are no longer fun and entertaining to me. If you are looking for a fun movie to watch as a family I would not suggest this one.
