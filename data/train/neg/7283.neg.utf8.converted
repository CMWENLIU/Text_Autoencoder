I ordered this 7lb bag of candy for my husband (his favorite!) because it was the only one listed as the "variety" in an assortment of Amaretto, French Vanilla and Irish Creme flavors.  The picture was even different than it is now, showing different colored wrappings on the candies to indicate that it was an assortment of flavors.  However, when it arrived, it was a 7lb bag of the same gold original butter toffee flavor, not the assortment I wanted.  I could have ordered the 2lb bag if I wanted all the same candy! Don't buy this if you're expecting an assortment because it's not.
