I received this product three months ago.  The first seeds started to grow then died within a few weeks. The customer service center is taking a month or more to get back to customers.  Two months later they say that they will send me a new package of seeds. Great except after one week the bulb burnt out after only a total of three weeks of use (2 at the beginning and one this time).  So, now these seeds are going to fail too.  Ridiculous to pay so much for nothing.
