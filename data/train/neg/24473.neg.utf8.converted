Let me say, the first time I tasted Celestial Seasonings Raspberry Gardens Green Tea, I was in heaven.  Had I written this review then, when the tea was a lovely shade of transparent red-purple with a light blackberry flavor, I would have given it 20 stars.  But according to Celestial Seasonings Customer Support, they have changed the recipe, removing the hibiscus and blackberry and leaving that delightful "Mr's Yuk's Bathwater" flavor in it's place. I kid you not.  The tea is now a sickly yellow green with less hint of raspberry now, than before.  The box still looks the same, and the ingredients list still includes hibiscus and blackberry - but it's a lie!  Let the drinker beware.
