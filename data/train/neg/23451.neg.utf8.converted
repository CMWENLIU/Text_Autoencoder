Relative luxury items that charge a premium are subject to a greater degree of discrimination on the basis of commanding margin substanailly higher than that of more mid-stream, value or bang for the buck items.  If you're going to spend $30 for a 16 oz bag of Coffee, the expectation is that the quality of the product is high to exceptional.  My personal opinion, and that of several office co-horts, was that the quality of this product did not match the price point.<br /><br />Our office purchased a Techni-Vorum Moccamaster, with a copper heating element,  for ideal brewing.  Bottled Culligan water was used to make the coffee.  Under such conditions, the sweet flavor of Kona shines.  This did not happen with this product.  The consensus in the office is that the beans were stale.<br /><br />One trick in the food industry to add margin is to sell products that are slightly aged, and a at least a little bit if not moderately on the way to expiration.  This is the model that Trader Joe's operates under.  The difference is with Trader Joes, you pay less for the product, so there is still some relative value in the purchase.<br /><br />Pure Speculation:  I do wonder if this is the case with this product.  Higher Margin Product not selling in recession, gets older, passed off at disproportionately high price point.  I can not know.  What I do know is that I will not be buying this again. Again, while my experiences with Kona with other lines have been outstanding, this particular product was stale.  Suggestions on other Kona lines appreciated.  I am willing to pay up for good beans.  If paying at this price point, the expectations are high.<br /><br />Did have better Luck with Caffe Britt, which while a darker roast, exceptional quality, and good value at the price point on Amazon.  Happy brewing.
