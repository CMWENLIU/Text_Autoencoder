Don't waste your money on these cups...buy the packets and use you Keurigs smallest cup size (5.25 oz.) The packets are much cheaper and have real sugar.  These DO use an artificial sweetener and you WILL notice, especially in the aftertaste.  I have used 3-4 of these cups in the last week or so, then made some straight from a packet I already had...the packet was 100 times better.
