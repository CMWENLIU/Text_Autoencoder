What a disappointment!  Whole Foods is a quality company and we love shopping in their stores.<br /><br />This product appears to be 3.5 lbs of packaging and a half lb of product:  2 small bags of dried beans, one of quinona, and two Bragg's items.<br /><br />I can't imagine ever sending this as a gift.
