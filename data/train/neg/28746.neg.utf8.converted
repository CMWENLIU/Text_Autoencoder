From the recent reviews mine will not be popular.<br /><br />1.  This honey is incredibly expensive for a very small amount, even less than noted in the ad.<br />2.  I buy unfiltered, unheated,  unprocesseed raw honey from many countries and areas all must be without proximity to flowers with pesticides and or abominations.  This honey states (if you can wade through the UMF stuff, in very small print, that it is filtered to remove particles.  I want the pieces of comb, I want the pieces of pollen, I want the natural particles that came from the comb to the jar - the pure enzymes etc.  Further, this honey is heated albeit limited according to the fine print.<br />3.  The material in the four page pamphlet is very limited focusing on the UMF +20 designation which is supposedly very important.  The first page is just pictures and the name of the honey and company.  The second page is white small print on a pale yellow background which makes for very difficult reading.  I like that the honey comes from isolate protected trees far from any farming and contaminants.  The third and fourth pages are more on this UMF +20 stuff.<br />5.  TASTE - the honey, if you are new to it, has very distinctive flavor because of the unique tree from which the honey is collected.  It has a slight off (a hint of bitterness maybe) flavor.  I liked it.<br /><br />Overall you get limited clear information on how they process the honey, and the cost is outragous compared to many other raw, unfiltered, unheated, unprocessed comb to jar honey where you get four or more times as much at a fraction of the cost with most if not all the same health healing benefits.  Also, the brochures talks about the lack of peroxcides.  I have never heard of this before and question what it means in a practical sense. I will not buy again.
