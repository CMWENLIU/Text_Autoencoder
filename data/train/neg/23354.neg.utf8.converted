I had heard such great things about this brand and was thrilled to find it on amazon for sooooo much cheaper than the company website.  I ordered the Maple flavor and eagery awaited its arrival.  It smelled like heaven when I opened the jar, but when I tasted it, it was gritty.  No, seriously, like someone had mixed a few tablespoons of sand in my peanut butter jar.  I immediately checked the expiration date thinking something had gone terribly wrong here.  The peanut butter was not due to expire for over a year, so age was not the culprit. I went online and googled the item, hoping to find some other reviews mentioning the gritty texture.  Sure enough, others had experienced the same thing, and apparently, according to an employee of the company, the maple flavor is SUPPOSED to be like that due to the cane sugar crystals.  In fact, he even states, that is his favorite feature of that flavor! WHAT?! Has the world gone crazy?! I couldn't even eat it...it was the culinary equivalent of running your fingernails down a chalkboard.  I have read that if you bake with it or mix it in something hot, like oatmeal, that the sugar crystals will dissolve, and you can actually enjoy the wonderful flavor, but I would not recommend using it at room temp or colder.  Other amazon reviews don't mention anything about the grit factor, so I guess it didn't bother them.  I can't conceive of that, but hey, more power to them.  I read that the cinnamon raisin swirl flavor has the same gritty texture, so keep that in mind if you are considering that one as well.  Good luck!<br /><br />BTW, Amazon was very cool and immediately refunded my money.
