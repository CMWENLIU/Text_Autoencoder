We bought this just to try it out, and ended up throwing it away after attempting to use it once. This stuff is impossible to squeeze out, and the only reason we were finally able to get anything out of it was because we cut part of the bottom off and squeezed out out of there instead. Pointless. Go with the original stuff in a can, or just get natural peanut butter and use a knife to put it in the kong (thats what we use).
