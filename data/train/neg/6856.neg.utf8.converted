I love green tea.  I love passionfruit drinks.  I really disliked this.  The beverage is essentially sugar water.  It is being marketed as "Aloe Vera Green Tea."  And I have enjoyed aloe drinks in the past.  This is a really cheaply made "aloe vera" product sold with a premium price tag.<br /><br />In general, the order of ingredients indicates the greatest percentage of the product. The ingredient list opens with water, cane sugar, and then "Green Tea Infusion" (green tea leaves and more water).  So I'm assuming they made a batch of green tea, and then diluted it with water before bottling it.  Then there is aloe vera, citric acid, and passionfruit flavor (but no actual passionfruit).<br /><br />The sample I received had pulp in it, but it tastes like orange pulp and not passionfruit.  And there is no indication from the ingredient label if this pulp is even supposed to be in the bottle.  The end result is watered-down weak tasting tea with slightly slimy pulp in it and an artificial citrus taste.  Yuck.<br /><br />Oh, and though a reasonable person would look at the bottle and think it was a single serving, it is labeled as 1 1/2 servings.  So the 80 calories listed on the label?  You should actually think of that as 120 calories because normal people are not going to drink 8 ozs and save the 3.5 ozs for later.
