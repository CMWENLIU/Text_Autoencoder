I had paid $7.81 for Natural Balance Potato and Duck Formula Dog Treats, 8 ounce bag. Since it did not specify for the size of dog as I purchased this online through Amazon.com, I assumed it would be "middle-of-the-road" which I predicted for medium size dog. When I finally got the product, I was shocked! I knew the amount of the product would be small but the size of the treat is even smaller than expectations would allow. If I had a dog the size of a small rat, it might have been a comparable treat. Be weary of what you pay for online and NEVER assume! I don't know a dog who would find this a treat as it is the size of a flea...a chihuahua would have found this treat but a speck in his diet. Not worth the money nor the time I had to wait for it.
