I bought the mum-mums for two reasons: to provide teething itch relief for my 6-month-old son and to keep him independently occupied with something to munch on. The mum-mums disappointed on both of these counts. They are way too fragile and crumble easily. I thought they would be hard so that he could suck on them for a while, but as soon as I put one in his mouth he "bit" off a huge piece that obviously would have presented a choking hazard. And he can't even hold them - they crumble in his grasp. (This is also the reason they are not so good on the go - they crumble to pieces in the bag.) So, I end up breaking off little pieces and putting them in his mouth. I could use Cheerios for that instead of spending that much money on the mum-mums!<br />Taste-wise they are pretty good and he enjoys them, plus they are organic and I know they are easy on his stomach. But they are a disappointment because they failed on both intended purposes: they do not provide teething relief and they do no work as a snack for him to enjoy on his own.
