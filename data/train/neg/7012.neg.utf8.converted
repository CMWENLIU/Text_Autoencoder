I purchased this lavender for the fragrance to remind me of the south of France. The product arrived yesterday and there is little or no fragrance. The bag is labeled "culinary lavender".  The product is not listed as culinary lavendar on the web page and it was reported to be great for making sachets - no way!  This was a total waste of money.
