Inner seal of can was open; therefore, product was completely dried out (a solid block) and unusable.  Contacted seller to ask for a replacement, but was told to return the defective product.  I had already paid $4.99 in shipping for a $4.99 defective product, so I did not want to spend even more money on shipping to return it.  Total loss of ten dollars.
