Unfortunately, I did not read every word of the description prior to ordering this product.  My mistake.  All I saw was "all natural almond butter" and "no trans fats or hydroginated oils".  Upon receiving the product and reading the ingredient list on the packets, I found that the almond butter contains Evaporated Cane Juice, Palm Fruit Oil, and Sea Salt.  That doesn't mean "all natural" to me.  I expected to see only almonds and possibly salt on the ingredient list.  I will not purchase this product again.
