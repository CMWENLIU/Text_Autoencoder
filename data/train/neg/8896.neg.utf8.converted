This is the stuff that the aliens will feed their pet humans when they take over the world. "Human Sustenance Product, Strawberry Flavor. Give your pets the very best! Promotes bright eyes and a shiny pelt. Recommended by 4 out of 5 humanologists!" It will come with a label that has a smiling human on it. I can see it now.<br /><br />It tastes like cookie dough without the delicious grainy sweetness. Pasty. Tastes uncooked. Does not really taste like strawberries at all. Lays in your stomach like a lump of...well. Now, it is a very healthy slab of icky paste, and I like that it's not too sweet. It is also gluten-free if your branch of religion believes that oats are gluten-free. However, these lumps will only serve to be my desperation snack for those extra hungry late afternoons.
