We purchased a Halloween House from the same company and our 4yr old really enjoyed it however the Train has issues.  The gingerbread is so hard when you go to break the specified piece it breaks other pieces, the structure is unstable so it makes it difficult to decorate, after all that then the engine ended up collapsing after sitting a few hours.  After contacting the company, they mentioned it was an issue they are working to resolve in their 2010 model.  I would avoid purchasing this.
