Boxer has been on Blue Buffalo for 6 months; decided to order food due to convenience and price. Not a good idea must have gotten an old bag because the food made my dog's stomach upset. Would not order dog food again from Amazon. Not sure if they sell much of this product or it just sits in a warehouse for a long time before it goes out.
