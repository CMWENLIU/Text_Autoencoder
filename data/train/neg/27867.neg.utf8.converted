This is a mild hot sauce. That means you can apply it liberally and it's unlikely you will make any dish too hot. So it is user friendly.<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): Aged cayenne peppers, distilled vinegar, water, salt - etc<br /><br />Why 2 stars? This sauce lacks any character beyond a heavy dose of vinegar. If you happen to like a lot of vinegar in your hot sauce - then you'll love this sauce and my 2 star rating is way off base. I don't like anywhere near this much vinegar. I've blind taste tested over 30 hot sauces and there are many better ones.<br /><br />What is interesting is that the original Tabasco sauce has a near identical taste to Franks once it is diluted.<br /><br />You will find mention that this sauce was top rated by Cooks Illustrated. That is absolutely true but what these pundits fail to mention is this was a casual test, done in 2005, comparing only three hot sauces!<br /><br />Suggestion: Since tastes vary and if you happen to like this sauce - then buy it in one of its larger sizes - at least 23 oz and consider the gallon size. They cost little more than the smaller sizes.<br /><br />I'd encourage others to experiment with a sauce that is not so heavily laden with vinegar - you just might prefer it.<br /><br />Try any of these:<br /><br />a) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - This sauce has considerable heat but it is nicely balanced against a bit of sweetness combined with a hint of garlic. Virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the Asian section! No vinegar.<br /><br />b) Cholula Original Hot Sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - medium hot and readily available - look in the Mexican section. It has a hint of vinegar.<br /><br />c) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Extra Hot Sauce - a great blend with more vinegar than the above but not too much. Another great blend.<br /><br />d) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Hot Sauce - a decent blend but with a lot of vinegar. Still it is much better than Franks.<br /><br />e) Tapatio Hot Salsa Picanta - another widely distributed and excellent Mexican Hot sauce. A lot of vinegar but far less than Franks. Once again you will find this in your Mexican isle.<br /><br />In my opinion, all of the above are far superior to Franks.<br /><br />If you like Franks and are at the least bit curious, you should try any of these other hot sauces
