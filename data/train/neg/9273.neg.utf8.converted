This is the third Red Rain product i have tried. The original, sugar free and this.<br />Loving the drinks i wanted to give this a shot. Iv never been a huge fan of these shots, made by any company. Rock star shot, monster shot, redbull shot and 5 hour energy shots i think are gross and this is no different. One thing this does that other shots and regular red rain energy drinks does in i get massive diarrhea after drinking it. I think just from the massive amount of b vitamins in this it throws your whole stomach off.
