I really, really wanted to like this. Really. I followed the directions on the package to make a "bold" cup of "coffee" drink and was put off by the taste. I tried it hot, cold and room temp. I LOVE a robust and bold cup of joe and this struck me as bland. It was pretty expensive so I'm pretty bummed about it. It's not a good sub for me. I don't have any experience with Postum like others so no comparison there.
