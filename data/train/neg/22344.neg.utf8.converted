These beans are not meant for your espresso machine!<br /><br />Caffe Appassionato beans are roasted very dark and are oily just like a French Roast.  I would not be surprised one bit if this is French Roast.  I think many Americans like Dark Roasted Coffee because they are used to drinking crappy burnt drip coffee that sits on the burners too long.  This coffee has absolutely no character what so ever.  My opinion is that its way too dark and taste burnt.<br /><br />The espresso shots brewed very unevenly.  I pulled a double shot in separate cups on my Expobar espresso maker and ended up with one cup having a significant more espresso than the other.  The beans were ground very evenly in my Gaggia burr grinder at setting 4 just like any other bean I've used for espresso.  There was barely any crema!  I will try a coarser ground the next time around just to see if I can pull a more even shot.<br /><br />I prepare several shots per day on my Expobar Espresso Machine, have experimented with numerous varieties of beans over the past 3 years of owning this machine and have always made excellent espresso drinks.  Unfortunately, this was not the case with Caffe Appassionato.<br /><br />Caffe Appassianato Espresso Roast makes a good cup of coffee in the french press but these beans are the worst for espressso.  4 stars as coffee, 1 star as espresso.<br /><br />If you want to buy espresso beans here on Amazon, go with Lavazza.  They have a $17 bag that is very good.  I just ordered another bag of Lavazza after tasting my first shot of Caffe Appassionato.<br /><br />Don't let all of the 5 star reviews fool you, this is not espresso!<br /><br />[...]
