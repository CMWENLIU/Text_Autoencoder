First of all I want to start by saying that the Vanilla Blueberry flavor is very good! I love that it has the omega's, fiber, and protein and can be eaten as a snack without milk and makes for a great healthy meal with milk. I really did love the flavor and tried the product several times but I did have stomache pains afterwards every time I ate it no matter how much or little I had. Maybe there is something in it that only my body can not tolerate. Such a shame too since I love granola of any kind and this one in particular seems very healhy for you. Wish I could keep eating it.
