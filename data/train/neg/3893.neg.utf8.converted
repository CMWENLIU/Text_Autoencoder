I tried this item for the first time yesterday.  I eat primarily fresh organic foods, so I purchased this cereal as a specialty item.  I was very disappointed. Unfortunately, I didn't read the label until after I had gotten home (on me!).  The second ingredient is SUGAR! Gross.  Sugar seems to rob real flavor from foods. The descripton on the front of the box sounded great, but I found that this cereal tasted very similar to over-processed sweetened cereal.
