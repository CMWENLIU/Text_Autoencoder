I think the 5 star reviews of this stuff must be written by people that work for Wabash Valley Farms to keep people buying this oil.<br /><br />This stuff is close to fraud in it's advertising.  No, it is fraud.  This stuff is tasteless and boring.  The first bite and I am wondering what I spent my money on!<br /><br />I have one opened jar and one sealed jar and am trying to decide where I am going to flush it.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it one star is because I could not give it zero stars.
