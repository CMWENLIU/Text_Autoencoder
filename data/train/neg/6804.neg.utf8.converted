I ordered this sampler pack of instant soups and it was delivered very promptly. (arrived within 2 days)<br /><br />The confusing thing is that I'm not sure what I received in the package. I was expecting some instructions and/or information in English.....  but everything on the packaging is in Japanese.  Unfortunately I live in an area of Pennsylvania where there is no Japanese population.<br /><br />The package contained a total of 22 small packets in eight various sized strips .... two packs(4 strips), three packs(2 strips), and four pack (2 strips).<br /><br />I have no idea what is in the packets or how to prepare them.  I assume that they are various kinds of instant soup.<br /><br />Do I combine them?<br />Is each packet a complete soup mix?<br />Does this represent 22 servings?<br /><br />Your guess is as good as mine.  I am going to try to prepare the soup by adding boiling water to each packet.  I'll update this review after I get a chance to experiment.<br /><br />It's like a Dining Adventure!  Wish me luck!
