I thought I would try to cut a few points out of my day by using this chocolate dip to help my cravings...It tasted okay. It was okay with fruit, but the fruit was way sweeter than the chocolate.  It almost tasted like a very bitter chocolate.  I think if I didn't eat any chocolate for a couple months then ate this I would like it, but that's not the case. It will probably sit in my fridge until it expires.
