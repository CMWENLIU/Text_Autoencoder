Bumble Bee used to be a good brand but it has been on a steady decline in quality.<br />Yesterda I opened a can of Bumble Bee "Chunk Light Tuna" in oil and what did I<br />find?...Not one piece of "chunk" of tuna...Instead, I found liquified Tuna Slop<br />swimming in a bath of oil. Even my animals refused it. I bought a store brand,<br />took it home and when I opened it, guess what? - I actually found meat - chunks<br />of light tuna. The store brand was cheaper and the quality was far superior to<br />Bumble Bee. The result: No more Bumble Bee tuna in my future.
