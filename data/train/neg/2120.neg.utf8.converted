The packaging for the Organic Steel Oats was awful.  When I opened the box every single container was opened and there were oats everywhere.  One more thing: the oats were packaged with 12 can of soup.  Poor combination.  No wonder why they burst open.  Amazon must do a better job of protecting the contents for shipment.  They may have already been punctured.  I will return the item.<br /><br />Update: I contacted Amazon about the packaging. Amazon responded to my e-mail within 3 hours. I requested the oats be replaced. Amazon apologized about the packaging and are sending a new shipment. Thank you Amazon for your customer service.
