I did not like this product at all....in fact, I tossed the other bottle in the trash. I was expecting a garlic-flavored dipping oil, but got more of a balsamic-vinegar salad dressing. WHERE'S THE GARLIC??  It was brown in color, with big black chunks of....something in it, maybe the vinegar? I am a very good cook, and sometimes make my own garlic dipping oil. This product was more vinegar than oil. I could barely taste garlic and saw NO slices of garlic in the product. I would not buy any of "Lizzie's Kitchen" products again, due to the fact that this one was so bad-tasting. I do not recommend this product to potential buyers.
