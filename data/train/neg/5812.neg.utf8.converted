I would never buy this product again.  It is the worst quality olive oil--made from the last of the leftovers of the olive pressing process (that is what "pomace" means).  I didn't know that before I bought it, otherwise I wouldn't have!  I had to throw it away--it smelled and tasted rancid.  If you order it, just be aware that it is not a quality olive oil.
