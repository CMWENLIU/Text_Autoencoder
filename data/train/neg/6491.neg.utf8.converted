I was expecting (or hoping) for a different variet of tazo, since I love the Awake and the Zen so much.  What I received was a brown paper bag with 5 Awake and 5 Zen and 1 small tea bag of peppermint.  The reason I gave it 1 star is that I love TAZO K-cups, but not for that price.  I could have 2.5 times the amount for that price.
