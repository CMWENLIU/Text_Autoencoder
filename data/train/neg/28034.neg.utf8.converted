The vitamins defiantly leave an aftertaste. Not really strong, but strong enough that both of my teens were not willing to drink it again.  I found it better in ice tea, but I could also taste the vitamins.<br /><br />The bottle has one of those seals that have a little flap you pull on.  It did not work, the flap pulled off before the seal, so  I had to get a knife to open the seal.<br /><br />The bottle is large, and needs to be refrigerated after opening.<br />I always test these drinks for staining by squirting a little on a cotton rag and throwing it in with the wash.  This stains.  I was able to get it out with a 3 hour soak in stain remover.<br /><br />Overall, disappointing but not horrific.
