I purchased these at walmart but they were so bad I wanted to come review them so you guys online can be warned.  I brewed myself a cup and it was so bad I couldn't even drink it, i had to throw it out.  First off, I want to say that I'm not a cappuccino snob, I enjoy a great cappuccino at a coffee shop but I also regularly drink the powdered flavored kind that you just mix with water.  I didn't have the highest of standards for this drink to begun with but it was bad, t doesn't have very much flavor the flavor that it does have is not good, it's watery (I brewed it on the small cup setting) and it has a bad aftertaste that I just couldn't get over.  These are also pretty expensive for what you get and you are much better off in my opinion to just go to get a mix with water types.
