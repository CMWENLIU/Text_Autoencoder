The federal government wants Organo Gold to stop using its USDA organic seal.<br /><br />Prado, one of the company's representatives at the packed meeting room, called the product miraculous.<br /><br />"Our thing is not to sell it. It's like to let other people know what this product is," she said.<br /><br />She claimed she didn't sell any of products. Pardo said she makes money by "introducing to the people, a healthy coffee."<br /><br />Organo Gold is a multi-level marketing plan. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott says some multi-level marketing plans are legitimate, if a person is paid only for the product sold.<br /><br />It's illegal if payment is calculated on the number of distributors recruited.<br /><br />Two people complained to the state about Organo Gold and its business practices.
