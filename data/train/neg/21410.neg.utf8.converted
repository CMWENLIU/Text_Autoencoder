I ordered this product because it was organic and easy when out and about with my baby.  However, we I received my order, one of the pouches I noticed had been punctured and was moldy.  I threw it out thinking it must have been a fluke, however I ended up with another punctured pouch (that wasn't moldy, thank God) because I fed half of it to my baby before I realized it had been punctured.  I was disgusted and concerned that my baby had eaten it.  I went to the companies webpage, found no phone number so I emailed them at a provided email about the packaging issue, and never heard a peep out of them in response to my concern.  I was kind and undemanding, just notifying them of the issue and they didn't even have the courtesy to respond.  I will not purchase Plum organics again.  I will stick to Happy Baby or Sprout.
