I used this gelatin to make marshmallows. When it was hot it smelled VERY bad. I called the company and they said, "the beef gelatin has always smelled more than the pork." The marshmallows came out very good, but the smell was so bad I remember it and it turned my stomach. It does not smell in the package at room temperature.<br /><br />Addition: After wondering why boiled cartilage would smell so bad, I looked at the FDA website. The production of gelatin seems to be completely un-inspected. The FDA has no jurisdiction over post food production items like this. The FDA says that this industry uses dropped cows and other items designated as not suitable for food.<br /><br />From the FDA:<br /><br />"Domestically, generally human food that<br />contains meat only in a relatively small proportion or that<br />historically has not been considered by consumers to be products of the<br />meat food industry (e.g., soup stock, beef flavors and extracts,<br />gelatin), is not produced under USDA inspection (see definition of<br />``meat food product'' in 21 U.S.C. 601(j)) and may be physically<br />available for use in FDA-regulated human food and cosmetics. Further,<br />even when excluded from human food produced in USDA-inspected<br />establishments, prohibited cattle materials may leave the<br />establishments for inedible rendering or destruction. These materials,<br />which previously have not been explicitly prohibited in human food and<br />cosmetics by FDA, might then be used in FDA-regulated human food or<br />cosmetics. For example, prohibited cattle materials leaving a USDA-<br />inspected facility might not be denatured sufficiently to preclude<br />their use in FDA-regulated human food and cosmetics.<br />  Under the Food Safety and Inspection Services' (FSIS') rule, SRMs,<br />small intestine from all cattle, and material from nonambulatory<br />disabled cattle must be designated as inedible. However, certain<br />products, such as gelatin and collagen (which are both covered by the<br />provisions of this rule) used in FDA-regulated human food and<br />cosmetics, have traditionally been produced from cattle material deemed<br />inedible by the USDA. Therefore, such a designation by the USDA may not<br />be enough to preclude use of prohibited cattle materials in FDA-<br />regulated products without additional regulation by FDA. Further, some<br />cattle are not slaughtered under continuous USDA inspection (e.g., some<br />are sent directly to rendering). Cattle material from these animals,<br />such as brains or bones which include SRMs, could end up as starting<br />material for human food, such as meat extracts or gelatin,<br />respectively. Furthermore, if prohibited cattle materials were used in<br />FDA-regulated human food or cosmetics, the rule would facilitate FDA's<br />ability to use the enforcement mechanisms of the Federal Food, Drug,<br />and Cosmetic Act (the act) that apply to adulterated products (e.g.,<br />seizure) to prevent human exposure to the prohibited cattle materials."<br />Federal Register - 69FR 42255 July 14, 2004: Interim Final Rule -- Use of Materials Derived From Cattle in Human Food and Cosmetics<br /><br />[...]
