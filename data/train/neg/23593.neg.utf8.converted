These have to be the worst tasting banana peppers i had. They taste like battery acid that water to dull the acid. These do not even taste good and they are not hot at all no hint to them. I had about 5 people taste these and they all spit them out in the trash. They would not even take these for free and i got 6 jars what a waste of money and shocked how badly they taste. If i got a bad batch sorry but 2 jars i tried are to bad tasting. I rather eat grass in vinegar then this.
