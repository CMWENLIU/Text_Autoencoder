I was very hopeful about this product.  While I did not expect anything close to real apple cider, an occasional warm apple flavored drink at work was a welcome idea.  And while this product is sugar free (sweetened with aspartame), that didn't scare me away as I've enjoyed some other drink products sweeted with aspartame.  Well, I brought my new purchase to work this morning, and brewed my first cup.  The aroma was pleasant ... could smell the apple right away and then a few moments later could smell the caramel.  But then I tasted it - and it was awful!  I sipped it hot, sipped it warm, and even tried another cup with a different amount of water.  I'm done!  The taste is extremely chemical with little to no apple taste (nor caramel).  Not sure if I can return the product (will be checking) but if not I will be throwing it away as I would not be comfortable offering to anyone!
