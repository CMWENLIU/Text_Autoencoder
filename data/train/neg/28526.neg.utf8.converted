I was misled by the high reviews of this coffe (somehow I forgot that we are in Folgers land here) so I bought a 4-pack. This coffee tastes awfully like robusta, and probably is made moustly out of robusta (interested parties can inquire about robusta vs arabica in the coffee blends, but let's just say that any decent coffee blend is made out of 100% arabica. Robusta is mixed in cheap blends because it is cheap. Tastes awful too... ). Also, the price of this coffe does not reflect the low quality - it should be way cheaper.<br />I normally buy Lavazza Oro, but somehow the quality of that coffee deteriorated in the last year or so).
