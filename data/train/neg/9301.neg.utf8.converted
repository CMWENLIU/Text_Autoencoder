Had this product for about 2 weeks now. Not particularly satisfied as of yet. Like others have stated the problem with leakage is annoying & makes a mess, not to mention a weaker brew. Tried pulling the rubber seal/grommet down to account for an apparent gap between the Keurig coffee maker and the K-cap. This seemed to help a little but not enough to keep me from having to place a dishcloth under my coffee mug to avoid a bigger, longer clean-up. Haven't tried the foil trick yet because I've discovered that trick works very well with the My K-cup device, without having to buy pre-packaged K-cups, use them once, clean them out, let them dry, use the K-cap, adjust the seal, clean the mess...<br /><br />I'm not sure whether to send the K-caps back or keep troubleshooting until I find a solution. Since placing the foil on the My K-cup filter prior to putting on the plastic lid works as well with my Keurig coffee maker as the pre-packaged K-cups I probably wont have a need for the K-caps.<br /><br />p.s. I still purchase the pre-packaged K-cups since some of them have outstanding flavor. I just don't discard them in my trash can. *HINT* They recycle nicely after removing the foil & filter.
