Dear Friends,<br />I ordered this pack and I received in good shape. I tried 2 packets (of the 12 pack) and both were pathetic(completly sour) in taste. The packing does say best before Mar 2012, and it is SPOILED and SOUR in taste(I am from India and have been drinking coconut water everyday for the last 6-7 years, so I know the taste of it). This might be due to high temperature in shipping from Brazil to my home(including all intermediate stops).I found Indian brand "Nirav" of good taste, and in future I would buy Nirav.
