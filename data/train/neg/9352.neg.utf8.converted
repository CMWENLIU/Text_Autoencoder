We ordered The Amazing Celebration through Amazon, for $80, supposedly a deep discount.  The food arrived about when we expected it, and while the dry ice was gone, the food was all still frozen.  So far, we've had the sirloin steak, stuffed potatoes, pork chops, chocolate cake, and stuffed sole.  The sirloin and pork were decent, but no better than typical grocery store quality.  The meat at Costco is better and much cheaper.  The potatoes were good, and quite convenient.  The chocolate cake was pretty good, and with a short time in the microwave was like an expensive "molten chocolate" sort of cake from a restaurant.  The stuffed sole was disappointing.  It was OK, but no better than what I'd expect at a cheap restaurant.  In short, Omaha Steak food is less expensive than good restaurant food, but also less convenient and not nearly as good.  It's more convenient than getting everything from a grocery store, but much more expensive and not as good.  If convenience is your main goal, and you aren't too picky about price or quality, then Omaha Steaks is a good choice.
