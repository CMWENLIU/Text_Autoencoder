The flowers were great. They know how to deliver there. The pot is very small though. I was only able to pour one cup of tea from it. And the tea? That was a joke. Mine tasted ABOSOLUTELY horrible! I couldn't drink it. Maybe some people who like bitter, overly herbal tastes will like this but I like my tea lighter.<br /><br />(The teapot also burned my hand a little as the glass is so thin- please be careful!)
