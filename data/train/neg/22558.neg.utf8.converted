I like the similac formula bottles.  However, I was looking to find these bottles for a lower price through Amazon, so I came to order these bottles.  My understanding from the way the product was described is that there were 24 cases of 6 bottles, not 24 bottles total.  At 24 bottles total (which is what I received), this is a worse price than what I pay at my grocery store (which is the most expensive place I have bought them).
