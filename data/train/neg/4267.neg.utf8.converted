Received this in a gift basket, it tastes good but.....and it is a BIG BUT.....look on the ingredients listed and the pumpkin seeds in the mix are imported from China.??  I apologize and hope I don't offend but I refuse to give my children untested food imported from China given the current manufacturing problems they have had over there with toxins and chemicals placed in food products (I.E.  baby formula)  These must be extremely cheap pumpkin seeds to warrant this which makes me nervous, why else import them from China and not use USA pumkin seeds?  Sorry, will take a closer look at all ingredients from "Anna"s House" in the future.
