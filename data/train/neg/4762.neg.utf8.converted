I had just come back from NYC and had dilled green tomatoes.  I was craving this food.  I did research and this item seemed to be what I was looking for.<br /><br />The picture is misleading.  I got my package.  I was horrified.  I was expecting large, crunchy dilled tomatoes.<br /><br />To my great disappointment.  The tomatoes were cherry tomatoes.  The tomatoes had no crunch and very little dill.  I spat out what was in my mouth.  I am, also, upset for you cannot return the product unless their error.<br /><br />Do not waste your money on this product.
