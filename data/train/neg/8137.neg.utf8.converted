Don't order from Faerie's finest, you will be wasting your time. Order your product from somewhere else.<br />Ingredients were not available for shipment when they promised and I kept calling for a status of my order. Every time they told me the same thing: "next week we'll receive the ingredients and after that we'll ship the product". Over an over the same thing until I got tired and I had to cancel my order. The person on the phone was not willing to help or answer my questions. Very frustrating and a waste of time.
