I have the nespresso tassimo machine and I love it. I also love starbuck christmas blend and have missed it since I got my machine. I thought these little caps would do the trick. They kind of work. The resulting coffee is pretty watery- the capsule look like they are not sturdy enough to handle the pressure of the machine, they are shrunken after use- unlike the real nespresso capsules. The coffee that comes out (again I am talking starbuck christmas blend) tastes fine, but is weak in overall strength and looks really watery. PLUS after foaming up my milk and adding it to the coffee- the coffee instanly 'melts/pops' all of the foam. Nespresso must do something to their coffee to make it not do this. I find this a point none of the other reviews touch upon.
