i love amazon, and i love these bars! but ordering off of the internet is NOT the way to go on these and i should have listened to the other reviews..in this case, you get what you pay for..i but these religiously at multiple stores locally and they are always soft and fresh..as other reviewers mentioned, ordering from amazon, they come in hard as rocks! inedible and when i went to return them, they say you cant!!!!!! i will be contacting my cc company as i paid $40 some dollars for stale food..will NOT be ordering these again..VERY DISAPPOINTED!
