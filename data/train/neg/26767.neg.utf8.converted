Delivered October 4, 2010.  Expires in barely two months on December 5, 2010.  I signed up for "Subscribe & Save" every six months so I could have one tin a month of this flavor, but it makes no sense to do so since four months before I get another delivery the batch will be past the expiration.  I'm really disappointed since other purchases I've made through Amazon have never had this issue.  The coffee itself is good and one of the few decafs I've tried with a nice flavor, but you need to drink it quick before you have to toss it.
