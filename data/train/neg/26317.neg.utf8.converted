The syrups were too thick, which means that you have to mix it into the shaved ice rather than just pour it over the top.  There is so much food coloring that you can taste it.  Obviously, I expected food coloring, but I hate it when there's so much it affects the flavor.  My daughter only liked the blue raspberry flavor.  I won't buy again.
