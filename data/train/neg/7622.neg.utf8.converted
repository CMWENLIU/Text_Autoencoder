For starters, I'm not an anti-Splenda fanatic. I've been a user for years, and despite internet sites claiming that Splenda is the equivalent of radioactive waste, my hair is still thick, my brain still works, and my doctor says all my organs are just fine.  That said, Splenda with fiber is one of the silliest insults to consumer intelligence out there.<br /><br />The envelope that Splenda with fiber comes in is much more rigid than the standard issue packet, and appears to be foil reinforced.  It is so stiff that you can't do the customary snap of the wrist to move the powder to the bottom, so that when you tear open the packet you don't make a mess.  No luck with this packet, which might stop a bullet if placed in your vest pocket.<br /><br />Next, the powder sinks to the bottom of your favorite beverage (mine being coffee)....and STAYS there.  It does not dissolve instantly, in fact it puddles at the bottom of your cup.  If you happen to zap your coffee in the microwave, it carmelizes:  a thick, slightly brown, hard to scrub out goo becomes adherent to the cup bottom.<br /><br />A gram of fiber in every packet?  Come ON, Splenda people!  A bit of corn (corn is the source of fiber in this product)in your morning beverage is NOT where you want to go nutritionally! If you get your fiber from whole grains, fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, you also get the added benefit of vitamins and anti-oxidants.  If you get it from your artificial sweetener, you get...a brown gooey mess at the bottom of your cup.<br /><br />AND, Splenda with fiber costs more than regular Splenda.  I'm a family physician, and what the Splenda people appear to have done conforms to a very familiar pattern in the pharmaceutical world:  as the patent expires on the original medication, modify the product slightly, get a new patent, and keep charging the higher (non-generic) price.  Sucralose is now generic/off-patent, and available in multiple brands cheaper than Splenda.<br /><br />Argh.  Eat healthy foods.  Exercise.  Forget paying significantly more for 1 gram of fiber in your Splenda.  This product is dually hampered:  it under-performs, and it is an idea that makes little to no nutritional sense.
