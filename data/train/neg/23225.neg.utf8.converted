This product does not ship with all of the flavors that were advertised. I received raspberry, mint, and french vanilla. I received NO plain chocolate which is the best of the flavors, in my opinion.<br /><br />The raspberry and french vanilla taste fake and chemical-y as well as being too sweet even for a sweet-tooth like myself.<br /><br />Save yourself the trouble and bad aftertaste: only order Chocolate Supreme. Avoid the Variety Pack.
