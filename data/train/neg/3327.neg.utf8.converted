Well I'm mystified.  I received a can of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink</a> to review and loved it.  Good expresso flavor with a hint of cocoa and not too sweet.  BUT the plain Illy Issimo caffe drink... yuck.  It had a metallic taste and I couldn't even finish half of it.<br /><br />You would think quality would be more consistent across lines, but I'll be buying the Cappuccino and avoiding this product.<br />Pam T~
