I bought a box of these after tasting a sample at my local Costco - they were pretty good (and I was hungry).  We like to eat natural, healthy snacks and this looked promising.  I picked up a box and brought it home, but imagine my surprise when my husband notices that these are a product of China!<br /><br />I could go on and on - from political implications to safety concerns - I avoid buying things made in China, but let's just say that I definitely don't want FOOD produced and shipped from China! At the very least, I now find these less than appealing...<br /><br />Check the fine print before making your next purchase!
