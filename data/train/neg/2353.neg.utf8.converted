I tried this not knowing if I would like it or not, I love ginger ale, ginger beer, ginger oookies, but don't like hunks of it in an entree, so I thought the ginger with lemon sounded really appealing as a hot drink I could have at work.  It came in a little pouch like a teabag, but with loose bits.  You apparently can drink it hot or cold, and I tried hot.  It wouldn't have mattered much though, the ginger taste is so extreme it would only be for people who LOVE ginger in all of it's forms.  I couldn't finish it, it was just too much for me.  So, for ginger lovers only all others should probably steer clear.
