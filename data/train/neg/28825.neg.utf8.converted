These seeds smelled disgusting, were WASHED, and worthless - International Spice brand (listed under a new name with FAKE reviews! I'm VERY informed on and experienced in, the culinary arts of poppy seed recipes and I know good, decent, and total garbage -- these were the latter. I never take the time to write reviews, but the reviews I read, that led me to buy these, I suspect must have been authored by the seller and or associates; notice they ALL mention tea and are the very poorly rated International Spice Brand incognito - don't take my word for it, just do your homework to confirm this; also, look into these "reviewers". I wanted to warn people not to waste their money if they are looking for HIGH quality seeds.
