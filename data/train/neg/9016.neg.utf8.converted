These new cookies by Nabisco won't be purchased by my wife or I unless there is a special clearance sale.  There is an aftertaste in each bite that left me and my kids wondering if we'd just brushed our teeth.  The gooey center was more like a thin film of fudge, and nothing gushed out like the picture led us to believe.  The cookies are very thin, and not worth the caloric intake.
