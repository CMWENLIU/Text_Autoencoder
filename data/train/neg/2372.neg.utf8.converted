First time using Great Western brand.  I usually use Gold Medal but decided to save a few bucks.  Yuck.  Big mistake.  The aroma and flavor were sub-par.  While the customers still liked it ok, I found it almost unpleasant with chemical overtones rather than the soft rich vanilla I expected.  And the texture was tough and gummy and it soaked up the humidity like a sponge.  I had to keep clearing the buildup on the inside of the bowl and the cleanup afterwards was like getting melted gummy bears off.  I've never had this much of a problem with Gold Medal or even plain white sugar even on the muggiest days and today was a pleasant summer day with modest humidity.<br /><br />Bottom line, cannot recommend and will never use again.  Trying to decide if I pour out the remainder or not.  Don't like serving customers something I wouldn't touch.
