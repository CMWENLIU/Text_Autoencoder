After several months and much wasted milk I've given up on these grains. I'm pretty experienced with kefir making. I've bought kefir grains before, but always live, never dried. I followed the reviving directions exactly, but the resulting kefir smelled and tasted foul, there was always too much moldy "flowers of kefir" after just one or two days, and there was never any kefirian.
