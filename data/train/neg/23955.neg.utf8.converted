Whatever you do, don't try to use these squeeze bottles for thin liquids---they leak around the top every time you turn them over to use them, shake them up, etc. A particularly thick sauce should work fine. I also don't really like the little red stoppers---they're so tiny they're very easy to drop and lose.
