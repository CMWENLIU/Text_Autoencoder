I have used these bags for the past 6 months. I used to love them and liked that they are biodegradable, but the last box I bought contained a lot of damaged bags. I thought it was one bad batch, but it keeps happening with bags from different batches. I have lost over 30 ounces of breast milk in the past month and one day didn't have the regular amount to send with my son to daycare. Breastfeeding mamas know the devastation of losing even an ounce can cause so losing this much has been beyond upsetting.  I caution you to be very careful when using these bags for milk storage.
