This is the worst split pea soup I have ever tasted. There are way too many onions... I usually like a lot of onions in soup, but this was ridiculous. There were more onions than peas! It tasted more like I was eating onion soup with "split pea" flavor. On top of that, the onions did not even taste fresh, they were bitter. Amy's usually makes great products, but they desperately need to change this soup. I give it 2 stars only because it is healthy, and there might be a small chance of someone liking this if they like tons of onions.<br /><br />Walnut Acres' Split Pea soup used to be perfect, but they changed their recipe recently after I reviewed it. It is still ok and still tastes better than Amy's Split Pea.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZLJY">Walnut Acres Organic Soups, Split Pea, Fat Free, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>
