I am a FULL-ON tea drinker.  I drink green tea and black tea all day long and when it comes to my breakfast tea, it HAS to be a one-two punch or I'll revert back to my bad coffee habit.  I quit about a year ago but I do still ache for that incomparable aroma that only coffee can give!!  I am having a pretty good go of my Twinings Breakfast Tea and TAZO's Awake still does it for me but I'm always on the look-out for a stronger breakfast tea and TAYLOR's is NOT IT!  I wan't the equivalent of starbucks for my black tea so sometimes I double-up on the tea bags.  I could have dumped the entire box of Taylor's in my cup and it still would have been too meek and mild for me.  So, if you enjoy a cup of flavored water with a tinge of black food coloring, this is just the tea for you :)
