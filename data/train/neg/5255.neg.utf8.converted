"Eden Organic Baked Beans" have some great things going for it. Low salt, fat free,cholesterol free, organic, a good source of,protein(8 g per serving),potassium, calcium and iron.All those things are what I'm looking for and the only reason I give 2 stars. But the one area they are lacking is good taste. I am not new to low sodium foods. I have been using and on the look out for it for years. Always trying to find something that tastes good as well as is healthy. The products seem to be getting better and better and I have recommended several items. My favorite at this time is Amy's brand. I would especially recommend<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G18NR0">Amy's Light in Sodium Organic Minestrone Soup, 14.1-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> (see my review for details)to anyone trying to switch over to low sodium as an example of how good it can be. But Amy's didn't have any low sodium baked beans, so I decided to give this Eden brand a try.<br /><br />I guess if i could only use one word to describe the taste - it would be "blechhh". It leaves a horrible sour sort of after taste in my mouth that makes me shudder, and they are really dry going down. I wouldn't recommend buying these in bulk. If you see these at your local market and want to try a can for yourself, that would be advisable, but have some applesauce or some other favorite side to wash these down.<br /><br />One other good thing I could say is that they have a long shelf life. Which is where they will stay - on my shelf - unless I have some big emergency, and even then I'd have to be desperate.<br /><br />Ingredients for those interested are:<br />Organic Navy beans,Water,Organic Sorghum,Tomato Puree,Organic Apple Cider Vinegar,Organic Mustard seed,Organic Onion and spices, sea salt.<br /><br />Sorry but this is one healthy product I can't recommend.....Laurie
