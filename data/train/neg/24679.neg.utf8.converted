Lays Dill Pickle potato chips are delicious.  I would recommend that anyone who likes a tangy chip give this brand a try, as other brands I've tried don't have a good balance of acidity and saltiness and can therefore totally overwhelm the palate.<br /><br />HOWEVER, Lays Dill Pickle potato chips are NOT so delicious that anyone should be paying $21.98 (including shipping) for JUST ONE bag of them.  You can purchase the same-sized package of these at a brick-and-mortar grocery store for $3-4 with sales tax.  I realize that this flavor is not available in certain regions of the country, and I realize that the point of having an Amazon store is to turn a profit, but the listed price here is nothing less than ridiculous.  Shame on this seller.
