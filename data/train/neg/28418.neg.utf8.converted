This review applies specifically to the loose leaf variety of PG Tips. I would give the bagged version five stars.<br /><br />Following the directions printed on the box to use 1tsp of tea per serving, the loose leaf variety of PG Tips does not offer substantial savings over the bagged variety. These 250G boxes contain as much tea as the eighty-bag boxes, and this six-pack of 250G loose leaf boxes contains as much tea as the two-pack of 240 bags also offered here on Amazon. The price difference? Three dollars.<br /><br />The savings is negligible for such a large quantity of tea, and, as far as I can tell, the loose leaf form of PG Tips is actually the same exact stuff that is inside PG Tips teabags. That's disappointing. When you pop open one of these loose leaf boxes, you may be disappointed to find that the contents aren't really leaves at all. Rather, you get finely ground (or perhaps more accurately "pulverized") clippings of tea leaves--the same dusty powder you'll find if you rip open a PG Tips teabag. Factor in the need for some kind of infuser or tea filter and you've already overstepped the price line between the bags and the loose "leaves." Then you also have the extra effort of filling your infuser and washing it afterward to deal with.<br /><br />To make matters worse, this stuff is hard as crap to brew even with an infuser. The fineness of the tea particles is, well, too fine. These little clippings have a tendency to escape from whatever you put them in and get into your cuppa, and it's not very pleasant to get a mouthful of them at the bottom of the cup. There are two working solutions I have found. One is to use spice bags made out of cheesecloth. These can be homemade, but I purchased mine at Bed Bath and Beyond. Reusable bags take a few minutes to clean after each use but are inexpensive and can last a good long while. Alternatively, there are premade paper tea filters out there that are exactly like tea bags. If you buy these, you will pay more than the cost of just buying the already-bagged version of the tea. Either way, regular infusers probably won't cut it.<br /><br />The flavor of PG Tips--both bagged and loose--is perfect. It's the best black tea I've had. It's basically a very strong English breakfast tea that brews very dark but does not get bitter (even if oversteeped). This tea also makes great iced tea. Something like four teaspoons of this or four bags of the bagged variety steeped in three to three and a half liters of water with a quarter cup sugar added makes iced black tea that tastes very much like something you would get at a restaurant. Though the loose leaf version of PG Tips makes the same excellent tea that the bagged version does, I cannot rate it above one star because it is essentially a less convenient and more expensive version of a similar product. I'm disappointed.
