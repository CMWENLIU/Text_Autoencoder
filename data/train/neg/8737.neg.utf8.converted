Planters has reformulated these peanuts to greatly reduce there hotness and spiciness. In Amazon's product image above, the peanuts appear thoroughly coated in chili pepper; but, in the image I uploaded, you'll see that the peanuts now only have a light dusting of pepper and salt. So, be advised, before spending a fairly substantial amount for 108 packs of these peanuts, you should first buy a smaller quantity -- because they may not be what you expected.
