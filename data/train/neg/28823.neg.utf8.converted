I was anticipating this package with great excitment!<br />I was in such a mood to bake coconut cake!<br />Unfortunately, i received two lemons instead and no coconut extract.<br />Some of the bottle labels seem a little worn on the edges, as if they either got worn out with time in storage or they were old.<br />There was no expiration dates on the bottles.<br />Though I had wanted to give this seller a chance, I chose in the end to return the entire order item.<br />Safety first!<br />Too bad!
