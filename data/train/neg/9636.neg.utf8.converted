I have had my Aerogarden for about nine months.  I am definitely not impressed.  I planted my first set of gourmet herbs which came with the garden, and all I ever got to harvest and use was tons of basil, more than I could ever use, and a little cilantro.  The dill, mint, chives, and parsley never grew big enough to use.  And I was really looking forward to picking fresh sprigs of mint anytime I wanted to make a mojito.  I have been waiting months for that mojito.  My results never looked anything like the big bushes of herbs they show on the infomercials.  I planted my second round of herbs about 6 weeks ago.  This time, most of my herbs did not even germinate.  And my pump rattles ridiculously loud.  I e-mailed the company and they are more than helpful and are sending out a new seed kit and a new pump.  I am not looking forward to installing that pump after reading others experiences.  For the money, it is not worth the very small amount of useable herbs.
