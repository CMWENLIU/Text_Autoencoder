This is advertised as an Extra Virgin Olive Oil Super Premium. Not so. Upon receipt the label says olive oil and grapeseed oil. Cloying and dominate grapeseel oil flavor. Neither the Red Chli, the Meyer Lemon, nor the Blood Orange Infused rises to the flavor profile expectation. Plus that grapeseed oil dominance is nastique. I ended up throwing all three bottles in the trash. I would never buy any of this product line ever again. Very disappointed.<br />After many years of purchasing from Amazon, this is my first disappointment.
