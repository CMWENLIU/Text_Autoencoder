These are hard as rock and I have 10 Boxes which got expired. Waste of money !!!. I wish amazon did a better job in checking products which are sold by them.<br /><br />It defeats the whole purpose of buying grocery like non perishable items from a website instead of buying from a local grocery store.<br /><br />If amazon is to succeed in grocery business, they do need to do a better job in vendor product verification in terms of quality.
