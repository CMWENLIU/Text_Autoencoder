I bought these assorted pops so that I could experience the flavors of childhood....all SIX flavors advertised on the box.  What I wound up with was unbelievable.  Here is the breakdown of all the pops I received in this assorted box:<br /><br />Grape=58<br />Cherry=40<br />Watermelon=1<br />Blue Raspberry (my favorite and reason for buying)=1<br />Orange=0<br />Strawberry=0<br /><br />I was so disappointed.  If you really want an assortment, or you are trying to have a decent number of your favorite flavors that aren't sold alone, you will be disappointed too.  I attached a photo above of all the varieties separated to show how unbalanced the assortment really is.
