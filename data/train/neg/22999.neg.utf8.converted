Campbells certainly has its moments, but this ain't one of 'em! This soup's got beef...it's got barley...what could possibly go wrong? Let me tell you...instead of including some onions and bell peppers...maybe some garlic, they decided to throw in a shipload of their hideous minestrone-type vegetables. The beef was overcooked, dry, and nearly tasteless. You can't even taste the barley, through the flavor of old, canned carrots. The only reason I didn't give this swill one star, is that there is undoubtedly some nutritional value to it...'caveat emptor'.
