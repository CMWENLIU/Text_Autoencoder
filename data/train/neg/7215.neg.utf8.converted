I have been looking all over for a lid that will fit both sizes of 3 oz. cat food cans -- some brands such as Before Grain and Blue Buffalo Wilderness have slightly oversized 3 oz. cans compared to Fancy Feast or Wellness.  Lids that I have seen at the pet store and elsewhere fit the smaller cans, but not the slightly larger ones.  Anyway, these Petmate lids did fit both size 3 oz. cans, along with two sizes of larger cans. HOWEVER, the plastic is so stiff and hard that they are next to impossible to snap on and off.  They were basically unusable and I threw them away.<br /><br />I also ordered another brand of lids (OurPets) for small cans and they are a dream.  They fit both sizes of small cans and are soft and easy to put on and take off.  Would recommend them over the Petmate Kitty-Kaps for sure.
