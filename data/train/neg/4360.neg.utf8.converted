Honestly, I cant understand why this pasta gets such high marks.  I tried it and it is nowhere close to normal pasta.<br /><br />Since being told I have to be gluten free, finding a good pasta substitute has been difficult.<br />All these rice pasta brands are glue-y, sticky and slimey in texture.  this one is a little less so but it still has that wierd slimy, sticky quality.  the rice noodles are pasty colored too.  not appetizing at all.  And all this gluten free marketed stuff is hideously expensive so trying all the different brands gets costly.<br /><br />I have found the quinoa+corn based noodles to be the closest thing to real pasta -- The texture is much better.  I'm still trying to find something I can live with but so far, the quinoa pasta seems to be the most acceptable.
