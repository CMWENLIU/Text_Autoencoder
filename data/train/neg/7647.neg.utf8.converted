I should have read the reviews on these!  About half of the chews in the bag were the thickness of a pencil.  It took my dog no more than 2 minutes to chew through one of these.  These sticks are probably cheaper at Petco.  The only reason I ordered them was to bring my Amazon order over $25 so I could get free shipping.  What a waste of money!
