Upon first taste, I thought that I was really going to like this cereal. I thought that it was another version of Quaker's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YPMKRC">Honey Graham O's Cereal, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>. As such, I was pretty excited. I mean, I like Oh!s. It's one of my favorite cereals.<br /><br />Then the aftertaste caught me. And made me start looking at the ingredient list. I am guessing that it is the corn bran that they put in here, but the aftertaste is somewhere between burned popcorn and Honey Smacks (you know...the one with Dig 'Em Frog). Not so much ideal.<br /><br />If you don't mind the aftertaste, it's pretty reasonable cereal. There are only around 100 calories per 3/4 cup serving, so it's not terribly bad for you like many oversweetened cereal. I think that this is probably the vanguard of an effort by Kellog's to sweeten their cereals with honey, but they haven't quite gotten it figured out just yet. Unlike the other reviewers, I didn't think that it was super sweet, but it certainly was sweeter than my normal cereal.<br /><br />ALLERGY WARNING: THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS PEANUTS.<br /><br />Harkius
