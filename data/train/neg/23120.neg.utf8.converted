This is described as a "1-Pound jar of mushrooms". Well opening the packaging I was surprised to see that the jar was half full. One huge jar literally half full of very small slices of very dark, very dusty mushrooms. I use dried mushrooms a few times a week and have bought them from many different sources, including from a street seller in China. I have bought dried mushrooms from other sellers on Amazon but I will never ever buy these from this seller again. "Ultra AAA"? I don't think so!<br />(I took a picture, but am unable to attach it. A pity.)
