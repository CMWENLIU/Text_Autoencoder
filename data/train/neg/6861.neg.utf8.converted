I bought these cause I'm a chocolate snap lover, and I had been craving some. The lack of trans fats and description drew me in.<br /><br />Let's just say this: I took these over to a family party, and none of the kids liked it. NOT ONE. And most of the adults, the best they could say was, 'Eh.' I think two folks had more than one.<br /><br />I'd have to say skip these cookies. They don't make your mouth sing with chocolatey snappy joy.
