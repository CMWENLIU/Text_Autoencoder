When I purchased this item the ingredients on amazon did NOT say that it was made with soy oil.  My son is alergic to wheat, milk, soy, peanut and eggs.  I was so happy when I found this because it was affordable and (I thought) he could actually eat it.  When it came I was really upset to find that it's made with soy, not canola like it states.  Amazon should fix the discription.  I ended up bringing the bars into my classroom and giving them away.
