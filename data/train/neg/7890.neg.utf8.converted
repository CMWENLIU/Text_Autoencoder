For the first time, I'm going to look into returning a purchase to Amazon, sorry.  I expected jumbo lump crab, but got some totally wet, soggy, tasteless lumps of white pieces of crab.  I've had jumbo lump crab in the past, this is not it.  For some reason, it's packed in some sort of liquid and then the can is lined with some sort of paper substance.  I've used this companies products for many years, this is not up to their usual standards.  The pieces are quit small, like they came from a small crabs and they are saturated with liquid.  Lump crab that I have bought previously in the pouch has almost no  liquid run off and consequently the crab is tasty and solid.  Krab tastes better to me.  I thought it was a good deal as the price per pound computed to be about half what I usually pay, but a bad bargain to say the least.
