I bought a tree from BonsaiBoy web site and Im dissapointed about my purchase. The actual tree is nothing like the one in the product picture on the web site. It is just a straight trunked tree about 2-3 years old potted in a bonsai pot. I could have bought a nicer looking tree from Home Depot and pruned it myself to make it look greater than this. This order costed me around $70 including shipping and the humidity tray. The tray doesnt match the pot (too larget for the pot), so i cant use to diaplay the tree. I bought a nice tree from JoeBonsai couple months ago and i was so happy with that purchase. The tree exactly looked like the one on the product image and i love tree. If you are looking to buy a tree, i recommend JoeBonsai over BonsaiBoy.
