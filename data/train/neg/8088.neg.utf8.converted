I got these grapes as a gift.  Upon opening the box I had no idea what I was getting...and then I opened a ziploc of a handful of grapes that say "FRESH RED GRAPES" in sharpie marker on the bag.  These were not sent priority mail nor was there an ice pack with them.  If someone is selling grapes I would at least expect them to come in some sort of packaging.  Also, I noticed that shipping was more than the price of the grapes and way more than needed to send them.  Overall, I feel the sellers took advantage.  Needless to say, I will not be eating these.  They are questionable.
