Don't buy this if you think you're buying organic macaroni and cheese.  I guess I'm more than shocked about how this is fraudulently advertised on Amazon.com.  In its product features, it says: "Made with organic cheddar cheese."  This is blatantly false.  When you receive the Mac and Cheese, it's packaged in a neat little "Back to Nature" box announcing its support of the Nature Conservancy on the back of the box giving it the veneer of being "natural."  However, if you read the ingredients, not even the cheddar cheese is organic.  There is no organic certifier to be found, either.<br /><br />Now, this actually breaks the National Organic Program standards and should be investigated by the Agriculture Department.  This changes my whole view of Kraft -- not that it was especially good before.  But apparently, this company buys into the "greenwashing" effort to try to cash in on the good organic name without actually supporting the type of food system we expect when we buy organic.
