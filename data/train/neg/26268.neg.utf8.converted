I've tried and liked other McDougall's soups, but this one was awful. The beans and vegetables were still way too hard after letting set for double the suggested time. Also, it was extremely gritty, like there was dirt in it! I threw it out after two bites because I thought I might break my teeth out on the grit. I recommend the Miso soup and Vegetarian Chicken Ramen... maybe they just haven't worked out issues with the dehydrated beans?
