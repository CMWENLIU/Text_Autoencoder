While this was brewing, I was excited.  It smelled like a bonafide donut shop in my kitchen.  Was I really going to be able to drink a chocolate donut without the calories?  Not so much.  It has a distinct chemical taste to it that even creamer and sugar cannot fix.  I actually gave it away to a friend that likes it for some unknown reason.
