I am allergic to soy. I bought a case of this soup, thinking I could share the case with two friends who are gluten intolerant. WRONG! The description says "Contains no soy, Contains no GMO's, Contains gluten", and I simply read it wrong, adding a 'no' in front of the gluten. Looking through the reviews, I'm not the only one who made this mistake. Luckily I can keep the rest of the soup for myself, so it wasn't a total waste. It's not an amazing soup, I don't know that I'd want to eat it by itself, but it's good for what I need it for - a soy-free cream of mushroom soup that I can use in casseroles, etc. For that, it's great!<br /><br />IMPORTANT EDIT: After using this soup for a few months, I started having a reaction to it. The Amy's brand is vegetarian and uses a lot of soy in their foods, and either through cross-contamination or a change of formula, I can no longer eat it (or any of the Amy's soups) without having a bad reaction. If you are very sensitive to soy, be aware!!
