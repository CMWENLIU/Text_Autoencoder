Have not even used this so called mix yet and it may taste very good, most of the Kinnikinnick products do.  The reason for my dissatisfaction is the fact you must add 12 egg whites to what is suppose to be a mix.  Before my need to use gluten free products, I was able to buy angel food mixes that did not require adding eggs and of course expected this to be the same.  If you are going to use fresh egg whites, you may as well use your own rice flour as well.  I was looking for the more simple way baking a gluten free angel food cake.  Also not sure why the box says to (spray or grease) the pan, never have heard of doing this with an angel food.  Doubt this is going to end well!
