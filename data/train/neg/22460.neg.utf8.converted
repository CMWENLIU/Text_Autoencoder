I wanted so much to like this product!  I had heard wonderful things about the tea (as you can see by the glowing reviews)  but I could not tolerate the smell.  I opened the bag and thought it smelled exactly like pipe tobacco.  In spite of this, I forced myself to brew some.  It was horrible!  Saying this has an "unusual flavor" is downplaying the nauseating taste.  I was seriously ill afterwards.  If anyone knows what I can do to redeem the flavor, I'm all ears!  (or eyes).  I really want to salvage what I have.  Thanks!
