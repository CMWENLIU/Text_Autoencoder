So far, I've popped two bags (bowls) and both times, I've ended up with burnt popcorn, and many, many unpopped kernals.  These two things (burnt popcorn and large volumes of unpopped kernals) shouldn't occur together.  My guess is that this is the result of the grey heat reflector portion of the bag being smaller to accomodate the removable "bowl" lid.  So there is less surface area for the popcorn to be in contact with this reflector.  I will definitely not be purchasing any more boxes of these dumb "bowls" in the future.  It was a good idea, but very poorly executed.  Orville is surely rolling in his grave over the number of unpopped kernals with his name on them!
