I was so disapointed, I got my shipment today, drank around 3 cans.  I felt a little funny so I read the label.  This particular coconut water had as much sugar as orange juice.<br /><br />sigh - have to give these away, I'm diabetic.  Ordered a no sugar version.<br /><br />Coconut water (juice)is cut from the jelly coconut.  Different sort of coconut then the hairy coconut you get coconut milk from.  I know hairy is not scientific.  I do love Coconut Water.
