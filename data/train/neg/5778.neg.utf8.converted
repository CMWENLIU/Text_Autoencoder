I eat peanut and cashew brittles because I want to eat a lot of nuts held together in a syrup that has hardened.  This brittle is mostly hardened syrup and there are only small slivers of cashews mixed in.  Yuck.  I will think twice before ordering a brittle where they don't show you the product, just the box it comes in!
