Regular oreos are about $3.00 for 15 oz.  These are $16.00 for 10 1/2 oz. How ridiculous to try to take advantage of people like this. I can buy a package of regular Oreo cookies and pounds of candy corn and eat them together and be just fine. I will be sure to never do business with this ripoff operation.
