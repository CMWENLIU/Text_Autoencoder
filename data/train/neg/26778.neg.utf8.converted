I received my order of 40 of the Brooklyn Beans Brooklyn Bridge K-cups yesterday, and we first tried them this morning. I don't care for the flavor, and I'm not sure what to compare it to except it has a bit of a "cardboard" taste, I think. It certainly does not care to Green Mountain's Nantucket, in my estimation. In addition, two of the 4 k-cups we used today did not give a steady stream of coffee, but squirted out in an erratic manner. I am disappointed.
