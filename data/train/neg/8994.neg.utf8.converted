I've had several of the brothers all natural products and purchased several cases after reading that they are a company in western ny. I liked supporting what I assumed was a small business operating in a big apple growing area of the country. It turns out that they just repackage a product that comes to them from china. I emailed the company and they tried to assure me that they are positive their chinese product is of the highest quality and the reason for the apples coming from china when there are apple orchards in their backyard (I've driven by the plant and apples grow all over around there) is because there are no freeze drying facilities in the us. This doesn't make any sense because I checked a package of mountain house freeze dried apples and they are made in the us from us produce.<br /><br />If buying chinese produce doesn't bother you then these are for you, they do taste good but if you're concerned with the huge amounts of less safe pesticides used in china and with the questionable quality of chinese food products then steer clear.
