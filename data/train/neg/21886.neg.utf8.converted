I received the Blue Diamond brand version of these nuts as a gift and had to go find more because they were so delicious.  I found this brand at Target instead so I decided to try them out.  I was quite disappointed.  The Emerald brand nuts are sweetened with sucralose and have a funny fake sweetener taste that is unpleasant.  The Blue Diamond Almonds are sweetened with Stevia so they taste more natural and also have a richer chocolate flavor. I would not recommend the Emerald brand of this product.
