I have purchased this honey and what it really is honey that has been whipped so air is added and it becomes more of a spread then a liquid as it would be when taken from a hive.<br />Honey straight from the hive is like liquid gold and not this pasty  substance which is good for a sandwich spread but to say it is "raw honey" is a marketing term to confuse buyers.<br />To charge this amount of money for pound of honey is over the top. The best local honey sells less then $10.00 a pound.<br />Buy the honey from beekeepers in the area in which you live.<br />Not honey that is shipped around the world. You are just paying the cost of the energy to deliver.
