Obviously you can't tell from a picture whether pumpkin seeds have the shell on or not, so we assumed since they were salted that they were probably without the shell. Well, if you buy these, I hope you are the type that likes eating pumpkin seeds shells (we aren't). The seeds themselves were not very large and the shells were not easy to open. I was very disappointed. These, in my opinion, are only useful if you like eating the shell and all.
