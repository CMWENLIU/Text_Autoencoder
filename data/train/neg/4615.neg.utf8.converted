I was so disappointed with this tea. i bought a box during lunchtime looking forward to a nice cup of tea in the afternoon. I made the cup and took a sip - YUCK. It tasted fishy to me but couldn't figure out why tea would taste fishy so I read the ingredients. I wish I had read them before - the second listed ingredient is an oil blend of tuna oil, soy oil, and soy lecithin. Just the thought of tuna oil in my tea is enough to make me gag - the actual taste is just as bad.
