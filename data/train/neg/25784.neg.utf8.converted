I purchased this bug spray because on the cover it says it covers many types of insects. When my husband and I tried to spray the outside of the house (we have both fly and ants problems), it requires the use of hose. I felt kinda lucky because if we don't have one then we can't use it and not everyone has a hose somewhere handy in the house and it didn't say anywhere on the bottle that it requires usage of a hose. Anyway, when we connected the bottle to the hose, after a few water pumping, the cap part got disconnected from the water pressure so the water from the hose just came out and shot my husband from head to toe. Alright, we reconnected it again. It did the same thing. So it took forever to spray the out side of the house, with my husband's cursing, water splashing, bottle falling, and trying to keeping the hose connected to the cap. It was such a hassle that I had to write something about this product to warn the other customers who is considering purchasing this product.
