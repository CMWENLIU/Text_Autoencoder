When I ordered the Melitta filters (pack of 12), I thought I was getting 12 packages of filters!  This would have been a good buy for about $20.00.  However, to my amazement and consternation, I found ONE package of filters arrived in the mail.  My own fault, to be sure, for not checking more carefully.  You can be sure I will if I ever do this again!!!!!!!!!!!
