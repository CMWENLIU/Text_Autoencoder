I used this formula for my baby thinking I was getting the best (with all the info about hexane, DHA, etc.). But recently it was out in the news that Baby's Only, both dairy and soy formulas, contain arsenic levels 20-30x more than that of other formulas. Now that is a huge difference.<br />  Because the 2 official statements this company has come out with are just denials of what the studies have shown, I no longer trust this company. Why not just replace brown rice syrup with another sweetener? But they continue to claim brown rice syrup is safe, when it's been found to contain high levels of arsenic. Safety should be the priority, especially when you're dealing with infants/toddlers, not profit.
