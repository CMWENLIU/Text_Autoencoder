I bought this flour because I thought it would be low in carbs...it is 43 net carbs/2 oz.  The first ingredient is white rice flour.  Almonds is the fifth and last ingredient.  This is not suitable for diabetics or those on a low glycemic diet.  If you are on a gluten free diet, you may like this flour, but you need to buy xanthan gum to use it in your recipes.  All of this should have been posted in the product description.  I feel cheated.
