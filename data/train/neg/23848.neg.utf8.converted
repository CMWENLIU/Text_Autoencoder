I am very disappointed in these Sen-Sen's. I purchased them because they reminded me of my grandmother. When I was a child 45 years ago my grandmother had Sen-Sen all the time. She used to give me a packets and I loved them as a child. I sometimes would dump the entire packet in mouth. I just loved them as a child. I ordered these so happy to have found them again and I have to say they taste NOTHING like the original Sen-Sen. A faint remnant of the taste but really these are just terrible and barely edible. The old ones were also perfect little cut squares and these are all cut uneven. NOT the original recipe at all. Rate-YUK..wish I could return them
