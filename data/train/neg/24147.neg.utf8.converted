I purchased this water and it is ordinary water. I cut fresh flowers and they did not last any longer than they would have with ordinary water. The water has no effect other that quenching your thirst. It is ordinary water. Do not waste you money on this water. If people think this water is wonderful it is all in their head. Water can not hold any energy past a certain time frame.
