Should have known better, if it seems too good to be true....  Then, well you know.  Bought the coffee at a reduced price and was hoping to have stumbled onto a great product.  Not the case, this coffee taste like instant.  For being a dark roast, the flavor or the lack of is extremely poor.  Better luck next time......
