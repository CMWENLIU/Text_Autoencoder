The reviews for these Chocolate Truffles seemed great so I ordered two boxes of them and had one sent to California and one to New Jersey.<br /><br />When each party opened them the truffles had melted into a solid mass inside the bag and had white stuff on them that looks like mold. Yuck and high ho... returned they go!<br /><br />As that both boxes were sent separately and had the same problem, it is doubtful that it was a problem in transit and more likely occurred in the distributor's warehouse<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R48MDE">Chocolate Belgian Truffles Donckels - 1 Pound Box</a>.<br /><br />I could not honestly recommend this product or the company who sells them to anyone else.
