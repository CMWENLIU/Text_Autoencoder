Well, all I can say is that the coffee was fresh.  Other than that...Awful, just plain awful.  I'd rather drink $2 a pound grocery store coffee.<br /><br />Kenya AA is smooth, rich, with an intoxicating odor and a wonderful aftertaste.  This coffee is the exact opposite.  Harsh, no body, with a bitter edge and lingering bitter aftertaste that I can still taste a half hour later.  Completely lacking the winey, fruity highlights Kenya AA is known for.<br /><br />I tried it black, and with cream and sugar.  Unpalatable either way.<br /><br />If you like eating charcoal briquettes, then you might like this coffee...
