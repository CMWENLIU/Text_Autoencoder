After reading about these noodles on Hungry Girl and following all the buzz, I had to try them for myself.  Afterall, I've discovered a lot of new reduced calorie options over the years that merit the trade-off.  Unfortunately, these noodles were just not worth it.  The texture alone kept me from wanting more than two bites.  Still hopeful, I mixed them together with spaghetti sauce and grated parmesean cheese and let them sit overnight in the frig (as sometimes the flavors can make it better the second day).  Again, no luck.  Just plain yucky.  Maybe putting in soup would help change the rubbery texture??? Not sure but I won't be trying again anytime soon.
