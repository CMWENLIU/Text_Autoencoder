I bought the 35 count variety pack thinking it would be the flavors shown in the photo. We didn't get a single Wolf Gang Puck flavored coffee, which I was really looking forward to. I got a ton of Spicy Eggnog, which I didn't even know came in the pack and Pumpkin Spice, which isn't even listed. We also got several Blueberry Flavored coffees. One would have been great but 4? I only got one Chocolate Glazed Donut. There was also no Mudslide or Butter Toffee flavors. I didn't get a single Grove Square brand. DO NOT BUY this sampler, you don't get what you pay for, only gross, left over holiday flavors. Total waste of money.
