These are over priced, seriously? $29.19 for a 24 pack? They cost 99 cents at stores like Wal*Mart. So lets do the math, (24*.99= $23.76) SO ($29.19-$23.76= $5.43). THAT IS $5.43 OVERPRICED! PLUS $24.49 for shipping? WHAT?! I have ordered larger and heavier items on Amazon and shipping is no where near "$24.49"!<br />NOT BUYING FROM THIS SELLER!
