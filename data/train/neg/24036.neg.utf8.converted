I use Nespresso Roma, and my wife uses Nespresso Ristretto.  We bought Cremosa and Espressivo as possible substitutes, because lower per-capsule price, free shipping with my Amazon Prime, and I don't have to use the Outpresso to recycle.  But we don't like the coffee. Others may prefer it, I'm sure, but its not for us. Too weak,  and we don't like the flavor.  The Cremosa is especially watery versus Nespresso.  I'm cheap and maybe not as picky  so I will use them up over time, but after trying both Cremosa and Espressivo, my wife will have none of it.  One of life's little pleasures especially for her is good coffee, and these are no substitute.
