Bought the beef and chicken Not for me....First off while the price is 64% off be aware that it'a industrial size....and it expires in June....I bought 4 of each the chicken and beef...HATE the taste....and THEY really should tell toy the expiration date...Probably why it's so cheap....I THREW them all out....just did not like the taste or consistency!<br /><br />Manna Soy Gourmet Meatless Beef Goulash, 4.4 Pound Family Pak, All Natural, Gluten Free, Shelf Stable, Pre-cooked, Pre-seasoned, Dairy Free, Egg Free, Sugar Free,- Even Kids Love It
