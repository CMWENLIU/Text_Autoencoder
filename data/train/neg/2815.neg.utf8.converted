I can't describe how awful these chocolates are. We got 'em before Christmas at half-off at a drug store and are giving them away to people we don't like. They manage to combine the texture of stale candy with the taste of hideously sugared cola (without the cola). These chocolates were awful years ago and they haven't improved a bit.
