Nothing beats a creamy, sugary cup of steaming hot tea on a cold and rainy day (I live in Washington, so I drink a lot of tea).<br /><br />I usually buy loose tea at the grocery store, the price isn't great at $24.99lb but the taste is so far above the drab Lipton tea bags I grew up with that now I can't bear to drink tea from teabags.  It's like watching television on a tiny black and white after a few weeks of using a a nice flatscreen, horrible and strange.<br /><br />The price for this Davidson's Irish Breakfast was so much lower than what I get at the grocery store that  I thought, 'ha! It must be my lucky day!'<br /><br />Well, when something seems too good to be true, it usually is.<br /><br />From the moment I opened the bag, the tea smelled wrong.  I still had a few teaspoons of Irish Breakfast from my last visit to the grocery store and when I compared the teas they looked noticeably different.  The grocery tea, hereafter known as 'Good Tea' was darker, the tea leaves more solid with occasional bits of bronzyness scattered willy nilly throughout.  The 'Good Tea' was not just slightly darker, it was several shades darker.  Also, the Davidson's Irish Breakfast had a grayish-green tinge to it.  In fact, it looked a lot like the oolong tea I bought last year and have yet to finish (guess I'm not an oolong girl).<br /><br />I made a cup for my hubby, adding just the right amount of cream and sugar.  When he's busy working, sometimes I think he'd drink a cup of soy sauce, as long as it was hot and he didn't have to fetch it himself, he's just so distracted, but he took one sip of the Davidson's and made a sour face.  Anyways, he wouldn't drink it and I had to toss my cup down the drain too.  There's no amount of sugar, cream or lemon slices that can fix this hellish brew.  Sorry, but I'd give this a pass.
