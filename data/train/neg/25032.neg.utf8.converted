I will keep this review short and to the point. This is not 100% Juice. It is Acai puree, water, evaporated cane sugar, citric acid, xanthan gum; as listed in their ingredients section. It comes in a 32 OZ bottle. It contains about 26 ounces of fluid, as recorded by me using US standard ounce measurements. Although I think it tastes OK, I am very disappointed at the misrepresentations and will not buy it again.
