We have five cats and I was sick of paying for the more expensive stuff, so I ordered this (and their dry food) because there were discounts on it.<br /><br />To a cat, not one of them would eat this stuff. Now all of these cats were feral, some still don't let us pet them and stay outside. And to a cat, they all hated it.<br /><br />So I first tried to put Fancy Feast on top of it. They carefully avoided this stuff and picked out the Fancy Feast. When I thoroughly mixed them, they just left it.<br /><br />I finally put it outside, and whatever cat ate it threw up two times outside.<br /><br />I had mixed it with tuna fish and the oil. Cats got sick on that too, when they don't get sick on plain tuna.<br /><br />This stuff has no juices, which, if anyone knows cats, that's the first thing they lick off of food.<br /><br />I don't know how you screw up the ingredients they say are in this food. I suspect that this is NOT organic chicken, organic vegetables, etc. I think it is some Chinese-made horror product.<br /><br />Cats are pretty good about knowing what is good for them and what isn't. If dead mice and birds don't kill them but this stuff makes them sick, THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT.<br /><br />Don't order this stuff!<br /><br />P.S. We were totally out of food and I put it out last night (since we still have cans of the junk around). Some cat puked the dry food that he ate afterward in order to try to settle his stomach. These cats don't get sick ordinarily.
