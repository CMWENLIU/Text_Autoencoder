Made of Vegeplast's bioplastic. Requires a significantly harder push on the Nespresso lever to punture the thick capsule. Coffee tastes mediocre and is nowhere near the quality of real Nespresso aluminum capsules. These Ethical Coffee capsules are only 10 cents less than the .60 cents each real Nespresso capsules ordered directly from Nespresso with $6.95 two day shipping. Amazon does not allow returns of these/food item.
