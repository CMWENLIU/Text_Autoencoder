I have received multiple shipments of this item from Amazon (a subscribe and save item delivered every month), and they have all been great. The real deal, same as the bottles you get in Japan. Until my most recent shipment - sent out Oct 19, 2011. When I opened the package, the bottles looked different and it said Made in Thailand. Why has the product changed when the price I'm paying is the same? Bring the original Made in Japan bottles back before I order this item from Amazon again.
