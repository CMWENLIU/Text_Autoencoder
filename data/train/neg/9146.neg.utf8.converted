My Goldendoodle wouldn't touch one of these when offered repeatedly, nor would my neighbors dog or my friends dog.  Don't waste your money just because it is unique or you may well end up throwing them in the trash, as I did. They are too expensive just for garbage and the shipping is too high and all for naught.<br /><br />Thankfully, I only bought two.  Customer Service: extremely rude and overly condescending.
