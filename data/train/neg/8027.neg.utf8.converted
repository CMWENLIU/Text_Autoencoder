This product is listed when you search "Arrowhead Mills Gluten Free." It is not gluten free, as it contains two ingredients that are wheat-based - Organic Wheat Flour, Organic Whole Wheat Flour.  Hopefully Arrowhead Mills will correct the tag to avoid any complications for people with celiac disease.  Dr. Tatiana
