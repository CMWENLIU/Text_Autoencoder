I have purchased Back to Nature Crispy Wheat Crackers consistently for a year.  We eat a case a week (6 boxes).  Also have the saltines on hand and graham crackers.  Received 2 cases of Crispy Wheat Crackers last week and opened them last night.  Every box of the 12 boxes I received were loaded with salt - more salt than ever.  They are so salty they burn your mouth.  You can feel the salt and see the salt.  This seems to be a manufacturing problem.  I have notified Back to Nature about the problem and we will see if they fix it.  In the meantime beware if you purchase the product that you may receive mostly salt and no cracker !!!!
