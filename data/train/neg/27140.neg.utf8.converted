I tried to find out the ingredient list before I purchased this seasoning. I went to Paul's website and it didn't list the ingredients. It said this: Salmon Magic(tm), Chef Paul's newest creation, is a unique blend of carefully selected herbs and spices with subtle accents of dry mustard seeds.<br /> After I received it the first ingredient listed was Sugar. My problem is that I don't like sweet tasting food unless it's a dessert. I tried to like it but I could hardly get through dinner. If you like your food on the slightly sweet side it will probably be fine for you.<br /><br />P.S. I really like his Seafood and Blackened Redfish Magic.
