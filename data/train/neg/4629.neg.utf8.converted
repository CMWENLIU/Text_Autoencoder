Yes, the first ingredient is meat, but do not be fooled. The following ingredients include multiple soy ingredients to make up most all the protein content. All the soy and corn ingredients are conventional which means they are cheap, GMO, ingredients. The unimpressive ingredient list also includes multiple artifical colors...these are for the owner's benefit. If you want a healthy dog that lives a long time, find a better, natural dog food that doesn't rely heavily (if at all) on grains(Amazon offers a multitude of options). Dogs aren't designed to eat such high amounts of grains. When factoring cost remember that dogs won't need to eat as much if it is quality food, and ultimately you'll spend less on vet bills.
