I love figs and look forward to fresh figs in the fall.  When fresh figs aren't available, then sun dried figs will do but ONLY when they are flavorful and not too dry.  I've had various brands of dried figs throughout my life and these are certainly NOT tasty in any way.  Most in the bag are too dry and the ones that are moist are almost mealy tasting and taste too bland to be worth the sugar content (even if it's from natural sugar).  I wanted to like these since they were easily accessible to make some homemade treats but I just can't vouch for this version of dried figs.  Sorry.
