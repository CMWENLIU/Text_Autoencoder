The ingredients in this dog food contain soy and corn which have about the same nutritional value as sawdust. Don't be fooled by the fancy label or celebrity jerks who promote this food. Dogs are not meant to eat grain (a little oatmeal or brown rice is sometimes okay). Typical of Purina dog foods, this is full of artificial dyes and cheap fillers. They get away with it because too many dog owners don't bother to look at the ingredients or educate themselves on dog nutrition. A dog who has constant gas or eats their own filth is not normal. A raw diet is best for dogs, but there is some decent kibble out there like Orijen, Natural Balance, and Merrick. This one is for the trash heap.
