I've bought Millstone from several grocery stores for several years, and it's always been pretty good.  I ordered two packages from Amazon and both tasted absolutely awful.  No wonder...the "best by" date on both packages of coffee was dated two months prior to my order.<br /><br />I'll still buy dry goods and true unperishable items from Amazon Grocery, but I'll skip things like coffee, nuts and other foods that go bad or degrade in quality after significant storage time.
