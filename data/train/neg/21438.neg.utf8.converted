Be aware of the Legal Disclaimer at the bottom of this product's ingredient list.  It warns that it is not fully disclosing ALL of the ingredients in Fantastic World Food's products for a reason. I had been buying this product for years from health food shelves and never thought to thoroughly read the ingredients until recently when my eyes fell upon "partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil" right there on the box of their Vegetarian Chili mix.  This is Trans Fats, and no amount of this chemically modified fat is safe for the body! If you are trying to avoid that ingredient and looking to purchase this food based on its false health food marketing, you can verify this bad news for yourself by checking out the product in the natural food section of your store.  This is a very poor business practice as they know people are avoiding trans fats like the plague... hence the legal disclosure.  Inexcusable!
