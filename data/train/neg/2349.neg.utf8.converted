I love lemons and hot drinks like tea and cocoa, so Gold Kili's Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix seemed like something I'd really enjoy.  Instead it had a terrible medicinal taste with a bit of a burn going down, then there was an aftertaste.  I couldn't even make it through an entire cup of this beverage mix.
