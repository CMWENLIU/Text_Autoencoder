I guess I got a bad batch from bees that went far afield of the orange trees. Mine is a medium to medium-dark honey and is definitely lacking the citrus taste I'm used to in other brands. Nothing light, fragrant or delicate about my bottle. This is typlical clover honey. Very dissatisfied and will never buy this brand again. I was looking for an alternative to the two brands available locally, which are very expensive. This was certainly cheaper but definitely not worth the money. I'll keep looking.<br /><br />But, for those who aren't picky about orange blossom honey being from orange blossoms, this is an OK clover honey. Depending on where you live, this might be cheaper than clover honey you can get locally and I'm sure you'll like it.
