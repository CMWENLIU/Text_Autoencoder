I used 2 of these packets in tea and got rid of the rest.  I found the taste to be unpleasant - didn't seem sweet, more tart and fruity than sweet.  And, I sensed a metallic like aftertaste.  I thought it was terrible.  But, I recognize that everyone's taste is different.  You may like this just fine and you may have an entirely different application for it than mine.  I also don't like Splenda, so you may like this product better if you're a Splenda fan.  I just wouldn't buy a truckload of it before you sample it.
