After consulting with many doctors in our area, ww decided to discontinue this formula.  The high levels of inorganic arsenic in this formula are believed to increase the risk of many cancers, diabetes etc.  Although we have been feeding this stuff to our baby for about 6 months, the doctors said it is no cause for alarm, but to be on the safe side to change to any formula that does not contain brown rice syrup as its principal ingredient, until more studies have been completed.  It is astounding to me that the brown rice syrup is not regularly being tested by Nature's one because he FDA does not have any firm standards for arsenic.  What a cop out.  This is completely irresponsible considering its the main ingredient.  I did a lot of research before feeding this to my child and wanted to believe that this was the best formula out there but I feel like we have been let down.  I guess I have to rethink that idea that anything labeled "organic" is made with purest, ethical ingredients.  Anyway, I know other formulas have their drawbacks too (hexane, etc), but they are much lower risk than the inorganic arsenic which i read takes about 2-3 days clear half of it from the body and about 7 months eliminate all of it.  Look elsewhere.
