I live in Central Asia, in a place where brown rice is unknown.  I come back to the US and buy supplies for a year, paying for product and airfreight.  This rice has almost no taste.  There seems to be neither energy nor nutritional value.  Eating it gives me nothing but irritation to have spent so much money and confined myself to a year of dead rice or no rice.  Actually, it has accustomed me to not eating rice.<br /><br />The package was intact.  The sell-by date was okay.  I had never bought this brand before and I never shall again.
