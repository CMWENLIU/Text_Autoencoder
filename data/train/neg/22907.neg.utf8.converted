Good Taste... Bad Reaction within 2 hours, like clockwork... Laxative for all.....There should be a POP UP warning before purchase for this site and on the bag. Gas, cramping, pooping for hours, upset stomach the following morning. I love this brand of Gummi's but I will no longer eat the Sugarfree items. Now I am stuck with 5 LBS and no refund.
