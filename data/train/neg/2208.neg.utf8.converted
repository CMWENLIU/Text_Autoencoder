I got this in a large pack of Dove body wash at a big name bulk store and was excited to try it out.  I normally use the pouf to shower with (Don't tell my Pals!), but decided to give this a go.  It's, as another person posted, "Like using a Brillo Pad!".  I have very sensitive skin so it's way too rough for me.  It's too small, gets very slick, and it's impossible to reach in between the Guy parts.  I don't see how any Man could ever use this other than for scrubbing dirty, greasy hands.  It's made more for the mechanic or coal miner who needs to scrub their skin to get clean and definitely not for a Guy who occasionally does some yard work, etc.  If you arrive home looking like Mike Rowe after a hard day at "Dirty Jobs" then this may just be for you!
