Used almost the entire jar and absolutely zero heat. I added some cayenne pepper to spice it up. I usually buy the real Thai stuff, which this is supposed to be according to the label, but got this instead. With the real stuff, 3 tablespoons along with 2 cans of coconut milk and your mouth is on fire. Not this. I am on vacation and made curry for my family. They loved my red curry chicken but to me it was only so so.
