I've been getting the Horizon Organic stuff for a while, but I thought that I'd try out this Organic Valley milk. I don't know if their quality control isn't as good or what, but I put in the straw and sucked a chunk of something into my mouth. Sadly, Amazon doesn't seem to offer exchanges on this stuff, but the rest are going in the trash.<br /><br />I imagine that not all of them are like this, since other people seem to have enjoyed their milk. Mine has the following on the label: 28 Jan 11 A32 27-421 17:32 0069615.<br /><br />Update: I contacted Amazon and they were able to refund my money for the spoiled milk.
