My puppy loves to chew, so I got these.  She likes them until the meat entwined in them is gone, then she goes to something else.  Plus they can be VERY dangerous.  I saw her chewing on something one day and went to look.  She had found one of these she'd left where I didn't see it and had chewed it to where the end was gooey and mushy.  I've read that if they swallow this part, it can get caught in their intestines and block them OR in their throat and choke them.  I threw them away after reading that and reading sad stories of others who had to take their dog to the vet, expensive surgeries and such.  I'll never buy them or anything like them again.  I don't get anything for her that is rawhide, can splinter, etc.  The best thing I've found for her to chew on that is edible and safe is called "Beefeaters Sweet Potato Snacks For Dogs".  Do a search here on amazon.com or on Google and you can find them from $8.99 and up, but they're worth it to have something safe for your dog to chew on.  They are all natural, satisfies her need to chew, is full of vitamins and most importantly, SAFE for her.  They come in a huge bag, so for my little 6 pounder, they last a long time.  Sometimes I even cut one in half and give it to her.  The slices are pretty big, so they'd be very good for big dogs too.  Stay clear of ANYTHING rawhide or like that if you love your four-legged baby.
