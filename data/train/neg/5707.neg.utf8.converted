I first purchased this from Amazon back in Mar 2008 for my lattes (to get the Starbucks flavor) and was extremely happy with both the price and product.  The sauce was nice and thick (actually had to squeeze the bottle a bit to get the product out) and delicious.  And you can't beat $19 price for 6 bottles (free shipping to boot!).<br /><br />I finally ran out last month and placed another order with Amazon.  The consistency this time was VERY runny and watered down... In fact, I ended up spilling some of the first bottle as I wasn't expecting it to be so watery.  I had to actually shake the bottle to get a more uniform consistency (which I never had to do before) and even then, it was still very runny to where I had to be careful when I poured (yes, poured... not drizzle) it into my coffee.  I checked the other 5 bottles and they were the same.<br /><br />Not sure what changed in their formula but I am definitely NOT happy with this new batch.  I would return it, but it wouldn't be worth my time and shipping cost (Amazon was running a special promotion at the time and I got the 6 bottles for around $15).<br /><br />I am generously giving it 2 stars only because the 1st order back in March was absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />Not nearly as excited about my weekend lattes anymore....  :)
