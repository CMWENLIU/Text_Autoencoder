It's possible that I'll eventually figure out exactly how this product is intended to be used, but so far I've had no luck; there are no instructions regarding amount or application.<br /><br />I first tried applying a nickel-sized amount to my scalp.  This was a huge mistake as my hair was then greasy and gross.  I had to wash my hair twice before it started to look and feel ok again.  So next I tried putting a tiny amount on my hands and then smoothing it through the ends of my hair.  This was a little better, but my hair still felt greasy.  Since both of these attempts were on dry hair and the oil says it can be used on dry or wet, I decided to try it after washing my hair.  Again, my hair ended up greasy.
