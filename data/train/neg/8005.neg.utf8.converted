The old biscuits were great, I gave them to my dog for years and then Nutro changed the packaging, and kept the price the same while lowering the amount of biscuits by 50%. The new formula has 11% protein as opposed to 20% in the previous formula, they have more fat content than the old biscuits, they took out the polyphosphate which is the ingredient that reduces tartar and they are hard as a rock now. The new packaging doesn't even work right. The resealable seam ripped off like it wasn't even glued. Stay away from this product. Unless Nutro realizes its mistake and starts valuing its customers more than its bottom line, I wouldn't buy anything with their name on it.
