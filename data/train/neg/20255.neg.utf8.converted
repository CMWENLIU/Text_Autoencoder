I've purchased at least a dozen of the 16oz. Maple Almond Butters without incident, but the most recent container has caused an allergic reaction from peanuts.  I actually tried the nut butter from this container on 3 separate occasions to rule out other causes and the reaction occurred every time (oops).  I have had this allergy since I was extremely young, and this is the first time I've EVER had a reaction from something with the (frankly lame) disclaimer "may contain traces of peanuts".  Luckily my allergy is on the mild side, although nausea and vomiting are still not pleasant.  To be honest, with what they charge for their nut butters they should be able to process them without ANY cross contamination.  Sorry to say they've permanently lost a customer as I'll be sticking with Blue Diamond, who boast a 100% Peanut Free almond butter.
