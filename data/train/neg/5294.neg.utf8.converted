I purchased this synthetic cat litter from Target for several weeks, thinking that the odor control was very good and that it was more convenient to scoop less frequently.  For the first few weeks, I loved it and continued purchasing.  We keep the litter box in an small unused bathroom in our basement.  This fall, my inlaws came to visit and would be staying in the basement on an extra bed.  In preperation, I cleaned the bathroom and was horrified to discover a thick layer of blue dust all over the bathroom.  It clearly showed on the white paper towels!.  It was everywhere.  On the walls, ceiling, floor, behind the door, etc, and it was thick.  For a synthetic product, the amount of dust was unbelievable.  I cannot recommend this product.  I have returned to traditional litter, and am disgusted thinking about the amount of blue dust that has probably been circulating our house.  We've never had a dust problem with litter before and clean the bath room ever few weeks.  I could not believe the amount of dust on the ceiling! Simply unacceptable.  There is no excuse for a sythetic product that is supposed to be absorbant to spew blue particles into the air, our lungs, and the environment I live in.  Avoid.
