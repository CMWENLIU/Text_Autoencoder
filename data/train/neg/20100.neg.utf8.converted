When I ordered it I was so excited to get it and cook recipes with ham flavor bits.When I got it and checked the ingredients it has hydrogenated oils which means trans fat. I'm so disappointed. How something called healthy food good for vegetarians can has trans fat???!!!! I didn't even wasted my time in returning it because they will only refund the 3.19 but not the shipping cost 7.44 so what a waste of time and money!
