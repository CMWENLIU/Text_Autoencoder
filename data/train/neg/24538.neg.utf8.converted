The advertisement shows the boxes filled with candy nuts etc.<br />In reality each box contains only 1 tiny item.<br />If you price the items, they would cost less than 3 or 4 dollars for everything.<br />I'm uploading pictures of how small and cheap the items are on various websites.<br />Total Rip-off.
