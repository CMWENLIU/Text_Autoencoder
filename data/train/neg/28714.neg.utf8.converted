I found this frosting pretty disgusting.  And I'm not one to be very likely to put the words "frosting" and "disgusting" in the same sentence.  It ended up tasting mainly like butter.  When I scraped it off into the sink, it just stayed in one clump and wouldn't even rinse down the sink very easily (like you'd expect from butter).  And even if you like the taste of a bunch of butter on your cake, save yourself some money.  The only ingredients in this mix are powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt.  You can buy all those very cheaply and still add all the butter the directions call for (2.5 sticks!).  Gross!
