I don't understand the point of these bars. Take a variety of roasted nuts, stick them together in bar form using corn syrup, and what do you get? A good way to lose a lot of nuts all over the front of your shirt every time you take a bite.<br /><br />The bar form adds nothing to me, except for corn syrup that I neither need nor want, and just makes it harder to consume. I would rather just eat the roasted nuts!
