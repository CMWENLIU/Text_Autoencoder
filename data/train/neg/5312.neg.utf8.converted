I've had the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T0GXNC">SodaStream SodaMix - Cola</a> before, and it was fine. It tasted like someone mixed a diet soda with a regular one with the slight aftertaste of sucralose, but it wasn't that bad, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T0NXK8">SodaStream SodaMix - Caffeine Free Root Beer</a> was one of the best root beers I've ever had even WITH that aftertaste. I gambled on the Natural Cola, hoping it would taste like the regular one but without that aftertaste, but boy was I wrong. It tastes like you took some apple juice and mixed it with cola.<br /><br />(The natural rootbeer, incidentally, is freaking awesome - it IS the  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T0NXK8">SodaStream SodaMix - Caffeine Free Root Beer</a> without the aftertaste. So my order was only half fail, ha. Amazon apparently doesn't sell it.)
