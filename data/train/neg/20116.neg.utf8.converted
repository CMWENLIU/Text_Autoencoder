Wedding Soup is definitely one of my favorite soups and campbells use to be the one canned wedding soup i use to buy...until they changed it. I get that they want to provide for people who want to consume less sodium but to totally do away with their regular wedding soup is disappointing. I miss the old flavor and everything about it this one is just too different if you like the original you know what im taking about. I hope they bring it back one of these days until then I guess I have to settle for this one or just stick to making my own. Why mess with a good thing?
