I was expecting a sort of organic version of a fruit rollup but instead this is more of your standard energy bar with a vague strawberry taste. Imagine sawdust mixed with juice and a few strawberries. Given that the ingredient lists starts with Date Paste, Rolled Oats, Brown Rice Syrup and the Strawberry Puree I guess that is pretty much what I should have expected. 160 calories, 2 grams fat, 3 grams protein, 4 grams fiber, 22 grams sugars and 20 mg of sodium per 1.7 oz bar.
