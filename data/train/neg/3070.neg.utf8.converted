I was really disappointed to find out that LIDS of Earth's Best foods contain BPA. I tried to contact company and ask them why they use BPA, by the way BPA is not used in Canada and Europe for baby food, but they did not contact me. BPA has estrogenic effect, what can be the cause of obesity, there is evidence that BPA has effects on fetal and infant brain development and behavior.<br />Food itself is OK, but I can not understand how they can risk ours baby life and health by using BPA!??<br />Definitely, we should do something with that.
