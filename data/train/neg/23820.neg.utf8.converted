I ordered this item well before Xmas as a gift for a secret santa gift. They told me it wouldnt be shipped till the 26 but would arrive before Jan, 1st. This was after Amazon said if items ordered will get to their destination before Xmas. First LIE. Then on Dec 30, I receive a email saying they are out of stock and would NOT be able to ship this item at all. One day before it was to arrive. This leaves me without a gift and no possibility for replacement in time. This is just too much sloppy handling of accounts. I am VERY UNHAPPY and you should be very very careful with this company. It is from TAYLOR'S MARKET and should be passed up.
