A real dissapointment.  With my regular brewer I have made my own half caff by blending a Starbucks caff and decaf for years.  When I got my Keruig I thought this half-caff product would be the best answer for me, but it isn't.  This tastes like a mixture of weak coffee and dishwater.  Why Green Mountain put this out is a mystery.  Green Mountain has a good caff coffee called Dark Magic and a good decaf coffee called Dark Magic Decaf.  All they would have to do is use half of each of these in a K-cup and they would have an excellent half-caf.  I know because I have a 20 ounce mug that I have brewed 9.5 ounces of each of these together and the taste is great.  The only explanation for this Green Mountain half-caff product is that they must think that anyone who would buy a half-caf probably doesn't care much about taste, so they can use two cheaper coffees.  Half-caff coffee drinkers DO care about taste.  Message to Green Mountain: Give us a 50:50 mixture of the Dark Magic caff and decaff coffees and deep six this product.
