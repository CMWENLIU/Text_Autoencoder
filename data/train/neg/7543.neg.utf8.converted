I was really excited to buy this food maker and get started.  After steaming and pureeing just one thing I noticed a plastic/metallic smell.  I brushed it off to the product just having that new smell.  Washed it out again and pureed more food.  Then I happened to taste the food and it had a horrible plastic or metallic taste.  I tasted different batches of things I made with all having the same result.  So instead of the food having a natural taste as the product claims, it all tastes like plastic!  I have no idea what can be causing this problem.  Maybe it will go away with time, but I certainly don't want to waste a bunch of food to perform a trial and error test over and over again. Very disappointed in the end result.
