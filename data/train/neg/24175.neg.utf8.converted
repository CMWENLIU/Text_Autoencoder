The crispy frog was delicious but it cost me something like twenty five euros in post and packaging! That is ridiculous. How did that happen? It was only a TINY piece of chocolate. I thought that it was the same size as a life size frog. One of the kids in my sons class had brought one to school that she had got in the Harry Potter Studios in Florida. That is what I thought I was ordering. Absolutely ridiculous. Light as a feather so no way could it cost that in postage. It would have fit in an envelope with an ordinary stamp. Felt cheated!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545044251">Harry Potter Boxset Books 1-7</a>
