Not only does this pack contain the regular varieties you can find at any broken down liquor store (like the one in the horror movies) and nothing else, but they package them FOR YOU.  Now, this is all well and good IF you're going to give a deal on them, which they do not.  3 packages for a buck? Please.  I'll limit my choices for a good price, or pay a good price for the freedom to choose, but I won't take a hit on both. And where are all the hard to find flavors? Koolaid is packaging these things all wrong.  Now, lemon-lime flavor happens to be my favorite.  So, I come on here looking to spend maybe 7 or so dollars for a bunch of them, BUT NO!  Look at the way these high-way robbers priced and packaged the things! There's no way in heck I'm about to spend 24 bucks for lemon-flavor AND be forced to spend a year drinking the same flavor.  It'll ruin my affection for the flavor and make me cranky.  The wife doesn't like it when I'm cranky.  I'm not married, but if I was, I'd be cranky and the wife wouldn't like it.  She'd probably divorce me for spending 24 bucks on one flavor of koolaid.  She'd say she needed more variety and didn't want to pay the high-price for it.  In summation....it's friggin powder and flavor, for crying out loud. Give us a break.
