This is probably the worst coffee I have ever had.  It arrived stale, odorless, a bag of lifeless beans.  It had absolutely no coffee smell when I opened the bag.  I always grind my coffee fresh on the spot and there was no aroma from the ground beans - bad sign.  The brewed product was equally lifeless - worse than ground Folgers from a can.  I returned it after the first cup. My bad for ordering such a large bag but I have have had good luck with organic coffee and this seemed like a good deal.  Bland, bland, dead stuff. Maybe other reviewers received a fresh product - I don't see how anyone who enjoys coffee could like this stuff in the condition received by me.
