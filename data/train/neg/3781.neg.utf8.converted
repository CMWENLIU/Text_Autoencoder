To help me drink more water I used flavor crystals to make it more palatable. When I visited my doctor I was told I had high blood pressure. I asked why for 66 years my blood pressure was normal but now it was high and I needed 2 prescriptions. Doctor said that was normal. Since I like to research I found that the crystals I was using had Aspartame, one of the most dangerous artificial sweeteners. Side effects include headaches, anxiety, abdominal pain, nausea, heart palpitations, irritable bowel syndrome & high blood pressure. Acesulfame potassium is another artificial sweetener used in some Crystal Light varieties. This sweetener contains methylene chloride, which is a known carcinogen - long-term use of this carcinogen may cause cancer. Other side effects include nausea, headaches and impaired liver.<br /><br />I stopped using anything with Aspartame(threw out the prescriptions)and my blood pressure is now normal. The "Natural" crystal light is not really natural because it contains Aspartame(which I was told is also genetically modified). Crystal Light has a very good product called "Natural". It uses cane sugar (not GM sugar beet) & TRUVIA. This is a much better product and only a few calories more than the "Natural" which is not really natural. Aspartame is not natural. Many other synthetically sweetened products use Aspartame. You have to read all labels. It's better to eat smaller amounts of real food rather then more synthetically sweetened, GM frankenfood and avoid the side effects. What's the big deal in a few extra natural calories?
