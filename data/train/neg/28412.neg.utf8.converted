I was looking to buy "Chicklet" gum and this is actually "Double Bubble" brand gum. Gum is a lot harder to chew, which was no good for me since I have to chew "Chicklet" brand gum. "Chicklets" are a much softer gum consistency. And there were no near 1,000 pieces. Bag was very small. I would est. 500 pieces no more.
