It was supposed to be whole cashews and I assumed that Deluxe meant better than average quality. What I received is rather small inferior quality cashews with a stale odor and more than fifty percent of the cashews were broken in halves to small pieces. Product description is misleading and I will not buy this product again or recommend this to anyone.
