when it comes to buying health food items, you can be at a lost if you are sent an item that is past due it's expiration date or it was sent from another company other than the one advertised. Amazon will not accept a return and now I am stuck with an item I cannot use.  Make sure it is want you want and if it is sent as something else. AMAZON GOT YOU>
