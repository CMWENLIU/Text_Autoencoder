The sprouted rice does not taste as good as the brown rice, and it takes a lot longer to cook. It's not worth the time or effort to use the GABA, sprouted rice.  I have noticed no difference in 'health' other than, for some, the psychosomatic response that it is healthier.  Be that as it may, I see no data supporting that other than anecdotal.  I won't purchase again; unfortunately, I ordered too much so I have to use it, but not often.  I am sure like most rice it will keep for a long time.
