It started raining this morning and I was feeling the hunger.<br /><br />Hmm...Yes! Snow's Authentic New England Style Clam Chowder.<br /><br />Into my fave cast iron pot. Heated up and into a bowl.<br /><br />Wait. What is this? So much for my clam chowder dance I did in the kitchen as it heated up.<br /><br />Pretty thin. Not too thin, but not thick like an ACTUAL clam chowder.<br /><br />Flavor: Bland. Very.<br /><br />I ate the entire bowl nonetheless, (hate wasting food)<br /><br />I kept thinking, where are the clams!!!!<br /><br />I think I bit down on one. It looks NOTHING like the picture either.<br /><br />Blech! The worst clam chowder I have ever had in a midwest diner beats this.<br /><br />Very bummed.
