Not only was the taffy too hot to eat (and I love Cinnamon Salt Water Taffy normally) the customer service was even worse.  Despite what Amazon said would happen, it didn't even SHIP for 8 days.  I tried to contact them twice to find out why so long.  They couldn't be bothered to reply.  I ended up throwing out the candy.  It was a total waste of my money!
