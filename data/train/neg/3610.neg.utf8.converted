I love many flavors of Larabars and like how they are raw and simple.  I bought one of this flavor to see if I wanted a box...no way.  You get the coconut that hits your taste buds first...then you are instantly smacked with an aftertaste of *SOAP*!  Terrible.  I tried 3 bites to see if it got better...NO.  I'd never recommend this although I do like other flavors.
