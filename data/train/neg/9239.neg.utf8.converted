After reading all of the great reviews I decided to try this...my baby is 7 weeks old and I am trying to stock up feedings in the freezer so I needed to produce more milk to do so. I tried the tea for 2 days and it actually DECREASED my milk supply so I stopped. So I read up on other ways to increase my milk supply...I read eating oatmeal helps and of course drinking lots of water. The oatmeal REALLY works!! I suggest eating oatmeal if nothing else is working for you.
