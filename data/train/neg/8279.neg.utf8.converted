I bought this product because a review I read said it dissolved easily.  It doesn't dissolve in cold broth, it just clumps up, and heating the mess cooked the egg powder into hard lumps.  When one is nauseous from chemo and trying to get some nutrition down, this is NOT satisfactory.  If there is a secret method of how to make this work, it wasn't on the packaging.
