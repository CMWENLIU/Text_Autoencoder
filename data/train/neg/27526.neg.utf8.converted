For all the fancy packaging this company uses to sell their cookies you'd think two things. One that the packaging was well done and looked good after shipping which wasn't the case. The glued on decorations weren't still intact. Two, and the more important one is the cookies should taste as good as the packaging they are being sent in. These cookies had almost no flavor. KEYLIME wasn't the flavor there was hardly a hint of citrus to them. Mostly tasted like a really buttery sugar cookie with a powered sugar coating. This is not the first keylime cookie I have tried and the other wasn't much better. I have had a wonderful keylime cookie in the Cambridge area of Boston in a large whole foods grocery so I know they do exist! But don't waste your money on these like I did.
