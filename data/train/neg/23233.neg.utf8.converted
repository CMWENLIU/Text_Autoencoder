I know now why this vanilla sugar was so much less money then most, the vanilla beans are not ground. There are two, whole beans in the container and if you want them ground, guess who does it? You will need a very fine spice grater, luckily I had one. I will probably need to buy even more beans because I like the vanilla flavor intense! I was quite dissapointed. :(
