I am extremely disappointed in this product.  It didn't come with directions, when I first tried to get any of this out of the tube the right way, the bottom of the plastic tube broke open, so I could never use this properly, and the bags under my eyes are just as big as before.  I would never recommend this to anyone, and I wonder if it worked for other women who bought it because of The Dr Oz show.
