Not good. I think M&M is trying to get us to like this because the little pretzel-like nub inside the candy is cheaper than a peanut. Also, the 'pretzel' is pretty bland. It ended up tasting like an M&M which you bite into and think 'blech- there's something inside this M&M.'<br /><br />Peanut M&Ms remain the superior M&M variant of the original chocolate candy.
