I bought this cat nip package and also bought cat grass kit for my 3 cats cause they love their greens but the cat nip hardly grew at all and this is not the first time ive tried to grow it for my cats, the cat grass on the other hand was awesome and cats enjoyed it definitely will buy more grass but not the cat nip. Not impressed with the product at all :(
