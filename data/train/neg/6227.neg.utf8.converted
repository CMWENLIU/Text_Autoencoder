...at least if you purchase from this seller (OTCMaster).  The tea box arrived completely crushed and looking a million years old.  Disgusting.  Now I have to come up with something else to fill out the gift basket I'm putting together.  A waste of time and money + a huge disappointment; I will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER order from this seller again!
