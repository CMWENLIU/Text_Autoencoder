I really enjoy Twining caffeinated English breakfast tea. However, I was very disappointed by the decaf version. Something in the decaf process strips the tea of all its character, leaving only the bitterness behind. The same thing is true for the Lipton Decaffeinated Tea. Since I only drink iced tea, I can't say how this tea is when prepared hot. Buy this tea only as a last resort.
