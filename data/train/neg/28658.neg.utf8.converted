This review is a generalization of all hoof treats, not an indication that this particular brand is different than others I have tried.<br /><br />Many dogs seem to have little problem with hooves. When I tried these, they seemed to be on par with other good quality manufacturers. My problems with them is three-fold. First, they have a tendency to splinter; and since most dogs tend to swallow faster than they taste, I became quite concerned my dog might sustain internal injury from those shards. Second, the aftermath was a bout of diarrhea. However, my dog has a sensitive gut, so take that for what it is worth. Lastly, and of least concern, is that they stink horribly. I know dogs tend to like things that stink, but holy moly. When my dog plopped down next to me in the office after eating her first one, I thought she had eaten a rancid Yak!
