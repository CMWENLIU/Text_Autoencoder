I thought originally this was an assortment of three separate flavored candy pieces, but was wrong. Still, the mixture sounds good on paper: three ingredients I really like- honey, almonds, apricots. It just didn't taste as you would think.<br /><br />The apricot flavoring, if present (I couldn't taste any), is completely obscured by the overpowering taste of honey. While I like honey, the honey used here seems unusually strong, very cloying taste with a strong lingering perfumey/flowery aftertaste. Some of the pieces contained large chunks of almond, and the toasted nut flavor occasionally broke through the smothering honey to be a good taste compliment. But not all pieces were graced with sizable almonds. I shared the candy with a few friends including one who has had Turkish Delight before, and they all disliked it. We were all left disappointed.
