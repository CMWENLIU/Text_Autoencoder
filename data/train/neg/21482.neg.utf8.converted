These are totally worthless.  After two weeks, I saw no moths in the traps, but plenty flying around.  I got another brand of traps and within a week, I had about 27 moths captured on them, but the SaferBrand was still mothless.  It's now been three months, and the other traps are totally covered in moths, but the SaferBrand still have caught no moths: only a couple of gnats on them. The other traps were cheaper and work much better.  Don't waste your money on these!
