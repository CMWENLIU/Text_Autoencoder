My dogs love these treats, and I do buy them occasionally because they are cheap and perched at the check-out counter of our local garden/feed store. But check out the ingredient list-- I don't think anyone can feel good about feeding their dog high-fructose corn syrup! Just not the healthiest option-- when so many of our dogs are overweight, it seems better to feed them a real liver treat, versus this product which is "made with liver".<br /><br />My dogs absolutely love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000255OIG">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried 14 Ounce</a> (the larger size packages are more economical). I just feel a lot better about feeding real freeze-dried liver that doesn't have all the extra junk in Bil-Jac liver treats.<br /><br />Specifically, these treats have chicken "by-products"-- that means liquid slaughterhouse run-off and other non-human grade leftovers from the slaughterhouse. UGH! Bil-Jac also includes three preservatives, glycerin (?!), and the corn syrup.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the ingredient list for Bil-Jac liver treats, so you can make your own decision:<br /><br />Liver, Chicken By-Products, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn, Chicken Fat, Glycerin, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Propylene Glycol, Wheat Flour, Phosphoric Acid, Salt, Sodium Propionate and Potassium Sorbate and BHA and Citric Acid (Preservatives), Iron Oxide.<br /><br />bil-jac, dogs, cookies, biscuits, snacks, dog toy, treat, training, liver, treats, agility, obedience, bil-jac foods inc
