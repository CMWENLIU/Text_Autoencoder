I bought Peanut Shop peanuts for my dad's  birthday which recently occurred and I just gifted him The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg Handcooked Lightly Salted Virginia Peanuts, 12-Ounce Tin, 3 pack, $14.31.<br />My dad is a peanut connoisseur and eats lots of different peanuts and gourmet peanuts so I was anxious to get his feedback on these nuts. Just got feedback from my mom. She said they were not very good, according to my dad. She had to cook these peanuts & add salt to make them more edible. She said they didn't taste as if they'd been cooked long enough so she added some salt to them and cooked them and that made them better.
