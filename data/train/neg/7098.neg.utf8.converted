I bought these red hots as a stocking stuffer. I looked at the price of $6 bucks for red hots and thought it would be a HUGE bag. The bag was tiny! I feel ripped off. why would such a small bag of commonplace candy be so expensive. I should have looked but in future I really need to stick to products that amazon sells.
