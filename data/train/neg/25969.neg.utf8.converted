I was so excited about this chocolate tea! After reading rave reviews I thought I would give it a try. It tastes like you are drinking water-downed baking chocolate. It was incredibly bitter. I added a bit of raw sugar which helped a bit, but it didn't make it amazing. I think the only way that it could possible taste good is if you made it with hot milk and a lot of sugar. At that point you might as well just have normal hot chocolate. Save yourself the money- don't buy this.<br /><br />Side comment: I never received the lid to the tin. Who sends a tin without a lid? I am really not sure.
