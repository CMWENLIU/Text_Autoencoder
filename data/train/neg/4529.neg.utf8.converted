Rachel Ray either knows NOTHING about dog nutrition or she doesn't care.  Rachel, you are no Martha Stewart.<br /><br />Nutrish is anything but, it's loaded with COMMON dog food allergens (soy & corn), fillers (corn gluten & dried beet pulp) and<br />'animal fat'... which is a nice way of saying: We took all the dead & diseased animals from the slaughterhouse leftovers, plus the euthanized dogs & cats, rendered them down, drained off the fat & sold it back to the makers of Nutrish as 'animal fat'.<br /><br />There was a big investigation by the Dept. of Agriculture about 15 years ago, that discovered that many dog foods that<br />contained ANIMAL FAT had high amounts of barbiturates in them, because the fat contained the rendered remains of<br />euthanized pets, which are euthanized by a barbiturate overdose.  DVMs across the US were finding that it was taking<br />more of the barbiturate to euthanize the pet because the pet was being fed a small dose in its food on a daily basis,<br />due to the rendered animal fat found in about 25 dog foods, including Nutro.<br /><br />Dried Beet Pulp is the by-product that is left over from the processing of sugar beets, they extract the sugar, and what's left<br />is beet pulp (usually fed to pigs as it's cheap), but in dogs (which are carnivores) it's INDIGESTIBLE & produces gas (which<br />can cause gastric torsion - fatal if not caught & repaired via a DVM surgery in time) and beet pulp produces a FALSELY firm<br />stool, causing you to believe that your beloved dog is healthy because he's pooping some firm poops.<br /><br />No, the dog can't digest the beet pulp, it dehydrates the dog & passes through like a bale of hay....<br /><br />A good dog food contains WHOLE ingredients (not meal), no fillers, no soy, corn or wheat, whole fruits & veggies, no<br />salt and should contain whole turkey or chicken, whole herring and cottage cheese.  Your dog does not need salt if<br />the food contains whole veggies, potatoes, whole fish or cottage cheese, as those foods naturally contain salt.<br /><br />Natura Pet makes Evo (grain free), Innova, California Natural, and their pet food (cat, dog, ferret) contain 100%<br />HUMAN GRADE ingredients... "natural" means nothing.  Natura sells to mom & pop pet food stores, not chains or<br />supermarkets, because their food is preservative free, very tasty & HIGHLY caloric, so feed 1/2 the amount that<br />you would normally feed.  On Evo & on Innova your dog will poop 75--50% less stool volume because there's no<br />fillers and it's digestible.  These foods produce a glorious coat & even the pickiest eater will eat them.  Don't<br />supplement with canned food or other items, you won't need them.<br /><br />My Borzoi would spit out filet mignon scraps if they were cold, not sauteed in butter.  LOL!  But, she LOVED Evo.
