We received an email back from Cascadian farms. "People" in the US like sugar.<br />I've enjoyed Purely O's for quite a few years until I noticed something different. I thought it was the milk, but no, I eat them from the box of the evening if I need to take medicine with food. They were a 5 star and we bought them in quantities on sale until we noticed the taste and started checking around. Sugar? If I wanted a sugary taste and sugary cereal, I'd chose a a regular branded sugary cereal, there are plenty of them.
