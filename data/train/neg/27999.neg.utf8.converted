I have tasted many ginger beers in my time, because of this I was looking for a healthier alternative. I found this diet ginger beer by Regetta with the hopes of it keeping the sugar and calories down while quenching my ginger beer sweet tooth. I have to say that in the first part of the question it passed with flying colors but it failed miserably in the second. The sugar and calories are almost non-existent but it sacrifices the most important factor for this point and that is taste. Their is almost no ginger "tang" and very little carbonation to boot.<br />Still looking for a better diet ginger beer replacement.
