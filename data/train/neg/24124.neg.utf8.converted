I thought these chips would be the same excellent quality as the Ghirardelli White Chocolate bar.  Instead of cocoa butter, which is the main ingredient in really good white chocolate, these chips have both palm kernel AND palm oil. This is very disappointing, since other Ghirardelli products I have tried have been excellent.  Don't waste your money on these expensive, horrible-tasting white chocolate chip wannabes.
