Amazon should publish the nutrition label for food items.<br /><br />I bought this product because I read that blueberries are suppose to be good for me.<br /><br />Product arrived quickly. About 5 days using the super saver free shipping.<br /><br />Package is the typical re-sealing bag.<br /><br />The berries inside have the same size and texture as raisins.<br /><br />The taste is not like raisins, it is more like some kind of industrial chemical flavor.<br /><br />The food label says Blueberries, sugar, and oil.....<br /><br />What kind of oil? Hmmm, it has the slight overtones of used motor oil, yep that's what it taste like....<br /><br />And why add sugar? Is it to cover up the flavour of the oil...?<br /><br />And why add oil at all? Isn't there a big enough car market for the stuff?<br /><br />I don't think this is as healthy as I thought it would be..<br /><br />Nope.
