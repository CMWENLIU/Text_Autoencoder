This review is not about the benefits of the product. I've heard a lot of good things and that's why I bought it.<br /><br />I wish this was not "pitted". At least I would have been pitting them while eating them and expecting a pit in every date. About 1 out of 8 dates only is completely pitted, and the other 7 are either not pitted, half pitted, quarter pitted, crushed pit inside, etc. Whichever technique was used in pitting was a fail and a waste of time and quality. Result is toothaches and possibly breaking tooth or crown if not being very careful. 2 stars gone there.<br /><br />Combination of price + S&H is a little high. 1 star gone there.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />So after trying to ignore all the bad dates I've gotten so far I couldn't take anymore. The dates are full of black dots and many of them have bugs, or bugs' eggs. I found out that where a bitter funky tasting one crushed in my mouth I checked it and it had bugs' eggs. Really? How old are these dates? They're too dry and old. There goes another star.
