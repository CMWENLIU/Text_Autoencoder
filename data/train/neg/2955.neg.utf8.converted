I bought the Weed-B-Gon because the old Weed & Feed is not available in any stores in my area.  Weed & Feed worked.  Weed-B-Gon DOES NOT WORK!  I've tried spaying my yard 3 times in the past 2 months, and it did not kill one single weed.  After 24 hours, the weeds are still there.  After 1 week, the weeds are still there.  After 2 months, the weeds are still there, healthy as ever!  Don't buy this bogus product!  Can i give less than one star rating?
