Ordered this with much anticipation, as there are few "ready made" hush puppy mixes on the market.  Made the first batch, took the first taste, and....BLECHHHH! I wonder if I got a bad batch - TERRIBLY over-salted - beyond the point where I could swallow a bite.  It's as if the salt was the primary ingredient in the mix!  Awful, orange coloring also put me off initially.  BAD EXERIENCE; BAD PRODUCT if you're looking for a hush puppy mix.....
