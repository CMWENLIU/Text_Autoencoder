Wakame is a pleasant, mild, slightly salty, tasting sea vegetable.  It helps to maintain an alkaline balance in the body, and is an excellent source of iodine. However, when I ordered the Emerald Cove brand of wakame, I wasn't aware that their product is imported from China. Since I have concerns about the quality and processing of food products from China, I recommend ordering wakame from an importer who obtains it from another country. Five stars for high quality wakame.  Zero stars for food products imported from China.
