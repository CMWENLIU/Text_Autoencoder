Order this only if you use large quantities of dressing in a short time, or share the order with others.  The expiration date on the dressing I received was within a couple of months, so I ended up giving some away and throwing away a couple of bottles.  Love the dressing, but the expiration date was MANY months shorter than what I found on the shelf of my local grocery store, so it ended up not being a good value.
