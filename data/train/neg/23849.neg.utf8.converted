A friend and I stopped by the candy shop before a movie and I was drawn to these little small antique-looking packets. I turned it around and read how it had been known as the very first breath freshener from the 1890s. It was .99 cents and quite a curiosity to me so I ended up buying it. As my friend and I were standing in line, I ripped it open, handed him a few and popped a small, black square into my mouth. I was in for a surprise...and not a very good one I might add! As my friend and I gagged for a few seconds, he ran to the trash can and spat them out. I was so confused...is it supposed to taste like perfume? You might as well grab a bottle of perfume and spray this stuff in your mouth! Yuck! I think I'm going to have nightmares about this stuff...
