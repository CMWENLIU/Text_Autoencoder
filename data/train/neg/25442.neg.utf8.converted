I was not at all pleased with this product. I regularly purchase Nutiva brand hemp seeds but when I saw the price of this brand I decided to give it a try. As the old adage goes, "you get what you pay for". I noticed there were a lot of pieces of the outer shell mixed into the seeds which has a very course texture in contrast to the regular texture. While I can get over that, every day I ate them I would bite into very hard orange crystaly bits which I have to assume aren't digestible. I'm not sure if Manitoba is addings these things as filler as a cheap means of increasing the weight or if they're getting mixed in by accident - in either case though it's unacceptable. I would not recommend this product and would probably not try it again. The extra monetary cost of Nutiva is certainly worth it to forego the filler. On the other hand, Amazon was amazing. Delivery was prompt (ahead of schedule actually) and of course I have nothing bad to say about subscribe and save.
