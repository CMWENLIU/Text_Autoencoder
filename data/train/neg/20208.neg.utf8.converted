This order took 25 days to arrive..The story given me changed every time I contacted.  I am angry that they claim the fault lays with the post office..to the point they have actually printed a card they put in the box saying delays are the post office. The tracking shows a different story.  It took them 10 days from order to print the label and then 11 days for them to actually get it to the post office...Once the shipper had the product it only took 4 days to get it to me.  4 days with the post office..the rest was on the vendor...
