I am so sad about this food. I have fed my animals evo and innova after P&G took over and ruined Iams and Eukanuba. I searched for a good food and I found the best food in the Nutura pet food. Organic USA based, all of there supply chain was controlled by them and it was all use products. It was the only food that was not involved with pet food recalls back in 2007. P&G has signed a contract stating that they will not change the recipe until June of 2012. Well guess what we are here and the food has already changed. It changed almost instantly after they bought it. The food was just not the quality it used to be. Crumbly and dusty. It won't be long and everything about the food especially their good name will change...
