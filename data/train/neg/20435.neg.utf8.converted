I purchased this based on the good reviews.  But I have to agree with the last post.  I am pretty disappointed with this coffee.  When I opened the can, I can smell something that was a bit off; it was not particularly unpleasant but it was distinct enough to be detected.  And when I brewed the coffee, I could taste whatever it was that was causing the off smell.  It's hard to describe this taste and smell; the best I can come up with to describe the smell is that it reminds me of either paper or plastic; maybe both.  And the coffee flavor/taste is muted.<br /><br />I will not purchase this product again.  I was very optimistic about this product when I ordered it as I had recently purchased and enjoyed another coffee product (regular, not decaffeinated) by Melitta.  Since this item may not be returned, I guess I'm out of luck.  I'll think twice about ordering groceries from Amazon again; especially if untried and when it comes in bulk like this one did.
