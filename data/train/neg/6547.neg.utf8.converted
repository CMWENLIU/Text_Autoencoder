After eating wellness core, my cat has developed urinary crystals. Now I see that many pet owners have had the same problem. I am so upset that I did this to my cat. I chose it for the no grain/high protein formulation and instead of great nutrition I have fed him something that has caused pain and suffering.  This seems to be a well known issue from the numerous complaints I have now found. It should be removed from production until the formulation is corrected.
