I was advised by a health care professional to eat prunes daily as a means of supplementing my fiber intake.  I was skeptical, but I gave it a try.  I discovered to my mild astonishment that prunes can taste better than I remembered them from distant past experiences, and here they are available on Amazon.  The prunes are available as a Kirkland product, and Costco shoppers realize that Kirkland is the Costco store brand, or something like that.<br /><br />So, I was further actually astonished to discover that my local Costco store sells this same product, 3.5 pound bag, for the amount of $6.40 instead of the $18 to $20 price as they are on Amazon.  Why should anyone pay that much when the same item is sold in Costco stores for $6.40?  Is this some kind of a gouge?
