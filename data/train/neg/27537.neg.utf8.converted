I have no issues with the product, in fact it is an excellent product and our puppies love this food, but I do object to it being represented as a case of 24 cans and being priced like 24 cans only to find out it is a "half-case" of 12 cans.  Enough said ... it's worth it to drive 50 miles and buy from the store.  This is the second provider that represents the product as a full case and delivers a half-case!
