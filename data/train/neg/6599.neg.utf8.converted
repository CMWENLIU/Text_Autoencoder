What I normally think of when I see candy rocks is a hard chocolate shell over a chocolate center.  Additionally, the product description includes the phrase "Products are manufactured in a facility that processes tree nuts/peanuts, dairy wheat and soy products." What it doesn't say is that the product CONTAINS tree nuts, jelly beans and who knows what else.  And this is a Kosher product! Likewise the manufacturer site does not mention the additional contents of this product.  Add to that, the nuts tasted somewhere between stale and fowl.<br /><br />I certainly will not purchase another product from Koppers unless I can taste it first.<br /><br />I called customer service, got a refund and threw the remaining 4.5 pounds in the trash.
