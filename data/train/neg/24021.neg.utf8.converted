I bought this syrup hoping to be able to make coffee or lattes at home that taste at least a little bit like Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts pumpkin spice lattes.  Not only does this taste nothing like either, it is actually gross.  My husband took a whiff of it and gagged.  The bottle was sealed when it came so I don't think mine was tampered with.  I just think the flavor and smell is so far off from any other pumpkin flavoring out there.  We ended up dumping it down the drain.
