I just forced myself to eat a whole bowl of this because it is healthy- which is it's only redeeming quality. I scooped this into my mouth quickly and simultaneously tried to hold back the vomit that was gurgling up. I then drank some of the milk in my cereal bowl to relieve my mouth of the nauseating flavor, only to find the taste had leeched into the liquid.<br /><br />If you like the show 'Fear Factor' or 'Bizarre Foods', you will like this cereal. I say save your money and just tear into a cardboard box instead of eating this.
