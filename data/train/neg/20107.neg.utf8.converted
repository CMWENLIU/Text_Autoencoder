Just bought a case of Nestle Pure Life water.  We were with my boyfriend's daughter and she told us to buy a different kind since they sold it at school and she thought it tasted "funny."  Since she tends to be a little finicky, we disregarded her comment.  Mistake.  The water has an odd, metallic aftertaste and your tongue feels a little tingly afterward (not in a good way).  Even on sale, this is definitely not worth it.  We not only wouldn't buy it again, we wouldn't even take it if it was free.  It's that bad.
