With the greatest satisfaction, I've been purchasing this product for over a year, but my latest purchases of this product are very disappointing. As a person that chose Emerald Harmony no salt cashews over all the other brands sold on Amazon, I am very upset that Amazon is passing off an oily brand of no salt cashews I once bought on Amazon (much to my great disliking) as Emerald Harmony's no salt cashews.  Please give me and those other people who know their nuts back the original great Emerald Harmony no salt cashews you use to sell.<br /><br /> mg(I know my nuts and hope to be able to purchase them again)
