With the increased popularity of argon and coconut oils being used by women of all ethnicities, I mistakenly thought this product would be appropriate for my hair.  I use argon oil now, and it really helps to calm frizz and flyaways for my colored (and overly dry) hair.<br /><br />I have thick, coarse, wavy hair that is color treated.  I have used hot oils, and leave in oils, for years, without having any problems.  But this product seems to be intended mostly for ethnic hair.  No where on the product does it say this, but the advertisement has an ethnic model, and other products in the line are clearly not intended for Caucasian hair.<br /><br />Since there are NO directions on this product, I would imagine I would use it the same way I use my argon oil, but that results is limp, greasy looking hair, even when using the product sparingly.  And the ingredients certainly leave a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Perhaps a woman with ethnic hair would know immediately that this product was intended for her, but with very little information provided in the description and even less on the packaging, I think a lot of women are tricked into thinking this is an appropriate product for their hair type, and it really is not.  I think this product needs an overhaul with more clarification in it's advertising, description, and packaging.
