This product says GLUTEN FREE in large letters right on the front of the jar. Also the ingredients listed in the product description online looked fine to me. Just FYI, I was diagnosed with a wheat allergy several years ago. Anyway, I bought this product and used it without reading the label once I had it at home. My bad I guess, because I got very sick from it. THEN, I read the label and saw the dreaded words "NATURAL MODIFIED FOOD STARCH"... in other words, wheat! I will continue to look for a powdered soup base that doesn't contain wheat... they're very hard to find! I just wanted to warn those who have celiac and/or a wheat allergy like me.
