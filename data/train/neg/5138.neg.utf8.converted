The spice packets that come with the noodles are NOT spicy at all. I'm guessing the flavor packets were dulled to appeal more to American tastes, but they definitely are not on the same level as what I'm used to. Very disappointed. With the normal noodles, I could only use half a packet or risk burning off my taste buds, with these a full packet barely tingles my tongue. With the cold weather coming up I was really looking forward to bowls of hot spicy noodles, now I have to make do with the dulled down versions.
