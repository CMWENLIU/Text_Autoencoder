I have had several rooibos teas.  Most in tea bags. some at starbucks.  As soon as I opened the bag I knew there was a problem because it was ground almost as fine as coffee.  It went straight through my tea diffuser and the grounds were all in my cup, plus it tasted nothing like any rooibos I have ever had.  Pretty bad actually.  Highly disappointing.  I was so excited about this shipment.  Do not order this.  get it from your natural foods store where you can see it if gonna get in bulk.  If not stick with the 10.00 boxes of these tea bags for sale.  Tastes like you could use this in an iced tea machine maybe with a fine filter so you can brew like coffee.  Otherwise useless.
