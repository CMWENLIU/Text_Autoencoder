If you can stand the taste of Aspartame then you won't mind this product, the fruit punch flavor is ok except for that. Personally the aspartame taste was too strong and bitter for me to enjoy this drink. I wish that they could/would use sorbital in this product like they do in some of the bottled varieties.
