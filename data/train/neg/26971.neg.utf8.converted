I bought this product last year and it was shipped in a dirty box (used before for canned pork). I decided not to complain because the can with oil was ok.<br />This year they shipped 2 cans of oil with less then 3 month till expiration date. The company representative said that it is ok to send last year food and I should send it back at my expense. He was not able to check if they have fresher oil.
