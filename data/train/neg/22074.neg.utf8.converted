Was so excited to find this at amazon since I had tasted this product and was impressed. It was good and tasty and it was soft. When I rec'd the 3 boxes I opened one and was really excited to experience the same foodgasm I had when I first got introduced to this fruit bar...first bite ...more a food nightmare since I have 3 boxes with 12 bars that I don't feel like consuming...it was stale and hard...What a waste.:(
