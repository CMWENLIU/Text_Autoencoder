This is not the best manuka honey you can buy. My jar arrived with a flimsy lid (I should have returned it right then, but I wanted to give it a try). The honey feels diluted and it doesn't have the consistency of real manuka honey. Yes, it's cheaper, but in the long run, you're better off with a more expensive, but potent product.
