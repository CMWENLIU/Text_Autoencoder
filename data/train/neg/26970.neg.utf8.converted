I'm not opposed to change,but I do oppose change when change wasn't needed in the first place. I am so disappointed in Necco's misguided decision to change their classic Sweethearts conversation hearts. Once a great traditional candy they're now just gross. They changed all the flavors, eliminated the white ones all together (which as luck would have it, were my favorites) and changed the nice crunchy texture to a soft disintegrating mess. Bleck. What a huge mistake. Why change a trusty classic? Why not just make a new candy?
