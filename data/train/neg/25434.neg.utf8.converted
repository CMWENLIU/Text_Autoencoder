This is the second time in the last 2 months amazon has cancelled my order.  First the hp touchpad, which i wasted money buying a case for it only to have my order cancelled with no warning, now my 6 bags of skittles were cancelled with no warning.  Amazon says i can order them again, for $28.00.  Sounds like a good deal, i ordered them originally for $6.00
