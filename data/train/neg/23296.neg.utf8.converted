This product is hard to find where I live and I was willing to pay the extremely high shipping charge to get it -- but the vendor did not respond to two e-mail requests, it took 3 days by telephone, then another six days to get the product once they finally determined that I had not received it.  Six weeks is way too long for an in stock product and customer service was really lacking.<br /><br />The sugar is good and really nice for adding flavor and I like the way it never clumps.
