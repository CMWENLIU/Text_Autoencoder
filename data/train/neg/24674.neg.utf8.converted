The coffee pictured here is the DARK ROAST that was sold in their first store in 1971, and is still being sold in the Starbuck stores today.  The coffee that I received is the MEDIUM ROAST.  There is a vast difference.  The packaging mine came in had a rendering of a Starbucks store in UT Burnt Orange on a white background on the front and the left side of the package was solid Burnt Orange with the three different roasts listed:  Blonde, Medium and Dark.  On the front was the Starbucks logo in green and white and beneath that in large Burnt Orange letters:  MEDIUM ROAST.  This obviously is not the dark roast that is sold in the stores and pictured here.  It is just flat, very bitter coffee.  I have a package of ground Pike Place coffee in my freezer right now that was purchased at a Starbucks store for $13 and change.  It looks exactly like the package pictured here and it tastes entirely different. I could only take a sip or two of the coffee I received - it is very bitter.  There is no hint of almonds or chocolate.  Amazon says this cannot be returned, but I received something that was different from what I ordered and what is pictured and I would like a refund or a replacement.  If Amazon corects this mistake, I will update this review.<br /><br />REVIEW UPDATE 1.8.12<br /><br />I spoke with Amazon Customer Service and they graciously agreed to either refund my money or send a replacement.
