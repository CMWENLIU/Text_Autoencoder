Bacon Salt isn't a terrible food additive standing alone.  To my mind, however, nothing that costs over two dollars -- I paid $5 for a little bottle -- should contain both corn syrup *and* trans fats.  (Why does a spice need fat?)  I probably shouldn't have paid for it, but I heard rave reviews and was sucked in by the prospect of making my spinach salad taste like hot, salty, fatty pork.  For the money, I can't say it's worth the price.<br /><br />Also, it's a major "caker."  Don't use it for a month, and you've got a brick of barbecue potato chip seasoning.
