I should have read the reviews on this, as I, too, thought I would get 3 dinosaurs given the picture and the word "assorted."  When I called customer service to complain, they said "assorted" means they choose for you which of the three assorted you will receive. While they wouldn't send me additional bones, they credited me $3.00 and were very polite in handling my complaint.
