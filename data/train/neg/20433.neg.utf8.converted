I wish the NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION were posted on the amazon.com page.  If it were, I would have known that this product is relatively HIGH IN SODIUM - 310 mg of sodium per TEASPOON!  Not my cup of tea.  Now I have 4 giant tins of this product.  Aarrgh!<br />UPDATE:  I finally found how to email customer service thru the "Help" button upper right of the page, and I was impressed at their response!
