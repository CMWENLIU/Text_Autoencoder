When I first bought this item I loved it. But after having it for a few months the biggest problem I have is starting the darn thing! I'll select my steam time I need and when I press start it beeps at me. In problem shooting it says if it beeps 6x then its not locked in but it beeps more then 6x. Plus it doesn't even puree most stuff like green beans, carrorts, and apple sauce, are some of the top ones I can think of.
