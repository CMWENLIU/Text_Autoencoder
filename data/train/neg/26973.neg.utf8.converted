Be aware of the quantity you're ordering! When I ordered, this was offered as a pack of 6. Only one was delivered to me, and when I called Amazon, they kindly rush-shipped the replacement (I only asked for 5, but they said they would send 6) the next day. The next day, I again only received one. I called them again -- this time, they wanted me to ship back the treats so they could do an investigation on their warehouse because "something is clearly wrong." Excuse me? You want me to take the time to go to the post office to send back a few bucks worth of dog treats so I can wait for YOU to do an investigation on what's going wrong in YOUR warehouse? Not wise, Amazon -- you should have sent me my replacement that I was entitled to, and promptly at that.
