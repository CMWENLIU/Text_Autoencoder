I'm happy to hear that others are having good luck with this product.  Unfortunately, our experience has not been quite as positive.<br /><br />First, I was a bit disappointed at the construction.  For this price point I would have expected something other than flimsy plastic.<br /><br />Second, within a month of buying the door the retractable plastic piece started randomly going up and down.  I called their customer service department to inquire.  The rep described it as a known issue.  The solution was to disable the auto-retract safety feature.  I asked when a permanent fix was forthcoming and she told me that disabling the safety feature WAS the fix.  Baffled, I asked if she thought that was a good solution.  She told me I could return the product for a refund if I wanted to (after having cut a hole in the side of my house) in that pseudo-polite, passive-aggressive manner that makes me want to rub broken glass in my eyes.  I hope that she was simply someone who needs to be fired rather than a typical representation of the company.<br /><br />Third, as others have noted,the collar and "fob" are extraordinarily flimsy.  My standard poodle destroyed hers within a few weeks.  Compared to other dogs, she is very gentle so I was surprised when it just fell apart.  I was able to click it back together a few times and get it working, but this last time I saw some sort of yellow-ish corrosive looking goo inside it.  My wife called their customer service and they are sending a replacement.  Meanwhile,the poor dog is very confused.  :)<br /><br />Fourth, the fob is NOT directional.  We have fought with sensitivity settings until we are cross-eyed and whenever the dog is close to the door, it opens.<br /><br />Had we paid $50 or $75 for this product I wouldn't have even bothered with this review.  But, at ~$400.00 (including wall extension, extra batteries, shipping, etc) I am fairly disappointed.<br /><br />I hope others find this helpful.
