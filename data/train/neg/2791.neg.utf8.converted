I've tasted a large number of Dr Pepper imitators, and Dr. Zevia is by far the worst.<br />I like Stevia sweeteners, you see, and I assumed Dr. Zevia would be delicious.<br />Don't buy it, don't drink it. It tastes like chalky cherry cough syrup. I've only been able to drink it when mixed with Coca Cola or Dr Pepper, and that defeats the purpose of diet soda entirely, doesn't it?<br /><br />I'm not even willing to try the other Zevia flavors, I still have 17 cans of Dr Zevia I can't handle. Blech.
