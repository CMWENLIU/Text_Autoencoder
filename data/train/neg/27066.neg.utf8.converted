Yes, I should have read the whole description, so I take part of the blame.  However, I can't see how in any way how this rice could be considered "RED" as stated in the title above:<br /><br />"A Gourmet Aromatic Whole Grain RED Rice"<br /><br />Nowhere on the front of the bag does it clarify that it's brown rice as it does on the back.<br /><br />I'm not saying it's bad rice, just that it's not RED as the title clearly states.<br /><br />There is a specific type of rice known as "red rice".  This is NOT it.  When it arrived in the mail, the front label says "RED RICE" on the back it says it's brown rice.<br /><br />So, yes, I should have read the whole description closer, but just calling brown rice red on the label doesn't make it so.<br /><br />Disappointed, will not be buying any more Lundberg products.  Sorry, but you ticked me off with your misleading labeling.
