When looking at the picture and the caption saying "10 Pack," i thought that they were going to give ten packets of whatever was shown in the image (so a total of 50 small packs over all).<br /><br />However, it only came with 1 large package, or 10 small packs over all. That comes out to about $1.50 per pack. If you visit any Asian market, Hi Chew costs at most $1.<br /><br />Not only am I overpaying for candy, but I'm overpaying while buying in bulk which should NEVER happen.
