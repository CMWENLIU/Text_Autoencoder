Nobody here really Knows: what's the 'mango powder's pure<br />Weight'(:=X)? - Let's try to find out - from this seller's info:<br />~ Wt1 = 9 oz , - as 'Weight To Ship' [ that's ~270 g ] ,<br />or<br />~ Wt2 = 1.3 Lbs (pounds)~ as 'Item Weight' [ that's ~ 590.2 g ]!<br />Surely: .....Wt1 > Wt2..........(1), - because 'Item Weight' is<br />included in 'Weight To Ship' , - at least it sould be so. -<br />But...Wt1 = 270g &lt; 590 g = Wt2..(2), that contradicts with (1)!(*)<br />- So if they take 590 g , pack it, put in a box to ship, -<br />& then it becomes more than twicely less in weight, - probably<br />they poor out that mango powder & just send to us an empty can(?)...<br />To buy it - everyone wants to know the 'netto' weight (=X?) of<br />this can/jar of mango powder. - Otherway just nobody buy it!<br />If empty 'can with cover' has weight:= Wo, then ...Wt2 = Wo + X...(3),<br />where X is the weight of pure mango powder that I'm trying to find.<br />If an 'empty shipping box with something besides' item that prevent<br />item to be broken, - has weight:= Ws, then ...Wt1 = Ws + Wt1 .....(4),<br />Then from Equations (3)&(4) we transitively have:Wt1 = Ws + Wo + X..(5),<br />where X is the weight of pure mango powder that I'm trying to find<br />yet. Let's suppose that "approximately"  Wo = ~90 g & Ws = ~ 100 g.<br />How "approximately" close is it? - it doesn't really matter. Then<br />from Equations (5)&(3) we have two equations:<br />{...270 g = ~90 g + ~100 g + X ...(6);... 590 g = ~90 g + X ...(7)}.<br />So from the First Equation(6):X=270g-(~100g)-(~90g)= ~80g;-but from<br />the Second Equation(7):X=590g-(~90g)= ~500g,-that's more than 6 times<br />heavier than the same weight X from the First Equation(6)!(**)<br />After both contradictions: (*) & (**) , I just couldn't trust<br />this seller! - I rest my case! - Somebody please correct this seller<br />or amazon's weight arithmetics info or it would look like gypsy 'bazar'?!<br />- Does anybody really know this one mango powder pure weight?!<br />- It looks like only X= ~2.7oz of mango powder is packed in very heavy can<br />with something else heavy - just like such complete waste of my money!
