So I am drinking this water with my family right now and I am seriously concerned that we are all about to die.  The amount of fulvic acid that some people are considering good for them makes my anus feel like it is about to explode about 30 minutes after drinking a bottle. That being said, I am considering ordering a case for my next cult suicide.  (Yes, Next) Now, on the subject of "Enjoy the Dark Side" I find that even comparing the god awful taste of this water to something as mild as the sith (compared to the water of course) is just insulting. Also, on the subject of my grammar that last sentance, it's possibly a side effect of the water's terribly written website, and the chemicals from all of the decaying plant matter that makes up 90% of the bottle. Now, on to that suicide.
