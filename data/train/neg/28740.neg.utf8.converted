I don't like this product at all.I have been growing fava beans for my own home use consumption for more than 20 years.Unfortunately this year's crop was not as<br />good as I had hoped for and I was looking to buy some additional beans.<br />Looking at the offering of Amazon for the Westbrae beans I thought that this was<br />just what I needed but what a disappointment. After opening a can, at 1st glance<br />inside I knew these are very old beans. How could I tell? The big black stripe<br />on the top of the beans mean they were grown to maturity and probably dried before<br />canning, making them very tough. The taste:horrible.The product in my opinion isn't worth more than a couple of nickels per can.<br />Well,live and learn.<br /><br />Jan Van.
