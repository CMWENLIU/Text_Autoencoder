First off - disappointed with the false "Prime Shipping". I ordered this on 8/9 thinking I would get it before my vacation on 8/12. It came on 8/13 after I was already gone - if that was the case I would have ordered it when I returned.<br /><br />So I tried this product, despite the reviews and it exploded for me also. I used Cyclone first - it started coming out fine then began to squirt all over. When the K-Cup exploded, the foil opened on the side of the cup. What I noticed when I opened the box was that the foil that seals the K-Cups were not properly attached to them. They did not go all the way to the ends of the cups (like all the other brands I compared them too). Also, they were not sealed tight with the bubble on the top (like the other brands I have) which tells me they are not sealed properly.<br />I am disappointed. The taste is OK (that's the 2 stars) but the poor design is frustrating and messy. POOR DESIGN!<br />I will not order these again. I am not even sure I will use what I have or if I will attempt to return them.
