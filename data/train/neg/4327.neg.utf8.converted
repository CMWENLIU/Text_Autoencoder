Ujinotsuyu Matcha Hagoromo is not nearly as good as some of the other brands of matcha I tried. Instead of being a pure green, it had a faint yellow-brownish tinge. It was also quite harsh and bitter-flavored. If you're willing to spend more money but don't want expensive tea ceremony grade matcha, try Do Matcha 2nd Harvest (the red label variety). It has a much lighter and fresher flavor. My local store also carries Maeda-en, which is better than Ujinotsuyu but not as good as Do Matcha.
