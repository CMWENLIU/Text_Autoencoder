I was devastated by this product, even angry. Don't they think, the manufacturers of this otherwise great product, that folks who spend their hard-earned money buying blueberries, are trying to eat a natural health enhacing food?<br /><br />Why contaminate these big, beautiful berries with one of the most horrible sugars ever invented by mankind. Yes, these blueberries are bathed with High Fructuose Corn Syrup. In fact, they have so much of this Genetically Modified sugar that eating a few of them mad me cough uncontrollably! The only way I could eat these blueberries was after washing them for 15 min in running water and this was not enough.<br /><br />Worse. Where foes it say in their advertisment that this supposedly natural product is contaminated with GM HFCS? I think, we consumers, should be able to look at a lable before we spend our cash. Please do not buy this product if you are looking for a natural diet!<br /><br />Why not sweeten this product with the new US approved sweetener Stevia?
