I just bought Bigelow Green Tea and would advise anyone purchasing this product to read the country of origin which is "Product of China".  The write up says that the product is blended and distributed in the USA, but that in itself is deceptive if the originating country is not listed.  Food products according to the Food and Drug administration aren't required to actually list where a product comes from.
