I didn't expect this low carb pancakes to taste like the yummy carb laden pancakes of my youth, but dear Lord, these pancakes were horrible.  i followed the directions to the letter from the back of the box and made up the entire box (we love us some pancakes, and we have company over). The first few pancakes were the usual... not meant to be served.  But they kept getting worse.  Thick, gloppy, uncooked centers, and the parts we could eat tasted like glue and saw dust.<br /><br />The WORST part is, I called New Hope Mills to complain and they won't give me my money back or offer me a consideration.  It must be user error.  I can make pancakes, I've been cooking for over 25 years.  In fact I made bisquik pancakes yesterday for the family.<br /><br />So.... Skip this mix.  Unless you like raw centered glue/saw dust pancakes.  In which case, Enjoy!!
