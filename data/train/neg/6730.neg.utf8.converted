PLease do not buy this product people, each spice is literally 1 table spoon, I never though that this tiny thing would cost so much, I expected something a little bit bigger for 40 bucks. Contents are ridiculously small, the little cover box is heavier than the spice that it contains. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT&lt; GO TO YOUR LOCAL INDIAN STORE, YOU WILL GET MORE FOR YOUR BUCK. this is waste of money and time, I returned this product immediately. So cheap, I cannot even understand why do this guys sells them, do they think that people are dumb????
