If you used to use Soy Vey's Cha Cha Chinese Chicken Salad Dressing (which was delicious and addictive), don't think that this is what you're getting here. We ordered six bottles of it, because the dressing was no longer available at the store.  They sent us a new product which is basically their Sesame Dressing.  It tastes nothing like the Chinese Chicken Salad Dressing. It appears they are marketing their Sesame Dressing as their Chinese Chicken Salad Dressing.  I know its confusing, but the bottom line is this: if you want Cha Cha Chinese Chicken Salad Dressing DONT BUY THIS...its sesame oil with sesame seeds mixed in. Period.
