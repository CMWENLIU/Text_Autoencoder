Ok, when you start screwing with the original delicious flavor of cashews, then you are experimenting randomly.  These do not taste good!  Plain and simple.  Pepper belongs on eggs only and NOT on cashews.  There is a tangy citrisy flavor that doesn't make it either.<br /><br />I honestly say, I tried a handful, husband tried a handful and we said, NO WAY!  The claim is SEA Salt, whatever that is;  I know I wouldn't drink sea water, so why would I like SEA Salt.  The cashews are hot and spicy and overall, the heavy seasonings take away the original flavor, and without original flavor you have something completely different.<br /><br />Cashews generally are a good source of snacks and these have no transfat which is good.  It's a good thing I have a few enemies in my lifetime, because they will deserve these!....Rizzo
