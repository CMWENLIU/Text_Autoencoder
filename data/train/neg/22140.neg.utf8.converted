Cutter Bug Free Backyard is an excellent product. Use it yearly and it always helps. That's not necessarily what Amazon shipped to my home.  I received an improper bottle with a label on the front and no Manufacturer's Safety Data Sheet or any other markings, warnings, instructions that were supposed to be on the bottle.  The serial numbers were unreadable.  I didn't open the bottle in case there was tampering with the chemical inside.  Called Amazon and spent hours on the phone trying to get them to handle a potentially dangerous situation at my home.  After several hours, they agreed to refund my money but could find no way to help me get rid of the unknown substance in the bottle.  They kept referring me to "oversized packaging",which is a section of Amazon that wasn't even open for business. They also insisted that UPS could just pick up the bottle to return it.  I had to explain to them, repeatedly, that that is not permitted.  I also called UPS to make sure they knew that Amazon wanted to ship the unknown product using their service.  After hours of calls, I received an e-mail stating that they can't take the product back for health and safety reasons but were finally willing to give me back my money.  I, however, would be stuck with the product. Even after calling the manufacturer's emergency health line, they couldn't do anything without the EPA numbers that are supposed to be on an appropriate bottle.  Amazon's corporate HQ in Seattle was even less help.  They told me that they can't handle this type of issue and that no one at their HQ would assist.  I was told to call a HAZMAT removal company.  Again, I would have to pay for Amazon's mistake.  Everyone at Amazon considered it my job to pay for removal.  According to them, all the other bottles are marked properly.  They can't explain why this one wasn't or whether it had been tampered with.  I want it taken care of so that no one is injured by the contents.  Amazon suggested that offering my a $50 credit would solve the issue.  I declines their offer.  I am considering paying for the removal and filing a claim in Small Claims Court for the expense plus my time.  Perhaps public embarassment will make someone from Amazon take some responsibility.
