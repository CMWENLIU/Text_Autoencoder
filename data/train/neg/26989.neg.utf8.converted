Although this is prominently named Madagascar Vanilla Bean Powder, there is hardly any vanilla bean in it! Lots of sugar, sweeteners, non-dairy creamer and artificial ingredients, though. I wish I hadn't ordered it, and haven't opened it. I'd return it if it were eligible for returns. Anyone want mine?
