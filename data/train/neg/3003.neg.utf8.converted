I love Green tea, I love Pomegranate, and I love flavored teas.  The reviews were good so I bought this based on that information.<br /><br />But I cannot gag this stuff down.  It looks very appealing in the cup and smells like it should taste good, but I really really do not like it.  I tried it for several days thinking it must be one of those aquired tastes, but it is still really gross to me.<br />I ended up giving the entire case away to a neighbor who did sort of like it.... so it isn't ALL bad.  Must just be me.<br /><br />In my opinion -- if you have not tried it, find someplace that sells it and give it a try before you buy a whole case.
