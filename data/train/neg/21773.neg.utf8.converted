In the past I've used pure vanilla extract and vanilla beans which are expensive. However good vanilla tastes great and that's why I ordered this. It read McCormick PURE vanilla. To me that should mean only vanilla extracted from the full grown unripe fruit of the vanilla plant.<br /><br />I thought I was getting a bargain at $12 for 16 ounces of vanilla. When it arrived and I used it to make a protein shake I was shocked. One sip and I knew I had to throw away the shake. It tasted disgusting just as if it was spoiled. The first thing I noticed after using a teaspoon of this so called vanilla is that my shake smelled funny. At first I thought it was the milk or yogurt. When I smelled the vanilla from the bottle it was disgusting. I read the ingredients and noticed that there was 41% alcohol. Are they kidding? The alcohol drowns out the vanilla taste (if they really use vanilla). This might only be good for cooking because alcohol evaporates with heat. I'm completely baffled by the positive reviews here. Don't people know by the taste and terrible flavor that they are using alcohol? I definitely do not recommend this unless you're a desperate alcoholic. Most good vanilla extract I've used in the past only has about 2% alcohol. This horrible product, with 41% alcohol, might as well have been labeled "alcohol with drops of vanilla flavor" or "I dare you to taste the vanilla"! I've bought numerous items from Amazon over the last few years and 90% of the time I'm satisfied with the purchase. However, McCormick (Pure???) Vanilla has to be the worst purchase I ever made. Fortunately this is not the norm when buying here. I just wish this was a returnable item.
