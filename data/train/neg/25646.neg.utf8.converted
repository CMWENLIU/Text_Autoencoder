This was a Christmas gift from my very well meaning and thoughtful daughter-in-law and son.  I understand it is not returnable, so I will find it ANOTHER more appreciative home.  To be able to post his review I am forced to give this item at least one undeserved star. This doesn't even smell like lavender!  I grow several types of lavender, so I know what it smells like.  The contents are cheap, generic, and not worth the hard earned $40 they spent. Don't waste your money on it.
