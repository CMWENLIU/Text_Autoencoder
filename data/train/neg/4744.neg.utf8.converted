FYI to anyone who loves their cat(s) and is feeding them this premium cat food thinking it is... Well it was just (very quietly) bought out by P&G. Either that means something to you or it doesn't. For me it was a deal breaker. Our cat loved this food, but I won't feed him a product owned by that company. They *say* they will keep it all the same, but you never know.<br /><br />We switched to Orijen.
