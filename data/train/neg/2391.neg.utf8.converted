Dried fruit can be a great snack and was looking forward to the mixed fruit.  I'm sure this is not just an issue for Mariana but after opening 3 different bags, I couldn't get past the horrible smell and somehow when all the dried fruit is in one bag each fruit item almost taste the same.  Anyway, I'm sure if you don't mind the smell, these are not only good for you but a good source of sustenance, especially handy for traveling.
