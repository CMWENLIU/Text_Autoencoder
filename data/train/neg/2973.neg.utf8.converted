I'm sorry but in contrast to the other rave reviews for this product, I did not like it at all!  I purchased several e.v. olive oils and this one was most disliked by both my husband and myself.  We tasted it alone and with some fresh bread for dipping and we each experienced a funny feeling inside our mouths and a dry scratchiness to our throats that made us cough.  This has no place in my kitchen.  Sorry Siciliani :)
