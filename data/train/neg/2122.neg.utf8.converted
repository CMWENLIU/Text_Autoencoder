BAAR Cola Syrup at least TASTES good. I agree with my fellow reviewers who say it tastes good. It's exactly like coca-cola in flavour, except that it's not quite as sweet.  (And thus, doesn't even approach Pepsi-Cola in intensity of sweetness.)  No matter -- I just add a few packets of my own favourite artificial sweetener....<br /><br />This syrup, however, lists "High Fructose Corn Syrup and/or Sucrose" as its first ingredient.  Sucrose is another word for sugar....bad enough, but at least it's been used for thousands and thousands of years, and most people, throughout history, who have imbibed sucrose/sugar, have lead relatively normal,(and normal-length), lives.  But High Fructose Corn Syrup, though also natural, is a somewhat modern invention.  Thus, the claim above the name, "Cola Syrup", right in the middle of the front of the label, (that this is an "Old Fashioned Remedy") is patently false.<br />(H.F. Corn Syrup was first -- unsuccessfully -- produced in 1957, and then sucessfully mass-produced and introduced into foods in 1975.)  Even if you are born in 2010, anything that has been around in foods for only 35 years, (since 1975), can hardly be called "old-fashioned"!  Also, the listing of TWO ingredients, ("High-Fructose Corn Syrup AND / OR Sucrose"), as the possible number one, (largest amount) ingredient, is misleading, confusing, and (almost?) a violation of the law which mandates ingredients in food be listed in descending order of their amounts.  Are these "And/Or" ingredients listed alphabetically?  In order of how many bottles have HFCS, and how many have sucrose?  And how does one know, (if one is not a celebrity and is possibly being given the bottle for advertisement purposes), if the bottle one has purchased have the HFCS or the Sucrose?<br /><br />It is also totally astonishing to me that, according to the bottle, this product's manufacturer, BAAR, is the official supplier of Edgar Cayce Products!  The insignia of "Cayce Care" is, indeed, on this label!  And although the insignia is quite pretty, (a gold-outlined, white, horizontal oval, with a pretty little maple-leaf between the words "Cayce" and "Care"), I simply<br />CANNOT believe that those who presently run the "Edgar Cayce Foundation" would ever condone the use of high-fructose corn syrup<br />in any of their products!  (Edgar Cayce himself probably never<br />heard of H.F.C.S, as he himself died in 1945.  Of course, Mr. Cayce is justly famous for his predictions of the future, (which he found whilst sleeping) -- but I am quite certain, (after reading up on H.F.C.S., on Wikipedia and elsewhere), that if Mr.<br />Cayce ever DID dream of H.F.C.S., he probably put it in the "nightmare" classification, and tried to forget all about it as much, and as soon, as possible!  In his place, I know that's what I would have done!)  To find high-fructose corn syrup in an Edgar Cayce Product is totally beyond belief. For myself, I will continue to admire, and research the modest, but completely genuine and gifted genuis who was Edgar Cayce -- but I will get my cola syrup elsewhere!<br /><br />And, where elsewhere?  From SodaSteam Soda Mix!  Slightly more expensive than this "Baar" Cola Syrup, it gives one: 1) A much, much thicker syrup, but the same 16 ounce size  2) Sweetening with SPLENDA.  Many people are down on Splenda, but it has been cited as the safest of the artificial sweeteners by David Zinczenko, of the "Eat This -- Not That" series of books.  Too much of anything is not good, of course, (I found that using too much Splenda gave me, personally, elevated readings on my liver tests....so I cut down) -- but from all I've read, Splenda is better than High-Fructose Corn Syrup, by a couple of miles!<br /><br />So, it's SodaStream Soda Mix Cola flavour for me.  If I find a healthier alternative than that, I will switch, (and hopefully be able to share my discoveries in an Amazon review).  But, as of now, I don't think I will buy BAAR Cola Syrup, (Old-Fashioned Remedy....?????), thin, watery, and most probably laced with High-Fructose Corn Syrup, ever again!<br /><br />Near the bottom of the front of the label, it proclaims that this cola syrup, "Soothes Stomach Upset".  But knowing I know now, this effect is, for my stomach, very, very temporary, at best.  H.F.C.S. -- "High-Fake-Customer-Switcheroo" syrup, is not something that I recommmend....for anyone!
