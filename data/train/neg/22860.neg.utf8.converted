I chose to switch my cats to Felidae after the food they'd been eating for five years was discontinued and I had trouble finding something they liked that was safe for them to eat. Felidae seems to be one of the only brands not involved in the constant pet food recalls. I did start them on the non-senior variety and then moved to this when it was time to more closely watch their weight. They are healthy and shiny with fewer hairballs than they had in the past. UPDATE (June 13, 2012): I just got a new bag of this food. The formula seems to have changed (indicated by a new food shape), and my cats will no longer eat it.
