I've been a fan of Napoleon Lemon sours for ages, so I decided to give the assorted candies a try.  What a disappointment!  The citrus flavors (lemon, lime and orange) are delicious, but most of the others are, to my taste, mediocre or yucky (the cherry seems like medicine to me).  The seven-pound minimum quantity means that I'm stuck with a whole lot of candies that will never get eaten (unless guests pick them from the bowl on my coffee table).  Would not purchase again -- although I would buy the non-lemon Napoleon flavors if individual flavors, not the assorted mix, were sold.
