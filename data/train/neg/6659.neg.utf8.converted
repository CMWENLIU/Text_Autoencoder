There are 85 servings in this 3oz container. Each serving is only 1/4 teaspoon and yet each serving is a WHOPPING 240 mg. of sodium. Not only that but the 2nd ingredient is Monosodium Glutamate....I could be wrong but I believe this is a form or MSG.<br />Regardless, I am very disappointed in the taste of the product...hard to describe but think "wheat" plus salt flavors and that comes close to describing this seasoning...... in addition to not liking the taste I am really surprised by how high the sodium is..... and suspicious that it is loaded w/MSG.<br />I do not recommend this and am very sorry I bought it. Will probably just toss. One of the very few utter disappointments I've gotten on Amazon.<br />I was searching Amazon for "dried mint" when this came up. Yes, I read the other two reviews and did not see a mention of mint.... it was late at night, I was tired.... blah, blah.... just so you know there is absolutely zero mint in this seasoning and I'm wondering why it showed up in my original search.... oh well, live and learn.
