I don't understand how anyone has anything good to say about this product .The smell is so very horrible!! and it doesn't come out!! Its not just a scent its a chemical like stench. It made me feel dizzy and sick and will not wash out. I have had a horrible headache all day and have really bad nausea.I haven never smelled anything so bad!!<br /><br />Also, my hair didn't feel any softer, instead it felt less soft after washing it out. It feels crispy and dry. It also felt moist when the oil was still in. I didn't understand how this could be. Horrible experience
