It isn't just a quick simple thing, they don't fit the newest nespresso machines, so there is a little black rubber ring that you put on I think?!? underneath the lid (no directions, just a note saying they don't fit anymore so you have to use the little package of rings in addition to adding the foil lid)I'd return them, but it's not worth the shipping fee.
