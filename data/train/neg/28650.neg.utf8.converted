From just two days of giving these treats to  my dog she started having bloody diarrhea, less appetite and that's when I googled information about chicken jerky and was horrified about what I found. I can't believe I bought this at a Wholefoods store. I did not realize they were made in China, but now I see the correlation with other products that have been recalled. DONT BUY THESE PRODUCTS! I just trashed the bag I bought, which wasn't cheap by the way, but after seeing what it did to my dog I am not buying this again from any store.
