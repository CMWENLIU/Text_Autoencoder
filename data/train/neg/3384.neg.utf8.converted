As far as licorice goes this one is just so so. If you love real licorice buy RJ's that in my opinion is by far the best there is. This one has great texture and a good initial taste but then a strange bitter note like that of blackstrap molasses hits your tongue and a an unpleasant sulpfur after taste that lingers. It is too sweet and almost more of an anise flavor then real pure licorice. I don't know whats in it it came in a clear bag twist tied from a health food store locally. If you love blackstrap you may like it. I much prefer RJ's it is all natural and much better in both texture and pure real licorice root flavor. I like Panda brand for flavor too but not texture. I would not buy Kookaburra brand again.
