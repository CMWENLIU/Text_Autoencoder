My Baby Brezza journey is so disheatening that I have to share. I did extensive research into baby food maker and as most of you who are reading this, I narrowed it down to the Brezza and the Beaba. Brezza won me over with the one button touch and step away function. So....<br /><br />November 2011: Bought Baby Brezza on cyber monday sale (was around 100 bucks), arrived 2 weeks later -- dead on arrival. Plugged it in, no light, no function, nothing. Thankfully, my baby wasn't quite eating yet. Called Baby Brezza/emailed, a few days later a new machine came out to me.<br />Jan - March 2012: Brezza #2 working well, around the end of March, started seeing a black oiling residue. I'm a pretty chill mom, so just wiped it off and soldiered on.<br />April 2012: Brezza #2 stopped working, steams fine, but will NOT blend, can hear the motor, but no action. Called Customer service, again a few days to connect up. The agent said there was an old batch of shafts that have caused problems, will send new shaft -- a few weeks later a new Brezza showed up.<br />May 2012: On to Brezza #3, plugged it, made applesauce, take extra care regarding the shaft (purported to be new and awesome). Brezza #3 stopped working 10 hours after arrival (2 batches of baby food). Called customer service, no answer, called again, left a VM, called again, spoke to a very apologetic lady who states she will send out another new shaft and as compensation for all the inconvenience an accessory of my choice. Per her, it should arrive within 4-5 days.<br />June 2012: still waiting, almost 14 days later, placed another call to customer service.<br /><br />So my advice.<br /><br />1. didn't save money (need to have jarred baby food on hand in case your Brezza busts)<br />2. went through 3 units in 5 months<br />3. Spent A LOT of time tracking down Baby Brezza customer service.<br />4. Have a lot of spare Brezza parts in my house.<br /><br />If you were thinking about buying, consider getting it at the big box store so when it busts you can just return it and get your money back and lessen the anger and frustration at this product.<br /><br />Cheers, hope it helps. Thankfully, as we rarely had a working baby food machine, my daughter quickly graduated to mushed up food and small bites and grew out of the baby food phase... still such a bummer, what a poor made product.
