I have several dogs in several sizes.  Nylabone products are always the ones that last.  When my pit bit off an arm of this toy I almost fell off the couch.  He bit off a Nylabone!  It wasn't until I found the toy outside a few days later and picked it up, realizing that it's not solid.  Makes me wonder what other toys are not solid from NB.  We still love the brand, but I would examine new toys carefully before buying them to see if I can tell if they are solid or not.
