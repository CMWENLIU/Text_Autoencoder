I gave this product three tries; with a good hair product I think you should be able to tell its worth by then. I have long, very thick hair, and cheap conditioners tend to cause a lot of quick buildup; this was no exception. I could still feel the waxiness by the next time I washed my hair. Give this one a pass - use a real shea butter product instead, and it should absorb into the hair and scalp better.
