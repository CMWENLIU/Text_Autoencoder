Having "Community Coffee Private Reserve Ground Coffee, Medium-Dark Roast" in the product name/description is very misleading.  I never knew what chicory was, I thought maybe 100% chicory was used in flavoring the coffee.  Description needs to be much clearer - and not include "Community Coffee Private Reserve Ground Coffee, Medium-Dark Roast" in the name!
