I've been making all kinds of soda for the last 5 years from various concentrates, with a home-made carbonation kit that consists of little more than a tank of CO2, some hoses, a filter and regulator.  I regularly get the Homebrew Root Beer and Homebrew Cola and have tried every other flavor they sell.  For starters, the Ginger Ale (and several others) keeps the essential oils in an alcohol suspension, yet is sold in a plastic bottle.  It doesn't take a chemist to figure out just how stupid that is.  Every bottle I've received has been partially collapsed, bubbled/sticky on the outside and has 'particulate matter' on the inside, due to the volume of alcohol migrating through the plastic.  Same with the Lemon flavor as well - it's been totally revolting.<br /><br />Avoid this - get the Ginger Beer instead of the Ginger Ale, use Koolaid unsweetened mixes for the fruit flavors, and really just use the Homebrew label for the Cola and RootBeer products.  Get any soda concentrate with essential oils in suspension (read: most) from a distributor that uses glass bottles.<br /><br />My Soda Rig:<br />*The Carbonator - fits to 20ounce and 2liter bottles: [....]<br />*Ball Lock Disconnect - connects the Carbonator to the CO2 tank: [....]<br />*5lb or 20lb CO2 tank (get the 20 if you don't need your rig portable) - local beer homebrew or welding store.  Make sure it's food grade.<br />*Dual Gauge CO2 Regulator: [....]<br />*3-6 feet clear tubing with 1/4inch interior diameter.  It only needs to handle 50-60 psi, so it doesn't need to be reinforced.<br /><br />Most of this stuff can be gotten cheap from various local sources or somewhere here on Amazon ([....]).  Once you put it together, you can start carbonating just about anything.
