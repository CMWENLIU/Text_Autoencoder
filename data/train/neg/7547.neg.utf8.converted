I love the tender bites as do my senior cats (17 & 18 yrs old). But I do question the price, which is a unusual.  I get the 24 count variety pack for $9.49 at my local Food Lion grocery store.  I would expect a 48 count pack to be no more than double that price (18.98) so $28.11 would seem a bit high.  Unless of course  48 means 48 - 12 pack boxes.  Then the description needs  a little work.
