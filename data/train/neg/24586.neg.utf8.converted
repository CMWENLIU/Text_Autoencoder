I've been hooked on NOW's spearmint tea for awhile, and when that was unavailable for a time, I found this. I'd been wanting the benefits of green tea again anyway, and this seemed the ideal mix of the two, with the added bonus of peppermint and lemongrass. The glowing reviews here sealed my decision...but alas, I sadly haven't found this to be as wonderful as they did. I find this tea to be pretty bland no matter how little or long I steep it, and there's barely a trace of either mint to be detected. Now anything like this is going to be a matter of personal taste, obviously. I do recommend trying a single box if you can before committing to the case of 6.
