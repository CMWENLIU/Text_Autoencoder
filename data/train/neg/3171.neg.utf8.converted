Here is a comparison of liquid,organic milk and organic valley organic nonfat dry milk powder. 16 servings of liquid milk costs $5. 13 servings of powdered milk costs $7.  Powdered milk does not dissolve well at all in heated water or a blender. It works well in baking. The only benefit to powdered milk is that it can be stored much much longer than liquid milk.
