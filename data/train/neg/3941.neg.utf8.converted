I should state up front that I *like* energy drinks. I consume far too many of them. However, this "No Fear" was the absolute bitterest-tasting drink I've ever had in my life, and I actually had to spit out my first sip and dump the rest of the contents of the can down the drain. It tasted HORRIBLE. On the up-side, I really thought the design of the can was awesome, with the skull-and-bones universal sign for "poison" as a logo.
