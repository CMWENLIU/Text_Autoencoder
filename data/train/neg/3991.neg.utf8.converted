i love this sparkling water and usually have had it in the glass bottles...  but hard to find, so when i saw it was available in the plastic bottles i figured i would try it....  i was very disappointed...  half the bottles had no fizz left when they were opened...  virtually flat!.... the ones that were still carbonated were good but the others were not drinkable...  i would not order this product again....
