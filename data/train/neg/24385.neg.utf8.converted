I had this stuff a long time ago , and it was OK , but this batch is just plain nasty . I don't expect too much from instant , but I don't want to have a headache first thing in the morning . I'm sticking with Tasters Choice Gourmet Roast when available , it wasn't when I ordered this poison .<br /><br /> Update 9/10: I must have gotten a bad batch on the first jar , because it really did taste like Mr.Clean coffee , so I threw it out . In a pinch I tried another before I got rid of it all and found it to be pretty good like I remembered . Not great but OK . You have to use allot to get a full flavored brew on the quick so for the price I doubt I'll buy it again , but I thought I would add this to be fair .
