Emerald needs to put on their box of almonds that it contains Splenda or at least say it has an artificial sweetener. Consumers are not aware of this until they read the ingredients. I bought them and didn't realize it had an artificial sweetener which I can't have since I'm pregnant. Shame on you Emerald!
