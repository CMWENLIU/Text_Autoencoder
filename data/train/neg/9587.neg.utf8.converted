This is not an indoor bonsai tree. Tree was advertised as indoors, it came with welcome information on receiving your new OUTDOOR tree. It wont last on my desk, as planned. The poor thing is starting to lose all it's leaves. Very disappointed in the description.  It's an adorable tree, I guess I'll put it outdoors and see how it goes.
