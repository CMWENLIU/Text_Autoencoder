Even I was fooled into buying this organic vegetable paste (made from seasoned, concentrated vegetables with no MSG!).  Autolyzed yeast paste (the third ingredient) IS MSG.  Also soy sauce (the fifth ingredient) contains MSG, also autolyzed yeast extract (the ninth ingredient) is MSG, and the seventh ingredient, natural flavor, can include MSG.  Basically you think you are buying a healthy organic product with no MSG when in fact you are buying MSG (with a few healthy vegetables mixed in). It is criminal to be able to market this product as having no MSG.  When is health going to take precedence over profit?  Shame on us.
