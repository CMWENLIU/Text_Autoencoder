I ordered these elk bones for my dogs thinking there would be 3 bones in the order. When I received it there was only 1 bone in the package. In the picture there are 3 bones shown and being priced around $8 I thought that was reasonable for 3 bones. However, paying $8 for 1 dog bone is overpriced in my opinion. I called the company and they refunded me 10% but honestly I would have rather had the 3 bones that I thought I ordered instead of a refund. Even on the packing slip it said "elk antlers" plural. They should change the picture and wording so it is clear you are only ordering 1 bone.
