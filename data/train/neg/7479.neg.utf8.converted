Received chocolate in a box that was dirty and dusty. The chocolate itself had some old dust residue on the pieces of chocolate. I opened the chocolate, and guess what? It had "white spots" along the side. (Please see photo uploaded for this item) - Those who are familiar with milk chocolate, when it sits for a long time it develops white spots and loses its flavor. This is exactly what happened to the box of chocolate that they sent me. There was no flavor at all coming from this chocolate. It had an expiration date of "08/2011" but it was clear that this chocolate had been sitting around for a very long time. I asked politely for an exchange, and they kept giving me paste + copy responses saying that they did not do any refunds or exchanges and kept referring me to their return policy. I kept going back and forth and they were just not willing to do anything to accommodate my problem with this chocolate. Their customer service on the phone was horrible, the gentleman was not empathetic at all. They even sent an e-mail stating "This is how Kinder Bueno is supposed to look, are you sure you've tried this candy before?" SO RUDE!!<br /><br />The main reason I'm writing this, is because I LOVE Kinder Bueno. When I first had this in Germany, I fell in love! It was the perfect mix between Kit Kat and Nutella. However this company has really ruined this treat for me.<br /><br />DO NOT PURCHASE FROM PARTHENON FOODS.
