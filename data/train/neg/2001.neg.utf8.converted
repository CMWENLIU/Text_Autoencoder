Texmati is a brand name that mimics the word Basmati and this rice should not be mistaken to Basmati Rice that grows in the foothills of the Himalayas. Basmati rice is known for its long chain carbohydrates structure (conversion of starch into sugar is slower) vs short chain carbohydrates in any other type of rice, including Texmati, a glorified name for long grain American rice thats no different than any other brand long grain American rice, where starch turns into sugar fast and not suitable for healthy eating, especially diabetics (unlike genuine Basmati). For the same price or less you can shop at a local Trader Joes and pick up genuine Organic Basmati from India. Avoid this product its a total ripoff. Not the real deal.
