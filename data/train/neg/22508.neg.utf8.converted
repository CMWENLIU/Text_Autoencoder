Got this babycook as a family gift and am very disappointed. The steamer works well, although the reports about the steaming well developing odor are scary. The blender works for about a half second until it spins freely, all the food stuck below it, not processed to where I can feed it to the baby. Maybe I'm not getting this right? I am following the instructions from the cookbook (small portions). So the rest has to be mashed with a fork and then there is still cleaning to do. I don't see how this is easier/faster than a proper blender...
