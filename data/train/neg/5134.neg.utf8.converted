Cheerios are cheerios, so no review necessary there.  What I am reviewing is buying this item from Amazon.  I am a very loyal Amazon customer, with 165 orders last year.  I am very dissatisfied with Amazon on this one though.  The product they sent is only 2 months from expiring and it's a 96 pack.  If you go to the grocery store you'll see that the Cheerios there have about a year left on the shelf life so these have clearly been sitting around the warehouse for a while.  Food items are non returnable so if you're not happy with the old stuff that Amazon sends you then you are out of luck.
