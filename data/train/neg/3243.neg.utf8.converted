The quality of the box content is crappy.  I don't know if they are doing this on purpose or not but I found a few rock pebbles in the boxes together with the beans.  I'm not talking about 1 or 2 but quite a few and these pebbles are similiar to the size of the beans so just becareful to wash them and look at the beans carefully before cooking them.
