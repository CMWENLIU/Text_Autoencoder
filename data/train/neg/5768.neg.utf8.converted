I see the price has been reduced from $30 to less than $8. It's now priced correctly. I made the mistake of ordering 4 cans of flat-pack, same brand, for $30 (no longer shown), thinking it must be something special. It wasn't. In fact the same brand was selling in 4 oz glass jars for $2.79 at a local grocery. Obviously, Amazon has figured out the price was way out of line (I guess someone snookered their buyer) but, unfortunately, not before I wasted $25.
