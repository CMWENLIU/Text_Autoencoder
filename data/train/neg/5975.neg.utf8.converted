I have been an avid Celestial tea drinker for a number of years and this<br />by far was a favorite of mine, until they changed it.<br />  Not only did the company decide to package it differently , they have also<br />added a blend of white tea in it. In my opinion they ruined a perfectly good<br />product.<br />  The tea itself seems weaker to me, not smoother.<br />For the past year, this tea, prior to the change, was difficult to find in my local<br />grocery store.  I purchased it online and was fully satisfied until the last shipment arrived<br />and the new tea was sent. Needless to say, I won't be buying this again unless the company returns<br />back to the original , which was superior to this by far.<br />  Why oh why can't companies leave things alone? New does not necessarily mean better and in this case<br />it rings true.
