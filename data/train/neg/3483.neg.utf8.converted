Did you enjoy that worm you ate on a dare when you were a kid? Why, now is your chance to relive that special moment again and again!<br />That weird, unappetizing consistency of overcooked calamari, the creepy feel in your hands and later your throat, and no taste other than whatever plastic this stuff is packed in - who wouldn't want a whole plate of that?<br />As an added bonus, Miracle Noodle looks like a gaggle of tapeworms, and it smells like fish when you open up the package, which makes your hands reek like you've gutted a trout after you rinsed this "pasta" (LOL).
