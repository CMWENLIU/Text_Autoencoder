I followed the directions for "pie filling" and got pudding anyway. Lame.  It's nothing like the creamy deliciousness that you get from the mix in the Jello No Bake Cheesecake.  I don't care for the crust that comes with the No Bake Cheesecake and I had hoped this would be just the filling component. It's not. :(
