Simply terrible.  Awful.  I've never tasted a worse espresso in my life.<br /><br />ECC Espressivo vs. Nespresso Roma vs. Nespresso Ristretto ... I expected to write a detailed taste review after pulling each of these shots this morning, comparing the flavor profiles and nuances side-by-side.  But after tasting the ECC Espressivo, I realized that any comparisons to the Nespresso pods would be completely worthless.  The Espressivo is so horrible, it's a huge disappointment that shouldn't even exist.  To call it "gas station coffee" would be an upgrade.<br /><br />About a 1/3 of the way through the Espressivo pull, I noticed that the stream was quite watery and blonde.  At first, the crema appeared similar to the Nespresso pods ... but then, just 1 minute later, the Espressivo's crema had all but disappeared (while the Roma/Ristretto crema was unchanged).  Translation: It's not really espresso.<br /><br />I love the lower price.  I love the biodegradable aspect.  I love that a non-Nespresso pod option exists.  I was so excited about this ECC pod, but I couldn't be more disappointed.  The taste was so terrible that I can't even give it an extra star for price/eco-friendliness.<br /><br />If you're looking for your Nespresso machine to give you bitter and watery swill like it came from a Senseo machine, this Espressivo is the pod that you've been dreaming about.  On the other hand, if you bought your Nespresso machine to produce good quality espresso, please stay FAR, FAR AWAY from this product.
