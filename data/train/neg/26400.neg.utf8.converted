This is a horrible horrible horrible vendor. The k-cup variety pack was not boxed, it was just thrown in a packing box. The k-cups were beat up and looked like they were old and had been through a tornado. I can not believe that this vendor would put such a dismal package together. I don't know how fresh or new these k-cups are and I am afraid to use them. Apparently, these were someone's leftovers that they are trying to dump on unsuspecting customers. You should be ashamed of yourself. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR! This is my first amazon disaster. I will rethink purchasing from Amazon in the future.
