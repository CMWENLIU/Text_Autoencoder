If you have been in a Turkish market you soon realize this it not what you are looking for!<br />It's full of chemicals and most of it is sugar. Worst of all, when I realized, I wanted to send it back but amazon doesn't accept returns on food!!<br />I let myself be driven by the reviews but I guess I should have investigated further. With a list of ingredients I wouldn't have hesitated NOT TO BUY IT!
