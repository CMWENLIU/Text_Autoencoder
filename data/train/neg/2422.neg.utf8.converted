3 members of our family have Celiac disease. When fruity pebbles started claiming gluten free, I was excited to let my young kids try a "fun" cereal for the first time. It was not a fun experience since it definitely was not gluten free. Even myself who is not as sensitive as the younger ones had a reaction. If you need to be on a gluten free diet, proceed with caution.
