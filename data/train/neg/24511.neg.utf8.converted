I purchased this cat food after reading how much better it was for my cat then Science Diet or the other comparable dry cat foods that are found in pet stores. When I first tried it out, I mixed it with her regular dry food and over the course of a month gradually increased the new food and reduced the amount of the old food. Occasionally she threw the food up but by the time she went to the new food alone, she was throwing it up regularly.  I have put what was left (3/4 of the bag) in the garbage and will never order it again.
