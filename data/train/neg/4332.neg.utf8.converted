i got this bag as part of the TWO bag "special", dont like how they rope you into buying two bags to get the Free shipping. making it $28 all together! these cherries are NOT at ALL Sour! Big Bummer! Even worse was that every single one of them in this 5 pound bag were BROKEN. none of them were in one piece, the stem connected to the cherry. i used them for Valentine favors, and they were NOT cute like the raspberries, because they were in parts. the non-saur part was the Big let down. they may have come broken because they were shipped in the Dead of winter. tho they did not sit outside for one second. so not sure if they always come broken. i will NOT be getting these again.
