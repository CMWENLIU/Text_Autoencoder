The flavour and smell is very strong, unlike any other seeds I've tried. I would describe the smell/taste as a spicy, maybe a little acidic. I don't know where the spiciness comes from, it is really strong and really unlike anything I've ever had. I would not describe the taste as earthy, earthy tasting to me is like a tea that tastes like leaves, but it is possible that this flavor is earthy to others. If you are using many at a time just be aware they are strong.<br /><br />They are packaged tightly, which is convenient for storage. Flat, vacuum-sealed? bags which can be slid in just about anywhere.<br /><br />**Edit**<br />Have to change my review from 4 to two stars.<br />I had some pasta the other day and the (red) sauce tasted exactly like these poppy seeds. Today I opened a bag and noticed little red  or orange flecks. It look like there is something added to these, which would describe the strange smell, which is not natural.<br /><br />I rinsed them, but they rinsed *very clean so it it's not an oily residue that is causing this, which they haven't (rinsed clean) in the past.<br />I am not sure what is going on, but I personally, will not be using these anymore - this whole thing is just freaking me out.
