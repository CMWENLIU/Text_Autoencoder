I have been using the Better Than Bouillon Vegetable Base for years.  I was in the process of ordering additional jars, when I read Ms Hill's comment, from December, 2008.  I reviewed the Ingredients listed on the jar and researched yeast extract and maltodextrin. There are very good articles on line, that explain how MSG can be "hidden", in the list of ingredients.  The articles indicate there are over 40 food ingredients besides "monosodium glutamate" that contain processed free glutamic acid (MSG). It appears that autolyzed yeast extract and maltodextrin are two of those food ingredients.  In addition, "NO MSG ADDED" does not mean that there is NO MSG in the product. If MSG is "processed into" a product as opposed to being "poured into" a product (just a matter of a different processing method), then a company can declare "NO MSG ADDED"  or "NO ADDED MSG", even though the product contains MSG.<br />Therefore, before I make an additional purchase,  I am asking Superior Touch --- Please advise if your Better Than Bouillon products actually contain any MSG.
