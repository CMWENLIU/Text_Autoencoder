I really must disagree with the other two reviewers.  I have found the aroma of this blend to be bitter, acidic and burnt.  That carries over and makes for a pretty lousy cup of coffee.  However, it isn't undrinkable and I suppose I'd put it on a par with what one would get from a cheap supermarket choice.<br /><br />Now, to be fair to Cafe Altura I want to note that there was air in my bag.  I don't know if this is unusual or if they do not vacuum pack their beans (which would lead to oxidation fairly quickly and hence the bitter aroma).
