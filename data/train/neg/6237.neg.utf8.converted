I bought this item as a Valentine's Day present for my mother, whose favorite candy is Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Today the package arrived and upon tasting it, I discovered it tastes nothing like the candy. Now I'm stuck with a case of this stuff when Jiff is tons better. Bottom line is if you are buying this because you think it'll taste like Reese's, don't. It's average peanut butter with the Reese's name stamped on it. No wonder why they don't sell it in stores.
