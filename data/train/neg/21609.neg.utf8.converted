After reading several of the other reviews, I decided to purchase this product,  mainly as a way to adopt a more low carb diet.  Here's the deal:  Right away you notice that the mixture is extremely eggy. The mixture has the look of a pancake and cooks all the way through easily enough.  The taste: tastes like a dried up omelette.  Very eggy taste.  Hard cardboard texture.  No amount of syrup can bury this flavor.  Was not able to get through even one pancake.  Very unsatisfied with this product.  Could never recommend to anyone.  If you are trying to lower your carb intake; eat smaller portions of carbs.
