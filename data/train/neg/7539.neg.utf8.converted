NO MATTER HOW GREAT AN IDEA THIS ITEM SOUNDS LIKE, DO NOT BUY IT!!!!  After all the buttpain this product has already caused me (see below), a mere 6 days after receiving the replacement for the FIRST defective driveshaft, turns out THIS "NEW" driveshaft has the same problem!!!! It seized up, and will not allow the blade to turn. At least the first driveshaft had the decency to work for 3 months. Unbelievable that this product is still being sold on Amazon, I am positive I am not the only one this is happening to. Short of getting my money back, there's pretty much nothing Baby Brezza can do to make this right. Send me another driveshaft??? Yeah RIGHT!!!!<br /><br />>>ORIGINAL REVIEW>> Had no issues with the Baby Brezza until now (month 3). The mystery black stuff I read about in other reviews has started making regular appearances and the blade is starting to get stuck when blending for no apparent reason.  I really love what this product has allowed me to do (I make food in it to feed myself as well as my son!), but bummed that I'm encountering this problem which, from casual browsing of the other Amazon reviews, is not a rare manufacturing defect, but rather a design defect/quality control failure which causes a $100 piece of machinery to fail just a few months after purchase. Calling Baby Brezza customer service today to see how they can rectify this situation (thank god I saved the box).<br /><br />>>>UPDATE 25 April 2012>>> !!!!!IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR BREZZAS WITH LOT NUMBER MWI-001BRU!!!!!!!<br />After a few days of phone tag, the Baby Brezza rep contacted me and let me know that the particular lot number (look for that on the bottom of the base) of my Brezza was indeed having the issues I described, due to a faulty driveshaft.  The rep said they would "exchange"  my faulty drive shaft for a new one, but UNFORTUNATELY, the "new driveshafts" are STILL BEING MADE. And wouldn't be available to ship for approximately 5 weeks.  Their "consolation prize" was a free accessory (of course, I had already purchased most of the accessories back when I bought the Brezza!). Pretty damn inconvenient when you have a REALLY hungry 7 1/2 month old baby.<br /><br />So if you have this lot number, even if it's working now, I would definitely lean forward in the foxhole and get Baby Brezza to send you a replacement driveshaft. The fact that they didn't offer to send a whole new unit instead of making me wait 5 weeks, AND that they don't even have these new driveshafts yet, means to me that it may not only be this lot, but any other lot manufactured from July 2011 on that has the defective driveshaft.  SO BUYER BEWARE on this product if you haven't already bought one.  It's a fantastic concept, just bad, bad, bad quality control for the $$$cha-ching$$$$ it costs.<br /><br />>>UPDATE 15 MAY 2012>><br />Received a replacement driveshaft, blade and container (with lid) today, along with the "Sorry For the Inconvenience" gift of a food storage unit. It's been about 3 weeks since I spoke with the Brezza rep. Not bad, given the estimate she gave me was 5 weeks. Originally I was told only the driveshaft would be sent to me, so I'm pleased that I now have a backup container and blade!  I am satisfied, and have changed my rating, because I really do love what this product does!
