Be VERY careful when ordering from OZBO. I was shipped outdated inedible Riesen and passed them out to friends and cohorts without knowing their condition. When people got back to me with information regarding the product white discoloration, sticking to the inside foil and hardness of the candies, OZBO refused to replace the product because I couldn't collect all from whom I had given the candy. I guess OZBO would have me open each separate Riesen candy and inspect, then rewrap them and package back up in the bag. GET REAL OZBO. I hope this review is helpful.
