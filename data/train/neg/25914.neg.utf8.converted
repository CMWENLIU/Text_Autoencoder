Firtst above all, DO NOT EAT THIS CANCER-CAUSING NOODLE!<br />Recently Korea FDA reported and warned customers that this noodle has too much BENZOYPRENE.Benzoyprene is an organic compound with the formula C20H12. Benzopyrene is CARCINOGENIC, because it moduletes DNA, interfering with transcription. However, the company is insisting Benzoyprene is absolutely safe!! WTF!!?? Do you want cancer? Try this...<br /><br />UPDATE: Korea FDA recently announced that customers should return these products!
