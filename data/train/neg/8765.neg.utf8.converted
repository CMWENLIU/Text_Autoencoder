"Eclipse Breeze Exotic Berry" gum is surprisingly unpleasant tasting as the cardamom and berry flavors do not go together! I bought this flavor after trying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q9ZX8C">Eclipse breeze exotic mint sugar free chewing gum - 12/pack, 12 ea</a> (which is very good "*****") and was very disappointed. Just to be sure that it wasn't only me, my kids tried it as well and they both found it to be "gross".<br /><br />The only real upside of this sugarfree gum is that after the berry flavor goes away, the cardamom does do a good job freshening your breath.<br /><br />Not Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
