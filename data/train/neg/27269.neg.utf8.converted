Over the past 2 years I've ordered 10 cases of these wonderful cheese crisps but my last<br />order was NOT the same. Every box in the case tasted the same, NO flavor. I E-mailed the<br />customer service department at John WM Macy's and got no response. I took a chance and<br />ordered a second case and it was the same. I'm very disappointed. When you find a product<br />you like so much you tend to count on the same taste, my guess is the cheese isn't the same.<br />I don't blame Amazon for this, it's the Company that isn't living up to the standards it should.<br />I was always willing to pay the price but now it's not worth it. If I ever hear back I'll fill you in<br />but so far after 3 E-mails to Macy's NOTHING. Before I gave them 5 stars, not now.
