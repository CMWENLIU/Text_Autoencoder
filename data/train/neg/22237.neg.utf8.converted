Boy oh boy.  Walden Farms is really a hit and miss operation.<br /><br />I think this stuff is probably my least favorite of their products I've tasted so far.  What makes no sense is that the ingredients that might add alfredo-esque taste, if they would choose to employ them in the recipe, aren't caloric.  Spices and salt would go a long way toward making this stuff edible.<br /><br />I will add that though the sauce is also as thin as h-e-double-hockey-sticks, I can deal with that in a zero-cal food. That's a sacrifice I can live with.  But it's the sickly-sweet flavor and the lack of any sort of savory component that makes this stuff such a startlingly-awful flop.  I suspect there's a whole lotta Splenda goin' on in this stuff.  Give it a pass and just thin out some other bottled "lite" alfredo sauce using fat-free milk.
