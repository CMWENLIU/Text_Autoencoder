There's no doubt that dealing with skinny and boney sardines is not for the faint of heart. Vertebral columns, spinal cords, various and sundry entrails, they're all right there...<br /><br />So here's the alternative - skinless and boneless, promising a civilized, politically correct and appropriate eating experience.<br /><br />Not.<br /><br />These pale pretenders are like throwing out the baby with the bathwater. They're dry and tasteless. Sure they're easy to eat but why would anyone care?<br /><br />And to make matters worse, notwithstanding the fact that the Amazon product description says "Product of Spain", these bad boys seemingly slipped across the border by the cover of darkness. Clearly marked on the box is "Producto de Marruecos" - Product of Morocco.<br /><br />So don't waste your time with these. Go for the gusto. Vigo skinny and boney sardines come from Spanish territorial waters, and are plump, rich, and flavorful. If you can't handle the gore stick with tuna fish, or perhaps give Pablum a try...
