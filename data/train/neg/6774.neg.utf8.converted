Sorry, but it must be an acquired taste.  It was more like soup than chili...could barely find the meat.  Plus, it tasted like it was loaded with ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg and something else.  Those things have no business being in chili.  It was so overwhelming I literally couldn't taste any other food for 15 minutes after eating it, almost like it ruined my taste buds.
