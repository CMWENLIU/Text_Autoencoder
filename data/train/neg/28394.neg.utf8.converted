I usually enjoy Starbucks products, but this one does not work for the purpose I ordered it. The pods are too small and packed very tightly, so they do not work w/my Senseo. Too small is the biggest problem. My coffee came out as slightly colored water because the hot water went around the pod because the pod did not fill the holder. Oh well.
