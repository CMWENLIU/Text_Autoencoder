I have scoured the internet trying to find the source of the produce used in this product and have not been able to locate ANY information on production.  There is only information regarding its New York City base, but nothing regarding where the food is grown, packaged and/or whether it is imported.  Though it is "certified organic" I will discontinue use of the product until I have answers to the above.
