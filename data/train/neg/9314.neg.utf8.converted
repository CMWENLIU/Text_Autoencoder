Just be aware (and Purina says so on the label) that this is not another<br />daily cat food.  Check it out and see that there is only 12% protein in it, and cats need a food with at least 40%.  The problem is that, if they eat a whole tray a day, then they'll reject the "real" food.  I imagine that 1/2 tray per day is the absolute max for your kitty.
