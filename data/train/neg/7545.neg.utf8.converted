I read many reviews saying people received defective units where the blade wouldn't spin, but chose to ignore them.  Sure enough my unit had the same problem out of the box.  I tried calling Baby Brezza and all I got was an answering machine, my message was never returned.<br /><br />Thankfully, I found a review posted on  December 29, 2011 by D. Mc. which provided a DIY fix to the problem....too bad Baby Brezza cost me a lot of time and aggravation.
