I was very excited to receive this item; the description made it sound like the samples would be diverse.  I was disappointed to find that my pack only contained Jasmine, Black, Oolong tea, and two green teas.  I would have loved to have a white tea or at least some clarity on what I actually received.  The terms "black tea" and "green tea" mean very little since there are so many different types of black and green tea.  I would appreciate this product much more if they actually told me exactly which teas I was sent.  It's all well and good to say that it was a random selection, but if so they need to state what was actually selected.  Especially since different teas require different preparation, it is not appropriate to be vague; this could compromise the taste of the tea.<br />I have yet to sample the teas, but since my initial reaction was so negative, I thought it was worth noting.
