First, to the efficacy of the product:<br />It leaves a filmy coating on our hands (and, we assume, other skin areas, including scalp) even after many rinsings...not a pleasant feeling...and yet, we do not notice any real difference in dandruff control. We used it every other day for a week.<br /><br />In addition, the scent is very strong...and some may find it unappealing.<br /><br />Finally, as at least one other reviewer has noted, the packaging does not hold up well in transit: our sample arrived in a padded yellow envelope via USPS and was leaking all over the place. We thought it was inadvertently damaged during shipping...and disposed of it; Amazon very nicely shipped another one out, but that, too arrived in a leaky mess. This time, we cleaned it off and proceeded to test it out, with the above results. So, if someone does order it online, just be aware that this might be an issue.<br /><br />So, overall, we cannot fully recommend "CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong & Full" based on experience, but as with any product like this, it might produce better results for others, so it might be worth a try. Just be careful with the shipping, and maybe wait for a decent price for the first time around.
