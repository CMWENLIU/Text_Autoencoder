Barbara's Bakery hyped the new packaging but neglected to mention that the weight went from 12oz per box to 10 oz per box.  I use to purchase a 4 pack of the 12 oz old package for 15.57 and that works out to 32.4 cents per oz.  the new price for a 6 pack of the 10 oz box works out to 39 cents per ounce.  That's a 20% price hike in a period of low to no inflation.  Thanks for the nice new package guys.  I much prefer the old package at the old price and will be checking out other cereals with the intent of eliminating cinnamon puffins from my diet.<br /><br />The cereal also tastes different - not as good.  I looked at the ingredients and noticed that in both the old and new product there is 150 mg of salt.  However, in the old ingredient list cinnamon came before salt. In the new ingredient list it comes after salt.  Thus, there is less cinnamon in the new cereal. You can really taste the difference.  The old recipe was much tastier.  Again, my hat is off to Barbara's Bakery.  The price went up and the taste is not nearly as good.  Great job guys.<br /><br />January 20, 2011 Update:  I have replaced cinnamon puffins with other cereals.  Bring back the old taste which I loved so much and I'll buy again, even at the increased price.
