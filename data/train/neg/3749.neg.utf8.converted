I purchased this espresso machine on-line after having an older version for over 8 years.  I had neglected the older machine quite a bit in terms of descaling, etc, had shipped it twice all over the US and never had a problem with it.  This new machine arrived and the plastic front was loose and very flimsy.  Still, it seemed similar to the old one and I set it up.  Within a month the entire machine just died.  It wouldn't turn on.  I contacted customer service and shipped the whole machine off.  After over 6 weeks it returned, this time it worked for about a week before shutting down with the brew group in a jammed position.  I contacted customer service again and asked for my money back.  They refused and sent me an email on how to take the brew group with a screwdriver.  5 screwdrivers, a stripped screw and 1 allen's wrench later, I finally managed to reset the thing.  For the moment, it is working but the espresso is barely warm when it comes out, not piping hot like it should be.  The 8 year old Saeco, by the way, is still chugging along after I cleaned it out. Sadly, I cannot recommend this machine or brand anymore.
