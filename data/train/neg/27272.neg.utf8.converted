I was hoping this would be a natural un Cruel way to get rid of Mole problem on new lawn .. But it did nothing at all , i followed the directions perfectly and even used a little more in spots , The bag ran out very quickly and i did not notice any positive change in Mole digging<br /><br />Back to the drawing board because this is not the answer
