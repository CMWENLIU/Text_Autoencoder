I was so excited when I read the reviews for these candies. I remember those wonderful dark raspberry shaped candies that came in a tin given to me on special occasions when I was a kid. THESE ARE NOT SAME. I was hoping to give these out to my nieces and nephews for a special treat but NO WAY. They are stale, tasteless, powdery white on the outside and not worth a nickle. Might as well be handing out a bag of DUM DUMs.
