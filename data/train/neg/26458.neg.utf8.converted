I have always purchased Bob's Red Mill Organic Oat Bran Hot Cereal, I wanted to try the high fiber with flax. It is very bland and dense (needs to be mixed with something like the Oat bran cereal or roasted flax and blueberry).<br />I will stay with Bob's Red Mill Organic Oat Bran Hot Cereal in the future.
