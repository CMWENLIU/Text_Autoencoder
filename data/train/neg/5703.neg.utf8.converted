Like the last person to review this product, I also find that the flavor on the Spitz seeds is very short lived. It tastes like the seeds are lightly roasted (not roasted enough for me, the flavor of the seed is close to raw) with no salt or flavoring. Then a light coating of flavoring is put on at the end. It does taste like dill pickle, but only the outside of the seed. Despite this, I was still a fan of this product until I tried Bigs brand. Bigs Dill Pickle is so superior to this product that it puts it to shame. If you are buying from Amazon anyway, you should buy the Bigs since local availability isn't the problem. One thing I will say about Spitz brand is that because the flavor is mild, I can eat a lot more of them before my mouth becomes raw from too much salt. This is nice since I usually eat sunflower seeds in a setting where I'm just passing the time. Still, I'd take the good flavor of Bigs and a raw mouth over Spitz any time.
