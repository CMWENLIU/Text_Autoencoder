I bought some of their cupcakes, and the same thing happened. I didn't even swallow the bite I took. It tasted dry and salty. I couldn't believe how completely awful they were. I bought a box of devil dogs the next day for $2.39, and they were ok. They weren't as moist as I remembered them to be, but they were nice with my coffee. I'm afraid to try any of the other brands. Little Debbie is one. I can't remember the names. But the prices are so OUTRAGEOUS here. Who in their right mind is going to pay $2.00 for one Devil Dog. I Ain't that desperate.
