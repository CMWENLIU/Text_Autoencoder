I grew up drinking coconut water in Jamaica and have been getting the Vita Coco brand which is decent but not great.  I decided to try this based upon the great reviews and am VERY VERY disappointed.<br /><br />This is probably one of the nastiest things that I have ever tasted and is a very poor excuse for coconut water. It literally tastes like water flavored with artificial sweetener with plastic added.<br /><br />I am going to see if I can return the case to Amazon.
