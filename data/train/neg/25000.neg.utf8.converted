At the wonderful Barry Farms facilities, the moment an order comes in they quickly go out and plant whatever grain it is. Then after some time has passed they are able to harvest that grain and take into the factory to be ground into flour where it is finally packaged up and shipped to the customer. And just for that extra spark of good customer service they don't even provide a tracking number, so each customer is pleasantly surprised when their items randomly show up one day.<br /><br />...seriously, the product is fine but expect to wait about three weeks or more for delivery.
