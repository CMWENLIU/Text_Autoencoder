I logged in to write a review for this coffee and was shocked to see how positive the reviews were, I guess my taste is not in line with the norm. I got this coffee in a sample pack and it is the only flavor that has yet to be completely used. I made one cup and it smells fantastic, it was very strange to have a fruity smell come from a cup of coffee but it really smelled great, so much so that even after I decided I didn't like it I left it on my desk for a while just for the aroma. First I tried it black, thinking it may be sweet already but it is not and it was a weird sensation to taste blueberry with the normal bitterness of coffee. Then I added sweetener which made it better, the sweetness aligned with the taste and smell of blueberry. Ultimately I just didn't like it and didn't even finish the cup. I don't think fruit flavored coffee is for me.
