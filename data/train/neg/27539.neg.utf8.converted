I fell in love with Maggi seasoning while in Switzerland - I brought home a bottle and became addicted!  I was excited to see it available in the States, but when the seasoning arrived, I was turned off by the "chemically" smell and taste!  It doesn't taste anything close to the real deal.  I still have a bit left of the original I had purchased in Switzerland, so I did a taste comparison - there is no doubt that what is available in America is NOT what you can get in Europe.  Like the Maggi you can get in Europe (which is produced by Nestle), this version is also supposedly produced by Nestle, but UNLIKE the stuff you get in Europe (which is manufactured in Germany), this "Maggi" is produced in CHINA.  And it tastes like it - the chemical taste and aroma is so overwhelming, I think I just have to throw out the two bottles I ordered!  Total bummer!  If you love Maggi, find an importer of German products rather than try and buy this version...
