I'm allergic to dairy & due to recent events I've had to give up the little bit of dairy that I was able to eat previously. I ended up buying this mac & chreese in the hopes of finding something similar to the old favorite that I loved so much. Note that I said *similar* & not identical. While I've tasted some vegan cheeses that were pretty close to the real thing, I wasn't expecting a miracle from a powder.<br /><br />Oh boy... where do I start... Well, first I'll start with the good. The pasta isn't bad. It cooks up nice & firm, just like I would want it to. The pasta is probably the one thing about this that I'd probably try again, if it came in a package by itself.<br /><br />But the bad part is the sauce. Not only does it NOT taste remotely like cheese, but it's this icky sloppy mess that reminds me more of garlic than cheese. My first attempt with this sauce might have had too much water, as it was a little too soupy, but my second attempt (I was willing to try it again to see if I'd prepared it wrong) wasn't much better. The taste didn't improve with either attempt.<br /><br />As far as mac & vegan cheese goes, I think I'll go back to the old fashioned way of making it (noodles & melting vegan cheese) instead of the instant route. I wasn't expecting a miracle with this, but I was hoping that the sauce would at least attempt to taste like cheese or be tasty in some regards. This just wasn't for me.<br /><br />If you try this, just remember that it isn't going to taste like anything remotely cheesy. Just go to the store & get one box of this stuff before buying it in bulk here on amazon.
