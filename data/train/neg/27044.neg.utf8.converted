this pasta cooks up and tastes very much like wheat pasta.  the taste is very good.  i only wish i had been able to read, or explored the ingredient list further.  even on the front of the box, that little white tag inset on the upper left green panel, says, "corn-quinoa" blend.  so if corn is not a problem for you, it should be fine.  going form wheat to corn flower is not a move in a positive direction, in my mind.  it is gluten free, so if that is your main objective, this product satisfies.
