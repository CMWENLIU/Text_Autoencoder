A steady diet of this caused my goldfish to lose color.  And I don't mean a little.  I mean she went from being a gorgeous red and orange to shock white.  Other goldfish in my tank also started losing colors.  After inspecting the ingredients, trying to figure out the problem, I discovered it's full of fillers, and more importantly lake colors.  A lake color will only disperse in oil, sucrose, or alcohol.  It's also the same stuff you find in your makeup.  What do you think that does to a poor fish's digestive system?  I will never buy this again.  Oh, and that color change issue with my goldfish? 1 year later, on a good frozen pure food diet, the white goldfish is still white, and the ones who lost some of their color, never did regain it.
