When I first signed up to buy this product through the subscribe and save program, it was a great deal averaging around $3.00 per box vs. $5.00 in the grocery store, but Amazon cancelled that subscription saying the product was no longer available through the subscribe and save program.  The price that's listed here is ridiculously high.  Unless you are in an area with no grocery store, why would you pay this exorbitant price?
