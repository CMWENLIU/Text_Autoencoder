I bought these at my local supercenter, assuming they might be fresh, and was shocked when I got home and they were stale.  They're really poorly packaged (just thin shrink wrap around the box; open the box and there's nothing but a tray and the rings) and they don't taste good at all.  The chocolate is flaking off of the rings, which look crystallized.  I wanted these for Hanukkah but they look and taste like they've been sitting around since last Passover.  Skip these and get Joyva.
