I am used to the old fashioned kinds with just peanuts and salt as ingredients. I thought I would try Skippy Natural Creamy peanut butter spread simply because a recipe called for it. I tried some before using it and this stuff tastes like oil and wax. If you like fake flavors than you might like this. Otherwise, stick with the real stuff that you have to stir, it's so worth it!
