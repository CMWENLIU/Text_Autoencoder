Chances are, if you don't care much for the taste of black licorice, you aren't going to find this tea very appealing.  The black licorice flavor was so overpowering  that I wasn't really able to distinguish or really even taste any of the other herbs/ingredients.  Have to give this 1 star (my first bad rating here on amazon) there has got to be a way to get the ingredients needed for "healthy milk production" without such a horrid taste.  Also, I BELIEVE the box said to let it sit for 10 minutes (rather lengthy time period) and to have at least 3 cups per day.  That's torture with the way this stuff tastes!
