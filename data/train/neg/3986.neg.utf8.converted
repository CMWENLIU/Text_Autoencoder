In the time I spent waiting for my order of these fly traps to arrive, I went out and bought regular fly ribbon for the bad fly problem (not sure what kind of flies - slightly bigger than fruit flies) I was having. In the at least week that I've had one of these fly traps up, I've caught zero flies with this fly trap and have caught probably over 100 flies with the regular fly ribbon. At one point, I even saw a fly on this fly trap and thought it was caught, but now it's gone. I even have pictures to prove it.
