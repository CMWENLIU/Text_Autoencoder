These are fairly tasty, but they are "organic" pears from CHINA and the cans are lined in BPA (a known endocrine disruptor). If you're familiar with organic certifications, you may have heard that China is well known for selling non-organic foods as organic. The Chinese have become masters at fooling certifying organizations. It is really hard to trust any certifications(organic, fair trade, etc.) from China so I don't trust these. Solana Gold and Columbia Gorge both sell organic canned pears grown in the USA and certified by Oregon Tilth. Amazon Fresh sells Solana Gold for $2.99 a can!
