I have long, fine hair, shoulder-length+.<br />If dry it can break when combed/brushed.<br /><br />Before CLEAR, I used shampoos/conditioners by Paul Mitchell [[ASIN:B002N5MI8C Paul Mitchell Extra Body Daily Shampoo, 33.8-Ounce Bottle] and Pantene [[ASIN:B001F51V3E Pantene Pro-V 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner, Classic Care, Packaging May Vary, 25.4 -Ounce (Pack of 2)]. They give my hair shine and satisfactory body. And less breaking. I'd hoped to have it look even better, be tougher with CLEAR. So I took a shot.<br /><br />CLEAR Scalp and Hair Therapy/Nourishing Shampoo with its sales pitch of 'nourishing<br />the scalp' seemed believable, like stimulating/nourishing the scalp. Oops; not-so.<br /><br />Terse instructions say "when using shampoo and conditioner" "apply to wet hair, gently massage into scalp, lather and rinse." (Two statements, connected by an asterisk) Seemed<br />unclear.<br /><br />Before rinsing, CLEAR's goopy consistency made me doubt its sticky white lather could get past the hair (not really a lather; no frothy bubbles). The consistency is like a women's facial creme. I took pictures of my frothy Gorgon-Head scary-odd hair. Pretty funny, kinda scary.<br /><br />I tried finger tips to rub the glop into my scalp. Maybe some got through my hair, but its heavy-consistency turned hair follicles into slimy protrusions like bright white heavy meringue; sticky and thick like tooth paste; both funny and weird. I tried rubbing it into my scalp; it just glopped together in my hair. Afterwards I had to wash my hands twice. The white stuff that couldn't get past hair covered my fingers, palms.<br /><br />My hair doesn't have observably more volume; after drying, the hair seemed sort of frizzed; literally less shiny, healthy. I repeated the treatment a week later, just<br />to be sure. Same effects, problems. And there's more:<br /><br />The label said an ingredients list was on the label's back.'Just peel it<br />off'. And it was, evidently rushed to market, upside down and backwards.<br /><br />Last shot at CLEAR: The plastic bottle has an flat oval top. The container came in a fitted, sealed plastic sleeve inside a padded Amazon mailer. Shipping shakes evidently poked the flat top and inside the sleeve was slopped with the gooey white glop.<br /><br />Back to the lab, CLEAR Marketeers. I'll stick with Paul Mitchell and Pantene.
