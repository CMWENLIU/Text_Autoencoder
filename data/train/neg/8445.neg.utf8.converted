how could i go wrong with all these great reviews. i purchased 1/2 lb of their vanilla beans. my package didn't fill the air with a vanilla aroma as some mentioned. we used in a few recipes and weren't impressed. emailed amit in customer service. amit basically told me to read the reviews. so, i keep reading the reviews....but the vanilla is still not as strong as it should be. i feel like i bought an old batch.
