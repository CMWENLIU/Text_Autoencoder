I have been spending bajillions of dollars ordering in Ikura/Salmon Roe sushi because I crave it all the time!  I thought this was a brilliant plan to save a little money, and to cut out the wasted rice.<br /><br />No.  This is no substitute. For starters, jarred caviar is reeeeally salty and preservative-y tasting.  Which I maybe could have dealt with for the price difference, except that whatever the "Smokehouse" flavor is is GROSS.  I even like a smoky beer a local brewery makes, but this was not for me.<br /><br />I will not be buying again.
