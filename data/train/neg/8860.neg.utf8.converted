I decided to try a box because Costco carries this and they haven't had my favorite Tully's Kona for a while. It lives up to the "light roast" description and brews one of the lightest (you might also say 'weakest') cups of coffee I've had in any K-cup. Even using two k-cups didn't help much. It's way too light for my tastes; glad I didn't buy the box of 88 at Costco.<br /><br />So, if you like a lightly roasted and somewhat weak cup of coffee, you'd like this. The flavor is good. But, k-cups run a little on the weak side in general and this one is simply too light for me.<br /><br />Amazon did ship fast and had a good price.<br /><br />UPDATE: Some reviews here don't seem to understand the terms being used.<br /><br />"Light Roast" is a description of how long the coffee beans are roasted. Light roaster beans do not have the strong and sometimes bitter flavor of beans that are roasted for longer times, but they retain more of the subtleties of their flavor.  It does produce a `lighter' cup of coffee.<br /><br />"Extra Bold" is a term Keurig/Green Mountain uses to describe a K-cup that has more coffee grounds in it than normal K-cups.  More coffee grounds makes for a stronger cup of coffee. The strength of the coffee also depends on how large a cup you brew.<br /><br />You can have a "light roast" coffee in an "Extra Bold" K-cup, but the result will still be a coffee with a lighter flavor.<br /><br />Personally, I like a medium roast; a nice balance between good coffee flavor and that strong coffee bite.
