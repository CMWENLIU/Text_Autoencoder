Save your money. Might as well buy Carnation's instant milk because that is all that this product is. It is very misleading, suggesting a substitute for creamer but being no more than powdered, non-fat milk in a convenient shaker dispenser. Hat's off to the seller, as thy have simply repackaged dried milk and sold it as creamer. Oh, well, I fell for it. But you shouldn't. Save your money and buy real creamer, and just go very lightly; the taste will be than worth it. I have bombarded by coffee with this worthless powder, and still find it undrinkable.
