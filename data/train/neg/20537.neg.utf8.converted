I cannot review the product, since I never got a chance to open it. Just as others complained, I too ordered a 32oz bottle but received a 4oz bottle, labeled on the packaging as 32oz. I contacted Amazon, who fulfilled the order, and I sent it back almost two weeks ago and am still awaiting reimbursment.
