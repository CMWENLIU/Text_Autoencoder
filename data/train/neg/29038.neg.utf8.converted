From reading other reviews before I bought this item, I was expecting something other than what I got.  I love regular Quaker Oats; however, I had heard how much better steel cut oats were for you. I just tried them this morning and was very disappointed.  If you are expecting something that qualifies for "comfort food" like regular oats do for me, then don't order this item.  I was expecting something creamy and full of flavor; but I got crunchy, chewy, and bland.  I kept thinking the oats would soften; so, I cooked them an additional ten minutes.  They never did.  I guess I'll stick with my regular oats.
