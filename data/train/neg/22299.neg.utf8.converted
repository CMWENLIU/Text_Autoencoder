Be careful in selecting products that contain the excitotoxin MSG (monosodium glutamate) and related glutamic acid products, hydrolyzed wheat protein, vegetable protein, listed as an ingredient. All these items contain a form of MSG which has several different alias/names as a way to sneak it into the ingredient list. Be safe, I avoid these products!  Dr. CK
