I ordered several types of seeds to sprout, and the buckwheat seeds were the only failure. Sprouting them is easy, but the seeds aren't hulled, which makes the sprouts difficult to eat. Removing the hulls after sprouting is too time consuming to be worth the effort. If you're looking for buckwheat seeds to sprout, buy a hulled variety.
