I have been buying this tea for a couple years,  it was lovely (hot or cold) until they changed the formula and added cinnamon.<br /><br />While I enjoy cinnamon in many tea formulas, it is not an asset here at all!  As far as this household is concerned the cinnamon muddies the flavor, ruining the fruit/flower flavor that made it such a pleasure.  This significant change was not listed on the ingredients (as of May 2012).  We will not order this again until they come to their senses and change it back.
