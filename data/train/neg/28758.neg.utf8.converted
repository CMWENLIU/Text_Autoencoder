The 15% leg meat raised this from a 1 to a 2 but overall this product isn't very good.  It has a vague crab like flavor but the texture is not anything like fresh crab.  I can buy decent fresh crab meet at BJs for $13 for 16 oz of crab meat (Sam's has the same for $16) There is 4.25 oz of crab in the 6 oz can so this is cheaper (~$9/lb) but I don't enjoy eating it.
