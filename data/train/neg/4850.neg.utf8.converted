The product contained MANY ant fragments, still identifiable with pieces such as thorax and legs, or head with mandibles still visible. The insects were cooked INTO the paper sheets, and hadn't merely gotten into the package during shipping. I understand that almost all food products have some trace pieces of insect, but if your product has that many, you need to redefine how you transport and manufacture your food products.
