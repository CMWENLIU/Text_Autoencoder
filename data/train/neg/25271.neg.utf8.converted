I assumed that bulk purchases of this type would be fresh, drop shipped as a rule, but I have serious doubts now.  I have had the fresh gum, this isn't even close.  You could wear your teeth out chewing this.<br /><br />Unfortunately, one of the few bad products, as received.  As usual, Amazon does an incredible job of processing, expeding & getting shipped-every time!
