This tastes like a frozen whipped whey protein shake-- bad after taste included.  I bought this thinking I would satisfy my ice cream craving by using this as a substitute, but I was totally wrong.  I only ate a few bites before throwing it into the freezer. Should have bought some low-fat fro yo instead!
