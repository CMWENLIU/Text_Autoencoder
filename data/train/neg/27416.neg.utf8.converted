I have used this splenda products for the last few years without knowing any side affect.  After reading a few health and diet book, I decided to quit this usage and I threw them away.  Now, I used Stevita Stevia and organic raw blue algave products, they are natural products and good for your health.  They taste great too and highly recommended.  Don't take my word, just google splenda and you will find it out.  I gave this product 2 stars because the taste is fine, but not for your own health.  Give yourself a better health with the above products that I recommended.  Life's too precious!
