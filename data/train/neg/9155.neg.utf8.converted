I am new to the GF world and was very excited when a friend told me she saw Gluten Free Betty Crocker mixes at the store.  I bought the Brownie mix and gave it a try yesterday.  I would be shocked of this mix is truly GF.  That was the most miserable I have been since I went Gluten free.  Although there is no wheat flour in the mix, I am guessing that the cocoa powder is milled in a plant that processes wheat.
