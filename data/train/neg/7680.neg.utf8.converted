I'm not commenting on the quality of the item but the poor experience buying it through Amazon.  Of the 12 cans, 10 of them came crushed and dented, a health hazard due to potential air entry into the cans.  I had to throw them out because Amazon didn't want them back.  I asked for a refund so I didn't end up paying $13 a piece for the two good cans.  Amazon refused at first, saying they would re-send it.  But it was out of stock.  I waited a while, wrote back, and they finally refunded the product, making me feel guilty for the dented up cans.<br /><br />I have bought many things through Amazon and will continue to do so.  But I won't buy canned items.  They don't survive either the Amazon warehouse or the shipping process.
