When I purchased this item, I thought that I was going to get a coffee with cream, but that was not the case.  The coffee itself was much stronger and bitter, and the "cream" or crema was just some powdered stuff that created a milky foam on top of the coffee, but did not change the color or flavor of the coffee at all.  I would not purchase this item again.
