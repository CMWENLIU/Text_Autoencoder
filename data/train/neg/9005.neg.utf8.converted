I feel mislead by the name of this product as the ingredient list on the package lists pears first then peas and then broccoli. When I tasted it myself I realized why my daughter was enjoying it so much, it just tasted like sweet pears. If a product is going to claim to be healthy and organic it should know it's customers are not afraid to give their kids vegetables.
