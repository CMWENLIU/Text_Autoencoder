The consistency of the frosting starter base is disgusting.  It's thin, sticky, and leaves a very oily taste in your mouth.  The flavor packets, however, are genius!  I've been buying them and adding them to a regular can of vanilla frosting or to homemade buttercream.  The base is a waste of money.
