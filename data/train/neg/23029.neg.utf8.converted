I had high expectations for this ketchup based on the reviews but am not satisfied. The consistency is too liquid and it doesn't stay on my burgers. The taste of the first bottle I opened is overly strong with too much spice or something else like a bad tomato. Just to be sure I opened a second bottle which tastes better yet is still too liquid to stay on my burgers. I bought the Muir Glen product last time and this is a thicker ketchup that tastes better.
