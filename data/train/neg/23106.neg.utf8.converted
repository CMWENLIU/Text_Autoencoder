If this is Basmati rice then one should define again the meaning of Basmati rice...Royal and Zafrani are new Basmati brands and that are cheaper but bad quality Basmati rice...<br />This rice has no smell and cooks sticky.. u need to put lot of oil to make it non sticky..I will recommend that its better to pay few dollars more and eat real basmati that is sold by Tilda and other premium basmati rice retailers...
