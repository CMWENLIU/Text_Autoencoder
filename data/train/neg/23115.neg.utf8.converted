I purchased this item believing it was "Manuka Honey" , after receiving this product through Amazon, not one word of Manuka is mentioned on the product label, or ingredients.  Now after some thorough research, I have learned that Manuka Honey is a Mono-Floral Honey (the antithesis of Multi-Floral Honey) meaning that the bees get their nectar from one plant in this case the Manuka Plant.  So Manuka Multi-Floral Honey is an oxy-moron & completely misrepresented to a lay person, I had to do research before I realized I got jipped. There is no mention of Manuka anywhere on the label. Caviot emptor!
