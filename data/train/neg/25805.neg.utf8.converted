I was very excited when I took this out of the box because I like the design.  But that all ended when I started putting the k-cups in it.  The measurements are off.  Any k-cup with a slightly rounded top will catch when you try to open or close the drawer.  There is not enough clearance.  Also, the drawer is not long enough to hold 7 per each of the 5 rows like advertised.  Again, the measurement if off slightly so it will only hold 6 (for a total of 30) with a little room left over so they do not fit snug.  Which leads to the 3rd problem:  with 2 rails instead of a solid bottom or mesh to sit on, the k-cups tilt so, again, with the poor clearance, they get hung up when you try to open or close the drawer.  Regretfully, this is not as advertised and not measured property to use for k-cups.  I am really not hard to please, but this is way wrong at any price.
