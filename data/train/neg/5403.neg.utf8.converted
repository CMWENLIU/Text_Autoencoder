I do realize I missed the part where it said instant coffee, well I saw it but I thought it meant instant in the kuerig, not actually Folgers type instant coffee. However the so-called k-cups aren't kcups at all. They caused my Kuerig to malfunction and clog. And as if that weren't bad enough the actual coffe tasted burnt.<br /><br />Don't be like me, read and heed the reviews!!!! It's not worth a nickel let alone $20.
