I received a Braided Money Tree for Mother's Day from my daughter and she was so excited to give it to me. I followed the directions exactly and after the leaves wilted and fell off, there is no sign of life.<br /><br />I thought if I was patient, it would show life and continue to grow but it has now been 6 weeks and I don't think it will revive.<br /><br />We lived in the tropics for many years so I was excited to get such a plant and it had special meaning from my daughter to me.<br /><br />Is there anything I can do? Is it possible to get it replaced so it will resemble what you describe?<br /><br />I remain - disappointed! I would like to hear from you.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Elizabeth Strand<br />paul.strand@mchsi.com
