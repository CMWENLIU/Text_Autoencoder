Before I purchased this product, I read one of the reviews which said the Lavazza black can was better.  After buying and tasting the Lavazza qualita oro, I have to agree.  The black can is better.  The qualita oro leaves a bitter aftertaste, and has an acidic quality that doesn't appeal to me.  In my opinion, the Lavazza black can of coffee has a better aroma and a smother taste.
