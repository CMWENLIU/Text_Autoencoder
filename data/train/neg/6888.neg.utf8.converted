K-Cups I recently purchased this new brand, and the quality of the K-Cups is definitively a problem. The seals on several of the K-Cups have broken and caused quite a mess. The coffee flavor s good when I am able to get a "good" cup. When you compare them side by side with other K-Cups you can see a difference in the packaging.<br /><br />I would not recommend this brand unless they make significant changes to their manufacturing and quality control processes.
