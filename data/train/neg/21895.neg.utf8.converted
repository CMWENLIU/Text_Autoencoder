I ordered this product along with another brand of coconut oil and six CD's. I arrived home to find an oil soaked box sitting on top of my mail box (I was away from home 2 hrs during which the mail was delivered) ....the temp was almost 100 degrees.  I opened the box to find a huge mess!  The other brand oil was enclosed in a sealed plastic bag that was dry inside even though the oil itself was liquified....when I removed the lid, the seal on the top was completely intact.<br /><br />This product, however, was put in the box loose.  The plastic jar seal was unbroken but the lid turned easily so I could clearly see how the liquified oil had come out and gotten all over the interior of the box.....including the six CD's....with oil seeping up into their plastic coverings and onto the paper jackets.  When I broke the plastic "ring" that is supposed to seal the outside of the jar, I found that the seal on the top was not secured to the top but had come loose so the oil came out and under the loose top.....since it wasn't in a bag, it went everywhere in the box.  This was a packaging DISASTER all around!!!!<br /><br />I found this order didn't "qualify" for leaving feedback under the packaging feedback tab in the order category.......so I can only assume it is the seller's responsibility; and the inner seal does definitely need to be addressed by them.  The oil tastes fine but I certainly will never order again.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I was gratified to find that Amazon reads these reviews and reacts to them....after posting this review, I received an email apologizing for my experience and advising that I would receive a replacement for the Barlean's.  I did receive the Barlean's which arrived with no problem; it was packed the same way but was sent two-day shipping so didn't sit in any heat for extended times....also, this jar didn't have the failed seal under the lid when I opened it.  I appreciate and was impressed by Amazon's response but, to be honest, I have to wonder if when regularly shipped it still wouldn't be a problem since it's not enclosed in a plastic bag inside the box and if sent via USPS in this heat is almost certainly going to melt.
