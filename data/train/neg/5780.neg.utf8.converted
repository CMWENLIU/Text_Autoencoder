I remember my grandmother making peanut brittle, and just waiting for it to set so I can eat it up. Then one day she ran out of peanuts and the only nuts left was cashew nuts, she tried it and we all fell in love with cashew brittle. But after my recent purchase from The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg,I have lost my love for this childhood candy. I mean it was absolutely nasty. I had to throw it away; 4 boxes; what a waste of money.<br /><br />It was all clumpy and disgusting, I will never order this again!!!
