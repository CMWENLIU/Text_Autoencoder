We love Annie's white cheddar at our house.  That's why I bought the case.  I was certainly disappointed with the chalky consistency of the product we received.  Then we noticed the date stamped on the cheese powder package--it had already expired months before I even ordered it.  My kids won't eat it. Very disappointing.
