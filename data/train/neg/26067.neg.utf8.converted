Oskri claims these are 100% fig, but they taste like they have some alcohol or something used in the manufacturing process.  Pretty miserable, if you ask me.  Also, this ad says there are 20 to a box - nope, there are 15.  I would recommend you 'try before you buy' at a retail store...and maybe just buy something there anyway!
