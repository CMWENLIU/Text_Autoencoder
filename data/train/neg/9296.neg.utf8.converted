Isn't this a rip-off? While it is a good idea, it doesn't eliminate the work and the mess cleaning an old k-cup and the value is ridiculous.<br /><br />$16.99?  Are you kidding me? If you spent $14.99 at Bed Bath and Beyond to buy the K-Cup filter, you won't have to hassle yourself removing the seal on the old k-cup and cleaning it with a cheap brush. You've defeated the purpose of the Keurig Coffee maker; that is to save time. There is a tiny hole created on all used k-cups and you'd have to make sure it's line up with the needle in the keurig. Even if there's an arrow, that's still another small thing you'd have to worry about when you're already in a hurry in the morning.
