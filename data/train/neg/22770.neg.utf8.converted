Unfortunately you cannot return this item or I definitely would.  It is basically flavorless.  The sprouts I get from my local health food store are SOOO much better.  Also, there are tons of hard seeds or shells or something that make this VERY unenjoyable to eat.  My husband won't let me put them on his salad.  Now I have 4 pounds of this stuff.  I will either throw it away or give it away, but why would I want to do that to a friend.....  I would rate this as a zero if I could.
