I bought this product based on the positive reviews it has gotten here. My experience was the exact opposite of what others have said. While the texture of Healthy Top is great, I found the taste to be quite frankly pretty awful. I expected a nutty taste, but this is a very distinct, powerfully odd nutty flavor that I could not get rid of no matter what I added to it. My search for a non-dairy whipped topping continues...
