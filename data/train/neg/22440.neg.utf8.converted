I used to get 25lb steel cut oats from Angelina's Gourmet - but noticed that the shipping charge has gone up.  Now I order my oats from Bobs Red Mills directly and pay less in total.  Cannot complain about the service, I usually get the oats delivered within 3 days.  However, it is more cheaper to buy it from the other place.
