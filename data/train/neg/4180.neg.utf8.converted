Although the title doesn't say it, the product description states multiple times that this product is 100% decaf.  Of what I received, I counted 9 of the 35 to actually be decaf (25%).  Looks like a nice selection of teas, but it's not all decaf.  Buyer beware.<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />Update - 30 DEC:  it appears that the product description has been updated.
