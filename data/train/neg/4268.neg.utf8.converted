I fell in LOVE with this product while visiting my Son in Honolulu, he purchases this at Cosco. As soon as I arrived back to the midwest I called EVERY Costco and requested and researched as to why this Cost's SO much on line and is unavailable in the Midwest or any Markets.<br /><br />It would apear this product is NOT safe under the USDA guidelines and this to be the reason for a HUGE cost Increase on line and the reason it is Unavailable in the stores normally found in.<br /><br />WHAT a SHAME ! ! ! I found a greater Energy prior to my daily Yoga and after my daily hygiene regimine for the day while eating this Mix. I would think this company; "Anne's House" would find a substitute to replace the requests for thier product. If this product is not safe under the guidelines of the FDA it should have been found before ever allowed to be placed on the shelves in the USA.<br /><br />I WISH I could find A Substiture Product as good Anne's House Soy Energy Blend that is Safe and is Reasonably priced on the shelves in the USA once again.
