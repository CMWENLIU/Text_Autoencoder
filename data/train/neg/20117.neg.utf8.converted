I am seriously considering starting a petition to bring back the old recipe! I'm glad so many reviewers here agree with me :) The new recipe is sub-par in comparison. If you purchase from Amazon you not receive the one pictured. You will receive the "new improved" recipe, which as you can read from other reviewers, isn't so "improved".
