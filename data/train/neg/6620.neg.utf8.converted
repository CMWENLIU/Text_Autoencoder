I purchased 2 of these systems for my 5 cats (we have 3 other litter boxes).  One of my cats injested some of the litter pellets and has been in the veterinarian hospital in bad shape for the last 3 days.  After xrays, and sedatives, enemas and iv fluids and blood tests, the vet removed 9 pellets, found a raging UTI and his kidney values are through the roof!  I called the manufacturer to find out what was in the pellets and was told: zeolite, silica, cement, and polysomethingorother.<br />Their website does not tell you that, just says no problem if your cat ingest - it'll will pass thru.  Not so!  I already have a vet bill in excess of $500 it is climbing because they have to keep him there!!<br />Update September 15, 2008<br />Vet bill in excess of $1000, kidney failure and Freddie died on Saturday, September 13, 2008.
