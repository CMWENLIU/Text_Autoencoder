I'm going to be blunt, but this stuff freaks me out. I read the other review about the smell and didn't think much of it. Well, that review hit home after I made my first package of oatmeal. My entire place, including the microwave, has wreaked of fake flavoring for over a week. I'm not the type that sniffs food, this stuff just overpowers your surroundings. I'm done with this processed mess and going to throw the eight boxes away.
