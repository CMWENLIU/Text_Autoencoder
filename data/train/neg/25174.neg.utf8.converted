I like these sardines and it seemed like a good deal so I ordered the box. Arrived a while ago. Two of the tins had broken open and everything is soaked in olive oil. I expect some kind of satisfaction from Amazon, have already sent an email inquiry. If they make good on it, I will edit the review to reflect the fact.<br />I was promptly contacted by amazon by e-mail and offered a refund  which I accepted.
