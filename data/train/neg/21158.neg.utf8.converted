Almond butter is just way too expensive for regular use.  It tastes ok compared to peanut butter, or any other nut butter.  One thing I dislike (besides price) is it is much runnier then PB, without the nice smooth texture (I'm comparing to real PB not the overprocessed stuff).  So my suggestion is those wanting the health benefits of almonds ought to opt for eating almonds in nut form rather than butter form as you'll save a ton of money.
