I gave this four stars because once I got it to work it was wonderful.  Does everything it says it does and is very handy to have.  BUT the problem was the same thing as everyone else, no drive shaft turning.  I also took it apart (easy) and just attached the belt to the gear and it works like a charm.  It's just too bad that they are losing customers because of some tiny malfunction because it is a BIG timesaver..  You would think they would try to fix the problem instead of letting their customers do it for them.  If I hadn't read the review on how to fix it I would have been VERY dissatisfied with this.  So I guess if you don't feel like taking a fifty fifty chance of it not working and don't want to have to fix something that is brand new, don't buy the baby Brezza.<br /><br />OK, now for an update.  I've had this thing for about three months now and I use it about twice a week, maybe for four or five different things a day.  Amonth ago I noticed a black liquid coming out of the drive shaft part when I took off the bowl.  I have always washed that part by hand and never put it in the dishwasher.  I guess this thing just isn't made to do what it's supposed to.  Now the drive shaft is completely stuck, it won't turn at all.  I also called Baby Brezza and no response.  I am majorly P.O.'d.  I also overlooked the blade sticking isuue because I just wanted to love this machine so much.  But now I know it is truly a piece of junk and I never should have bothered.  I fell in love with it because it worked so nicely and made everything so much simpler.  I will truly miss you.....tear ;)
