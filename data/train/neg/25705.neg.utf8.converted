I tried this and have to return the two other jars to the store. It was mostly tasteless. Since the price was much less than the raw almond butter I previously tried, I hoped it would be at least comparable. No such luck! It has roasted rather than raw almonds and added sugar and palm oil. I guess that is why it is spreadable but it makes it difficult to use for dipping apple slices in which is how I like to eat it most often. I will not buy this product again because it lacked the fresh, sweet raw almond taste I enjoyed with other brands. I'd much rather have to stir my almond butter and have a superior product with little or no additions.
