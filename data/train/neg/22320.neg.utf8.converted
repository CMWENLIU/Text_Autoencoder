I usually buy this product in the store, but thought I would purchase online to buy it in bigger quantities. BIG mistake. I cooked it the same way I cook the exact same product from the store, only this product smelled like rotting peanut butter and tasted disgusting. I am never buying this product again. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDG3UE">Bob's Red Mill Organic Grain Quinoa, 26-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>
