Beware the pig.....<br /><br />I bought these as a cutesy gift for Xmas presents for my children. They were not that great frankly. The packaging was not great, the pig was small, and he didn't taste that good. My advice is to pass on this one. There were some chocolate voodoo dolls that went over a lot better, were more fun, and tasted better so my advice would be to get those over this item.
