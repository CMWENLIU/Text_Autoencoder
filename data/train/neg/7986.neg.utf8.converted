I lived all my life in the Middle East and visited every country in the Middle East (including Israel) as well as many Mediterranean countries. I am writing this review mainly for people from the Middle East.<br />I always get my pickles from the stores that sell imported Middle Eastern food, and that's usually expensive.  So I thought maybe I can find them cheaper on Amazon. There were only 5 positive reviews when I ordered these pickles, so I was hopeful.  But after trying these with and without food, I am sad to report that they are not even close to Mediterranean pickles!  They are overdone and too salty and they are worse than what you get in North American grocery stores.  If you are looking for authentic pickles, because you miss having them like me, look elsewhere.<br />Many of the cans arrived dented, and none of them had a manufacturing or expiry dates.<br />P.S. for people who lived most of their lives in the US I'm not sure what to tell you other than these don't taste authentic and you might not like it.
