This coffee was such a dissapointment! I ordered it as a subscribe and save and after going through the first box, I replaced the Melitta coffee pods with Baronet coffee pods. The Melitta pods were never consistent. Sometimes I would get a cup of medium strength coffee from the pod and most times I would get a cup of coffee so weak, you could see the bottom of the coffee mug. For those looking for a coffee pod that gives you a rich and strong cup of coffee, buy the Baronet pods. I LOVE them! Each cup of coffee is consistently strong, flavorful and bold. If you like your coffee strong, you will not be dissapointed!
