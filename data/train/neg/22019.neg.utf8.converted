When I saw this product I liked the concept.  It's an enegry bar with no chocolate coatings (it won't melt) and no odd soy-based protein sources that I can't understand.  It looks like real food so I bought some.<br /><br />Then I read the label on the bar itself - it's made in China!  After China's track record of having dangerous chemicals in baby formula and pet food, I'm not so happy with this purchase.  I looked all over their website and it's impossible to know this fact until you get the bars.  Mrs. May's is in CA, I don't know why they can't use nuts & dried fruit from the US & Canada.  I won't be buying these again.
