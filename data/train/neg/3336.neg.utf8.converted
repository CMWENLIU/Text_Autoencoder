I love(d) these bars. They taste like a candy bar, have fiber, fill me up, whats not to like!<br />Oh wait... they use SOY PROTEIN.<br /><br />I'd heard about the dangers of men/boys eating soy protein before from friends/colleagues and pretty much dismissed it as tinfoil hat conspiracy theory. But when Men's Health had a large report on it, I figured it was worth the time to do some independent analysis.<br /><br />Long story short (and don't just take my word for it, I could be a crazy person on the internets) if you are a man, you are essentially taking large doses of estrogen every time you eat one of these. Note only does estrogen not help out in the muscle building department, the soy phytoestrogens have been linked (through legitimate research) to a whole lot of bad things, namely behavioral, pulmonary, circulatory diseases.<br /><br />So eat these things if you'd like, but I will be running not walking away from them. And it REALLY bums me out because they taste great... I just wished Special K would have ponied up the couple extra cents to whey protein...sigh.
