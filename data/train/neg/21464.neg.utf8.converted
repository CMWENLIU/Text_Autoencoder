i purchased this product in hopes of recreating almond bubble teas at home. however there are a couple problems with this product.<br />1- no measurements on pkg. just says one or 2 scoops per 8 oz.(no scoop included). 2 heaping tablespoons seemed to work.<br />2- not resealable, mix must be put in Ziploc or container.<br />3- hardly any almond flavor, very mild. you get a larger taste of the powdered milk and creamer. these 2 combined overpower the almond, giving more of a milky flavor than almond from beginning to end.<br />4- does not mix well.you have to mix powder with small amount warm liquid and blend, then add rest of liquid.<br /><br />Will add almond extract to future batches to combat taste.I know have to figure out what to do with the rest of the 3 pound bag! I will also try the other brand amazon sells, i believe its Trojan foods?
