I bought this because I was looking for the "aged 10 years" product shown in the photo. Note that this product is NOT the same as the product shown in the photo. The product I was shipped is simply "aged" but doesn't have any duration. Clearly it's a cheaper product than the one shown. I would look elsewhere for ten year aged balsamic
