Pets cost money...so if your going to be cheap and feed garbage to your loyal pets so you can save a few dollars a month...don't get pets....when feeding Fancy Feast to my cat she was always throwing up and had gooey stools...i listened to her behavior...even though she loved the taste( kids love candy...but is it good for them)...as soon as I switched her to a better quality food the vomiting stopped, no furballs, and better stool...she is much happier and thanks me everday for it with her energy and contentment
