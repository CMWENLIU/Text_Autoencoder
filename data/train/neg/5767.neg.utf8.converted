Today I received my package and was excited to try out the new peanut butter, as I had previous ordered a different flavor from Peanut Butter & Co. (The dark chocolate variety, and it was delicious!) through amazon a few months ago.  However I was extremely disappointed in this batch.<br /><br />When I first looked at the jars there were quite a lot of raisins on the bottom of the jars, which was not a problem.. I thought perhaps there was just a great deal of raisins in them!  However upon opening the first jar, I was quite wrong.  It seems that all the raisins had settled to the bottom, making me dig through the entire jar to the very bottom where they had all settled and smashed.<br /><br />Though I would have expected better mixing from a premium product like this, it was not the worst part.  Once I decided to try the peanut butter itself it had a VERY gritty texture, so bad that I had to spit it out afterward.  It was like a mouth full of peanut butter flavored sand.  Every bite was like chewing on a mouth full of sugar crystals.  All of the jars seemed to have the problem with the raisins being settled to the bottom, however I did not take a taste from each of them as well.<br /><br />I would have given one star, but Amazon was very quick and easy in resolving the matter for me, so they get an extra one for that!  I can only assume this was a defective batch, as the other ratings seem to be quite high... but it is a possibility you may received a bad order.
