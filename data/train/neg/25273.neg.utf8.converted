While getting started in the cake making business we thought with the brand Wilton we'd buy their fondant to use til we found a good recipe for our own and tweaked it.  This fondant works up well and looks great but the taste is nearly unbearable.  If it's for decoration only, it's as good as you'll use but for taste, absolutely the worst I've dealt with and everyone who tried to eat it said the same thing.  Duff's is probably the best store-bought I've used for taste and you'll actually crave eating it days after you've had a cake with it.  You can also get it from the original manufacturer as well for about half the cost.
