I can't for the life of me remember what inspired me to buy this stuff in the first place, but after just 1 use i promptly threw the rest of the bottle away. 1st of all, the stench is absolutely awful. Then after glancing over the ingredient list I can imagine why putting all these chemicals on my hair would really be beneficial. I've had such better results with just plain old coconut oil. Before the shower, i slather a bunch on my hair. I let it sit for 10 minutes then shampoo and condition as normal. Makes my hair super soft without having to add all these chemicals and putrid stench to my hair.
