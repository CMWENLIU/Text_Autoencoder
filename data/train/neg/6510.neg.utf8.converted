Got absolutely nothing from it.  It did taste decent, not worth $2.50 for the bottle, but at least it didn't taste like crap AND do nothing.<br /><br />This comment will probably get pushed down quickly; It looks like whoever is selling this product does the thing where whenever a somewhat negative review appears, they quickly create some accounts and give this a 5 star rating and vote helpful for all of the other previous fake 5-star comments.  The way you can usually tell is go threw and click the link that says "see all my reviews" by the 5 star comments; on many of them you will see this is the only product they have ever rated.  That's pretty fishy.
