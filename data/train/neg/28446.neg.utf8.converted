It tastes all right, but nothing like you'd get in a restaurant. And nothing like the Saag Paneer I've come to know and love. Nothing. Mostly it tastes like cooked spinach and cheese. Which, while I like, is something I can do with the equivalent of a can of spinach and a stick of mozzarella. Supposed to be medium spiced but, again, it just tastes like those two ingredients. Tandoor Chef does a rather passable (and tasty) chicken tikka masala too, so was very dissappointed. Will not be trying this particular one again.
