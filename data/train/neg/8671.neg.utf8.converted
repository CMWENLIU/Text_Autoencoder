This was the second tree I purchased online, both ended with bad experiences.  The trees were purchased at separate time; they both died within 2 months after purchases.  This particular tree was sitting in a 6" container, but it was much smaller than the one shown in the picture - The plant was only about 4" to 5" tall (with scarce branching); sitting in the 6" pot, it made the planting completely out of proportion.  After it died, I took the tree out to do the cleaning, there was not much roots in the first place.  I assume the seller hurriedly pushed a new young plant into the soils just prior to shipping out the order.
