I used to have no problem with these, until one day on an impulse I decided to give Target's Archer Farms brand coffee pods a try (breakfast blend aka medium roast).  They cost less, are bigger, individually wrapped and produce a much smoother coffee.  Now I can't drink Douwe Egberts anymore and am hooked on Archer Farms.
