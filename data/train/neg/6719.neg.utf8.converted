I was not impressed about this product (Made in China). Cheaply made and not very good quality. Outside was coated with redish brown sweet something which stained the carpet.  My dog first tried to lick the coating and then bit the "bone".  It was like hard leather, more than bone, and left a mess of shreds about as well.
