Seeing as simply anyone can 'review' items with out really having to buy anything and also how two reviewers, who said they know their 'tea's', stated that they were very disappointed to find that they have received not 'coca ' but 'GREEN', TEA. Now, when it comes to getting a refund , what could those people really DO about it? Argue that they should have received genuine,ground up 'coca' leaf when it is Illegal in america? Now, there IS 'coca leaf tea' which has had the alkaloids removed, available but WHO would want that? Even if they did get 'alkaloid free coca' how would they prove if it was real or not without spending serious cash for some Botanist to check it out? Isn't the most part of the 'Experience' in the 'alkaloids' ? So what would be the point in trying this if it had been stripped of it's 'goodies' other than for a 'novel purpose' which in My mind would be like drinking the 'Tea' of some plain leaf material. Another thing, people reported feeling tired and fatigued or something like that,after trying the tea. I know that Kratom tea does this to people and I wonder if THAT is what this 'tea' really is, or some kind of 'admixture' of green tea and Kratom. I highly suspect that the 5 star reviews are not genuine since I have not bought anything and I can leave a review. This is what came into my mind when I read the reviews and then by checking it out and seeing I could leave a 'review' without ordering proves to me the likelihood of false promotion by the sellers who may be creating false reviews. Say what you will but until the option to 'review' is given only to those who have bought this product, and then I can be 100% confident that the 'reviews' are not false, I will not be buying this product. Something tells me that if the 'review' option WAS given only to those who have purchased something, that this product would receive very steady and poor ratings. Unless you like taking uncertain chances with your money or if your rich enough that you don't care about the risk, I wouldn't buy this. Be Careful, People !
