We ordered and shortly thereafter, received the container of "English Licorice Allsorts," expecting an enticing, fresh package. Unfortunately, the enclosed licorice were anything but fresh. In fact, they felt and tasted like they were left overs from a year -- or more -- ago.<br />Consumers like myself, rely on Amazon to check, at least periodically, the age and quality of what they are sending to otherwise unknowing customers such as myself. Sending food is quite different from offering a choice of books for example like "new" vs. "used" or "date expired"<br />Please in future, do check -- at least on a random basis -- the quality of what you are shipping.
