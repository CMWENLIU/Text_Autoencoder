I am not a big coffee drinker. But my wife is. She has bought this in the store and really liked the coffee. I discussed with her and we thought it would be a good idea to put it on subscription. It came. She made her morning coffee and boy I heard about it. You would think someone died. And that someone could have been me! Well to make a point, it was stale. And since we opened a bag it could not be returned so now we have 4 bags of stale coffee. Do yourself a favor a pass this one by. Seriously. Thing is I am disabled. I am not crying about that, but that means a limited income. Amazon helps me to order in any items I can. Recently I have had to depend on a cane because the pain is too great. The problem in a nutshell is I think there is not enough "stock rotation" in the warehouse. I had the same problem with the Duracell batteries. Half the package was dead. Now all the other thing are fine. I love amazon. I have sold on Amazon for years. Good customers good people. (Personally, I tried the coffee and it was not the best but I have tasted worse.) That's all. Thank you.
