This is horrible soup!!  I love chicken soup, any kind of chicken soup but this is tasteless and watery.  The chick piece that was in my can was tough and stringy.  The four dumplings in the can were soggy and gummy.  Just awful soup.  I have eleven more cans.  I guess I'll add soup to the dogs food. I rate this even less the one star!!
