The 32-can Friskies poultry catfood pack had cans broken open and spoiled meat.  I called about this problem and was sent a replacement pack, but it had a broken can also.  I kept the unbroken cans and disposed of the open one, but the smell was terrible.  Something should be done about the storage and handling of these cans of food products.
