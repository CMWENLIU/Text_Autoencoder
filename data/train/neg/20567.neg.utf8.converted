Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about.  I purchased 4 bags of this stuff based on the reviews and I'm very underwhelmed.  My wife couldn't stomach more than one piece and I only made it through 4 or 5 myself.  While the texture is similar, and there is a faint memory of what licorice sticks used to taste like, it's definitely not the same.  I found the after taste to be a little sickening and, if possible, the remainder of my order is going right back to Amazon.<br /><br />No thanks.
