I had been buying Lion brand Kona coffee and was quite satisfied.  For some reason that has since escaped me, I decided to try the Hawaii Roasters coffee.  I was very much looking forward to it, especially after reading through the Amazon reviews.  When I opened the HRs bag, I was not captivated by the aroma as I am with the Lion coffee. I found the coffee to be bland and tasteless.  Not objectionable by any means, but not at all what I would describe as flavorful.  Perhaps I got an old batch or something, but regardless, I'm going back to the Lion brand.
