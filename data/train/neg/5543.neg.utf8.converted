This my problem with all of annie's products.  Just because it is organic does not make it healthy.  There is very little nutritional value to these crackers.  There is no fiber and it high in calories, fat and salt.  I wish amazon would list the nutritional value on the sight.  If they had I wouldn't have purchase them.  I do have to say that they are tasty.  I'm to the point of making my own at home.  Lots of really easy recipes out there.
