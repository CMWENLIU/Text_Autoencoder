There is nothing wrong with the way this product tastes, but it is difficult to cook with. I searched recipes on the internet and realized that in order to get recipes specific to this product, you have to buy the book. I tried other recipes that called for almond flour, but nothing turned out right in terms of consistency, although usually the taste was okay. Such failed experiments included cookies, pancakes, and biscuits. They just do not hold together no matter the variety of ways I tried to prepare them based on other cooks recommendations. I even tried a free biscuit recipe from the book's authors (specific to this product) and they also fell apart. Perhaps there are other uses for this flour than baking, but I haven't figured out what to do with what is left. If you are a skilled cook you probably will be fine using this almond flour, but if you are a novice or just adequate in the kitchen, as I am, I would not recommend this product.
