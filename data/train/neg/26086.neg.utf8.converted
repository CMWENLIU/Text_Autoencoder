These olives are both too salty and too small, not worth the effort to eat them.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UXMNBQ">Roland Nicoise Olives from France, 6.1-Pound Can</a>  I don't know what makes them Nicoise, exactly, but they do not add a specifically French flavor to anything, just more salt than you would want if you pursue a healthy diet.
