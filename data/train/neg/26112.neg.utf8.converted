The description on this item does not specify that this is the LOW SODIUM Homestyle Chicken Noodle, though the  picture does say so if you look closely.  Sadly, Campbell's appears to have discontinued the regular Homestyle chicken noodle (I cannot find it in any grocery stores, or online) and only offers the healthy request and low sodium options.  The low sodium is AWFUL!!  The flavor is completely flat and almost tasteless, and adding salt does not improve it.<br /><br />I can understand offering healthier options for parents and others who need to avoid sodium, but I'm ticked off that Campbell's has taken away the regular flavor.  I will say that the price here is reasonable - Campbell's soups are approaching $2 a can in many supermarkets - especially if you subscribe.  I would happily subscribe if this were the regular Homestyle.  As it is, I can't recommend this flavorless soup.  I'd rather make my own.
