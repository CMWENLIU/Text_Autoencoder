Hellmans no longer tastes like it used to. I read on another website that the water content has increased drastically over the years. I've never used any other brand and usually can tell when something I'm eating has been made with cheaper mayonnaise. Hellman's now tastes like the cheap mayonnaise. I'm trying other brands to see which one I prefer.
