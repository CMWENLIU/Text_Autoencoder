the fiber content of this "powder" is amazing but the the taste and texture are almost unbearable. while hemp is not going to taste as good (by good taste-i mean an absence of taste) as soy or whey, it should at least be better than this.<br /><br />my gripes:<br /><br />texture- this product should not be called a powder at all. it's more like the contents of a tea bag. the product should be more finely ground.<br /><br />taste- this hemp has a stronger taste than other brands i have tried. i haven't found anything that really goes well with the "earthy" taste.<br /><br />the good news:<br /><br />fiber-i believe one serving provides 54% of the DV. that's 2-4 times as much as other hemp powders. this is why i gave this product 2 stars instead of one.<br /><br />the good news about all hemp:<br /><br />it's not highly processed like whey, soy, rice or other protein powders.<br /><br />it's organic. most hemp powders are organic because hemp is naturally resistant to pests. ever wonder why you never see organic soy protein? hexane. this is the chemical (similar to gasoline) that must be used to isolate the protein from the bean.<br /><br />it's raw. yay!<br /><br />other brands:<br /><br />i have tried nutiva, ruth's and living harvest. i currently use and recommend living harvest. it has the best consistency and taste. ruth's contains slightly more vitamins than living harvest but has a slightly stronger taste. nutiva is by far the worst with the strongest taste, grainiest texture and least vitamins.<br /><br />i find that the best recipe for a hemp smoothie is just a frozen ripe banana (use one with lot's of brown freckles-it may be a little gooey going into the freezer but as with banana bread, those bananas have the best taste), 2-3 drops of vanilla extract, some soy or almond milk and a scoop of hemp. hemp doesn't really seem to agree with berries or non-creamy fruits.<br /><br />bottom line-unless fiber is your #1 concern, go with another brand.
