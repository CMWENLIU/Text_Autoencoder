Don't misunderstand my low rating, this is an excellent curry and really is as good as you would get in a quality Indian restaurant; quite unbelievable for a frozen meal in a box. The problem is the portion size is miserable since they started marketing it with the bismati rice included in the box. I am not a big eater and am normally quite happy with smaller sized entrees but you literally would need two of these if you are having it as an entree; and that is if you have the Nan bread with it!!! It used to come without the rice and you got twice the amount of curry, which was perfect (easy to cook up some rice or buy heat and serve to accompany it). Then the makers cut the size in half and included rice, making the actual curry portion half what it was. The reason the manufacturer gave for the change (reduced portion) was that customers like the convenience of having the rice included. Fair enough - add the rice, but don't cut the curry portion in half to where it is utterly misleading to pass this off as an entree. Please go back to a reasonable portion size and either add the rice and charge a couple of dollars extra, or better still, sell the rice as a seperate side dish and give at least a semblance of an entree sized curry.
