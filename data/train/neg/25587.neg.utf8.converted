I love Amazon and will still love the ease of shopping.  Infact I always check reviews before purchasing most anything.  But these crackers, I guess you call them are the most awful thing I have ever put into my mouth.  I have to think the shipping box they came in would have more of a pleasant flavor. (Since the box rolled around the UPS floor for a while)  So I will feed them to the fish in the lake.  :)<br />If you are looking for something tasty or salty or just to chew on, find something else!
