Having been GF for a long time and used to changing out flour in our favorite recipes I have to say this flour was one of the worst I have ever used. I bought it because of the several 5 star reviews but wow, what an expensive mistake. First were the lemon bars for a family Easter dinner that had crust like dry gritty sand that completely fell off the bars so into the garbage they went. Next were the two seperate attempts at oven baked puff pancakes called Dutch Babies which did NOT puff in addition to being pure goo that could NOT be eaten. (I cooked the second one longer thinking it just needed longer cooking....WRONG!) After wasting all those lemons, eggs and butter, I am very skeptical about trying this flour in anything. I have always had excellent results with Mama's coconut blend flour so will stick to that. It is also available on Amazon but needs to have the xanthan gum added as it is not in the blend already. This is a good thing since different types of baked goods need varying amounts of xanthan gum. Also, the texture of Mama's is soft and fine and most like white flour in comparison to the course sandy grit of this Namaste flour.
