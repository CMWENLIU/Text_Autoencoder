This product page lists as ingredients:  Decaffinated Green Tea, Lemongrass, Natural Flavors.<br /><br />But they have failed at listing ALL of the ingredients, which are the above AND rose petals, AND peppermint.<br /><br />Maybe not an issue to some (or most?) but was for me.  Peppermint in my tea is unacceptable and is an important ingredient that should be disclosed.  Shame on you Good Earth.  Because of this, I got a refund from Amazon and will never buy another one of your products online (maybe I'll try you out after I'm able to physically see the box and ingredients myself in a brick & mortar store, but for now you are a big FAIL.)<br /><br />I asked the Amazon rep to please alert Good Earth of this oversight, so if you're reading this and see that they've added the rose petals and peppermint to their list of ingredients, it was done after my call and this review :)
