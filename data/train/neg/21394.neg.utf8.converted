"This is instant coffee"--said the company I called to ask for a refund--which they refused! They say we should expect this gritty disgusting mess, & they want us to pay for.  It has no filter and the ground should dump into the cup to "add flavor" he said???  Do not buy this.  The CS rep was insulting, he said it says on the box it is "micro grounds and soluble"--I said the proper term is insoluble and we should expect to drink grounds????.  Return it to the store and never buy it again and tell the stores about this scam.  Manufacturer is Strumfoods.com--junk!!!
