I only paid $12.50 when they had this for a daily special but it wasn't even worth that.  Maybe the tea was old, that is why it was so cheap.  The flowering teas don't flower and float at the top.  Nothing like the picture.  The leaves soak up the water and puff out and fall apart.  But that I can live with.  The tea is completely tasteless.  Just like drinking hot water.  I have tasted many teas, bags and loose leaf and nothing as bad as these.  But the little glass teapot is cute.  And it IS tiny.
