OK, I love the Szeged Paprika, hot or sweet.<br />However, in the last ten (10)years these tins are NOT real Hungarian Parkika!<br />It's tastless and most cases it's OLD stock, or Chinese mixed with Hungarian. They caught some of the firms in Hungary doing just that. Mixing Chinese product that's not even close to what it should be.<br />Am not saying that all of them are like that, but this brand gone from 5 star plus to 0 (ZERO).<br /><br />These tins are possibly filled by Chinese or some other country. If it says on the package: Distributed by: (whoever) then it's NOT MADE in the USA or neither was IMPORTED from Hungary.<br />If it was imported from Hungary it would say so on the package!<br /><br />I'd pass on this purchase if you know what real Hungarian Paprika is.<br />I know.<br />These are tasteless red powder.<br /><br />Suggestion: SAFEWAY supermarket had the best selection in the past but now it's the same as this seller's.
