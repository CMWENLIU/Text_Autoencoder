Sure, the first ingredient on this cereal is whole grain oats. That's good. But the second ingredient is sugar, and there's more nutritionally-devoid corn in this cereal than Kashi's signature 7-whole-grain blend. Also note that this corn is not GMO-free. I'm not saying this cereal is bad for you (although there is debate over the health effects of GMOs), it just contains more empty calories than you think.<br /><br />Side note: Kashi is owned by Kelloggs. It's not some small company devoted to creating wholistic, nutritious foods; it's a corporation that is interested in taking as full advantage of cheap, subsidized corn as it can without deterring health-conscious consumers.
