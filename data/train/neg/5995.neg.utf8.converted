Most Walden Farms products -- and I've tried over a dozen -- I'd rate four to five stars.  Perhaps not as good as the high calorie stuff, but outstanding for zero calories and zero carbs.<br /><br />However, this peanut spread is nothing short of disgusting.  It tastes more like chemicals, very little like peanut butter.  I took one taste and threw the balance in the garbage.  Save you money!  But do try their salad dressings and syrups!
