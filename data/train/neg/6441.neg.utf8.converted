I finally, FINALLY found a dark chocolate that I love... Only to have it swept off the shelves and replaced with a disgusting 'new recipe' that reminded me of chocolate I bought on sale at a dollar store once. One of the other reviewers said 'waxy and tasteless' and that about sums it up. Plus, I find it insulting that they would trumpet NEW RECIPE!! on the box, and expect the consumer to assume that it was improved, as opposed to ruined.<br /><br />Lindt-- Charge more, I don't care, but don't sacrifice the quality of your products. Americans are SICK TO DEATH of soy products in EVERYTHING.
