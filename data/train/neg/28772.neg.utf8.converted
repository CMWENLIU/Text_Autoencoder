We have bought 2 packages of these that were fine. Last week I bought another package and the treats had a dark, burnt like color, and seemed very dry. I just assumed they had been over baked...but I should have listened to my instincts and not given them to my puppy. She had 2 treats and became very sick. Lethargic, vomiting, just looked damn pitiful. Had to see doctor, who gave her some medications by injection and advised us to take the treats away immediately, to which I did. She has since recovered, given NO more treats. I have emailed Blue Buffalo, no response. I have called them earlier today, no answer. I have now been on hold with them for 20 min...and still counting. This is VERY UPSETTING considering how they market their company as responsible and caring...and not to mention how much their products cost!<br />21 min....<br />I doubt I will ever get someone on the phone.<br /><br />JUST BEWARE of these treats before feeding them to your pet.
