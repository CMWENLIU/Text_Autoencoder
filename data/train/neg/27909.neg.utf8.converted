The picture is a fraud.  There is no pretty box just a bunch of k-cups thrown in a whte corrogated box with a cardboard tube that looks like it came from inside a roll of paper towels.  The worst offense, the coffee is old.  Some cups only had 2 months till their expiration.  The only good thing was I got to quickly ( because I did not want the coffee to expire)try many different blends at once.
