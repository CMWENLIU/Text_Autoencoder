Yes its a little cheaper online but you better be prepared to wait. For some odd reason they say it takes 2 weeks for them to be able to ship it out. I forgot and didnt order early enough and just had to order a bag on 5/11 and its 5/27 and still no cat food. Says it will be here June 2. Thats nuts. Not sure I will order online anymore. Its worth an extra $5 to just buy from petco.
