Being of Italian heritage, I was enticed by the romantic notion of starting my day with some real Italian coffee... I use a stovetop espresso (moka) maker. I received the four pack of Lavazza Rossa bricks very quickly, but to my disappointment, the expiration date on the bricks was impossible to understand. I received the packs on May 20th, 2011 and the two different numbers on the bottom of the bag read "AP1610" and "30081Z" (yes, "Z"). So, either the bags were over a year past expiration, or "1Z" means 12. Not sure. Oh well, I thought, I'll give it a whirl... The coffee was not bad. But, it was no better than Safeway's own Franch Roast beans from the bin that I have been grinding myself for years. This coffee is not worth the extra money (or, was it expired?). I'm still irritated that the company would be so unclear about the expiration date. I won't order this product again. Spudoratos!
