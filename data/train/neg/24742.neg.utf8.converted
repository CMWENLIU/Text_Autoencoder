I didn't like these cookies. I don't know why reviews here on Amazon and on netrition are saying how sweet they are, because they aren't sweet at all. They only taste like almonds and oats. The texture isn't good, and they fell apart before I could even get them off the pan. The directions said not to grease the pan but I think you'd have to, despite having an entire stick of butter in the mix.<br />According to the nutrition facts (when you do the math) the package is supposed to make 34 cookies (a 2" 2-cookie serving, makes 17 servings). It told you to drop tablespoons of dough and I used my tablespoon cookie scoop but it only made 24 cookies.<br />I suppose these cookies were better than any other of the low-carb cookie recipes I've tried from cookbooks, but they still were not good enough to make again and I'll probably end up throwing most of them away. I'm on a low-carb and low-calorie diet and with a whole stick of butter in the dough I don't think it's worth the calories I'd have to sacrifice to eat a mediocre cookie.<br />I suppose when I want to eat a cookie, I just want to eat a darn cookie. I suppose I want to taste sugar (or something like it), not oats or almonds. When you have a sweet tooth, who reaches for oats or almonds? I don't even like oatmeal cookies; maybe that's one reason why I don't like them.
