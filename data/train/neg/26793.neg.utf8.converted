I love a good cup of coffee....such as REVV, Jet Fuel,Tigers Eye or any of the Caribou flavors here on Amazon.....I got an Email with this coffee featured and thought...what the heck? Lets try it....what a waste of money. wish I could send it back...gave the remainder to a co-worker who even said...'can I toss it?'  Don't get me wrong...I did try each and every flavor....there was one that was ok...but most of them burst open in my keurig before the coffee even was finished.  Plus a few of them shot coffee grounds right into the coffee cup as it was being made.  I like my coffee bold but not bitter...so I tend to be picky, however, I will drink other strengths as well...no matter which one I tried, it was bland...boring....and I lost $24  on this terrible stuff.  Wish we could get our money back...but I won't be purchasing this brand ever again.  Hey, at least I gave it a try!
