I love the scent of this product. That's the good news. The only good news.<br /><br />But in my old age, I have developed a horrible itchy reaction to certain hair products, namely WEN, which gave me an awful rash on my hairline (front and back) as well as my entire neck. So when I saw this product, I thought it would be a relief now that my itchy WEN rash is finally (after SIX months of healing) a thing of the past.<br /><br />Sad to say that I was wrong. I used Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty conditioner and shampoo  three times in a row and guess what happened?  Yup. Same sort of irritation and itching in all of the same places.<br /><br />There must be a very specific ingredient the makers of hair products are including in their respective cleansers and conditioners because the fact that this has happened AGAIN literally has me scratching my head in disbelief.<br /><br />Again, this shampoo (and its companion conditioner) has a lovely scent - but I will not spend my waking and sleeping hours scratching myself like a cat with fleas.  If you have any sensitivity to hair products, avoid this one.<br /><br />Boo. So goes this product the way of WEN. In the trash.
