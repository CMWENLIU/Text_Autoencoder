We purchased the Stegosaurus at a local pet store the day we adopted our cattle dog mix. At the time she was about 45 pounds and 8 months old. We did not know what kind of chewer she was, but felt that a product designed for "powerful" chewers up to 50 pounds would be a safe choice. It was not. She worked to remove the head and tail of the dino and while we were able to get the larger pieces from her, she swallowed several very small pieces. And much to our embarrassment, at her first vet visit (3 days after adoption) we were told to stop giving her whatever "white plastic" toy she was chewing and eating. Enough pieces had gotten into and through her system to cause the vet concern she may not pass all of them.<br /><br />I am giving this product 1 star because:<br />1) It is described as a product for powerful chewers - it did not hold up<br />2) It is rated for dogs up to 50 pounds - while on the upper end of the scale, our dog fits into that category and the product did not hold up<br />3) the vet warned us to stop using the product as the size and shape of the pieces were potentially harmful to our dog.
