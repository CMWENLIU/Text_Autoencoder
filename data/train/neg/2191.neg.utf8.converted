I have been buying CF bulbs for many years. 100 watt equivalent bulbs typically use 23 watts, put out 1600 lumens of light and a 4-pack costs about $8 ($2 each). These bulbs are brighter (1900 lumens) but use 30 watts of electricity (1/3 more) and cost $40.81 for a 6-pack ($6.80 each !!). If you really want to save money and electricity, I recommend you check out other bulbs before you buy.
