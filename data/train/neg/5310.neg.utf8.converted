I found the pulp to be uncomfortably large chunks, that settled on the bottom. I also found this to be unnaturally sweet. (I have tried many different coconut waters; both packaged and fresh from the coconut.) The product lists far more carbs than any other packaged coconut water I have tried. Given these two things, I'm thinking it's likely this product is boiled, or otherwise condensed.  This may be good for those weaning off sugary beverages, but if you are looking for a coconut water that tastes like fresh from the coconut, this is not it.
