Bigs Dill 12 packs always seem to be on back-order, so I figured instead of heading to a Sports Authority (the only retail store I KNOW has my Bigs Dill packs) again and again for too much mark up, I'd try a case of these.  While the initial flavor is OK, it wears off really fast, and if you eat sunflower seeds the proper way, by stuffing a handful into your cheeks, you'll find it's quite like what happens when you are chewing bubble gum...good at first, but quickly becomes a bland, mushy mess.  Bigs brand is WAY better.  Bigger seeds, better tasting, and the last one in a cheekful still actually tastes like dill pickle.  I think even David's might be better, and that's saying something! I've gone through 2 packs of my case of Spitz, and I've already ordered a new case of Bigs brand.  I will throw these out or give them away when the new case arrives...they are that inferior.
