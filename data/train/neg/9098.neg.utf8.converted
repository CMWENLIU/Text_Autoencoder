I don't understand all these reviews that say there is no aftertaste to this.  Even in small amounts in baking, the first thing I notice is the terrible aftertaste and I've thrown out what I've made with it.  It's just THAT noticeable.  I was using Ideal until I found out it actually had a lot of carbs, but it was really good for baking.  I wish I could find a good no carb sweetener product.  This is NOT it.
