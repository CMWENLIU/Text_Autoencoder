I bought this as a Mother's Day gift for my mom and it arrived with the pot shattered!  She said the bonsai is fine but she was so sad that she had to go buy a new pot.  I tried to use the returns process to get a replacement and apparently that's not an option because they are all of a sudden out of stock.  How in the world do you return a tree?  I just want a new pot or compensation for the new pot my mom must now go out and buy.  :(
