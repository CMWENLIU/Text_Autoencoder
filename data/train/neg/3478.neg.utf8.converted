I heard about Miracle Noodles on Dr. Oz recently and couldn't resist trying them out, because they were touted as a delicious low carb alternative to pasta. Yes, I'd read the reviews and heard a lot of horror stories about how weird they tasted and smelled, but in spite of the negative reviews, I still got a pack of these because I'm a fan of all things Asian and figured that the poor reviews were from people not used to exotic food.<br /><br />Well, I tried them and can now render my verdict. You know that saying, "The truth between two extremes lies somewhere in the middle?" Nowhere is this truer than when it comes to people's reactions to these noodles. They are neither what the haters make them out to be nor at all what the ravers claim that they are.<br /><br />Let's talk about the negative reviews first. Contrary to what so many people are saying, Miracle Noodles do not have a pungent fishy odor or the texture of squid, calamari, or rubber bands. When I first opened the bag I had to really sniff for a "fishy" smell, since it was barely discernible. However, I did smell something else, a mild aroma not unlike that of sweetened soy milk. Not to worry, as these smells easily disappeared when rinsing and boiling the noodles.<br /><br />As for the texture? Not at all "rubbery", but very... gelatinous. At first I thought it was similar to those chewy fruity bits you often find in Asian puddings and drinks. But after chomping on the noodles for awhile, the texture became unmistakeable-- it was like cartilage. And no, this is not an exaggeration. The noodles had the exact semi-gelatinous, semi-crunchy consistency of cartilage. Did the texture make these noodles inedible or the worst thing ever? Not at all. Just very... jarring.<br /><br />What about the rave reviews claiming that this product is a perfect substitute for fettucine or other types of pasta? No way, Jose. Because their texture has a "fleshy" quality to it, Miracle Noodles are more suitable as a vegetarian substitute for meat, fish, and poultry dishes, especially since they absorb flavors so well. (When I poured oyster sauce on mine, they really did taste like a seafood-like dish.) But as a replacement for pasta? Good Lord, no. Not in a million years. I can see someone hankering for these if they want to have something in lieu of meat, but there's no way someone would be craving these in lieu of pasta. There are no similarities whatsoever between the two.<br /><br />So basically, don't believe the hype about this product, because it's definitely been mismarketed to the wrong eaters. Miracle Noodles do have some potential as a staple in the diet of someone either foregoing meat altogether or trying to cut down on it. But as a substitute for pasta or carbs? Not a chance.
