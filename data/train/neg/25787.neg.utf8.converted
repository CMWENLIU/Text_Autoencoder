I thought this was the answer to our mosquito problems.  NOT!!!!<br /><br />I followed the directions and made sure I soaked everything with this stuff: Grass, Bushes, Plants, etc.  Now I was sure my guests and I would be problem-free for our bonfire.  This was surely not the case.  As dusk approached it was if someone rang the dinner bell for the mosquito population.  All ten of us were being attached ferociously by the mosquito infantry.<br /><br />We ended up getting out the Off with deet to curb their appetite but they continued to look for any flaws in our defenses.  Then I remembered that years back I bought a bug light (uses UV light and fries bugs).  I plugged in the bug zapper and watched in amazement as those pesky little critters began to fry in droves.  As the frying continued so did the buzzing of these pesky little beasts.<br /><br />I wasted my money on purchasing this product but now you'll know too that this is not the abswer to your problems.  Look elsewhere my friend or you too will be throwing away your cash as I did.
