Was excited to find a product that worked to prevent bladder blockages.  My cat was excited when I opened the package, the smell alone had him jumping all over me.  But when I gave him one,  it was impossible for him to bite, let alone chew. The treat was bigger than a normal sized cat treat, and the texture of hard jerky, not a chew at all.  Wish the manufacturer would come out with a SOFT version of this treat.  2 out of 4 reviewers = your taking your chances with these..
