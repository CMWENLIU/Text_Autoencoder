These used to be my favorite allergy friendly snack that I did not have to make myself. The flavor was great and most importantly, it had TEXTURE (which as anyone with allergies to most textured foods like nuts and grains knows is extremely desirable and important.) But they have changed them for the worse! Oh they are so horrible that I am having trouble expressing it so here's a copy of the email that I sent to the folks at Enjoy Life Foods:<br /><br />  "You have ruined Chaco Loco snacks. They are now disgusting! They used to be the only allergy friendly snack that I'd found that had real flavor and most importantly TEXTURE. Now they taste bitter, slimy, gewy and are completely absent of texture. They stick to my teeth, are difficult to chew and swallow--gross! I tossed the bar into the trash after taking only one bite. Oh, and I noticed that you made them substantially smaller which in this case is a good thing because I can't imagine anyone choking their way through the entire bar anyway. I'm not sure who authorized this farce, I mean product change, and wonder if they actually tasted they product prior to forcing it out onto unwitting consumers like me. I thought that I'd finally found something delicious that I did not have to bake myself that would always be reliable and available for my family but I was wrong.  Choco Loco's now taste like most other allergy friendly snacks on the market today--Terrible. I am so unhappy that this product was changed and am returning them to the seller ASAP."<br /><br />Trust me on this one people, do not waste your money.
