Maybe you can call me a Ramen expert..<br /><br />I recommend this ramen if you want to experience a Japanese ramen. It will taste OK for a couple of times, but you will be easily fed up with it. The soup base is too weak and naive. Yea, Japanese ramen is good but what I mean by that is the real ramen you can get in Japan.<br /><br />As to instant ramens, Korean ones are much better.
