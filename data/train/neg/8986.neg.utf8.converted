A look at the seasoning ingredients and I thought I would love this mix-organic jalapeno, organic cilantro, organic lime juice, organic spices- it's full of things I love. However, when I received the mix and tasted it I was overwhelmed. I thought maybe it was just too concentrated so I also purchased a bag of the go raw naked seed mix and mixed them half and half. There's just something off about the flavor, it doesn't taste right. I have only eaten them by themselves however, so they might be okay if sprinkled on a salad, but definitely not something I could just snack on by themselves. I won't purchase them again.
