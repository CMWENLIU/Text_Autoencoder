Never having consumed dishwater I can only imagine that Oregon Chai is what it might taste like.  Having had superb chai at my local Indian restaurants, I assumed (wrongly) that I wouldn't be able to recreate the exquisite experience that is an awesome cup of chai.  I found my exquisite cup of chai by chance ... literally picking a brand at random (Third Street Chai -- -- beyond awesome).  Then I tried Tazo Chai -- -- very average.  Then I tried Oregon Chai... this is the weakest, most tasteless chai I've consumed thus far.  It literally almost tastes like nothing.  I can barely detect the spices that are common in chai nor can I even taste the black tea!  I'm surprised at the 5 star reviews for this product.  If the 5 star reviewers were bowled over by something this tasteless, Third Street Chai would rock their socks and send them into the stratosphere.  Try Third Street, folks... way better than Oregon Chai.
