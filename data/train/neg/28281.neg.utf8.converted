I love the concept of these tea bags (loose leaf tea, pretty mesh bags), but they don't deliver delicious tea flavor or any decisive bergamot. Every time I have them I am disappointed (& I have them a lot because they're carried where I work). I keep trying again, but there is barely any difference between the Mighty Leaf Earl Grey and their English Breakfast! The English Breakfast is more bitter, that's the only difference. This tea is mild... in every way. It tastes like neither tea nor Earl Grey to me.<br /><br />Better Earl Grey versions abound! Even Stash is more fulfilling. For a stark comparison though, I would recommend the Earl Greys by Revolution or Far Leaves. Those are how it should be.
