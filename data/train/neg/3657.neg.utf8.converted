I HAVE BEEN ORDERING THE LIPTON ICED GREEN TEA MANDARIN AND MANGO UNDER SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE FOR A LONG TIME.  AMAZON INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE.  I READ SOMEWHERE (MAYBE IN SOME REVIEWS) THAT LIPTON DISCONTINUED.  DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE.  AT ANY RATE, I DECIDED TO TRY THIS PRODUCT AND AM NOT VERY HAPPY.  FIRST OF ALL, UNLIKE THE MANDARIN AND MANGO PRODUCT, THIS ONE HAS SUGAR IN IT.  SECONDLY, IT JUST DOESN'T TASTE ANYTHING LIKE MANGO PINEAPPLE AND IS QUITE FRANKLY NOT VERY GOOD.
