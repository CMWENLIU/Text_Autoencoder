It would probable be good in chili, but it sucks mixed with instant rice.  There was a bitter after taste that lasted long after the meal, as well.  I'll try pre-washing the dust off, and rehydrating in a seperate pot, next time.  Part of the problem might be that the pepers were not cooked before dehydration.
