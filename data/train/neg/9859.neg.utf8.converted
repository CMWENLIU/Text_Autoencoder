I bought Kraft Sweet and Sour Sauce, and was completely disappointed with how it tasted.  I have never had a mouth full of toilet cleaner, but this is what I would imagine it tasting like.  Very strong chemical taste with a very gelatinous plastic-like texture, highlighted in a dull orange-brown.  I looked at the ingredients and the main ingredient is High Fructose Corn Syrup, a healthy dose of cornstarch, and some oleoresin paprika mixed in.  I found the taste to be so horrible, I threw the rest of the container away.  Yuck!
