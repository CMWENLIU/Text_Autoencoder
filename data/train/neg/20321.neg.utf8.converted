I tell people to stay away from MSG and nutrasweet because of the harm that it does the nervous system. Earlier this week, a patient told me that she found a soup stock that didn't have any msg in it. I asked her to bring it in this is what is included in the ingredients:  Hydrolyzed (corn and wheat gluten, soy) Proteins, and Yeast Extract.<br /><br />Sure they don't put Monosodium Glutamate in their concoction, but hydrolyzed proteins and yeast extracts contain high levels of free glutamates. This is the same stuff that can cause headaches, muscle contractions, chest pain, mood swings, and insomnia in many people. The Truth in Labeling people have been arguing about this for years.  If you look at the picture, there is a asterisk next to "No Added MSG*". In the fine print they say: "*Other than that which naturally occurs in the hydrolyzed proteins and yeast extract".  The truth is they put this crap in there to increase the glutamate content.<br /><br />So while I recommend that we all eliminate our intake of MSG, those of you that are already doing so, don't get duped by the labeling.<br /><br />For more information see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0929173309">In Bad Taste: The Msg Symptom Complex : How Monosodium Glutamate Is a Major Cause of Treatable and Preventable Illnesses, Such As Headaches, Asthma, Epilepsy, heart</a><br /><br />and: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0929173252">Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills</a><br />this review was originally posted on my website.
