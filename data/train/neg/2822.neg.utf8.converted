First and foremost, the curry is overwhelming!  You may as well be pouring curry powder into your mouth.  I wasn't able to taste the coconut or chocolate.  It had a very gritty texture and a STRONG curry smell.  It had so much curry that the inside wrapper was stained.  Oh well, I hope the bread and chocolate will be better.
