This should be called Sad Baby--it's awful. My baby absolutely hates it! I tasted a tiny bit<br />and it was bland to the point of gagging. Besides I assumed (wrongly obviously) that Stage 3<br />food--for babies 7+ months--would have some chunks of real food. Unfortunately, it's just glop,<br />and unfortunately, incredibly tasteless glop. I tried other flavors from this brand and they<br />were just as disgusting, my baby wont eat any of the flavors at all.
