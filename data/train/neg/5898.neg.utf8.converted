I bought this product as an alternative to other diet sodas (the "big two" will remain nameless) mainly because I wanted to get away from the aspartame artificial sweetener. I've heard "bad things" about aspartame but after doing my own research on it I couldn't find any conclusive research or studies proving it was as bad as people claimed. There are tons of sites that say all these bad things it does to you, but nobody can give me a single study proving any of what they say. I tend to think this thing against aspartame is more of a conspiracy then anything else.<br /><br />But regardless, I decided to lower my intake of aspartame and try this Zevia, since it's sweetened with Stevia. The taste is certainly lacking and while it doesn't taste horrible, when comparing it to the major players in the industry - it stinks. A very bland taste and there is very little carbonation.<br /><br />Did I mention it gave me horrible gas and bloating? You know the kind that sits with you all day long and just gives you an unsettled stomach? The reason for this is that it has a sugar alcohol in it called "erythritol" and if you know anything about sugar alcohols, they almost always give you an upset stomach, gas, and/bloating. Sugar alcohols are what those sugar free, low carb chocolates have in them. And while wikipedia states that this sugar alcohol "shouldn't" be as bad as the other more notorious ones, like xylitol, because none of it "supposedly" reaches the large intestine...let's just say I would disagree.<br /><br />If aspartame is so bad for you then why is that these products sweetened with stevia cause discomfort in some people? You'd think the "bad" product would be the one where you actually notice the side effects. At $1 a can (compare that to less then 30 cents a can for other cola brands), coupled with the potential unwanted discomfort, I think you might wanna stay away from this product.
