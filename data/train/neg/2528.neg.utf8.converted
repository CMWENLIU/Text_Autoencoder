There is a reason the ingredients aren't listed on Amazon.  These syrups are billed as natural (I accepted they were not organic).  I checked the Monin website before I purchased it, and they left off the FD&C Red #40 from the ingredients in the text.  Now that text is gone, and they have replaced it with an image of the label - AFTER I purchased this item.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU DO NOT BUY "FOODS" WITH ARTIFICIAL INGREDIENTS!  I BOUGHT THREE ITEMS AFTER CHECKING THE MONIN WEBSITE, AND THEY ALL HAVE ARTIFICIAL COLOR OR FLAVOR, OR BOTH!
