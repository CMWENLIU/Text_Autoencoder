I got a packet of this tea in a Tazo sampler pack, and was really excited to try it. I brewed up a mug of it and had a small sip. The sour orange tea immediately reminded me of these orange-flavored vitamins I used to take. I tried a few more sips trying to convince myself it wasn't that bad, but I finally poured it down the sink. I hardly ever do that, especially with a nicer tea like Tazo. I like almost all of their other tea, and I like other orange-flavored teas, and many other people seem to enjoy this tea judging from the reviews, but unfortunately it didn't work for me.
