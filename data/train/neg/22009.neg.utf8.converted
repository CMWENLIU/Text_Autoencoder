My order was delivered to my home in amazing time!!  I was expecting about 3-5 days for estimated delivery..nope, it was there in 2 days!  Too bad some of the candy rolls were broken, wrappers torn, and that was INSIDE the factory packaging.  If this was factory seconds, that would have been nice to know up front. Not sure I will order from  this company again.
