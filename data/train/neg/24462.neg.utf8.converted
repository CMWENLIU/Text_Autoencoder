When Nescafe discontinued their Iced Java coffee syrup, I went in search of an alternative. I bought a case of Coffee Time by Autocrat, because they said it was a "sweet coffee flavor." That sounds good, cause I like lots of sugar in my coffee. Well, Coffee Time was very disappointing. Barely any coffee flavor, and basically colored high fructose corn syrup. I bought a case of Eclipse, which their site said was a "more intense coffee flavor," but I defy anyone to tell the difference between the two products. (They're made at the same site, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same product in both containers.) Now I'm stuck with 12 bottles of a product that doesn't taste very good. I have to add chocolate syrup just to add some taste to it. Pretty disappointed, but oh well.
