I have very healthy 45 year old teeth and one bowl of this cereal was enough to break a large chuck off one of my teeth.  Be careful as I never expected to find gravel hard chunks in my bowl of breakfast cereal.  I am just sickened by it since I do take such pride in my teeth and to make matters worst its a front tooth!  If you don't like to chew gravel for breakfast then you likely won't enjoy this cereal.  Yeah it taste pretty good and may be healthy for you but not worth breaking your teeth over.  We won't even talk about denist bills.  Notice I am not the only review about broken teeth from this cereal.  The chunk broke off my tooth is at least the size of a average size pea so not just a tiny little salt grain.  If you like your teeth stay away from this cereal!  Ezekiel Almond Cereal
