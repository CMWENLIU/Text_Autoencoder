Unless you like OLD, outdated coffee, don't buy this.  Fourteen of the K-cups are already expired, some by THREE MONTHS.  The packaging was awful, all 35 K-cups just thrown into a way-too-large cardboard box, with what appears to be a PAPER TOWEL ROLL to help fill up the box.  It certainly isn't boxed as described.  Limited Edition Print it isn't.  I am furious and would return immediately, however, you cannot return food items.  This is just a way to unload OLD COFFEE.
