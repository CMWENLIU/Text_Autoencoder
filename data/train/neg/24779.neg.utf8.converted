I was very disappointed in the quality of the picture and frame.  I guess I thought I would get more for $25.  Paying $9 for shipping and handling I got it within two days which was great, but I would have preferred cheaper shipping for a few extra days of waiting; however, that wasn't an option that I could see anyway.  I wouldn't suggest this product unless you don't mind spending $25 and giving it to a kid that doesn't care about quality.  I was buying it for the grandma of my children for Christmas.
