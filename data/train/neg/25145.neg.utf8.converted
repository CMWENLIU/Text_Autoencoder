I tried this for my 6 month old, who had a bad reaction apparently to the raspberries, as he had been introduced to pears prior to that. My pediatrician chastised me and said that berries of any kind shouldn't be introducted to infants until they are at least a  year old. We love Earth's Best baby foods, but now I know to do extra research and not assume that just because the label says "6 months and up" doesn't make it okay!
