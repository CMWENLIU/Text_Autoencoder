I bought the 15 oz bag of Amport Foods Pine Nuts at Sams Club.  Although they taste good when you eat them, everything else taste like you have a mouthful of coins for about 3 days after you eat these nuts.  I ate just a handful of them and three days later I still had metal mouth. I returned these to Sams and told them they should drop this brand until they stop sourcing them from China/Asia.<br />The European, American, and Mexican pine nuts don't have this problem. Although these pine nuts are cheaper, they are not of value since they have this awful side effect.
