I bought these through another site. The picture of the bag composting was very convincing, but now that I've used them I can say that they don't compost per statement.  I have used these bags to collect food scraps to take over to my compost bin.  Over a year later they are still there.  I had my husband cut an opening of our compost bin thinking I could get some finished compost out on the very bottom. The plastic tears easier now but still in one piece, was thinking it wouldn't be identifiable.<br /><br />UPDATE I found info regarding "compostable" at plasticsindustry.org and here's a paragraph of what "compostable" means: "In order to breakdown, compostable bags must be sent to an industrial composting facility, not backyard piles or municipal composting centers. There are very few of these facilities in the U.S. and where these facilities are not available, compostable bags will sit in landfills because they<br />can't be recycled."  Shocking or what?!
