Laffy Taffys are the greatest candy ever made, and banana was the most convincing, most addictive Laffy Taffy flavor.  I've eaten them for over two decades, and during that time my life has been nothing but misery.<br /><br />They used to come in rectangular cubes.  Then the cubes got smaller, flatter, but the price went up.  Then they moved to candy bar-sized versions, again with a price hike.  There are currently two forms available: long, stringy sticks and tiny oblongs, about 30% of the candy that used to constitute a mouthful in the late 80s, when I started eating them.<br /><br />But banana's getting hard to find.  The company's big thing now is combining flavors, so that I'm afraid the divinely simple "banana" will be irretrievably replaced with that horrid miscegenation, "strawberry-banana."<br /><br />Aghgghghhh.  If only Mr. Wonka would get the bilious cancer!
