I eat a lot of raw cashews (mainly when I'm trying to diet) and thought I'd save myself some money by ordering these in bulk.  Unfortunately they were no good. I read the reviews on Amazon for this item and one person felt the same as I do but another review pawned the first dissapointed review off on the fact that of course raw cashews aren't as good as roasted ones. I'm here to tell you that I know what raw cashews taste like and these were no good!!
