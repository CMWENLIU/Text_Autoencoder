Well the big problem is that it grew mold.  I don't feel like I was overwatering it but mold still grew.  Before the mold grew my cat would throw up after eating it. That's more my cat's fault than an issue with the product I think.  She tends to over eat and I think she just ate too much grass too fast, if I let her eat for a few minutes and then put it away.  My other cat didn't have any interest in it.  I would maybe give it an extra half star if half stars were allowed.  The base is nice but the part that the seeds go in and the soil are not so great.
