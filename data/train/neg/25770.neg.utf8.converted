The plastic connector kept popping off my hose - I was completely soaked in less that 10 minutes. I had to keep crimping the hose and re-connecting, only for it to pop out of place again. When I turned the white dial to the "on" position, IT kept popping off as well allowing water to jet out everywhere. water with pesticide. all over me. not fun at all.<br /><br />cheap plastic parts all the way around that fail. I would never buy this product again
