This thing might be 5"-7" however the fact that its the size of a pencil round is beyond ridiculous. I spent $6 more on one for my larger dog and that was well worth the money, this little thing was worth about half I paid. Buyer beware, the photos shown are of their larger bones, they just use them with the smaller ones to make it seem like your getting your moneys worth!! There is no way a 40lb dog would get real use out of this, maybe a 5lb dog!! What a joke!!
