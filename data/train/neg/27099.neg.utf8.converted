I was happy to see that Amy's soups have reduced the sodium, BUT this stuff has as much sugar as a cup of chocolate milk, or even more... it's like eating tomato jam!! awful stuff.. Like most Amy's soups recipes, it has added sugar cane juice. Others have corn syrup... when my mom made soup, she never added sweetners to her soup.. Amy's soups is no different than the large brands.. high in sodium ( except for a few new recipes w/low sodium), and high in sugar...NO wonder our kids have diabetes, are overweight, and have high blood pressure. DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE SOUPS TO FEED TO KIDS. You are better off making your own soups and freezing them in containers.. tons of recipes online.
