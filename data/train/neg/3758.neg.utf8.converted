This is for one (1) yes 1 bottle of this nice product. I am very familiar with this product and knew I would like the actual product. When I reviewed possible sellers and saw this price I thought this must be for a case of the product based on the price. When I was unable to find any quantity in the description, I assumed (I understand I take some responsibility) based on the noted ($0.06 / oz) beside the price after a little basic math I would receive approximately 360 ounces. Instead I received one 17 ounce bottle!! Again using my basic math skills, I was able to calculate the approximate per ounce value to be closer to $1.27/oz. a far cry from the .06/oz noted in the description. Of course based on the "list price" of $58.52 it would be $3.44/oz (thankfully i did not pay list). I have learned a lesson to make sure I verify the actual quantity. Thankfully this was not a terribly expensive lesson and makes me smile as I eat my chicken wing knowing the sauce cost more than then chicken I'm putting it on. I just consider it "gourmet" wings and it makes me feel better.
