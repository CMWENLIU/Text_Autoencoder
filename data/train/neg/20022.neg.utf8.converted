This is written by the spouse of John. I was a frequent buyer of Ezekiel bread. I have probably purchased and consumed more than 300 loaves. I do not have celiac disease, but I do have gluten sensitivity and this bread worked for me for years. I was just going to start using it again after a 4-month elimination diet and discovered that it now has wheat gluten!! This is very disappointing. The only gluten free product by this company that I've tried (GF English Muffins) were awful. I tried one and threw away the package. It felt like a I swallowed a rock of goo. My gut hurt for a couple days and I ended up needing to do special remedies for acute constipation :( Additionally, their regular English muffins have barley malt, which I avoid because of my gluten sensitivity. Clearly this company has lowered their ingredient standards to cut costs and make their product more appealing to a larger market, which will not include me.<br />Disappointed.
