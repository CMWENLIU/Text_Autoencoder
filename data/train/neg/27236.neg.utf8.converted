The first few bites of these clusters were good, but I quickly grew bored of the taste.  It was too chocolaty, and within a day of opening the bag the product quickly became chewy, like it was stale.<br /><br />Although the shipment came with 4 bags, I ended up finishing only one.  Two were thrown away half-eaten, and the fourth was tossed altogether.
