It seemed easy enough to make. Basically just dump the little granules in a cup and add hot water. Stir to dissolve it. Then attempt to drink...<br /><br />Not sure what I was expecting. Maybe something like tea or like lemonade. It was neither. It was lemony, sure, but it was also really spicy. Like 'hot' spicy. A bit like drinking chili pepper water.<br /><br />Not my cup of tea, as it were. If you really like drinking spicy ginger, perhaps you'll like this. Guess I'm not much of a ginger fan...?<br /><br />For me, I'll stick with green tea or peppermint. This just didn't sit well with me.
