I bought this Xylichew Peppermint gum today at my local natural food store--never checked the price of $13.98--wish I did because I hate it. Flavor lasts about 10 seconds--kid you not. If you really want to try it see if it comes in a smaller size before committing to this container of 100. (What was I thinking when I bought it?)
