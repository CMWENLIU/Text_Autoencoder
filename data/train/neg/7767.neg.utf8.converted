Ordered these flowers for my wife for Valentine's Day nearly two weeks beforehand, only to have them cancel my order the weekend prior to V-Day.  Indicated that they were unable to fulfill the order at the price that I bought them at, even though they sent me confirmation that my order had been accepted and that my credit card was already charged.<br /><br />The other issue that happened is that their "cancellation email" was sent out in bulk, with my email address a part of close to 25-30 others - not sure why this wasn't handled individually or at least via bcc so that others wouldn't have my information.<br /><br />If this was indeed part of a pricing error, I don't have a problem with them cancelling the order, per Amazon's regulations for dealing with third-party vendors. I just think they handled this very poorly and ultimately aren't paying enough attention to details if so many customers were affected by this.<br /><br />Questionable business ethics - Buyer Beware!
