My girlfriend purchased this for me for valentines day. The plant arrived in good health and was packeged with precision. That however is not my issue. The tree if you can call it that does not look like a "bonsai" at all really. It has a very thin trunk, poor root structure, no nabari, and poor branch development. I also could find no data on "Fringe Flower" in my 7 bonsai books that I own. I would advise purchasing a Chinese Elm or Black Pine. I would not recommend to a friend.
