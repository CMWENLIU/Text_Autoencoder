I tried one and it was very difficult to make myself eat it, even with peanut butter on it. Tried another one the next day and they had already gone stale even though they were in a baggie. Opened another package and tried one more time to eat one but it still tasted like ground tree bark! I threw the rest of the packages away! What a waste of money.
