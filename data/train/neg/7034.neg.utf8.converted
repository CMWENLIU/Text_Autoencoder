I love carob powder and have bought it many times, both toasted and raw. It has a natural sweetness. This is the first time I've tried Bob's Red Mill carob powder.  I usually love their products, but this carob is bitter. Maybe they toasted it too long...? I like to mix carob powder with melted expeller pressed coconut oil to make homemade unsweetened carob bars. My bars are usually sweet enough without any added sweetener - but not with this stuff, unfortunately.
