This review is based on using these pods with a Nespresso Espresso machine.  Don't waste your money.  This coffee is not espresso.  It is a high priced 40ml cup of thin and weak drip coffee at best.  It does not have the body, it does not have the flavor, and it does not have the crema that will get from the Nespresso pods.
