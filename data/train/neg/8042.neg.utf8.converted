These were really awful. After reading the great reviews on the worthing vegetarian hot dogs and meat I was real hopeful, but they were just gross. We do love the morning star veggie dogs though. They taste a lot closer to the real thing. These veggie dogs were very mushy and just broke in half when I tried to take them out of the can. Very disappointing. We are a vegetarian family of 6 and no one would eat them.
