I had planned to present this flowering bonsai to the doctors and hospital staff who preformed and cared for me during a major surgery. When it arrived it was a wilted, brown and broken mess. Totally unpresentable. It appeared to me and to my wife (a master gardener) that the plant possibly had been subjected to freezing temperatures along with some rough handling. With dead blooms and brownish tone (lacking the rich green in the leaves) its future is very uncertain. I have a digital image of the plant as it looked upon arrival before it was to be transfered to the hospital and is available if a way to send. This is certainly not the quality I have come to expect of an Amazon product. Richard Wilson, Ph.D.
