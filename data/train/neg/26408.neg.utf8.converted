I ordered this product thinking it would be similar to the rock sugar I was using all over Germany this past winter.  They also sell it at Teavana but at an extremely high price compared to what I brought back from Germany (obviously there is a big expense on bringing sugar to the US).  I was excited to find these online and the picture looked like what I had brough back from Germany.  I'm not sure it was the same thing.  The crystals weren't the same color as the German rock sugar, it was cloudy in color and was more like pebbles vs. rocks.  The order took an entire 2 or 3 weeks to actually process and ship, come to find out, the place it shipped from was in my state.  I thought it was completely ridiculous how long it took and when it arrived it was poorly packaged.  It came in a white box (similar to a shirt box but a bit smaller) and the rocks were all falling out of it and pressed up against the box (between the it and the worn and dirty looking plastic wrapping that enclosed the box).  When I opened the plastic liner, the box was so flimpsy the sugar was going all over my counter despite how careful I was seeing how damaged the box was.  Never again.
