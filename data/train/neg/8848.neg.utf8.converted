A few months ago, bought from Amazon a 24-pack of these...they were called "avocado oil potato chips with sea salt". Ingredients were:potatoes, all-natural avocado oil, sea salt.  (3 grams protein)<br /><br />Today I bought from Amazon a 24-pack of potato chips called:" avocado oil potato chips Chilean lime".....ingredients are:potatoes,  all natural avocado oil,<br />Whey,<br />Salt,dextrose, sugar, maltodextrin,citric acid, malic acid, vinegar, parsley flakes<br />Buttermilk powder.  (Zero protein)<br />1) Many people have said positive things about ? Which product?<br />2)How can I buy just plain potato chips with avocado oil and sea salt? (brown label, same company)<br />3)So sorry that I can't say these most recent chips are just healthful, nourishing. And great! But they are't great:  so sorry:  Maltodextrin and dextrose are questionable, and add nothing to the original flavor.  Do you have influence to ask the manufacturer to remove dextrose and maltodextrin?  Thanks. Oh, the good old days! Just simple lime chips, no chemicals.  (I can just see the comments that malto...is "GRAS". Still not safe)..
