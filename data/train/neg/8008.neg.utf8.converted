Bottom of container is the recycling arrows in shape of triangle with a PS in the center.  From a website regarding food safety and plastics, it says this about PS...<br /><br />Styrene can leach from polystyrene plastic. Styrene is toxic<br />to the brain and nervous system among workers with longer-<br />term exposures,16,17 but also adversely affects red blood<br />cells, liver, kidneys and the stomach in animal studies.18<br /><br />I have been eating these noodles and really enjoying it and did notice that the sauce was leaching into the bowl after it "cooked".  I will think twice before I eat these again.
