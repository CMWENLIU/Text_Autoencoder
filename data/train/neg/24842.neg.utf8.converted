I had read about these noodles in Your Diet magazine and was intrigued.  I first called my local Whole Foods, but they didn't carry them.  I guess these are super-popular because the guy on the phone said that while they don't currently carry them, they plan to shortly because of the huge number of requests they had received.<br /><br />I placed my order and waited.  I worried that my perishible noodles were sitting somewhere rotting because it took FOREVER (over three weeks) for them to be delivered.  I finally got the box with 4 packets of noodles and a freezer dealy designed to keep them cool.<br /><br />I tried them the way the magazine recommended, heated in the microwave.  Uh, yuk.<br /><br />I'm not a big tofu lover to begin with.  The noodles were similar to really overcooked spaghetti.  Tasteless, with a really strange plasticy flavor to them.  I poured my beautiful homemade marinara on them, they turned into a watery mess.<br /><br />The heck with that.  I'm going for whole wheat noodles or protein enriched noodles.<br /><br />The product is as advertised, it just wasn't to my taste.
