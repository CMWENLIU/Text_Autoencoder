I want to make clear that this is the first time I have ever bothered to write a review for a product on Amazon, and I have saved this review for such a disaster.<br /><br />Since this is an extreme diet product, I was expecting it to not taste good, but in the least, I was expecting the flavor to at least remind me of what it was trying to resemble.<br /><br />I took a fingerful from the lid, put it in my mouth, and felt my eyes suddenly straining to focus on objects around me to escape the reality I was in. IT WAS AWFUL! I really thought I was going to throw up, and I was at work! Ack!<br /><br />Walden farms does make a decent blueberry fruit spread, and the chocolate sauce is so-so. This one should have never left the factory. I prefer adding a few calories to my gut with a lower calorie option than to ever eat this product again. Chemicals galore! Yuck!<br /><br />If part of your tongue got blown off in some bizarre accident, this product is for you, otherwise only buy it to prank your friends.
