I placed my order and the experience was terrible.I bought the flowers with Amazon because i thought they would help in case there was an issue and they didnt. The flowers were not on time,i had a lot of trouble because the order wasnt delivered the first time and Proflowers had to send new flowers again with an appology note.The flowers were great but the hole experience was awful and i really had a bad time tracking the flowers through all US. First the UPS guys didnt find the address i wrote which i doubled checked on google and it was correct, then the flowers were sent back to Proflowers because they didnt find the address. It was a complete stress week trying to track with UPS, Proflowers etc where the flowers were. Amazon simply does not help with anything, its better buying your stuff on the Proflowers page only if you have need to buy flowers buy Internet.<br /><br />I think Amazon should take certain kind of responsabilty when things go not so well with a seller. I bought at Amazon not at Proflowers... If i wanted to buy at Proflowers i could of done it but i trusted the Amazon page first. Watch out with the image your leaving with your customers because first we are Amazon customers.<br /><br />About Proflowers i had to enter to their web page and had to contact them through Skype, they obviously appologized but they were helpful.<br /><br />Would i recomend this seller, flowers etc? Only if you dont need to get the flowers on a ceratin date because the flowers are beatiful but the timing is not so good. You have to be ver patient.
