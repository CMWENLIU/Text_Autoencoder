I would check the sugar grams before you buy and be forewarned. This seems a healthy snack but of the 140 calories per serving, 117 are from sugar! (26 grams) The Cherries and all others like this are the same.<br /><br />When seeing the deal, I thought what a great healthy snack until I looked at the calories and breakdown that includes how much sugar.
