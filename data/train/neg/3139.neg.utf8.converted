Ever since I opened the newest bag of "Taste of the Wild," my dog has not wanted to eat it.  The pellets look much different than usual, and the food does not smell good.  My dog rejects it, and when he does eat a little, he looks very unhappy about it.  He has been vomiting multiple times per day since eating this new bag of food.  Through a process of elimination, I have come to the conclusion that this newest bag of food is making him sick.  Although my dog used to love this food, I have lost faith in the brand and will not be ordering any more.
