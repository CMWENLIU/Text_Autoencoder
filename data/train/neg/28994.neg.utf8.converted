You know when you open a bag of coffee how you stick your nose in there and I knew I was in trouble when it just smelled bad - a little bit like a dirty ashtray.  Despite the smell, I made a pot of coffee and the taste was just as bad as the smell.  I'm donating the unopened bags to a homeless shelter but I feel a little guilty subjecting anyone to this coffee.<br /><br />When I bought this coffee, I knew it wasn't going to be Kona or Blue Mountain but I didn't expect it to be this bad.
