Wow!  I did not know that someone could make a business selling food that tastes so bad!  No wonder these are called Raw Revolution... they taste revolting!!<br /><br />It seriously blows my mind that someone could make a food with chocolate and coconut that tastes so awful.  The first taste is poor, at best.  The mouth feel is grainy.  And the aftertaste... wow thats nasty.<br /><br />I ordered these b\c they were on sale and I wanted to try organic raw food.  Good thing that was a cheap lesson.  Learn from my mistake.  DONT BUY THIS!
