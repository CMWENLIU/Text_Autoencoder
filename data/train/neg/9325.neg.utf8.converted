First I'd like to say that this pepper oil has a GREAT flavor. It is the best ever for seasoning many dishes (including fried rice as noted by another reviewer). Also like that other reviewer all my local stores stopped carrying the product, even the ones that carry other House of Tsang products. So I decided to buy a case here. That was a bad move.<br /><br />Know that with this oil a little goes a long way. The case I got has a 'best by' date of January 2011. From when I received my product that was almost exactly six months. Now I can use a good amount of this oil pretty often, but as I said a little goes a long way. I'll probably use perhaps 2 bottles by the end of January. If I still use up another one, well by that time the rest may not last. Anyway that means I paid about $20 per bottle when shipping is added in. I just can't recommend ordering this product by case of twelve bottles if it only lasts six months.<br /><br />The best thing I can recommend is that since this is a great product, just hound a local grocery store manager into getting it back in stock or find sonewhere to buy single bottles.
