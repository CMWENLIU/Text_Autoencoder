Normally I enjoy a good green tea - I am aware that the nutritional value of these drinks is questionable but taste is relative.<br /><br />In this case I couldn't get past two things: the smell, passion fruit is not a pleasant scent to me, particularly artificial passion fruit. Second, I only got one sip of this stuff down. The aloe vera floaties & taste completely overides whatever sweeteners & artificial flavors they injected into this drink.<br /><br />Indeed it is kind of a slimy, gelantinous texture (the floaties are in perpetual suspension - there is NO settling to the bottom.!) with an odd funky flavor with an unfortunate after taste.<br /><br />I could not finish it nor can I recommend it.
