Ok, maybe I am a complete bleeding heart, but I put these all over my rooftop garden for an aphid/whitefly problem.  The next day, there were tons of sad little flies stuck all over these yellow sticky things.  Alive.  Alive and just stuck there.  None of the pesky things that were attacking my plants, just all of these flies buzzing while stuck to the tape.  Sad.  I did manage to get a few of them off and they flew off minus a couple of legs, but the product didn't do what it was supposed to do.
