<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5Q76">The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, Tea, Hand-Picked Tropical Passion, 20-Count Tins (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />Ahhhhh, the aroma of the tea in the tin is so very pleasing - strong and fruity - it truly does take you to a tropical paradise. I just knew that I was going to love this Passion tea. Maybe more than I love the Tazo Passion - but alas, No. I loved the Tazo Passion from first taste - fruity, just enough sweetness - the perfect warmth and flavor for my mid-day drink at work and on weekends at home to relax. Just a Tazo loose-leaf tea bag and hot water - no sugar needed, good to the last warm sip. I even always keep my tea bag in the cup and never get a bitter taste; just more good fruitiness. Can't do that with the Coffee Bean Passion. I knew about the possible bitter taste from reading the instructions on the can, so I was prepared to make the adjustment. I steeped the first cup for a short time, savored the aroma before my first sip, but all I got was bitterness. It left a bad taste in my mouth - maybe I steeped it too long. It was a few days before I attempted this Passion again. When I did I decided to time the steep - just 3 minutes and immediately remove the tea bag. It appeared strong, smelled great, but still the bitter taste. So I decided to get comfy and drink it anyway - maybe the taste will grow on me. No. I added some lemon and a touch of sugar to make it tolerable for my taste buds. Tolerable, but not my passion. I didn't pay much attention to the ingredients list before ordering: black tea, malva flower, marigold flower, natural and artificial flavorings - its a black tea blend - not an herbal infusion tea. Makes a big difference. I so wanted to like it, but for my taste and preferences - this tea has nothing on Tazo. I guess I was expecting something different. Its probably the black tea that my taste buds disapprove, as well as the artificial flavorings, I suspect. I have 3 tins of it and I'm probably going to drink it because I hate to waste food - but I do not look forward to it. May be good as an iced tea, with sugar and lemon. Or maybe one of my friends will like it - if so, I will gift the remaining tins with love. Sorry to disappoint - just not for me.
