Beings that I live in a remote area where there is NOT a lot of availability to this type of food or spices, I tried going with these mixes for my Indian dinner party.  I have been disappointed with pretty much every one I have tested.<br /><br />Instead of these Parampara mixes, try to find Shan mixes.  I am soooooo thankful to the Pakistani lady who turned me on to them.  They are perfect for recreating an authentic Indian/Pakistani meal.  Just like these Parampara mixes, all you do is add the meat and or vegetables, oil, etc. to the spice mix.  The complete directions are printed in english on the back of the box.  They have the perfect spice blend and heat.  I can only highly recommend the Shan: Chappli Kabab!  I grilled my patties out on the grill and served them with Naan, lettuce leaves, and a cool cucumber raita.  And Dal Curry for a side.  Mmmmm, totally yummy!
