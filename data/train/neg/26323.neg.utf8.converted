Well, I sure don't like the smell (peeuwww), and neither does Missy. But poor old Faidra licks at it until the big pieces get the better of her. Then she gives up too. Our three dogs finish it off (they clearly have no taste). I'll stick with some of the better smelling, smaller-pieced varieties of Friskies.
