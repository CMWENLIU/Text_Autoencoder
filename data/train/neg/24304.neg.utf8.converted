I love Hormel Compleats. They're all very convenient, since I can stash them in a cabinet in my office and not worry about remembering to bring something from home, or about it getting stolen from the communal refrigerator.<br /><br />I didn't care much for this... the dressing is pasty, gluey and has way too much celery for my taste. The gravy is too salty. The chicken breast is dry, stringy, and difficult to cut unless you remove it to a plate, which defeats the purpose of such a quick microwave meal.
