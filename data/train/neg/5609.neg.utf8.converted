Sadly I ended up discarding the unused tablets. Very weak flavor, I had to use 2 or 3 tablets for a glass of water. Also artificially 'sweetened' so be prepared to add some more sweetener of your choice. Not what they used to be, which is sad and strange considering the original recipe was a winner for decades! But someone had to improve it, and in the process destroyed a classic. Save your money, and treasured memories. Pass this one up.
