I have used the Gold Rush brand sourdough starter in the past with success. Since I couldn't locate any locally, I hoped to buy it on Amazon. But once you get it going, it keeps (and improves) as long as you keep "feeding" it. In other words, one packet will last for years. What would I do with the other 23 packets? Unless you're planning to go into the sourdough business, buying a case of 24 doesn't make sense.
