This pasta tastes great... BUT shame on them, people are confused with the word unused, digestable,protected whatever carbs and think it is the same as low or net carb... it is not low carb, people with diabetes are reacting badly to it... and people who are trying to lose weight on low carb diet are not losing.. it has the same count of carb like regular pasta...<br />me personally got bloated after eating it and gained weight.. read reviews about it on netrition.com<br />or any where.. if it is really low carb it won't be cheap, check the prices of any other low carb products.. even the products that are made sugar free (made with splenda and sugar alcohol) don't dare to call themselves low carb... UNLESS YOU SEE THE WORD NET CARB on anything it is not low carb.
