If organic truly matters to you the fact that tuna oil is added to this puree is truly offensive. The mercury levels in tuna are high enough that pregnant and nursing women are advised to avoid  certain amounts,  yet it is okay to add to a babies food?  And it is not specified as derived from organic or wild caught tuna.  This carries absolutely no logic and just goes to show what happens when a major food company attempts organic.  Garbage, complete and total garbage.
