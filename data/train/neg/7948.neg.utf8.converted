I agree with the assessment of the original reviewer and I believe that this is a heinous crime against Tic Tac lovers across the world. The second reviewer is obviously not a true fanatic and will bend to the will of the corporate America. We will not stand for pre-sucked Tic Tacs, no matter their supposed creed, white is NOT what they should start out as. This is an outrage, and I, for one, will not stand for it.<br /><br />PS.) Walmart does not carry mega Tic Tac packs and they suck(but not pre-suck), too.
