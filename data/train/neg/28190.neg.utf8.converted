This is terrible food. It tastes like chemicals... even the thick 'teriyaki' sauce they give you can't hide the noxious flavor. On top of that it is so grossly over packaged I actually felt bad trying to get to the food, yet on the back they say they're "saving the earth one bowl at a time". I looked for further information on this magical plastic bowl, but found none, and they invite you to donate 19 cents, but fail to mention their donations to this cause. Classic "green" company, all marketing, no substance and making more bad food for people to digest. I don't know about the other products, but the Teriyaki Bowl is awful. No debating that.
