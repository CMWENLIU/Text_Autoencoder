You can get this tea at any Asian food market for $5.00 or less!  The majority of the tea bags in the box I got had holes or tears in them.  I ended up using a tea infuser spoon but still ended up with lots of tea leaves floating in my cup.  If you wait long enough, the leaves do sink to the bottom, along with some other gritty particulate.  The tea itself is just okay, very weak.  You will not get a good second or third cup of tea from one bag like you would get from Prince of Peace Organic Oolong tea.  Spend a few cents more and get the Prince of Peace Organic Oolong tea.
