"Cookies are done baking!" Master Chef Greene exclaimed to an entire building of sweaty cubicle dwellers.  Master Chef, exhausted and sweaty, could have saved the trouble of this baking excursion had she only known that Quaker Oatmeal Raisin Breakfast Cookies could be heated in the microwave in only 10 seconds.<br /><br />Oh the labor that could have been saved!  If only she had shredded her all-from-scratch-homemade-double-oatmeal-raisin-and-walnut-cookie-recipe from her Grandma and instead bought the overpriced oatmeal and high fructose corn syrup infused cookies from Quaker!<br /><br />The gently wafting oatmeal aroma briefly distracted my nostrils from the overpowering musk of my overworked cube mates.  As I took a bite out of Master Chef's gooey creation my taste buds savored the wholesome goodness, but my stomach instinctively craved instead  the hollow taste of processed food.  All I could think about were Quaker Oatmeal Raisin Breakfast Cookies!  (Which, by the way, is always pronounced in the plural despite the fact that there is only one cookie per package.)<br /><br />These abominable Quaker Cookies ruined me for all other cookies.  Not because they are good, oh no, but because each one tastes slightly less bad than the last, creating an ever compounding craving for junk food.  Especially junk food that claims to be healthy, such as Quaker Oatmeal Raisin Breakfast Cookies.<br /><br />May Master Chef Greene save us all.
