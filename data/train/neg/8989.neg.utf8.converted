Many years ago a restaurant-owner said his secret to being able to serve such tender low-cost steak was the use of a tenderizer.  A tenderizer that worked like a charm came on the market shortly after that. You sprinkled it on the meat and blended it in with fork tines about thirty minutes before you cooked the meat.  Today's tenderizer (Adolph's) is supposed to work immediately by just sprinkling it on.  Not.  sorry.  Maybe it's the new cuts of meat with much less fat on, but it just doesn't work.
