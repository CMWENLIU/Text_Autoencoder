I've seen a lot of products on here and not only do I cringe but I criticize people when they complain about the taste of food for various reasons. I purchased this, solely for awesome, healthy, thick and colorful bowel movements. I wanted them, but wasn't getting them. So I ate this and in terms of flavor, any flavor, give me a snap crackle or pop, I received nothing. My tongue and body were analyzing it as if it were an alien. I thought, the solution was easy, grab some toppings and that should take care of the problem, right? So I put peanuts in the cereal, like an elephant, and the cereal was so strong in its stubborn ways-like kryptonite, it made the peanuts bland. So I said, ok fine, we're going to have to get the big guns here. I went out and purchased honey. The major religious books talk about milk and honey all the time, you can't get more sweeter and flavorful than honey. I put a significant amount of honey in my bowl and the forces were so strong with this one, it devoured the distinct flavor of honey like a fat kid devours a cake when left alone in a room. So, every time thereafter when I consumed cereal bowls of this product, it would be like a contest. I'd have a contest with myself. The contest would be, how fast and efficient can I be in consuming this with a spoon? And I'd set a record and the next day, when I'd eat it again, I'd try to beat that record-like a marathon. Training for the Olympics. Ten big spoonfuls one day, maybe nine or eight the next. And the thing is, I didn't notice any bowel improvement. I expected unicorns and vibrant rainbows to come out of my a** and it was like a wasteland just decimated with poverty, hopelessness and abandonment. I gave the cereal two stars instead of one because I presume this has some healthy benefits with the flaxseed and the whole grains and whatnot. If you don't believe me that's fine. Purchase this and bring a sword to the table. You're going to do battle with the dragon, my friend.
