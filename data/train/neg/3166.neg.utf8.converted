Am I using the same flour as everyone else? This stuff was a pain. The texture wasn't flourlike at all, it had huge clumps and the almond flour cookies I made (with an almond flour recipe) were HORRIBLE - grainy to the point that they would not even stay in a cookie shape, no matter how careful I was. Investigated after this and apparently Bob's Red Mill is known for this. I haven't really had issues with their other flours I've used (I'm on a gluten free diet like many people writing reviews for BRM products) so I think maybe they just don't grind the almonds fine enough? Not sure what exactly the issue is, but it is honestly unusable in recipes relying on lots of almond flour. Now I have 3 bags of it left and just mix a little in with other GF things I'm baking for a bit of added nutrition. If there's not too much in the flour mix, it doesn't affect the texture badly enough to ruin it, but you can still feel it a little. Blech. Who wants to buy a flour you have to grind fine yourself? I don't own a food processor, so it's not even an option for me. Might as well just make it myself at this price.
