I was considering a purchase to try this out after reading so many positive reviews and reading that it is also dairy and soy free, HOWEVER, I called my local Whole Foods to see if they carried this and was told they did and it was $5.69 per loaf.  This - - with S&H - - comes to $7.70 per loaf.  NOT A GOOD DEAL AMZ!<br /><br />WF also told me they carry Udi's Hamburger buns in a 4-pak for $4.69 per pk, again MUCH cheaper than AMZ's offerings.<br />NOT A GOOD DEAL AMZ!<br /><br />Why is it that any time there is a special need, it is used to justify outrageous prices, even on items thar are cheaper to make/produce than the regular ones - - like Tuna with just tuna, water or oil and salt @ $2.++ or more per can, as opposed to the nonsense with vegetable broth, etc. for a dollar or less per can?<br /><br />If we refuse to buy their products at these outrageous prices and let these venture niche products sit on the shelf, they might reconsider their outrageous prices.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049OQJXA">Udi's Gluten Free White Sandwich Bread (1 Case)</a><br /><br />(Are you listening AMZ????)
