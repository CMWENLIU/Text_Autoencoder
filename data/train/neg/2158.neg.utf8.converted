I was very disappointed with the pork cracklin's.  They were completely inedible, so hard they couldn't be broken much less chewed.  I have eaten bags of this product from other companies so I assumed these would be comparable.  Unfortunately I was wrong.  I attempted to contact the vendor, leaving several messages.  We still have the box with the product and would be happy to return it to the vendor for a refund.  I have shopped with Amazon for years and this has been my first unsatisfactory review.
