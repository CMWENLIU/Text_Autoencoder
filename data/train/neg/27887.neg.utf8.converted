I read all the reviews and was excited to get the coffee but after brewing my first few cups I must say this is not great coffee.  I love Peet's Major Dickason's and other more flavorfull well roasted coffee but the MM comes off heavy with charcoal, cardboard and a chunk of bitter without good aromatics or a complex pallate of flavors I enjoy in richer coffee.  I now have 46 more K-cups to work through.  Before you take the plunge and get a heap of the MM I highly reccomend a sampler pack, it may not be your favorite cup either.
