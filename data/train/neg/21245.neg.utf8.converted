"without any sulfites, preservatives, hydrogenated oils, artificial colors or flavors."<br /><br />...but not without a great deal of sugar and high-fructose corn sweetener. Like the previous reviewer I bought these at Costco. Brought them back due to the sickly-sweet taste. There was so much added sugar it was getting a little difficult to taste the berries.<br /><br />If you prefer berries au naturel or with just a little extra sweetness, watch the ingredient list on these. Sugar is the second ingredient by weight - and corn syrup is the fourth.
