I was disappointed in this sugar since I wanted larger pieces and the description left out the word, "fine". It was printed on the label, so it could have been included in the write-up. I had no idea that sanding sugar came in sized granules, so I couldn't use it for the dutch cookies I wanted to bake. Needless to say, I now have a product that I don't need or want, and I am hesitant to try to order more on line.
