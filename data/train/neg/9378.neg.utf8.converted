The vietnamese style coffee is kind of like cuban coffee, highly concentrated, roasted until it is like charcoal and served with sweetened condensed milk to cover up its foul taste. In addition to being absolutely terrible coffee for a coffee maker/traditional american cup of coffee the odor and taste of this coffee leads me to believe it is cut with CAROB which is a cheap filler. All in all I was highly disappointed with this terrible coffee and could not bring myself to finish the packages that I had, I would continually wind up throwing out the pot after a few cups and having to mix it with lots of milk to get a grey color out of it. (it's burned to hell just that bad.. I normally love STRONG coffee- but this is real garbage and it appears to have filler as well.).<br /><br />Avoid this junk, if you like dark strong coffee get Rainforest Hurricane Epresso instead or Dunkin Donuts original blend whole bean if you like a medium roast instead. This is terrible coffee made for a specific presentation, and that specific presentation is to cover up how horrible the coffee's quality and taste is. If you like the taste of burnt carob and a coffee that refuses to turn beige with milk.. this is your brand!!
