Let me preface to say I have had dire stomach issues since a small child.  Acid reflux corrodes my insides and often times I turn to Ginger-Ale when I can consume nothing else.  But, as we know, Ginger-Ale has lots of sugar, a load of sodium and a great deal of carbonation.  When I spotted, "Ginger Kili All Natural Ginger and Lemon Beverage" I thought I had found a wonderful solution.  My doctor had even suggested sucking on ginger lozenges that are at a available at health food stores.  I thought I had one-upped him with this product.<br /><br />Happily, I brewed the hot water just knowing that I would love the combination ginger, lemon and honey.  I am deeply fond of all those tastes.  I poured it into my cup of boiling water, allowed to cool a bit and drank a hearty sip.  Oh my goodness, I have never tasted anything so vile since that horrid cod-liver oil that still haunts my memories of childhood.  This is just awful.<br /><br />I will NOT be finishing the cup of Gold Kili nor will I ever buy another package.<br /><br />I hope others find it soothing.....I can't get that awful taste out of my mouth.
