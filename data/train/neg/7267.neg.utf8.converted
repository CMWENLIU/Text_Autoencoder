Eager to jump on the green tea bandwagon, Unilever has created this awful chemical concoction and is marketing it as a healthy drink. If there is green tea in here, I cannot taste it. The distinctive and delicate flavor of green tea is completely masked by sweeteners and additives. All I taste is sugar, making this no better for you than any other sugary drink in the supermarket beverage aisle. Green tea is naturally greenish-yellow and you should have to do nothing else to it except bottle it and sell it. If you have to put dyes and colors in here (caramel color, FD&C Yellow #5, Blue #1), you are doing something very wrong. Whatever health benefits you might obtain from drinking green tea is negated by all the HFCS, preservatives, artificial colors, and junk Lipton has put in here.<br /><br />From Lipton's website, the ingredients in here: Water, high fructose corn syrup, natural flavor, citric acid, sodium hexametaphosphate (to protect flavor), green tea, ascorbic acid (to protect flavor), phosphoric acid, potassium sorbate (preserves freshness), potassium cinnamate (preserves freshness), honey, calcium disodium edta (to protect flavor), caramel color, yellow 5, blue 1. Ingredients are listed in order of most to least. "Green tea" isn't until the 6th item into the list. Why 2 food colorants in here? Because blue and yellow make green, like we were taught in nursery school. The "green" in this green tea is from chemicals, not natural pigments present in the tea.<br /><br />Green tea is naturally beneficial for you and should be incorporated into a daily lifestyle (improves cardiovascular health, fights cancer), but not this product. Do not be fooled by bottle's health claims or pretty green design. There are no less than 4 artificial preservatives in here and you are getting little more than colored sugary water. It also contains no fruit juice (as written on the label), so the citrus flavor is derived from something other than lemons and limes.<br /><br />In tea drinking cultures, green tea is almost always served unsweetened, either hot or cold. It has 0 calories and is loaded with Vitamin C. If you want to enjoy a truly healthy green tea, you can easily brew your own and refrigerate. You can sweeten with honey as desired. A wonderful brand available at Costco and Amazon is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WB1YSE">Kirkland Signature Ito En Matcha Blend (Green Tea), 100% Japanese Green Tea Leaves, 100 Tea Bags</a>. Shoppers living near Asian stores will find boxes of bagged and loose leaf green teas for approx $2-10 depending on the size and quality.<br /><br />Avoid this tea. It's just bad, unless all you want is an overly-sweet beverage to quench your thirst. But even then there are better all-natural alternatives, like Arizona Ice Tea and Snapple.
