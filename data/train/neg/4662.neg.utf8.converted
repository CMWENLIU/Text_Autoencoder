I ordered three 12-packs so there were three shipping package for my order. The first two 12 packs came ontime as expected. However, one of the bottom have mole growing out of it so it have to be thrown away.<br /><br />The third product made it to my city and then return to the supply. Then it was reship to me next day (free of charge from Amazon). However, I only received 8 packs instead of the 12 packs.<br /><br />The product quality is pretty lousy compared to other coconut juice products I tried. I figure that I give this one a try. It look like somebody went through and open up all the box which made me afraid to drink it sometimes.<br /><br />The taste really do not taste like real coconut. I expect more from 100% coconut. It was pretty cheap to begin with but I think that I would go with other products.
