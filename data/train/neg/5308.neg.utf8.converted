I ordered the "All Natural Coconut Juice with pulp" & found it rather disappointing...The water<br />taste a bit stale & the hard chunks of coconut are a big turn off ..I thought that the can would have soft jelly... I know about coconuts & the correct taste, because I grew up with many coconut trees....I was expecting much more....<br />I read the reviews & liked what I read...<br /><br />Another problem all the cans have dents in them<br />that could be the fault of the delivery service.<br /> or distribution center....<br /><br />I also paid for "NEXT DAY" delivery and item was<br />delivered in 2 days...(2 days is FREE!)<br /><br />I will not be re-ordering this product...
