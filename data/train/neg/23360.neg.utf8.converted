This is an odd product. I had used the Splenda Individual Packets before and liked them ok (as much as one can like sweeteners in the first place). Then I decided to buy this bulk bag because I got a bit tired of opening up several small packets when needing a bigger amount of Splenda. Much to my surprise it seems as if the Splenda in the bulk bag is significantly less sweet than the product in the individual packets. When using it in a cup of tea, two packets of Splenda used to be plenty but not with the bulk bag. It requires at least three heaped teaspoons to sufficiently sweeten my tea, sometimes even more. What's more, when adding this Splenda to hot drinks it really fizzles, almost as if adding something carbonated. I never noticed this happening with the packeted Splenda and find this quite strange.<br /><br />Also, ever since I switched to the bulk bag Splenda, I have experienced relatively frequent digestive upset, something I never had with the packets. I am not too fond of this stuff and will not buy it again.
