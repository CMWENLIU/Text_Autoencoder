I place  order two times. First order, honey was leaking everywhere in the box. They are going to replacement. Yesterday I got second order, box was broken and honey was leaking again. I order 12 bottles (it was heavy) , but they use thin box and packed too poor. I like the honey, but packing was too poor.
