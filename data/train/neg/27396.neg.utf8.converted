The 1st time with these treats, my experience was fine. My yorkie is amazingly picky about his food/treats, so I'm always thrilled when he likes anything.  He loved these treats! Just bought another bag and gave some to him over the past few days and noticed he'd hack after eating one. I figured they were dry Bc he never did this before. I was going to give him one this morning before our walk when I noticed coarse,  long hairs all crammed into the marrow!! I pulled 2 strands out of one marrow and examined them. They were thick, light brown/Blonde and about 1/4 in long. No wonder my poor dog was hacking! He just had a mouthful of hair! I checked more of them & found more hair. I contacted Pedigree and am no longer buying their products. It was disgusting.  Save your dog's stomach and spend a few extra bucks on something that's actually quality treats for your dog(s) and more nutritious and wholesome .... not chock full of hairs!<br /><br />(The only reason for having 2 stars is due to my dog loving them so much...!)
