Like others have commented, Amazon has done a really poor job with the packaging on these.  The 12-pack ships from Missouri, and I'm not sure what kind of storage facilities Amazon or UPS has, but the bars are completed melted by the time you receive them, which is very disappointing.  When Amazon used to carry the sesame-peanut-chocolate in the 8-pack, the biggest complaint was that those bars were too tough to chew.  Now they're just mushy.  Bring back the tough bars!
