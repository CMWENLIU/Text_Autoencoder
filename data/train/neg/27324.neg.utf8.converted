Good brand name, sounded good to me, my finicky, fish-lovin indoor hyperthyroid male cat & my young male outdoor cat won't touch it.  I have no idea why.  It has a paste like consistency, does not have strong smell (maybe that is the problem).  I try very hard to feed them grain free, better quality foods.  This seemed like a no brainer -- now I am stuck with many cans of expensive cat food, guess I will donate to the pet shelter.  Percy, the finicky one does like Weruva Mediterranean Harvest alot (consistency like real tuna), it is a good brand. Hopes this helps --
