Beware of the label warning about possible digestive tract problems!  I have a pretty strong system, but an hour after eating three pieces, everything breaks loose!  I love twizzlers and thought these would be great for my blood sugar control - but the trips to the bathroom are not worth it!  DEFFINITELY BEWARE!
