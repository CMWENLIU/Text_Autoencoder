I have been a huge fan of Maille Dijon Mustard for years -- it was the ONLY brand I'd buy, even though it was not cheap.  Well, I replaced my last bottle with another, which appeared to be the same label, size, product, and said "Maille Dijon Originale" on the label.  What I didn't notice was the word "Hot", in small letters, sideways, on the right hand edge of the label.  It blew my sinuses out!!!<br /><br />I am not a fan of hot mustard, and this product was inedible to me.  I mostly use the mustard mixed 50/50 with good apricot jam (no HFCS) as a marinade for pork tenderloin, with part being reduced to half for a nice sauce for the meat.  This product is now useless to make that recipe.<br /><br />I have searched EVERY local market, and every one of them carries Maille, and every jar says "Hot" on the edge of the label.  If you are looking for a mild Dijon mustard for a specific recipe, this product is to be avoided!  Such a shame, such a shame . . .
