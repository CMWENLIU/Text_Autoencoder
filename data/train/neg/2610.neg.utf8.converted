I recently restocked my supply to discover a banner on the box announcing a change in flavor. Bleagh! The once addictive spearmint Altoids taste like a cut-rate wintergreen. Did I say bleagh? Bleagh!<br /><br />I'd hate to see nearly three decades of Altoids pleasure come to an end, but these are just plain lousy, now.
