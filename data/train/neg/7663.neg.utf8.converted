The older Haribo red licorice wheels were wonderfully flavored and had a great texture.  The current wheels have no flavor and are impossible to eat because of the waxy and slimy feel.  I bought two bags of them and ended up throwing all of them away!!<br />DO NOT waste your hard-earned money on these!
