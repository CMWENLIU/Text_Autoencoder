I don't know what the other reviewers prepared as a filler for their tarts -- clearly one can hide their taste (petroleum and preservatives) with something rich and robust -- but why try.  You get what you pay for, and with this item, you get something akin to cardboard.  I'm sure that their shell life (atomic half life) is somewhere around 200 years, so if we ever have to back to stocking fall-out shelters, this is the item you'll be looking for.<br /><br />I purchased a case to try out in preparation for a catering I was planning, and handed a cup to my girlfriend who is a non-chef.  Her first comment on the taste was "petroluem."  On the plus side, I can't imagine these cups every springing a leak or getting soggy.  In fact, I can't imagine that my body could digest them once swollowed.  Save your money and order unbaked pastry cups shipped overnight on dry ice by Dufour Pastry Kitchens in the Bronx.  They have a wide variety -- including blue corn, and they are not only digestable, but taste good.
