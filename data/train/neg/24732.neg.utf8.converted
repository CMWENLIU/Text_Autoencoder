This cinnamon powder was listed with other Ceylon cinnamon(but it was not). They did have Frontier Ceylon cinnamon so I sent this product back and Amazon refunded my purchase. I then purchased the Frontier ceylon cinnamon and it lived up to what I heard about it(great flavor and much better for you), it is more expensive though.<br /><br />BUT: The fact that took this first order back made it OK. I said I thought it was misrepresented and Amazon even refunded my shipping cost.
