As a true bacon lover I looked forward to this with taste-buds a-tingling only to be disappointed. The bacon flavoring apparently comes from a lab in New Jersey. Has a heavy chemical taste, and especially after-taste. As a party favor or gag gift it's fine, but if you're really looking for something to add pizzazz to your food, just make it yourself or hope some other company comes up with a better tasting version.
