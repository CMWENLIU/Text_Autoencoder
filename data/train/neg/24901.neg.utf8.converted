If I realized there was no Stevia in this product I wouldn't have bought it.  Instead it's Xylitol (derived from the bark of the birch tree).  The product lists Stevia Rebaudiana Bertoni as the first ingredient but the boxes I received do not list it. Very disappointed.  Also I bought Orange and Cherry - Cherry is on the sour side.  Orange tastes ok.  However Xylitol doesn't agree with me.  Oh and it doesn't dissolve all that great either.
