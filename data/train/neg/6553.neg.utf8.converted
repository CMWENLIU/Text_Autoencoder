My cat loves this, and from what I've read, it's pretty high quality. At the same time, it has a very strong smell to it. We walked into the kitchen after buying it, saying, "What is that smell?" It smells distinctly fishy, like someone left out tuna or something. If it was a faint smell, I wouldn't care, but this is a bit much. Our house already smells too much from her litter box. We don't plan on buying this again.
