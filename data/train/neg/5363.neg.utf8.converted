I raved about Kopi after my first tasting last year. It was smooth and rich with a wonderful caramel finish I had never experienced before. Since then I have had five other batches from two different vendors. Each of these later coffees were very disappointing. One vendor even sent a replacement bag (worth $80) after I gave a negative review to "renew your faith in Kopi". But I have never had a Kopi Luwak as good as that first one. When I am going to spend this amount of money on coffee, or anything else for that matter, I'm going to need to know I am getting consistent quality of product and that is definitely not the case here. I just received a 100 gram bag as a gift from a friend and it was the most disappointing of all. I get better Sumatran coffee from my local roaster for $12 lb. I'm glad to say I've had the experience of trying the most expensive coffee in the world, but I won't be buying any more.
