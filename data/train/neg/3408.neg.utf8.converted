I am writing this review fully acknowledging that tastes are matters of personal preference, whether in music or in food. That being said, I have to come out and say I just don't like these cashews, which are practically encrusted with salt and pepper.<br /><br />In our family we don't salt and pepper our food liberally, so maybe my wife and I were particularly sensitive to the salt-and-pepper blast of these cashews. Again, it's a matter of taste: if you love salt and pepper, you might like these.<br /><br />To write a fair review, I decided to wash the seasonings off the cashews under tap water to taste the bare nut underneath. I was surprised to find that the salt and pepper didn't just rinse off. Something was making it adhere to the cashews. So I soaked and rinsed and rubbed with my fingers a little more and finally got all the seasoning off the 5 or 6 cashews I had in my hand.<br /><br />Once I got all the seasoning off (or so I thought), I noticed something else that surprised me: the cashews were still greasy. This wasn't intended to be a whole-day affair, so I just popped two in my mouth. The first thing I noticed was that the cashew retained a slightly crisp, roasted character even after the drenching. That was the good news. Then I dropped the remaining cashews in my mouth, and a few seconds later came the bad news: I started tasting that pesky little prickly pepper picked for palate pop, poking its way through an otherwise tasty though plain roasted cashew.<br /><br />If you'd like a simpler review, my wife, a no-nonsense woman, ate just a couple and said, "I hate these. Do they have those Emerald almonds with the cocoa back in stock yet?"
