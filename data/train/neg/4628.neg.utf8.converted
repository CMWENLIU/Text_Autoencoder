My bad - I got sucked in by the Chef Michael name. I know he is a famous chef so I thought he would have the integrity to only sell his name to a high quality product line. After reading the ingredient list I'm not so sure. Too much soy, not enough protein. Plus all the low quality by-products in it, I'm not going to let my dog eat anymore. Sure my dog loved it but I love him too much to feed him garbage.
