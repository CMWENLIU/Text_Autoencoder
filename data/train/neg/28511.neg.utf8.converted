We have had these wonderful caramels from other sources and they were great.<br />These came smelling old-putred....we think from the butter turning old. There was a grease or something all over the packaging. So bad we had to throw away...not even usable in a sauce.<br />Save your money!!!!!!!<br />We buy LOTS of things from Amazon. Almost everything is great. But shame on them for selling this garbage. Hope they post this so we can help fellow users avoid rancid product.
