Yes, these sugar free Werther's do taste great.  I was ready to stock up on many boxes of the cute little candies that are only 8 calories a piece! It amazed me how sweet they tasted.  I ate 5 pieces yesterday. I had bad cramps and gas yesterday for about 12 hours but did not realize it was the candy.  Today I ate 5 more pieces... more cramps within an hour of indulging. Yikes!  Not worth it, even for a sugar addict like me.
