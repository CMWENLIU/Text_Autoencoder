I ordered this olive oil as part of my eating healthy initiative.  I just received this product and have not had a chance to taste it yet.  However, any potential buyers should be aware that this olive oil is packaged in a #1 PET plastic bottle.  There are studies that suggest that endocrine-disrupting chemicals may leach out of PET plastic, particularly over time in the container.  See Wiki article:<br />search 'wiki Polyethylene terephthalate',<br />and this:<br />search 'Polyethylene Terephthalate May Yield Endocrine Disruptors' for details.<br /><br />While an effect from leached chemicals is not proven, the plastic container would have stopped me from buying this olive oil, had I known it was not packaged in glass.<br />I will addend the review when I have had a chance to taste this oil, but my initial sense is that the 'Baja' in Baja Precious may more accurately translate as 'sick leave' rather than the presumably intended 'drop in price'.
