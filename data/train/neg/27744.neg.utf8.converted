I was looking forward to giving this made-in-the-USA treat to the little person who shares her home with me.  There are few ingredients in the formula, which, I believe, as with human food, make for a better product.  They even smell good.  I have heard great things about how kitties love this treat, and I looked it up on Amazon to find rave reviews.  As she loves all things chicken, I tried this flavor for her.  Unfortunately, she turned her nose up at it.<br /><br />I thought, maybe it's just not what she's used to and she needs to acquire a taste, so I added one to her dry food.  Less than one hour later, she threw up her entire breakfast.  This is the first time ever, since she has owned me, that she has thrown up anything, and I don't think it's a coincidence.  There are unusual ingredients in this formula, such as green tea and rosemary oil.  I believe she was trying to tell me she had some sort of a sensitivity or allergy to something in the formula.  I just wasn't listening.<br /><br />I hate to give a bad review to something so many other kitties are crazy for, but just be aware that there is a (probably small) percentage of kitties out there with whom these ingredients just don't agree.
