A few months ago a friend turned me on to a bag of the Mariani Phillipine Mango & I had been hooked! I was excited when I saw that Amazon sold it in bulk, when the order arrived & I opened a bag, I was so disappointed. The variety Amazon carries is the "Mariani Thailand Mango" and the one I went crazy for was the "Mariani Phillipine Mango" there was a HUGE difference in taste & texture. Now I'll have to see who wants the 11 unopened bags I have :(  At least I can buy the ones I like at my local Jewel Food Store.
