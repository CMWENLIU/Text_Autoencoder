A few weeks ago I bought two boxes of packaged chestnut product from Costco (don't remember the brand). That was the first time I bought pre-packaged chestnut. It was peeled, perfectly cooked, and delicious!! Unfortunately they were no longer in stock when I went back and tried to purchased it again. So I went online and found this product on amazon.<br /><br />I signed up for subscribe-and-save, and I figured I would have a long term relationship with this product. Shipping was prompt and the package arrived in good condition. I tore open a bag and was eager to give myself a treat. Then I saw them, the dark (nearly black), soggy, soft chestnuts half-naked hidden inside the mushy shells. I was thinking to myself, hmm, this doesn't look like something delicious. Reluctantly I peeled one chestnut and put it into my mouth. It was stale, soggy, and a little bit sweet, far from what I had expected. I decided to give it a second chance and put the second one in my mouth. It was even worse. It was rotten and had a terrible bitter taste. I quickly spit it out and realized I made a big mistake.<br /><br />I was going to give this product only one star. But realizing I had a very high expectation which may affect my objectivity, I'm giving it two stars in the spirit of being fair. In any case, I do NOT recommend this product. There're far better products out there, like the one sold in Costco.
