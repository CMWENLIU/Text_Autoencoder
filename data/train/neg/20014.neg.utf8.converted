I ordered this product and what I received was not the item pictured. Instead I received the almonds in a ZIP LOC bag and is apparent that it is not professionally packaged. Looks like someone had some almonds and threw them in a ZIP LOC bag and sent them to me. I have tried to contact the seller with zero results. I left negitive feedback as well. I want the item pictured not a ZIP LOC bag from who knows where.  Stay away from this company.
