Given the great reviews for these, I took the chance and ordered some.  I love sour fruit snacks and so do my three kids so I was excited to get these.  As it turns out, they are way too sour for everyone.  Even my son who loves sour candies wouldn't eat these.  If you'd prefer to have a more natural, real-fruit tasting snack then I'd look somewhere else.
