I thought I would send these to my mum for her birthday.  First of all, they arrived 2 days late.  In fact they took 8 DAYS from order to delivery, which I thought was quite long! so beware!!  Secondly,  the roses arrived closed and quite limp.  My mother put them in a vase but to no avail.  By the 2nd/3rd day they started turning black and never opened at all.  She said they were the worst bouquet of roses shes ever had.
