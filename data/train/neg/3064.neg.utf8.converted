I am a big fan of Dave's Gourmet sauces and condiments, but not this one.  If I was just rating it as a mustard alone I would give it 3 stars for taste, 1 for value.  There are much better, brighter and fresher tasting mustards available at half the cost of this one.<br /><br />However, this is a Dave's Gourmet product and as such I am looking for not just a good mustard but but one that makes a good use of a variety of heat producing, tongue scorching peppers, like Serrano or maybe even Habanero.  What we get instead is a mediocre Dijon-style mustard spiced up with "hot pepper extract".  This is a commercial additive of pure (or close to pure) capsicum, which is used for riot control and to add heat to an otherwise bland product.  In my humble opinion hot pepper extract adds "hotness" without adding to the flavor.  Dave's has some great products, I just don't think that this is one of them.
