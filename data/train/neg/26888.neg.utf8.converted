The worst thing is that they do not list the fact this is a 70% Robusto / 30% Arabica blend.<br />I do not like Robusto coffee at all. It has the taste of smelly socks. This is personal preference.<br />Since this coffee did NOT list that it is a Robusto blend and had such great reviews from many people (who obviously like Robusto coffee) I purchased it. I am dissatisfied with it and the item is not what I expected.<br />Since I was not able to return it, I opened one package.<br />Just for people to be aware.
