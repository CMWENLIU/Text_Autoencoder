After watching the documentary (Candyman) I really wanted to like these. I waited until they showed up on Amazon and promptly ordered a box.<br /><br />They shipped quickly, and arrived well packaged. A few of the beans spilled over into other sections, but that was easily remedied.<br /><br />I couldn't wait so I started right away. The box smells like scratch and sniff stickers, or those smelly markers, which honestly surprised me because of their commitment to natural flavorings. Very off putting.<br /><br />Here goes:<br /><br />Texture: I don't know if it's just a personal thing, but the textures are all off. A few are a little chalky, while the rest are way to soft. They stick to your teeth way too much. Somehow they are grainy also. Again, I'm used to the chewy texture of Jelly Bellies...<br /><br />Flavors:<br /><br />The fruity flavors have a weird salt flavor. Almost like energy gel or the Jelly Belly Sport beans. It's a little strange...<br /><br />Bacon: I tried. I couldn't finish it. It tastes like a cup of sugar with a fat piece of bacon in it. Good if you like your bacon drowned in sugar.<br /><br />Black Cherry: It tastes like sugar and not much else. I tried it several times to see if I had gotten a dud, but they don't taste like anything...none of them.<br /><br />Blueberry: It tastes way too salty with some granola overtones and a sour finish...weird, but not so bad.<br /><br />Coconut: If it weren't for the texture this would be awesome. Great coconut flavor.<br /><br />Cranberry: It almost tastes like sour raisins...weird. It has a cranberry juice aftertaste...I really wanted this one to be awesome.<br /><br />Ginger: Awesome. Awesome...very strong ginger flavor.<br /><br />Grape: So salty...almost a little like grape, but it really tastes way too salty with some chemically background flavors. Not good.<br /><br />Green Apple: So bad...it tastes nothing like apple at all. So bad.<br /><br />Himalayan Sea Salt: Really weird, salty, but also off puttingly sweet.<br /><br />Lemon: Tastes like lemon Pledge.<br /><br />Orange Punch: Totally Sunkist. Awesome.<br /><br />Peach: It totally tastes like Peach rings. If you eat it quickly to avoid the chemical smell, this is totally one of the best flavors. Eat it quickly though.<br /><br />Pomegranate: Tastes more like Cherry, but it isn't too bad. Doesn't taste like Pomegranate though.<br /><br />Root Beer: The best flavor. Without a doubt.<br /><br />Strawberry: One of the best. Not bad.<br /><br />Vanilla: Tastes like vanilla bean. Kind of like melted vanilla ice cream.<br /><br />If it weren't for the inconsistent textures, the chemical smell, and the bad fruit flavors these could be good. Which is really a shame since the fruit flavors are usually my favorite jelly bean flavors. Personally, for now, I'm sticking with Jelly Bellies. Dang.
