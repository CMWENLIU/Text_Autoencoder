They're delicious, but after I ate a few handsful, a couple hours later I started to feel really sick.  I spent the whole rest of the day suffering painful gastrointestinal distress.  I believe this is an occasional side-effect of the sugar substitute (branded Lycasin(tm)).  If you don't have a problem with Lycasin, go right ahead and munch away.  If you don't know, I'd try them in small quantities first to make sure they don't cause you any problems.
