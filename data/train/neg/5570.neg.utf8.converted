This kit saves you the time of making your own, but at three times the cost.  Anyone can buy bulk planting sponges or rock wool and make their own for a couple dollars.  However, if you don't care about the price and want to make Aero Garden planting fast, easy, and thoughtless, then this is made for you.  The kit is great, just uncomfortably priced for what you get.
