I have been eating Larabar bars for years and love Pecan Pie bars. A few days ago I received a box from a warehouse in Kentucky. The box had oil spots on it and when I opened a bar, there was a strange odor, almost like fermentation. I ate it because I had no lunch with me at work, but now I have 15 more bars that I will not eat. I think the temperature at the warehouse was too hot. I've never had this problem before.
