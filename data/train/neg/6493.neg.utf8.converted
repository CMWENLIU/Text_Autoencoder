This product is an absolute disgrace, and how the company has the gall to call it an infused truffle oil is beyond me.  For a start, this comes in a tin, which is never a good start, and the quality of the oil used for this is appalling.  I believe it is grapeseed oil - given truffle oil is intended as a finishing, and not a cooking oil, any decent cook knows that an almost colorless, high heat oil with almost no flavor intended for cooking is a completely inappropriate choice as the base for an infused oil intended to be served cold.  The end product is pale, tasteless and almost without any aroma, let alone that of truffles.  The presentation in a tin is unattractive and also lends the oil a somewhat metallic taint...just a generally awful product.  I guess they realize that the product looks so bad that if they put it in glass they'd never sell any of it.  The only conceivable advantage of this being a cooking oil would seem to be that you might be able to burn off some of the dreadful chemical taint.<br /><br />There are numerous reviews commenting (appropriately) on the 'truffle aroma' listed in the ingredients....what an absolute crock!  This isn't an ingredient, unless it refers to the fact that a white truffle was waved somewhere in a 5 mile vicinity of the vat of oil, and there is a remote chance that some of it may have floated past. I would also say that any company that sells the number of apparently different infused oils that this company does, is hardly likely to be interested in ensuring the veracity of any one product.  If I could hazard a guess I imagine they all taste very similar, and are all created from the same dreadful base oil.<br /><br />We use truffle oil to finish dishes like risotto and scrambled eggs, so I am looking for something that is infused into a good quality base oil, with nice color, and has an aroma that even if it is not naturally derived (one review suggests truffle flavor never is), it certainly smells like it.  I don't think you can go past the Bartolini brand (available on this site).  It uses extra virgin olive oil as a base, has a small piece of truffle visible in the bottle, which certainly smells like truffle, and it looks and smells great on food, which surely is the point. My advice, avoid the Tourangelle at all costs and give the Bartolini a try instead.
