We purchased Lupini Beans on Amazon.  The company is Parthenon Foods.  When we received the item we opened the first jar, the beans were incredibly bitter, so we opened the 2nd jar, same thing.  We poured out the beans and some of them were black. Contacted Parthenon Foods and this was their response:<br /><br />Hello,  We are sorry, but we cannot honor a return or refund for this order.  The order was delivered as scheduled by the shipping service selected.  The product(s) shipped were as advertised.  Please read our shipping and returns policies for more information. "You cannot return items that you do not like in taste or package shape"<br /><br />How convenient for them!!  The beans are bitter and bad.  I will NEVER order from this company again and I hope that all that read this review be careful in ordering any product from them.  I order many food items online and have never had a problem.  It is not that we didn't like the taste, the beans are bad, I grew up on Lupini Beans and have ordered other brands online and not had a problem.  So to Parthenon Foods, guess that was an easy $20.00 for you!!  So to the buyer beware, it may look good online, but you're taking a huge risk on when the product arrives!!
