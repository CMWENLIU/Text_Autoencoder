You would think such a large brand should be trusted; that they made money by making a healthy product for dogs. Well, let me not even say what effects this dog food had on my dog--let me just show the beginning of the ingredients list from the [...] website as of the date of this review (Check there yourself if you don't trust me):<br /><br />Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, sorbitol<br /><br />Corn and corn gluten and rice flour are not exactly wonderful, but--SUGAR and SORBITOL! Sorbitol, that nasty stuff in gum that gives people gas and loose stools! Can you wonder why your dog stinks up the house if it's eating this crap? And sugar! Need I even say why that is bad, or what health problems that can lead to? My vet sure got on a soapbox over the dangers of sugar, and rightly so. And even the "healthy weight" stuff has sugar and sorbitol in it!<br /><br />Don't buy Beneful for your dog. Pay careful attention to the entire ingredients list of the dog food you DO buy, as a lot of brands sure don't think you care about whether your dog lives many years or has expensive vet bills as long as it scarfs down their corner-cutting product. And if you must buy Beneful, at least send the company a few angry letters telling them to take the sugar and fake sweeteners out so you no longer have to feel you're killing your dog. I mean, come on, they could use apple juice if they wanted a sweetener. This is incredibly unhealthy and reprehensible, if you ask me. I sure won't buy this dog food ever again, and I would think twice before trusting Purina.
