Nescafe Classic is Nescafe Classic.There is NO Greek Nescafe.You can use ANY Nescafe Classic to make 'frappe' if you want. You can use Nescafe Clasico (sold by Amazon LLC for $ 18.65 for 3 glass jars of 7 ounce each and free shipping) and it is way cheaper than this tinny Greek product and it is 100% the same Nescafe Classic sold all over the world. There is no need/reason to pay this much for the same product.<br /><br />People who have never tasted good instant coffee I recommend Nescafe Gold. Not sold in the US but known and enjoyed by millions around the world.
