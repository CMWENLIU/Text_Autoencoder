I had read about, tasted and really liked this distinctive style of black pepper obtained from another vendor (World of Spice?). So when placing an order with Angelina's, I included this item and was very pleased by the price. However, they were completely nondistinctive, from the beginning. I don't know if they were stale from the start, or not what they were represented to be, or as the Test Kitchen recently reported -- not all tellicherry peppercorns are alike from different vendors. Anyway, while I generally like Angelina's products and believe this vendor is a good one, I give a thumbs down to this particular item. Try them from another vendor.
