Campbells Chunky "Healthy request" Clam Chowder tastes horrible. It's that simple. I wouldn't eat it again if it was free, really, I wouldnt. Only thing that could save this chowder is if you added at least a Tsp or two. of salt. about a 1/4 c of heavy cream, at least 2 TBSP of butter and a 6 oz can of clams to the 18.8oz can, as this stuff is all but devoid of those three things. If you like watery, bland potato soup, this stuff is for you!<br /><br />My suggestion: Just get the real stuff, but eat less of it and you get the same calories. At least you will enjoy each bite rather than cringe and after the 3rd bite throw it out. Maybe that is their plan. Make food so bad you just throw it out and lose weight from starvation. Way to go Campbells!
