If you like a hint of the past then this stuff is for you. All I can say is what a disappointment...<br />The problem with these, Archer Farms and Kettle Valley are that all Fruit Leathers have become APPLE leathers with a smattering of the desired flavor in puree form. There used to be real pure fruit leathers made from the actual fruit (Apricot, Strawberry, etc) but for some reason they disappeared from the market about 10 years ago (last company I recall was 'Nature ...' something). I guess like everything else these days the emphesis is 'make it on the cheap' and forget the real quality.<br /><br />It's a shame if it's merely a cost decision, there's a bonafide market out there for the real thing even if it's a little more expensive.
