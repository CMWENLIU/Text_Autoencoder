This is one of the worst products I have EVER eaten! I was excited to get this, because I'm on a diet, and I thought 0 calorie and RANCH! It's a win win combination!!! WRONG! It has somewhat the taste of ranch and fake bacon bits, but every bit of that taste is soon completely overtaken with a STRONG chemical taste.<br /><br />PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!! BUY LIGHT RANCH AND USE SPARINGLY!
