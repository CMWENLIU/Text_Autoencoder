Within our family, my husband has diabetic neuropathy, one of us is a vegetarian(that would be me), and one of us is a Vegan.<br />This product might please others, who are not so particular, or who have different taste buds, but here is how it went with us: 1) My huaband thought they tasted "horrible". 2) I didn't think the colorie count and ingredients were worth incorporating into my diet daily or otherwise, and 3)my Vegan son could not even try them because, although they are touted as healthy, due to a few ingredients which were not necessary to add, they are NOT Vegan. Come on, even some varieties of Pop Tarts are Vegan at this point, not that I am saying Pop Tarts are the way to go.<br />Just my thoughts.<br />Incidentally, one of my children with autism took one look at the packaging and threw the bar and the package away. He is non verbal, but I count that as 4)one more opinion, possibly more of an aethestic nature, to take note of.<br />Sorry, Pamela's Products Whenever Bars in Oatmeal Raisin Spice...you sounded nifty but you just were not our cup of tea. Improvements could be made I bet!
