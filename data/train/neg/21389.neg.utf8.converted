I am a huge organic products enthusiast, and I am a fan of Amy's products. I bought this soup in hopes of it having some sort of pizzaz. I was sorely disappointed.<br />After having heated it up, I tasted it and was shocked with how bland it was. It was a meek soup, almost as if they created a black bean base, tossed some veggies in and left it at that. Uh...where are the spices?! The herbs?! The excitement!<br />Only after adding some hot sauce, salt, pepper, garlic, cumin, and sour cream did the soup become worthy to be eaten with the rest of my lunch.<br />If you are a fan of more mild soups, this could be for you. If you're just a fan of plain veggie soups, this certainly could be for you. But if you like a little jazz in your soup, don't buy this unless you're ready to dump a jar of salsa in.
