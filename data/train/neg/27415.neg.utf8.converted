my family has tried just about every fruit pouch out there, this one unfortunately was the worst. maybe i'm naive but, when i look at packaging that has apples and strawberries on it and is called "apple strawberry" i assume that's what it is...not apple, strawberry and banana. i just don't understand why/how companies do this. reminds me of the time i went to a restaurant to have broccoli cheese soup, only to get 3 bites in and find out there's ham in. thanks guys depending on which religion i might be i could be in big trouble.  in this case, it's a matter of my son being intolerant, not anything fatal, but induced vomiting isn't fun. it wasn't until later of the smooshed in side of the pouch did i "see" wher it said banana. i'll be staying with Dole Squish'ems and the Fruit Buddj
