I'm not sure exactly why I thought I'd like this Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee, since I usually find Starbucks coffee not to my taste. The ground coffee has a nice vanilla smell while it's still in the bag but my first sip was a huge disappointment--it tasted decidedly harsh. I tried brewing it stronger and weaker; still harsh, almost acidic. The only thing that made it drinkable was adding quite a bit of sugar, and I really don't care for my coffee that way.<br /><br />The ingredient list claims "ground vanilla beans," which I wouldn't expect to have a harsh acidic taste. Vanilla is the second most expensive spice in the world (after saffron) and grinding the beans is known to be a good way of dispersing the flavor through hot liquids. How can it have gone so wrong in this product? Is it the coffee itself that's so unappetizing, or the combination? I just don't know.<br /><br />From now on I'll look for vanilla in baked goods and body lotion, and keep it out of my coffee. Sorry, Starbucks, I'm not a fan of this brew.<br /><br />Two stars, not really for the coffee but to encourage Starbucks to do better with recycling and other green issues, and to increase fair trade initiatives.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2010
