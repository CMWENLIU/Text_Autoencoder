I will echo other reviewers in asking why advertise a product as "Ultra Shea" when the first ingredient is mineral oil and shea comes several ingredients after.<br /><br />I tried it, but as another reviewer said, I didn't know quite what to do with it. There weren't instructions. I read a bit but geez, I don't have time to research this item. It only made my hair limp, and it was hard to wash out. Surely that would dry my scalp more than at baseline.<br /><br />All in all, I distrust products that advertise "shea" but contain primarily mineral oil.<br /><br />And my mother's method for keeping her girls' locks strong and shiny still works for me: Apply warm olive oil to scalp and wrap in a towel for a few hours.
