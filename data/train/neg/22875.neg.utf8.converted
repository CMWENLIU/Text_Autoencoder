When I got these in the mail I was quite excited to finally partake in their goodness.  After all, I have had quite the cavity problem over the years and I figured I had to do something to save my dentist the despair that struck over his face every time I walked into his office.<br /><br />Nearly immediately upon receiving them I took the bag with me down to my home theater and ripped them open with a child-like craving.  I popped them in my mouth one by one, careful to roll them around with my tongue and over and back and fro between my gums, lips and tongue.  I relished how soft and plyable they were and the taste was exquisite.  I could not believe that I was experiencing nirvana from a sugar free product.<br /><br />About an hour into the movie however, things started to change and before long, it was as if the gates of he11 opened up in my room.  I could almost swear I saw the hand of Bealzibub himself reaching forth from the depths of a gaping, red fissure that had become of my rectum, claws and all scraping any which way they could to cause pain.  I was doubled over in agony--if the weatherman had come on television that evening I am sure there would have been a flash-mudslide advisory warning issued in my home as that is exactly what had happened.  My guts were on fire.<br /><br />I ended up creating a tar-pit that labrea would have been proud of.  If it were not for my beautiful wife, I could have become quite entombed within my abode and fossilized in the times gone by.  I will say this though, Haribo would _not_ reimburse us for damages to our door when my Wife came home and the brown flood of goop shot out through the narrow slit that she had created by turning the knob, busting it from its hinges into her.<br /><br />These gummy bears are an exquisite deficacy.
