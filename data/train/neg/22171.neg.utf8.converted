We decided to buy this carousel rather than the one made by Keurig because it held more (35 vs. 27) and because it was taller and narrower, thereby taking up a smaller footprint.  The down side was that it is generally more expensive than the Keurig version, but decided to make the additional investment for the above reasons.  However, when we received it, it wasn't as well-made as we had hoped, mostly because it didn't stand straight, so when you spin it, the "leaning tower" rotates annoyingly from side to side.  Decided to live with it rather than dealing with a return.
