Had a craving for the "sorghum molasses" that I grew up eating on biscuits in the morning and there's really nowhere in California to buy it.  Just received 2 jars with high hopes.  Taste is not what I remember.  If you grew up in Kentucky, Tennessee or the western part of Virginia, this product may not be what you are expecting.  Don't get me wrong; the taste is not really bad, it just doesn't have the texture or true tang of the "molasses" that used to be so common in Appalachia.  Could be the addition of the sugar-cane molasses, or the citric acid that gives it a texture and aftertaste that's not familiar.  Maybe it'll make good cookies.  Guess I'll keep looking.
