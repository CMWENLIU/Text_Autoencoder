This product was totally different from the description. Boy was I disappointed in Amazon. I am a big fan of the Kona, Italian Roast, and French Roast was excited to get them package together for a reasonable price. The description was very clear listing the flavors and how many of each was included. I purchased two so I would get four boxes total. They were totally different. I received boxes of mainly housse and breaksfast blend with a few italian and french roast thrown in. There was no Kona at all.
