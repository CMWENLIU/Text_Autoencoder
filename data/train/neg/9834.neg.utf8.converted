The amount of fenugreek recommended to promote milk production by far exceeds the amount in this tea. The tea has to seep for 10 minutes before drinking. The box suggests drinking 5 cups of tea a day as well- who has that kind of time? . There are 16 tea bags in a box so it will only last 2 and a half days, which makes it overpriced and insufficient for the needs of a mom trying to build up her milk supply. Fenugreek capsules work- this doesn't.
