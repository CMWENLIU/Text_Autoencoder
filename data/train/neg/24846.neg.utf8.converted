Granted I'm not a huge tofu fan but after reading the fabulous reviews on this site and at the Hungry Girl site, I thought I'd give it a shot.  Tried them with marinara and like another reviewer said, the sauce just slid off.  The texture was way too chewy--like squid. Fine if you are eating squid (which I like) but not if you want pasta.  They taste  nothing like pasta. Very disappointing. I will be giving my other 3 packages away. Perhaps they would be better in an Asian soup dish but they are definitely not a substitute for good old spaghetti.
