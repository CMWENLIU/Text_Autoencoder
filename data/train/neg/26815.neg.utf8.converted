Since I just didn't have time to run to the stores, I only trusted my best friend, Amazon.com, to bring me the baby foods. The packaging and portion of each varieties was good, and the quality of Gerber baby food deserves no complaint. However, I was confused with the description, "18 Pack", as I thought it was 18 Pack of 2 tubs! What it contained was only 9 pack of 2-tub packages, and normally, I buy the 2-tub Gerbers for only a little more than a dollar at local stores. If I bought them at a local market, I would have paid slightly more than $11. I realized I paid almost $20 a box for these, and I even bought 2 boxes. This was the first product ever I regret buying from Amazon.com after several years of good patronage!
