I purchased Tully's Decaffeniated House Blend 24-count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers.  They open up around the top seal when brewing and the coffee grounds get into the coffee and also make a mess inside the machine.  Unless you want to strain your coffee and clean your entire machine after each use do not purchase this product.
