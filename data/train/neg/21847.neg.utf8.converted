I LOVE Kind bars, but these are terrible.  Upon taking one bite they tasted stale and not like any other Kind bar product I purchase on a regular basis. I litterally had to spit it out after taking a bite...and that's extreme..sorry!!  Steer clear of these new bars, I really think something was wrong with them, again I couldn't return due to Amazon's policy.  Very disappointing.
