The "most critical" review says:<br /><br />Do not buy for the Cranberry Apple and Tangerine Orange!<br />The picture and description is NOT accurate for this product as the shipped package replaces Cranberry Apple and Tangerine Orange with Wild Berry and True Blueberry!<br />- - -<br />A few years back I bought a box of 6 packages of the Fruit Tea Sampler and it was different. As stated above, they have now replaced two of the flavors with cheaper fare. I looked at the graphic before ordering a few days ago and it said 18 tea bags. I wondered how they could do this. What I got before was 5 flavors, 4 tea bags each. Yes, 5 times 4 = 20. How did they get 5 flavors and only 18 tea bags? Well, I found out today when I received the package, the obvious fact being that two of the flavors only have 3 tea bags, being two of the better flavors, Raspberry Zinger and Country Peach Passion. Doh!
