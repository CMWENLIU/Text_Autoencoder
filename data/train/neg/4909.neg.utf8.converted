Despite being sold under the same label, the Lea & Perrins available in the U.S. is NOT the real thing - as others have noted, it contains high fructose corn syrup. Aside from high fructose corn syrup being ridiculously bad for you, it does change the flavor. Not to mention, it's a false claim, as the American version is not 'the original'. See if you have any friends in England to send you the real stuff :)
