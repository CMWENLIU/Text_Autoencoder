I thought I'd tried this cereal years ago, but either the formula has changed or I'm thinking of something else. I was excited to see it on sale on line, but now I wish I'd never stocked up. I think I'm sending the rest to the food bank.<br /><br />I actually like the natural flavor of whole grains, but this is something made in a lab and you can tell. My first impression on my first bowl was "wow, this is sure sickly sweet for a 'healthy' cereal". I immediately checked the label for sugar content and was confused that there wasn't any, since the flavor is overly sweet and a bit nasty with it. I quickly noticed all the chemicals and food derivatives in the ingredient list, including aspartame as a sweetener. Ick.
