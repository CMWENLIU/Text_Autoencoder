After I purchased and then received four 11 oz. bags of dark Italian roast Eight O'Clock Coffee from Amazon early this January, I was so impressed by the full bodied flavor and good rich, smooth taste of that coffee that I ordered this 33 oz. bag of Eight O'Clock Hazelnut Coffee.<br /><br />I wish I had not done so. This is a very weak and bland tasting coffee with little to no taste of Hazelnut in the mixture. The dark Italian roast Eight O'Clock Coffee has a rich taste with very dark brown beans , but the coffee beans in this coffee are a bleached out light tan color that produces a weak tasting bland coffee.<br /><br />To make an halfway fair tasting cup of coffee, I've had to mix some of the great dark Italian roasted coffee beans into the grinder with these pale, wrinkled sub-standard coffee beans. I'm not unhappy to see that it is presently out of stock here at Amazon. Any coffee drinker who buys it after trying good coffee beans is going to be sorely disappointed.
