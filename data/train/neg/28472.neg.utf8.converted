BEWARE OF THIS BEING SHIPPED FROM AMAZON AS THEY ARE BAD!<br /><br />I ordered 30 Boxes or 6 orders of this six pack  of these to give to My kids for school.<br />But they where melted in the wrappers no once noticed until my kids got sick.<br /><br />On close inspection the Chocolate went bad and turned color to an ash color instead of its normal color and smelt funny.<br /><br />To see if these all went bad with all (6 Pack Bundles) I opened a box from each bundle  and only one had bars that were half melted and you could see how half the bar went bad and what the other half is supposed to look like.<br /><br />I am very disappointed in the quality that is shipped out consequently I also ordered the vanilla chipped ones and that arrived in the same box and they where fine.<br /><br />So they must of spoiled in Amazons warehouse. Also since you can't return these I am out $110 and my kids had to suffer too Not acceptable. I will never order another food product that is shipped from amazon as the quality is extremely poor.
