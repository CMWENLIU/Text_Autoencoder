This product is much harder to use than described.  The receipes are easy to follow, but the rolling is very difficult, and the insructions were vague, I found myself having to turn to the internet to look up instructions and rolling techniques.  The ingredients were all very high quality, but all were available in my local supermarket. Would not recommend.
