I switched to this food from Innova. I have a male and a female cat. They've been eating it for about a year. They're 2 years old. The pet store we were buying Innova from started replacing Innova with Innova EVO, and my cats would eat it-- but they were breaking out on their chin from it. They offered other things, but I ended up using this. It was a special order, but I'd sampled the bag and the cat acne disappeared.<br /><br />This past month, my male cat started peeing on the floor. We thought it was due to the stress of moving and our new baby and ignored it. Then he started to meow a ton. We thought he wanted more attention. He was still playing with our other cat. We ignored it. Then he started shaking while trying to walk to the litter box. We took him to the vet at 4a. He had a blocked bladder. Per our vet, he'd been hearing this a lot from male cats who are eating Wellness core. Honestly, I think the only reason he didn't have symptoms sooner is that I was giving him Innova EVO wet food for awhile in addition to the dry food. The other cat didn't eat it, so I didn't want to get food that both of them couldn't enjoy.<br /><br />Fixing a blocked bladder is VERY expensive. Also, there is no guarantee that your cat will be completely unblocked after treatment. Thus far, our guy is doing well. We still crate him to make sure he's peeing, eating, and drinking. It's hard to monitor this with two cats otherwise.<br /><br />Our male cat is now on a Prescription diet from the vet recommended brand that I'm not too fond of... He seems okay. We've switched our other cat onto the same diet.<br /><br />I will never purchase Wellness CORE again.
