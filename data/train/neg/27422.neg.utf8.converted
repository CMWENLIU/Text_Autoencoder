This product may well be a backpacker's delight, but it probably will be a disappointment to a home cook.The product no doubt will hold its own in comparison with other dried, light-weight products for the hiker's food bag. But the package directions (which are very small print and hard to read)can tip off a home cook that the manufacturer makes enough suggestions about to improve the mouth feel and taste of the product that the home cook realizes that for roughly the same amount of work and roughly the same expense of materials and utilities, one can make a much more tasty green chili stew at home.  Understand, please, that this is not a bad product if you want backpack trail food.  But if you have a stove and refrigerator and the usual household commodities potatoes, onions, chilis, spices) on hand, your family almost certainly will prefer chili stew made from scratch, and it will take about the same time and effort.
