After buying 5 bars, I and my family do not like the new recipe!<br /><br />I called Lindt to inquire about the new recipe and was told that the old recipe is gone, taste testing shows a preference for the new recipe.  I am not sure who did the tasting but it was not a chocolate lover.<br /><br />Another fine item is history!
