I've become a fan of The Switch sodas. The black cherry flavor has a great balance of flavoring and carbonation that had me ready to give up traditional sodas. The Orange flavor; however, leaves a lot to be desired. It has a really strong after taste and despite being "100% juice" it tastes like bad artificial Orange flavoring.<br /><br />I'd opt for the grape or the black cherry for sure. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />Also, you'll want to note that The Switch sodas aren't exactly healthy, they are simply not overrun with artificial flavors. They actually have a fairly high calorie count. That being said they have some health benefits over pop- like the vitamin count and no added sugars.
