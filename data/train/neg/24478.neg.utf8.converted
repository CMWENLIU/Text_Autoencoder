ok, I admit, I do buy a lot of stuff on Amazon, usually because of great price and quick shipment... But I got caught with this item... I ordered it along with other baking goods and the next day I saw it in Stop&Shop for $0.98! So obviously I bought it and thought I would just send this one back (4.79 is just a ridiculous price)... But this is not that easy. If I want to return it, I have to pay for shipment - which is another $5.00 or so...
