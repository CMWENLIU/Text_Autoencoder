These dates are one of the cheaper option for dried pitted dates on Amazon. I did not like them, though. Very dry, and some even have a tint of flavor of oil going bad. This is not bad enough to throw them out, let's say. But they are not enjoyable as dates usually are. You probably need to wash them, and they flake a lot, when you do.<br />Maybe I will use them for cooking somehow. I don't recommend this product.
