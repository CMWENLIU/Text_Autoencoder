I have been buying the fireworks popcorn from Amazon and have been very happy with it. I bought this to try something different. First of all I was disappointed by the rather small container for the price, but then I was very disappointed by the taste. I use canola oil in an electric popper. This popcorn had a slight taste of insecticide. I tasted it in every batch from the jar. It was a very distinctive and unpleasant taste.
