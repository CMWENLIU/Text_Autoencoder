Updated:  I purchased Tilda Basmati because of the rave reviews, WOW whats not to like about getting an even better basmati flavor?  This bag of basmati rice was packaged well, packed well for shipping, and shipped promptly.  But the rice itself is very disappointing.  It's instant rice, and not very good instant rice at that, with a basmati flavor.  It cooks in ten minutes to a mushy pasty individual grain.<br />  What with having ten pounds of it, I've tried cooking it every way that rice can be cooked, just in case I was preparing it incorrectly. Nope, tastes like someone made rice mush and then extruded it thru small holes and re-dried it. My family and I enjoy whole grain rices that generally take 55 minutes to cook and allow you to have a pleasant flavor and distinct individual grain texture to the mouth. I even tried using it as a filler for meat loaf or meat balls. It decreases the quality of any recipe you use it in.<br />  The only explanation for all these rave reviews that I can see is that they're generated by the company, or that the purchasers have never tasted real rice before.  This stuff is awful.  After a year of holding it in my refrigerator, much to long to get a refund, I've just finished dumping 9 1/2 pounds of it in the trash.
