I LOVED this thing, I used it everyday and it was great for 3 months. Well the plastic cracked in the cooker. So now I have this thing that wont steam and  would leak everywhere and it was a mess! I contacted their customer service- who got back to me quickly and said they would send out a replacement bowl. It's a month and half later- NO REPLACEMENT PART! Also the plastic part around the blade grows mold and there is NO easy way or a way I've found to get it completely out!!!  I have to say..as much as I did love this I would NEVER spend that kind of money on a baby cooker again.
