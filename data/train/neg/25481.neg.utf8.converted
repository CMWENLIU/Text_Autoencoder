Without a doubt, no one in our home liked this product.  As another reviewer stated, it taste like burnt banannas. The product crumbles easily because it is very dry. I suspect there may have been an issue in the manufacturing process that led to the burnt taste and dry texture.<br /><br />If I was really hungry, I would probably eat it- hence the title of this review.
