Everyone raves about this mayo, saying it's the "best". Some have said it's like the way Hellmann's used to be before they watered it down. Well I bought the 4 pack of 32 ounce jars and had high expectations. When I received the order, I opened the first jar and dipped the tip of my butter knife in to give it a taste sample. I did not like it at all. It tasted almost sour. It sort of had a mustard like after taste. I tried it on my favorite deli roast beef, and in my opinion, it ruined it. The after taste is unpleasant. I even tried to use it for tuna salad. It was awful! I don't get it? My jars are not out of date. I guess I just don't appreciate this brand like many others do.<br /><br />I have recently rediscovered Kraft mayo and I am happy that they reverted back to their older recipe. It is creamy and delicious. I will stick with that.<br /><br />I have three jars of Duke's left, that I will donate to our local food bank so that it doesn't go to waste. I know I will probably get a lot of heat from Duke loyalists, but what can I say? I just don't like it!
