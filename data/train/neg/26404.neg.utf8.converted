Majority of the cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol-A which has been linked to cancer, birth defects, miscarriages, obesity, and insulin resistance, which can lead to Type II diabetes. Refer to the Environmental Working Group report on BPA for more information.<br /><br />I consume many different type of fish. All other brand sardines except LA SIRENA sardines are soft and mushy. La Siena and Crown Prince Sardines in Water, 4.25-Ounce are better. Crown Prince Brisling Sardines are smaller and taste just a bit better without the BPA. 15oz is three times the size of the small cans for much less money and a very good buy when I mix with other food ingredients since there is no way to buy any wild healthy fish like sardines which cost around $2.00 a pound from grocery stores. The junk farm raised fish with added carpet dye is sold for $10.00 a pound which is not healthy at all. I consume more Baltic sprats and herrings from Germany which are very tasty and delicious. Regardless of the type of fish, each can has some 1000~3000 MG of sodium which is not low so I drain the oil since vegetable oil is unhealthy, regardless of the type specified, and never trust when they claim olive oil either, as well as the tomato juice or water, to get ride of the unhealthy part of the can including the unhealthy salt and then consume the fish.
