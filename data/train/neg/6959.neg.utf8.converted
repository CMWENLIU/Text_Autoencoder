I looked for a long while to find a dry kibble that my cats would enjoy and tolerate. One cannot have rice or other grains. They preferred the previous formula of Nature's Variety Instinct Rabbit meal formula. I purchased a new bag and the cats wouldn't touch it and in fact were repelled by it. I looked at the ingredients and the order, and they were the same until you got to the ingrediant "Natural Chicken flavor" on the old bag. On the new bag, it said "Natural pork flavor."  The individual kibble are flatter and airy and the old kibble was denser and a bit rounder.  Further the old formula says "90%+ of the protein is from rabbit,salmon,chicken, herring meals." The new formula says "75% pure animal ingredients and nutriousl oils."  In any case, there are some differences. I'm not sure if it is the pork flavor, the disc texture and density or even if there is a change in the ratio. THe first bag references the percentage of protein and its identity, whereas the new bage simply indicates the percentage of animal ingredients. I have some sad kitties who loved the old formula. Looking at [...] review of premium dry, it also lists other types that might also appeal to kitties.
