I bought this thinking it would taste at least a little like the restaurants version. It was NOTHING like it. I tried it with the water first. It doesn't even tell you how much liquid to add, just a glass of water and one tbsp. of the mix. I used a large glass. It was horrible so I added another tbsp. It was still REALLY bad. It was so watery. Then the next time I used skim milk (only because that's what's in my house). This tasted better, but nothing I'd want to drink again. Also it says on the package in the picture 'sweetened,' and it says it has sugar in it and my package was, so I agree with the other lady as to why people assume it's not sweetened when it clearly is. I would NEVER buy this again.
