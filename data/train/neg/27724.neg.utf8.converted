My coworkers and I purchased this cinnamon to create gingerbread ornaments with our students.  We mixed the cinnamon with applesauce (something we've done for years) but as we mixed we discovered this cinnamon to have many pieces of white fibers mixed in!  The white fibers looked like tiny, white strings.  We continued on with the project because we knew we would not be eating it but soon we discovered, the cinnamon didn't even work for the ornaments.  The ornaments crumbled apart once they were dry rather than sticking together.  Lets just say, I'm so thankful we did not purchase this cinnamon to bake with or to eat!!  We were so excited to the GREAT deal on cinnamon but in the end it was not worth it.  We have had to repurchase cinnamon at our local grocery store.
