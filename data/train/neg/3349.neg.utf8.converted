I bought these thinking that they would be as good as the ravioli. Wrong.  There is something different and unpleasant about the sauce.  The tiny meatballs weren't bad but something was "off" with the sauce, plus there was way too much sauce to spaghetti. Not sure if this was just a bad shipment or if they always taste like this.  I'll stick with the ravioli in the future.
