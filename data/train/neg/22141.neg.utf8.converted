This is so frustrating. Where is the nutritional information? They tell you what's not in it, but they don't tell you what is in it. Furthermore, I had to enlarge the image to get that information. What are they trying to hide? Due to their less-than-generous return policy, I would never buy a product from Amazon.com unless I know exactly what I am getting. Ya got that Amazon?!
