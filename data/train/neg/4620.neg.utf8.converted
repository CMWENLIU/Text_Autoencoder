I had never tried Pomegranate before so I just gave this a shot and it's nasty stuff.<br />If you don't like the tartness of a grapefruit (I don't), then this isn't for you. About as tart as I can go is an orange and this is about 100000% worse.<br /><br />This is also entirely natural and has no sugars added which in my opinion contribute to why I can't stand it... Just entirely too tart!
