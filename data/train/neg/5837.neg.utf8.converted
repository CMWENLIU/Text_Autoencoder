I've tried many bags of Goji Berries from different companies.  Some are good and some are not so good.  I later found out that the Goji Berries from China are not the best quality.  So, I found a brand that said that they are the "authentic Tibetan Goji Berries" at my local health food Co-Op.  Although they were expensive, they were good.  I later bought another brand at the 2007 Raw Spirit Festival in Sedona, AZ.  They were the best that I ever had, soft and delicious.<br /><br />When I saw that there were some inexpensive authentic organic Tibetan Goji Berries on Amazon, I became excited.  I made the purchase and couldn't wait to get them.  When I received them and tried them I was very disappointed.  They are the hardest, driest, discolored, worst tasting Goji Berries that I ever had.  I immediately felt that I was sold and inferior product in a nice bag.  These Goji Berries have a bad taste and have sediment on them as if they were not clean.  I called the company to inquire about the origin.  Of course they did say that they are authentic Tibetan Goji Berries.  I just don't believe them.  There were two bags that came with my order.  The second bag remains unopened and will probably eventually get tossed.
