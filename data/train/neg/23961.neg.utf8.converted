You've got to be kidding me. I thought I must be missing something when I first saw the price and read the description.. like maybe that price was for several packs of 24.<br />Wow, I live in SC, and I usually wait til they go on sale for $2.99/12 pk to buy. I never pay more than $3.99. What a rip off this "deal" is.
