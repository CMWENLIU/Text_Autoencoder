I was excited to get started on making my homemade baby food. They did not have anything like this when I had my other children. I splurged because I felt that this would save me time. I had it all ready to go food in the blender and then nothing! The blue lights lit up and then nothing! Followed the instructions step by step thinking I may have put the lid and bucket on wrong and still nothing. I called the customer support line and they are sending me out a new product plus something extra for my inconvience. It does have a year warranty on it so I will give the second one another try and hope it last longer than one use!<br /><br />Update:9/27/2011-I continue to wait for my replacement from the company and have called multiple times and left several messages to find if they have shipped me another baby brezza and they will not return my phone calls or pick up the phone. I would be weary about purchasing this item since it looks like they don't stand behind their product!!! I am returning it through amazon today!!!
