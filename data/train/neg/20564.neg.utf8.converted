Ingredients are listed in the descending order, the highest % of a product is listed first. Therefore, if a manufacturer is claiming Whole Grain and Whole Wheat all over their packaging, they have no business making white flour the primary ingredient. Since they don't tell you the ratio, they can add as little as 1% whole wheat and still be able to put it on the outside that way.<br /><br />This is an extremely prevalent practice & needs to be regulated. Food companies are deliberately deceiving the public into thinking that they're getting something more nutritous than they are.<br /><br />Unless a package says 100% whole grain or 100% whole wheat (Wheat Thins & Triscuits have them), then they're likely not.<br /><br />I can't have white flour and it takes me forever to shop because all these companies have jumped on the whole grain bandwagon & are attempting to fool consumers and they succeed most of the time.<br /><br />Shame on Nabisco. And Old London. And every other company pulling this malarkey.
