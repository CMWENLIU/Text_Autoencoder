This bottle just arrived today.  I unwrapped the top, took a taste, and I can tell you that this is sad, sorry stuff.  It is as thin as water, acetic in not a good way, and completely lacking in the flavor complexities one wants in a good bottle of balsamic.  This is watery dark-colored vinegar.  This is NOT 3 leaf balsamic which I hoped I could use as a drizzle or use for a reduction.  Is there a board I can appeal to? 'cause this stuff is improperly marketed, as I can get the same vinegar for 1/10 the price at a grocery store.<br />Let my folly be a lesson to all of you:  spend the money on a good balsamic and do not economize.  DO NOT buy this sad stuff.
