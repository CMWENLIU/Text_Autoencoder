I'm all for organic products and the many uses of hemp, but can't someone make a hemp protein powder that you'd want to drink?  First of all, this powder is green.  Second of all, it tastes horrible.  I added it to different kinds of juice to try to get the best flavor results.  After less than a week, I can no longer bring myself to drink it.  Just looking at the canister makes me nauseous.  Unless you can stomach gross taste and gross appearance, I strongly suggest you go with a different product.
