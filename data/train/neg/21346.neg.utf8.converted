With the first bowl I felt there was something gritty somewhere in a bite, but did swallow it.  The next bowl I found a little ball of rock (?) about the size of a groat, very round and very, very hard.  I am so thankful I did not bite down on it hard enough to crack a tooth.  The flavor was very good, but I'm tossing it all out.  Maybe I'm the only one to have this problem - but I won't be buying any more of this product.
