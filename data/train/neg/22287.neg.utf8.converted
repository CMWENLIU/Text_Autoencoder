When my grandson was born, Diogenes was able to retire and seek the sleep he so deserved after searching so many centuries for an honest man. My grandson speaks his mind eloquently and succintly.  Upon the arrival of my order of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LNHQ34">Funfresh Foods Real Food Trading Company Himalayan Pink Sea Salt, 2-Pound</a>, I quietly served it at a family meal.  Almost instantly my grandson asked who put sand in the salt.  I smiled, chuckled and told him no one had put anything in the salt and that this was special pink salt from half way around the world.  "It has sand in it, Grandpa! I don't like it!" he replied.  Nay, nay, not so, I assured him (and everyone).  "Let me show you."<br /><br />I drew a small glass of filtered water and added a liberal amount of the pink salt.  (BTW, if you like the C.Cola bottled water, *asani, much of it comes from the same source in FL as my tap water)  So I swirled the pink salt around in the water.  Let me mention that I have a degree in science and a bunch, like a lot, of chemistry courses so I know that table salt, sodium chloride (NaCl) is really really soluble in water.  Well, after much stirring I got quite a bit of pink insoluble grains on the bottom of the glass and, most disturbing, the liquid was cloudy!  I've been watching it for a couple of hours now and nothing is settling out.  I'll keep watching, but what the cloudy water means is there is either a fine particulate that will settle out in time or there is something else in the "salt" that is not or not completely water soluble or is colloidal, which does not make me feel good about this product.<br /><br />It is my understanding that most table salt is produced by crystallizing the salt from a saline solution, either natural (sea water) or man made.  The difference between "regular" table salt (at least in the US) and Kosher salt is that regular salt is allowed to crystallize undisturbed and will form cubical crystals while Kosher salt must be raked during the entire crystallizing process, thus forming the light flaky crystals familiar to that form.<br /><br />This product, it appears to me, is a mined mineral that contains a high NaCl content that is not further refined.  It is finely ground perhaps in the hope that end users will not notice that it also contains rock, sand, or whatever makes up the Himalayas.  The product claims to contain less Sodium (Na) and that may well be true, but is that lower Sodium content because it has ground rocks/sand in it?<br /><br />I'm returning this because it is an inferior product that is not what it is advertised to be.  This might be fine for a live stock salt lick but it is not fit for human consumption!<br /><br />Many Hours Later:  The cloudiness is clearing, so my conclusion is that it was caused by very small particles that took longer to fall out of suspension.  Nevertheless, sediment is sediment and sediment is not salt!  This is another example of when a low price is not a bargain!
