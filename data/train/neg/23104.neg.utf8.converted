Weird, everyone seem to like it. I just had to come here to read what people thought of Tru Blood, after pouring the remaining half of my bottle down the drain... I personally couldn't finish it, found it almost undrinkable in fact. Sickly sweet with barely a trace of "Blood Orange", it tastes completely artificial and I can't honestly recommend it, even to fans. Happily I picked mine up from a bargain bin! I'll stick to watching the show in future...
