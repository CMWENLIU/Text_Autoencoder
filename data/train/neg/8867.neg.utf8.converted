my shipment arrived with a lot of the plastic bottles dented up. customer service was so wonderful to deal with-a plus. i took a taste from one though and it's so strong of a flavor. i buy raw honey all the time and they're always firm to the touch, but this one is flowing, like regular store bought honey. my kids don't like this type of raw honey at all, the taste is too strong. maybe it's just our taste, but if you're into the normal flavor of honey, this brand is definitely going to throw your tastebuds off. if you're into different flavors, then this is the one for you.
