Our family loves to have hot chocolate on a cold winter's day and this is not hot chocolate.  I don't know what it is.  You need to find another product for your Keurig if you are looking for hot chocolate.  Please do not waste your money on this product.  There is no quality control on this one.  How Keurig thinks this is good is beyond me.
