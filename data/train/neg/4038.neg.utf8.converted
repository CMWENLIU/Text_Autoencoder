After reading alot of favorable reviews here on Amazon, I decided to buy some early harvest Bariani from Fall 08.<br />Overall, I was very turned off by the taste of this olive oil.  I've tried quite a few olive oils (from low to high end) in my time and I've grown to like oils with a light grassy flavor with a bit of peppery punch.  Perhaps it was due to the fact that Bariani uses unripe olives to make their oils but I found this one to be overly bitter.  And it wasn't something that was subtle, I actually cringed a little bit on my first tasting.  I will look elsewhere for my next bottle of olive oil.
