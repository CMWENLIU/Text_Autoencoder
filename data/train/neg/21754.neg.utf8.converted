The pee post is larger than i expected and smells of urine (probably the "pheramones" that attract the dog).  I installed it in my yard per directions and brought my 2 year old directly to it during her usual "pee time."  I tried to get her to sniff it or pay any attention at all to it but no success.  I have seen her take one sniff of it in passing but has never done her business even close to the pee post.  Maybe this would work on puppies that have not been trained yet, but this did not work at all for my dog.
