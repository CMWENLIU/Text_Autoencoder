Absolute garbage!  Unfortunaltely zero stars is not an option.  "Konedog", tell your employer, Cutter, to stop selling crap plastic applicators!  This sprayer is so cheap and poorly designed that you are destine to wind up wearing more bug spray than you'll ever get on your yard.  The hose end coupler is too deep (tried it on two different hoses) so there is water leaking/spraying all around the coupling even before you begin to spray.  Once you get going the draw tube is rediculously ineffective and isn't moving material.  Try bumping up the pressure to draw something out of the container and the hose coupler pops of the cheap snap-on fitting to the spray nozzle.  I threatened my wife that if she ever bought another Cutter product I would promptly drive her back to store to obtain a refund.<br /><br />Ortho, Bonide, Raid...any of them have to be better than the garbage Cutter is trying to pass off.
