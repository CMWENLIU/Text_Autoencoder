So, so bummed that they changed their formula.  I couldn't figure out what was different, but they must have stopped honeyroasting the mix.  Or changed the pretzel sticks they were using or something.  It's too bland for me now.  Boo!  At first I thought it was the batch I bought, but after the third can I realize they've definitely changed something up.  So sad.  Won't be eating this for snack anymore.  :(
