I make kale chips at home on a regular basis but wanted to give these a try for flavor inspiration. I opened the bag and a nice scent of BBQ wafted out. So, I pop a piece into my mouth...and while it tasted indeed like BBQ, there was also a distinct stale flavor and the powder flavoring actually coated my tongue - I could have been eating a BBQ-flavored cardboard chip for the lack of kale flavor. They have a heavy feel and do not resemble kale much at all - I was really disappointed. Back to making them myself.
