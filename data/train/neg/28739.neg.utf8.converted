Funny that Amazon/Seller left out MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE from the ingredients on the online listing..<br /><br />But MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE is listed on the packaging and it's loaded with it.<br />I didn't realize it until after I finished one bag and had a headache...just disgusting, all left over bags are in the trash.
