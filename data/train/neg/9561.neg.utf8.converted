First off, the bottle is plastic which is intolerable for olive oil.  I would not have been happy for this one reason.  But, I also think the taste of the oil is inferior to, well, most any other olive oil I've bought before.  I use it quite a bit and am not happy with this product, inside or out.<br /><br />I would not have ordered this if I had realized it would arrive in plastic bottles.
