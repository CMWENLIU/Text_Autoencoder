My initial review of this product was glowing, but continuing to use it I have found the product quality to be most inconsistent:  Sometimes the coffee is great then the next cup will be like dishwater.  I'm an analyst by profession but I cannot figure this one out.  Until Melitta can correct the inconsistency in this product, I will not purchase it again.  I'm cancelling my subscription.  Original review:  Recently I have been very disappointed with my Senseo coffee pods which I have been buying for several years. The flavor had become so weakened that I was adding other instant coffee to it to try to produce a robust cup of coffee.  I had even considered replacing my coffee maker. When the Senseo pods were no longer available, I decided, reluctantly, to try these Melita pods as they were more reasonably priced than the other alternatives.  What a pleasant surprise!!  Here's my robust coffee back again!! These pods definitely have more coffee in them because, when I discard them, they are noticeably heavier than were the Senseo pods.  Also, I had to use the larger pod holder that came with my machine because, when wet, the smaller holder would not contain the coffee while brewing.  Another pleasant surprise... these pods are individually wrapped and come in a dispenser box!  Try the subscription (you can select your own delivery interval) and save about $1 per box and get free shipping!  Thank you, Melita and please don't change this product in any way or you will be hearing from me for sure.
