I love strong coffe, I really like Peets coffee so if you've had that you get the idea of what I like. Anyways, there is not anything special about this coffee. I wish I picked something else! Being organic is about it. The beans are dark and oily and I was really excited but what I got in result was not up to all the hype. I use a French press.
