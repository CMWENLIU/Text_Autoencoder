If you're buying in store for $5 it's solid, but there are much better tasting almond butters on here that are cheaper, especially with subscribe and save. Better consistency and less stirring too. Trader Joes is constantly separated and quite thin to boot even in the fridge. It's still thin in the fridge. Highly recommend Justin's Almond Butter over Trader Joes any day of the week. I've tried most out there. Maranatha makes a nice one I've only found at Wegmans (forget the exact type as they have a few different ones), not to mention Costco sells a giant jar of Maranatha's regular almond butter for about $10. Has to be a 24oz or so jar. Sunland tastes as good as the Trader Joes and is much cheaper on here. So if you can get it locally for $5-6, great. Otherwise, don't waste your money.
