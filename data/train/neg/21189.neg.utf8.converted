I purchased a six pack of this bread mix and was disappointed.<br /><br />This bread mix contains rye, but based upon the ingredients list it contains more more wheat flour, and malted barley flour than whole grain rye flour.  If you are purchasing this product hoping that it is predominantly whole grain rye flour you will be disappointed.  If you are trying to avoid wheat due for health or allergy reasons please look elsewhere.
