We started using the Blue dog food product for our 3 dachshunds. The last one was the salmon blend. All three dogs developed varying levels of diarrhea. One was very severe.  We started all 3 back on Science Diet and within a couple of days they were all back to normal.  I threw out the Blue and will never risk using it again.
