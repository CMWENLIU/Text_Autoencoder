I don't know if it was just me or what but I CANNOT get any tomatoes to grow.<br /><br />I've followed all of the instructions (of which there are many) and so far I've only had flowers bud but then never come to fruition.<br /><br />I've done the manual pollination, I've made sure they didn't fall over, I've even trimmed them but dang it if I can't get a tomato.  And, these plants are a total water hog.  I have to fully fill up my water every 4-5 days due to how immense these plants grow.<br /><br />So, if anyone else has had a good time growing the tomatoes please let me know.  I think I'm going to have to go back to herbs and lettuce.
