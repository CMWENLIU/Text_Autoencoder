The regular version of this Chunky New England Clam Chowder has been a big favorite of mine for over 30 years. But now that I am on a low sodium diet, I have to look for substitutes.<br /><br />When I tried the Healthy Request version of Chunky Chicken Noodle, it tasted identical to the regular version. So I assumed that this Healthy Request version of New Englan Clam Chowder would also be as good as its regular version, but it isn't. It tastes awful. It's so bad that I can't possibly eat it. So I wasted my money by ordering a case.<br /><br />Now that I have learned my lesson, the hard way. Before I will order a case of any food product from Amazon. I first try it out by buying a single can from a local grocery store. If it isn't available to try locally. Then I simply won't order a case from Amazon.
