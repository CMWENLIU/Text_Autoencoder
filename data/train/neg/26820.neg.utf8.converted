I agree with the person above as I did the same thing thinking this was truly 18 - 2 packs of the baby food.  This was such a rip off and I feel that the packaging and wording is misleading.  I have twins and try to be very frugal with shopping and this was a huge blow!  I bought 3 boxes Susie! Never again!
