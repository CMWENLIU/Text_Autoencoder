Dear Gatorade:<br /><br />Biggest fan of the G2 powder pack!  I have bought hundreds of these boxes in the last 18 months!  Tastes great, less filling!  Boxes stack neatly in the pantry!  No more boxes???  G2 in my store now comes in a slippery plastic cylindrical tube (for more money).  Doesn't stack in the pantry.  Yeah, it's still Gatorade G2 powder, but it's a pain in the posterior.  Packages teeter-totter on the shelf and fall all over the place.  Why do companies like yours screw up a good thing?  Did you feel you needed to make your product look all spacey-agey and better than the other box powders?  Have you tried to put this on your own pantry shelf?  I gave this 2 stars only because it used to be a perfect product.  I've reluctantly moved on to Propel.
