I like vanilla flavored coffee and expected to like this.  I figured Starbucks would deliver premium quality for a premium price.  But, this coffee didn't pass the taste test.  It was a pretty mild vanilla flavor and a pretty weak coffee flavor, neither of which appealed to me.  Yet the worst aspect of this coffee was the kind of artificial flavor aftertaste.  I'm not sure if that's worth buying unless they figure out a better formula.
