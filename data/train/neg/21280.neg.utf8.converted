I was so excited to have this plant.  It arrived very poorly packaged and the dirt had gone everywhere.  I repotted and watered according to recommendations.  Two of three sprouts died within 2-4 weeks after I owned it.  One hadn't fully bloomed yet and it just died.  The other just got all brown and died.  I think they were poor when they arrived and just didn't survive after repotting as a result.  Sad. They were all really thin and wobbly, nothing like the picture - where they have thick stalks and look big.  Just scrawny. I saw some at Ikea and plan to get some there if they are still there.
