I like a lot of the Gloria Jeans flavored k-cups, and I typically love french vanilla coffee, but this one is not so good to me.  The vanilla taste is almost like a chemical, as if they made a cup of coffee and shot some cheap vanilla syrup flavoring into it.  As far as vanilla k-cups go, I'd stick with the Van Houtte or Timothy's.
