We were very disappointed in this extract.  It took way too much extract to get any kind of taste to our root beer and when we did get the taste, it wasn't pleasing.  We emailed Cooks to give them a chance to tell us if this was normal for their product or if we got a bad batch.  They chose not to respond at all.  I certainly would not recommend this company or their products to anyone.
