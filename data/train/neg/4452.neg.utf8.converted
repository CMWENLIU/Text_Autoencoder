I have a number of Nylabones that are natural in color and 5 years old.  Our dog died 4 years ago and we kept the misc supplies.  Now we have a new lab and she loves the natural ones, which she basically wears down slowly.<br />We also had some white nylabones that hadn't been used and our lab almost eats them.  First we saw pieces about the size of 1/4 a rice in her feces.  Then I found her with a piece about the size of a dime in her mouth.  It was irregular and did not look like something that would pass easily.<br />We chucked the white ones and now I'm trying to find the good ones.<br />Not so easy since websites show pictures of both so I'm not certain what we'd get.<br /><br />I would never give my dog these white Nylabones.<br /><br />I did not buy Nylabones here.  I'm searching for a source of the good ones that don't break into large chunks.<br /><br />I asked for advice at the Nylabone site but have not heard from them.
