When I received the item, the part of the label with the weight had been torn off which made me suspicious.  I weighed the item on my electronic kitchen scale and the weight including the plastic bag was 4 pounds 14 ounces instead of 5 pounds of nibs as advertised.  I later transferred the nibs to another container and weighed the empty plastic bag; it was .95 ounces so I was shortchanged almost 3 ounces of nibs.
