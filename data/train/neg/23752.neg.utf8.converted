I decided to try a bag at a store first before buying in bulk here - man I am glad I did. I didn't really think about the ingredients too much, figuring if it was called "all purpose flour" it would probably work in anything - wrong! Though the texture is nice, the smell and taste completely overpower that benefit.<br /><br />I tried using these to make cookies, and it was horrible...way too much after taste of the bean flavor. Also, the fava bean thing kind of scares me too - apparently kids should not eat it because of possible health risks if they have certain genetic dispositions. Bob's Red Mill has some great stuff that is gluten free, but this one should be labeled as "garbanzo/fava bean flour", not all purpose.
