I don't know what cereal the five star raters are eating, but it tastes like cardboard! They are mistaken that people who can't eat gluten always want to eat healthy. Get rid of the whole grain brown rice - yuk! There are plenty of "healthy" gluten free cereals on the shelves. Just give me the cereal I ate as a kid! People who cannot eat gluten want their food to taste like the product made with gluten. Rice Chex tastes way better than this! I didn't realize the used BHT until I read these reviews. Go back to the drawing board Kelloggs!
