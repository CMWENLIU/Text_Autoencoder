I bought these bars to use as a good snack to help me loose weight. With chocolate and peanut butter, 2 of my favorites, how could I loose? I was very disappointed in the taste and texture. The chocolate tasted and felt like wax and the bar itself had the texture of sawdust with hardly any peanut butter taste. These bars are for those who want to torture themselves into loosing weight.
