The capsules are nearly half the price if bought separately on the Nespresso site. This offer is a dishonest gimmick camouflaged as a variety pack. I am a customer already, but I find myself hoping my Nespresso machine breaks so that I have an excuse to switch to Illy. Shame on Nespresso: not content with profiteering on the backs of poor nations where coffee is grown, they try to colonize us here on Amazon!
