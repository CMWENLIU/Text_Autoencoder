Timothy's Breakfast Blend does not work in my coffee maker.  Only the Breakfast Blend clogs the system and the coffee overflows and grounds end up in the brewed coffee.  I thought it might have been a bad batch so I purchased another supply and it happened again.  Other Timothy products work fine but for some reason this coffee blend does not.  I've cleaned the system thinking that might have been the problem and I also shake the cup  before putting it in the system to make sure that the grounds are loose.  Oh well, I guess I'll stop buying the Breakfast Blend from now on, I kind of liked the taste.
