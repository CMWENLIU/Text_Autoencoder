I love this snack and when i read<br /><br />Product Features<br />Two cases of six boxes, each containing six .77-ounce bags of crackers (72 total bags) ***i got 12 bags***<br />Low-calorie, crunchy blend of crackers, Ritz bits and pretzels<br />No trans fats or cholesterol<br />Just 100 calories per pack; all of the flavor, and none of the guilt<br />Single-serve packs ideal for lunchboxes<br /><br />i thought great deal....but today it came and i only have 2 boxes... What the heck. i can get that at walmart for 2 packages for 4.00<br /><br />i dont get it...what a rip off!!!  very misleading go to the store and buy it yourself. I will never buy food from amazon again last time i did it was expired i should of learned!!!!
