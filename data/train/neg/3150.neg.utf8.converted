After a large price increase of the WestSoy unsweetened soymilk we started using the Organic Unsweetened Silk Soymilk, which we liked. Yet, today I was comparing the Silk to a soymilk I picked up in an Asian market, and saw that the Silk contains carrageenan, which is a thickener made from red seaweed. I also get a health newsletter that is one of the best from a Russell L. Blaylock, M.D., called "The Blaylock Wellness Report" [...]. One of his issues is on the dangers of inflammation. One of the food ingredients that is one of the worst cause of inflammation is carrageenan. Here's what he says about carrageenan:<br /><br />"To emphasize the importance of inflammation in cancer growth and spread, a number of studies have shown that carrageenan -- a common food additive made from seaweed and found in products as varied as ice cream, beer, and toothpaste -- can induce intense inflammation when injected into animal tissues."<br /><br />"In fact, it is used in studies of inflammation. Even diluted solutions of carrageenan injected close to an existing tumor cause the cancer to begin to grow very rapidly. It spreads to other tissues much faster than it would have without the carrageenan."<br /><br />"Another often-forgotten factor is the high amounts of excitotoxin food additives in the typical Western diet. This includes MSG (monosodium glutamate), hydrolyzed proteins, aspartame, soy protein concentrate and isolate, casienate, autolyzed yeast, yeast extract, natural flavoring, broth, stock and carrageenan -- all disguised names for high glutamate food additives, and all of them are allowed by the government."<br /><br />I called the company that makes Silk Soy, and they claim that because their carrageenan is food grade and approved by the FDA, it is therefore safe. Food grade or not, if carrageenan is bad for you, then it is bad for you whether food grade or not. I say, why take a chance?<br /><br />In addition, they add salt as an ingredient. Why? Salt isn't needed in this soy. Or at least produce a version that doesn't have the salt, or for that matter the carrageenan as well. I'll be going back to the Westsoy unsweetened organic.
