If you have allergies, DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!!  Or if you care about false advertising of the most egregious kind, DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!<br /><br />I ordered this because my son has severe allergies to all chemicals.  If it weren't a serious matter for him, I would not be spending this kind of money.  I carefully read the ingredient list on the product page and for the most part, all of the colors were listed as containing deionized water, glycerin, and depending on the color, a type of vegetable color.  Sounds safe enough.  Imagine my horror today when I opened the package and read the ingredients on there.  The yellow, in particular, has Polysorbate and PROPYLENE GLYCOL!!!!!  This is an ingredients in antifreeze and paint and is derived from petroleum!  This is no better than regular food dyes you can buy anywhere.  This could have been very serious for my son if I had just took the ingredient list on the product page at face value and just used these.  Now, I have to scramble to find another truly all natural set of colors before his birthday party.  I also wanted to use these for cookies for Halloween, but who knows if I'll get new ones by then.  Amazon's site says this is not a returnable item too!  However, I called them and explained the situation, and indicative of the fact that they realize how serious this could be, they told me to just keep the item and they refunded my money.  This is the worst case of false advertising I think I've ever seen considering what I said above, that most people willing to spend this much for all natural coloring have the potential to be seriously, and adversely affected by these chemicals!<br /><br />By the way, you might want to check out the organic and all natural colors at seelectteas.com instead.  I haven't called to verify that their ingredient list is indeed as it appears on the site, but if it is, they just contain water and vegetable juices.  The blue is made from gardenias.  Someone else who sells colors, who may have been trying to get me to order their product instead, said the seelectteas colors are of a lesser quality and that some of the ingredients are sourced from China and that gardenias have not been approved for this use by the FDA.  I left them a message but they were already closed.  Maybe I'll leave another post here after I talk to them to see if this is all true.  As far as the color goes, I don't care if it's not as bright if there are no chemicals.
