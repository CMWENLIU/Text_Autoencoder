First, with a Name like, "Floridas's Natural" I thought maybe they were made with fruit from, I don't know, FLORIDA!!!  Wrong! they are made in China. Aside from that, imagine a giant gummi bear run over by a steam roller.  These are not fruit leather, they are traslucent, molded strips of evaporated fruit juice that have 0% daily fiber, are 66% sugar by weight and have almost no nutritional value.
