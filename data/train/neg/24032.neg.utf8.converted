I thought I would give these a try since the nespresso caps are so tasty hence we go thru them quickly. Thought I would try a knock off for half the price. NOT worth it! Stick with the real thing or try another alternative because these are WEAK, WATERY and YUCKY. Maybe if I was try to ween myself off a nespresso habit but I am not so I do not enjoy them at all. :(<br />I tried the 3 strongest options and they were all week. Had to do short pulls and a 3:1 ratio was still not equal to 1 weak nespresso cap.<br />The shipping and service was great, just not the product. Plus to add insult, they dropped the price from 25$ a box down to 10$. At $10 try them yourself and you can taste disappointing brown water too!
