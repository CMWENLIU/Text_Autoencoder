I trained my chihuahua to a litter box when we got her at 10 weeks, she was 1 pound and at 6 months is only 2 pounds. I do not like that this is a paper product, paper does not break down as well as wood pellets.<br /><br />I used wood pellets, I get 40 pounds for 5.00 and it last me 5 months. When Foxy poos I clean that right out. the pee soaks right away into the wood pellets. (get wood pellets at the hardware or safeway for  pellet burning stoves)..So it never goes to the bottom. I put in 2 inches. There is absolutely NO order and I change it out about every 2 weeks.<br /><br />But training a dog to use a litter pan is extremely easy!!!
