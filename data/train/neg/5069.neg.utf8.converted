Jiffy Pop seems like a fun product and is easy to use but I would NOT recommend it due to the fact that partially hydrogenated oils are used in it. That's very unhealthy and not something you want to be feeding your children. You're better off popping your own popcorn and adding your own non-hydrogenated butter.
