Maybe it's just that I almost always buy skinless and boneless sardines packed in extra virgin olive oil but I found these sardines packed in water to be really mushy and fishy tasting.  I love sardines but was very disappointed by the flavor and consistency of these sardines.  And they are not cheap either so I'll try to use them by adding mayonaise (lots of mayonaise) in a sandwich to help disquise the truly unpleasant taste.  I will NOT be buying these packed in water ever again!  I don't know if those packed in water but manufactured by other companies are of the same quality.  They were truly...... 'ughhhh'.  Maybe you are use to this taste and mushy texture...so please continue eating this really healthy food.  Sardines are the lowest member of the mercury absorption chain so are better for you than the contaminated tuna these days.  I just can't even think of eating these particular canned sardines straight from the can for a snack ever again.....just thinking about doing this makes me feel sick!
