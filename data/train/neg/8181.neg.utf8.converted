After researching "roasted pig ears" for my beloved dog, I chose this product...the package arrived in a timely manner; the bag was so small and lightweight I couldn't believe it contained my order...Unfortunately it did. I didn't bother to un-tie the hand-knotted bag but put the LIGHTWEIGHT package back into the box in which it arrived and will now return them...For the price paid, I could go to one of the local pet supply stores and purchase MORE than 24 ears...and also would have an ear large enough to satisfy my large mix-breed pet! These ears are SMALL...while they appear to be ears, not strips, they are ridiculously small and have no weight to them. Color me disappointed. I thought about ordering another brand but this experience has made me gun-shy...or ear-shy !! Poor product; cheaply packaged in thin hand-knotted plastic bag...No thanks. My dog--and my wallet--deserve better !!
