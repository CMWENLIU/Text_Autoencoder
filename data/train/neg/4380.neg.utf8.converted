I have a great amount of experience with water kefir; have been producing it at home for many years and enjoying the great health benefits gained from drinking it daily.  I wanted to share this experience with a friend and thought to bring DEHYDRATED grains with me on a visit to get her started.  I did not want to travel a lond distance with wet grains (I could have shared my own) and thought it would be easier to bring them dried.  The product description here states that they are dehydrated grains...NOT true.  What I received was a padded manila envelope, a ziploc baggy with about 1 to 2 teaspoons of some very badly crushed, wet grains (looked like they got squished by the postage cancelling machine used by the Post Office), and a photocopy of instructions.  Not as described or pictured in this listing.  The grains smelled bad and so far, have not been able to produce good quality kefir.  Who is the product manufacturer...Real Man of Genius? It is most certainly not Cultures for Health as pictured.<br /><br /> "Each Packet of Water Kefir Starter Culture Contains: 2 teaspoons Live active water kefir culture in a dehydrated state (will rehydrate to 3-4 tablespoons of water kefir grains; sufficient to yield 2-3 quarts of water kefir every 24-48 hours). For additional information on this product, please contact the manufacturer."
