I love the regular Annie's Rice Mac and Cheese, but this stuff tastes artificial. The cheese has more resemblance to processed Velveeta oil-based cheese than the quality flavor I'm used to from Annie's.  Bottom line, the convenience isn't worth it.  Buy the powder version of Annie's Rice Mac and Cheese instead.
