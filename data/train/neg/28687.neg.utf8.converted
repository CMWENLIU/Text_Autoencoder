I ordered three sets of these from EntirelyPets.  I even called them to confirm that the $2.99 price was in fact for 24 of these and was told YES.  When my order arrived, it had only one per set, not 24.  They keep changing their price here from $2.99 with $5.98 shipping to $66.00 with free shipping.  It seems like a bait and switch to get more orders because if you look at their reviews, you'll find that others also purchased these for $2.99 for 24 and received only one.  I even called to confirm and was told I'd get what is stated, yet I didn't.  When I followed up with them after receiving my order, I was told it was a "price mistake". When a vendor keeps making the same "pricing mistake" over and over, you have to start to wonder if it's a mistake or a bait and switch.  The item is fine, but not worth $2.99 plus $5.98 shipping for ONE, especially when the site specifically states that it is for 24 and even their own customer service stated I would receive 24 per set ordered.  I am submitting this review to warn others and to highlight to Amazon what EntirelyPets is doing.
