Well, I have to admit to being very disappointed in this product.  I doubt that there is enough broccoli in it to constitute even one serving of vegetable in the total amount...  Actually, I am surprised that there is enough broccoli in there, to even allow it to be added to the description on the front of the package.  Yes, as one reviewer put it, there is a small packet of green dust.  sigh.  Bland unremarkable taste.  My skillet dinner looked nothing like the package front.  I will not bother trying any of the other Velveeta Cheesy Skillets, after trying this one!
