I was very much exited when I found this on Amazon. Away from my hometown Hyderabad one thing I missed the most is Genuine Hyderabadi biryani. I thought this would make up for it. But, when cut opened the pouch to heat the biryani I found a strange smell coming out of it. I heated the biryani in microwave for 2 minutes and tasted it. And let me tell you it was the worst hyderabad biryani I have ever tasted. I was so pissed off that I threw in in a trash can. The taste and smell of the biryani were so bad that you cant even eat 2 spoons. So, guys if you are looking for genuine hyderabad biryani stay away from this. Actually I would have given it a zero star if it had been there.
