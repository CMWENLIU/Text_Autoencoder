Like other reviewers, I bought this tea because the box clearly states "Formerly Indian Spiced Chai". It is absolutely disgusting. While I was first upset that it tasted nothing like the Indian Spiced Chai, that was quickly replaced by anger as I realized that what I was drinking simply tasted bad. Totally gross. DO NOT buy this if you're looking for chai, or even for a tea that tastes good. I wish I could give zero stars.
