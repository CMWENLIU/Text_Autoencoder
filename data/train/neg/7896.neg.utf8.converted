Very disappointed.  We love this cake and can only find the mixes when we visit family in Iowa.  We were so excited to see we could order on-line.  However, we ordered on 6/2/08 and when cake mixes arrived a few days later they had a "Best When Used By Date" of 06/06/08!!!! Imagine having to use 12 mixes in one day!  I hope they keep for a little while.  The first one we baked came out fine, so we'll see how the others do.
