They say 6pack of 16? This is not true. I got a one bag of this delicious tea.<br /><br />It says that it costs "$5.99 ($0.06 / count)" This would mean that there would be 96 counts. What? What counts as a count? and where are my other 80 counts?<br /><br />Although it is cheap, this is still false advertisement.
