I had been using this food mixed with the canned science diet for my lab puppy (because that is what the shelter had used), and didn't have any issues.  However, after reading the other review, I asked the manager at a local pet food store what he thought of this brand, and he said it was NOT good - all fillers (corn) and animal by-products.  He suggested I gradually shift the dog to Blue, which has a similar protein/carbohydrate mix, and then when the puppy is a bit older (around a year), move to a food with a higher protein content.  (To ease the puppy into a new diet, he suggested I start by mixing 1/4 cup new food with 3/4 old food for a few days, then half and half, etc).  He also recommended that I mix in a couple of tablespoons of canned food with some water, just to make the dry food moist.  (He said the nutritional content of the canned food isn't as important, since the dry food will provide most of the substance, and that I can vary the canned food.)  Finally, he also said that bully sticks are far better for dogs than rawhide (which are basically like eating leather).
