I really wanted to like this stuff but it tastes really bad. When I opened the jar and smelled it I thought I'd hit the low cal jackpot, it smells very chocolatey. However it tastes strange, king of like sour cocoa with a horrid chemical aftertaste. Ever use hairspray and get a mouthful of the residual fog by accident or get shampoo in your mouth? Imagine that that happened right after you took a swig of rancid cocoa and that's what this stuff tastes like. Sad thing is I bought this and several other WF products after reading a bunch of feel good reviews on the net. Seriously it tastes bad and I'm an avid consumer of low cal foods most people abhor, like Promise. Sheesh I ate it twenty minutes ago and my mouth still tastes like a mini Exon Valdez spilled in my mouth. Blech.
