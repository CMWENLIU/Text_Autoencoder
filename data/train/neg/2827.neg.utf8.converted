I sent a letter regarding this order a while ago about the bad batch I received, it was just awful tasting!  I never got a reply on what to do with it, so here it sits in the box it came in.  I have had problems with packaging on this item in the past and left feedback on that.  The packaging finally got better than this happened.  If I cannot get this resolved I am going to cancel all standing subscribe and save orders of this.  A shame because the honey is normally delicious.
