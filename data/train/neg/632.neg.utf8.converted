As a warning - I am not a vegan, I do not hug trees (though I do love them), and I really am not into the whole organic movement (though I have no problem with it).... If my stance on those three "issues" was different, I might love this product... as it is, I found it to be somewhat disgusting.<br /><br />I typically drink Meijer branded chocolate shake mix (Meijer is a western US mega-store & the shake mix is a knock-off of what slimfast puts in a can).  I hoped that this mix would taste at least somewhat (even a little bit) like the meijer brand.... The ways that I described this taste to my wife each morning... well, they aren't good... I'm listing a few:<br /><br />- It tasted like rope<br />- It tasted like licking a wet horses bridle<br />- It tasted like sucking the water out of a wet hemp bracelet<br />- It tasted like someone had mixed dirt in with my unsweetened baker's cocoa<br />- It tasted like chewing on tree bark<br /><br />In all seriousness, the "rope" & "wet hemp bracelet" analogies are the closest... I used to wear a lot of hemp (before doing so was part of the "organic" eating movement I guess?)... and I remember chewing on the necklace/bracelets.  This product tastes just like that.<br /><br />Another note - I was not impressed by the blending of this stuff.  Most shake mixes actually dissolve in liquid; this stuff just sorta clumped into the liquid.<br /><br />On the other hand, I ate (almost) all of it... and it was much more palatable once I mixed it in with the meijer shake mix (2 parts meijer mix, 1 part this stuff).  The fiber content is really high (always a plus).. and it was fairly reasonable.<br /><br />So, if you are into the earth loving hipster movement or are just a standard faire hippy - this stuff might be for you.  For Joe Six-pack (even the liberal type), this product should probably be avoided.
