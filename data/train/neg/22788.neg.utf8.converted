This assortment was AWFUL.  I received 10 of the same flavor of holiday flavors (I ordered after the holidays) as well of 5-6 of other flavors.  This picture shows 35 different varieties, but I only received a few different flavors.  Also, these were shipped in a brown paper bag which caused many of the cups to be damaged.  I am very very disappointed with this order.  I will never purchase anything from Deals on Call LLC through Amazon.  It's a shame Amazon doesn't monitor its vendors more closely.
