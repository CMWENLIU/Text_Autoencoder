I found this rather expensive product to be useless.  A $16 investment will only cover 80 square feet.  So, I used it sparingly around the perimeter of my lawn.  Over the next two days, raccoons continued to dig up the lawn.  I would look for other means to deter rodents... such as leaving out rags soaked in ammonia or sprinkling cayenne pepper on your lawn and plants.  These are effective but require persistent applications.
