Where to start~~ First of all I would like to say I have always loved Ritz crackers. Secondly I believe I'm at fault by not reading the reviews before I purchased this product. With a one and one half star out of five, I should've spent time in reading the reviews and why it didn't have a better rating. No one as of yet has mentioned the fact that it's not the same Ritz cracker that you would buy in the grocery store, at least to my knowledge. This product is clearly marked "made in China". There is no information on the website I could find that said this was an imported item. Thirdly, as other reviewers have mentioned, a lot of the product (package crackers) are broken as the other reviewers have mentioned. Last but not least-the taste. To me, who've been eating Ritz crackers ever since they came out, the taste is totally different than a partial box of Ritz crackers I had in my cupboard. The only way I can describe this is more of a wheat like taste very unlike the original American made Ritz cracker. I have to say though, that Amazon.com customer service was very good about this and refunded me the money I spent as I am a person who believes in buying as much American-made product as I can. I am not a complainer and most of the items I've received from Amazon's gourmet foods have been packaged well and are as described on Amazon.com's website accurately. If you are Chinese, please do not take offense to this as most of the electronic items in my home (name brand items like Samsung etc.) are made in China or another country outside of the United States. When it comes to food however, I prefer to stick to America-made products exclusively-does that make me a bad person?.<br /> I never thought at my age ( almost 70 years old and disabled) that I would be spending time writing reviews although I'm aware that most Americans would like to know where their food is made. That's about it and good luck shopping.
