I'm a big fan of Zevia sodas and drink several cans per day during the summer months. With that said and just to be fair, I have to tell you that I'm not a big root beer fan to begin with. In fact, I haven't drunk root beer in twenty years or more. So when I ordered Zevia's Ginger Root soda and tried my first can, I thought I was going to puke. This stuff tastes exactly like Pepto Bismol.<br /><br />But you have to remember something here, I'm not a fan of root beer, so maybe this is the way it's supposed to taste. I've read raving reviews about this flavor on other sites but it's just not for me. That's why I had to give it one star.<br /><br />My opinion is subjective like any other one, but if you like root beer, I think you won't be too disappointed because my taste buds tell me that they have a good product, but one I can't enjoy. I know how strange that must seem to you but I can appreciate something even though I may not like it on another level.
