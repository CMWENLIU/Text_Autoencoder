I would be extremely pleased with this popcorn if I had just ordered gourmet white cheddar popcorn.  Because the bag promised black truffles and white cheddar, however, I was ultimately disappointed with the product.  I'm a huge truffle fan, and I routinely order another brand of truffled popcorn that has a very strong truffle flavor and aroma.  This popcorn came in at around half the price, though, so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it was very difficult to detect either the taste or the scent of the black truffles used in this popcorn.  It was overwhelmingly cheesy, and I would have been very happy with it if I weren't looking for something with a bit of truffle flavor, too.<br /><br />My recommendation would be to save your money.  Good white cheddar popcorn can be had for much less money, and if you want truffled popcorn, you're just going to have to go elsewhere.
