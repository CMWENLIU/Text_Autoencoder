I bought this injector as it looked like a good design.  However, the needle hub and syringe hub are plastic.  The needle hub cracked.  I returned the injector for a like replacement.  Today, the hub on the needle cracked again. Most discouraging when you are in the middle of the injection process.  Until needle hub and syringe are manufactured in other than plastic, I would not recommend this product.
