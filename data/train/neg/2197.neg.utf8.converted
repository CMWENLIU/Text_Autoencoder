Bought two six-packs about a year ago. Today we're down to five working bulbs. Three of them were unusable out of the package due to flickering/buzzing problems. The rest have died during normal use. Really like the light color and efficiency, but these bulbs definitely don't last long at all for the price. Pretty disappointing.
