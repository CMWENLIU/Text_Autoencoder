Every piece in the bag has melted and cooled down enough to stick to the wrapper. Kit Kats don't break, chocolate stuck to the wrappers, and disappointment all around. I've ordered chocolate from Amazon for a while, but this is the first time it happened. I'll make sure it won't happen again... just go to the store to get chocolate.
