What I was expecting was ground vanilla beans and maybe a small amount of preservative.  Nope, this contains Dextrose, Silicon Dioxide, and Vanilla Bean Extractves.<br /><br />If I wanted sugar or sand I would have asked for them.  As it is, the vanilla taste and aroma is almost non-existant.  Another opened container bound for the trash can.
