I ordered the Get Well Soon Chicken Soup Tote - Gourmet Food Gift basket to be delivered to my sister following her surgery.  I asked for her comments on the gift; she said that many of the items were stale.  It was cute, but I will not order this item again.<br />I wrote to the supplier about this and never received a reply of any kind.<br />I tried to find something different, but this one is not worth it.
