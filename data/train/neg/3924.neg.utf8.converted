Raw Cacao has a high Vitamin C content. This product has O% if you look at the label on the back.<br />Within the last year they covered up where it used to say Vitamin C with Vitality. If you look closely on some of the older packages, you can pull the Vitality sticker off that is covering up the vitamin C label. Which means that it has been cooked/processed in some way that removed that natural occurring Vitamin C.<br />I only use the highest quality cacao, from reputable sources. Less quality, Other "raw" cacao beans on the market are not only of cheap forastero cacao varieties, they also are contaminated with several types of dangerous bacteria (remember cacao is a tropical crop where microbe contamination is more difficult to control).<br />Remember you get what you pay for. Quality usually comes with a price. So check your facts before going cheap.
