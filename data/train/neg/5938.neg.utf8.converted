I was drawn in by the "tastes just like peanut butter", and decided to purchase this at our local store. My peanut allergic daughter was so excited to try it, but we were both sadly disappointed. We did not like the flavor at all, and she refused to eat it on a sandwich. In fact, all three of my kids did not like it. Our house definitely prefers sunflower seed butter to this alternative.
