We got this for our 6 yr old lab who tends to pee all over our small city back yard killing what little grass we have. I am disappointed that he has no interest in the post at all. He thought it was a toy when we were putting it in and my 2 yr old shows more interest in it than him and I constantly have to keep her away from it. The post also has a strong smell of urine when u get it out of the box. I don't recommend it.
