The new package which indicates Microwave or oven bake for a 10 oz deep dish is a lie.  I followed the directions to the letter and the crust was so hard it couldn't be broken with a hammer and the center was still cold.  Since it would be absurd to turn on the oven to bake such a small pizza for 20-25 minutes to serve one person.  That makes both cooking methods impractical and therefore the product is essentially useless and a total ripoff.  I won't get my money back, but maybe you can save yours.
