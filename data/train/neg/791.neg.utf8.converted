Overly sweet w/ a slight fizzy touch on the tongue. My husband and 4 year old appeared to like it, but overall I could barely take a couple of gulps.<br /><br />It reminded me too much like candy.<br /><br />I would not recommend this item personally, but some may find the drink enjoyable w/ the combination of juice and carbonate.
