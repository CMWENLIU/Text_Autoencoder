This was a big disappointment for me. I had long wanted to once again enjoy the "energy sticks" I remembered from my childhood, so I added one of these on to an order. Not only was it not the same format I had as a child (we had something about the diameter of a regular tootsie roll, and about 6" long, whereas this was about 3 to 4 times that diameter and could be broken into 4 sections), but it did NOT have the same taste at all. I know we sometimes inflate the wonderfulness of things in our memories, but this was definitely not the same thing we had as children. I'm not sure if this is just a different thing altogether, or if this is a poor remake of that, but I was very disappointed. It didn't taste horrible, but it sort of tasted like it had had itself been around since the 70s and was similar to any high-protein bar around -- definitely NOT worth the price!
