Advertisement for tea says it is strong and flavorful.  The taste must be quite subtle.  The tea, when steeping, presents with a deep reddish brown color.  The aroma is quite mild.  I brew an 8 cup pot; with one heaping tbsp. At 4 minutes the flavor is to mild.  This is brewing as reccommended.  To get an adequate taste I brew 6 cups with 2 rounded tbsps. for 5 minutes.  This is the upper limit of their strength recommendations.  Well; what do I hsve?  At any level of brewing I either have a wimpy cup or one so bitter no pleasurable flavor could be discerned.  This is the first Davidson's tea that I have not liked.  I can not recommend it to anyone.  Purchased at Amazon.  Arrived quickly in good condition.  Surprisingly little dust and sweepings size particles.
