I purchased this even after a few other reviewers mentioned that there is a fake sweetener taste thinking it would be ok but the taste is really overwhelming. If you are ok with drinking diet soda you will be ok with these. If not I would stay away. I keep trying to feed these to guest but with very poor luck :-).
