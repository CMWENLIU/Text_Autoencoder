We cold brew our own freshly ground coffee all the time, and thought we'd try this as a way to have some concentrate on hand for those times when we've come up short. Maybe it's the chicory in the formulation, but this isn't close to being an acceptable substitute for what we make ourselves. Until we read the ingredients listing we thought it must have alcohol in it for a preservative. We didn't finish the bottle. An extra star for convenience is all it gets.
