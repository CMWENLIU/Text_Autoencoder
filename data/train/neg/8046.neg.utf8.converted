Not until I received this package did I realize that "light sodium" was another way of saying "reduced portion size".  A pretty cheap gimmick that I thought was beneath the Dr McDougall's Foods people.  I guess I should be more careful to look for "reduced sodium recipe" when I buy these products, but I still felt deceived.<br /><br />The flavor is pretty good, but the portion cup doesn't live up to what I've come to expect from Dr McDougall's soups.
