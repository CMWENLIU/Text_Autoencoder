Shame on Nature Valley for trying to pull the wool over our eyes!  If you were a fan of these bars when they first came out, then be warned.  The recipe has changed and the bars are much different and NOT for the better.  Not only are they much smaller, they also contain far fewer nuts/fruit and the bar itself now has an airier consistency like the Rice Krispie's treat.<br /><br />How do I know all this?  I bought these bars on a regular basis from Costco and still had some leftover bars from the first batch and I was able to compare them side by side.  These were always my favorite hiking snack and now they aren't much better than every other bar out there.  I think Nature Valley will quickly regret its decision once they realize that their are a lot of unhappy customers.  I'd gladly pay a little extra if it meant keeping the bars the way they were.<br /><br />If you don't believe me then by all means buy them and judge for yourself.
