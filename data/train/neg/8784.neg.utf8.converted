this stuff is horrible!! smells like wax and has some really fake chemical flavor or some kind of spice.. i would recommend that this gets gets used for lab rats only to see the effects of the main ingredient RED#40. unfortunately this is not a returnable item from Amazon so now the local dump has an additional 12lbs of garbage that will never decompose
