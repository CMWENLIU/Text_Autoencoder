I love Stacy's Pita Chips- buy them all the time at grocery store so I know what they should look like and how they should taste. Unfortunately Amazon shipped them in the display box which was open when I received it. All of the chips are in a million pieces. (I also have to give kudos also to the FedEx guy who literally tossed the box on the front porch). Although the expiration date is two months away they taste stale- which makes me wonder how they were stored. I will continue to buy them at the grocery- fresh and whole! It's not Stacy's fault.
