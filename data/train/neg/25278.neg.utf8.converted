This bread tastes great because it isn't low carbohydrate it's a very high carbohydrate product that should be in the candy isle.  One slice of this bread made my blood sugar go up 50 points.  I ate two slices the second time and it went up 105 points. It took a while for me to figure out what was causing this dramatic increase. I looked at the label only after I ate it because I still believe in the honesty of our business culture. How can a company sell bread like this when the label is an outright lie? This bread probably has 40 carbs in each slice. I shouldn't have to do my own test on everything I eat. I should be able to trust that what it says on the label is fairly close to the truth. This company should be investigated.
