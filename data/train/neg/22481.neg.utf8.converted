Loved the product at first. It was so easy and convenient. However, I noticed that it took forever to grind up things that are little tougher or has a skin like green beans or peas compared to my food processor.<br /><br />Then I read some reviews regarding brown water coming out of the steaming unit. And when I checked my Baby Cook to my surprise found brown stuff on the bottom of the water heating unit. Was able to clean off a little bit but it is not designed to be cleaned easily. Thought the expense was for convenience but if the water reservoir can not be easily kept clean...I have no use for the it. Especially since it doesn't even grind as well as my food processor.<br /><br />Called the company to have it returned today. Hope it won't be a hassle.
