I just received my order (Orbit Cinnamint Sugarfree Gum, 14-Piece Packs (Pack of 12) Sold by: Potential Dynamix LLC.  I was surprised to see the packaging which indicated "Limited Edition" with a bright green florescent sticker on each individual pack of gum.  I thought this promotion had ended months ago so the gum couldn't be very fresh.  I was totally correct.  The promotion was between 2/11 and 5/11, according to the writing on the pack; today is 7/25/11!  The gum was hugely stale; barely chewable. I will NOT order from these folks again.  This was blatantly bad business (selling an obviously stale product), like selling a "use by" date that is 1/2 year old!
