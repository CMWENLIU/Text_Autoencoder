After getting fed up with catching insects crawling in my room, I decided to give this product a try. The instructions are pretty simple and the product seemed promising. I placed a trap in every corner of every room and hoped it would take care of my insect problem. It has been a week since the traps were placed and nothing has been caught. The pests that it was supposed to trap are actually crawling over it, under it, beside it, anywhere except in it. Needless to say this has been a major disappointment.
