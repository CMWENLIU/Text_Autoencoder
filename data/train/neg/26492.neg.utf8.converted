This product is MADE IN CHINA, it is on all the packages. If I could do less stars on this review I would.  I wouldn't feed my dog food made in China so why would anyone want to eat this or give it to their children, I wouldn't use any product that was edible or could be absorbed through my skin that was made in China(and certainly not as a willing purchase from an American company touting themselves as "America's Leading Brand of Freeze Dried Fruit Snack").  run people, run!
