We have ordered these truffles in the past and thoroughly enjoyed - found them to be of  high quality.  We especially liked having them on hand when guests dropped by.<br /><br />  HOWEVER, we had never  ordered from this seller before and these truffles arrived melted with chocolate oozing out of the paper wraps.  The bag had  also been squashed so that chocolate spotted the inside of the bag.  These were  shipped unprotected in a plain cardboard box.<br /><br />  The seller did not respond to  our emails.  Only after we contacted Amazon did they refund our  payment.  Never again!
