Plant showed up about a week after ordering and was covered in a white fungus or mold.. I don't know what to do about it and I don't want to put it near my other plants. I bought it from 9greenbox and I contacted them but am waiting to hear back from them.. The tree does not look like the photo at all and is in a pot that seems way too small for the tree. The tree seems rather weak looking in terms of health and beauty..  I was looking forward to it and was hoping I would get the brussels tree from brussels because the last bonsai I had bought was actually from them and was a great plant.. Do not buy from this seller if you are looking to get the brussels tree..
