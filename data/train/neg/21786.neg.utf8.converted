I normally always buy their 30 pack of regular bully sticks http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012UG416/ref=oss_product but when I saw the deal on these thicker bully sticks I decided to try them out. Unfortunatley, they sent me 25 of their regular bully sticks. I guess they thought I would not notice. do not make the mistake of getting these, go with the 30 pack.
