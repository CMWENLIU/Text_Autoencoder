I bought this because I love peanut butter, and am looking to eat healthier. First taste wasn't that bad...but the more I ate the more it started to gross me out haha I guess if you used it on a PB&J sandwich it wouldn't be so bad, but I was eating it with like apples and it just wasn't tasting good. I wasn't really thinking when I bought it.
