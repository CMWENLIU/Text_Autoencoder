Very unimpressive for smoked salmon.  Filet still had the skin on it, found bones (remember this is supposed to be a filet), so much fish oil in the package (once opened it was more of a mess than a treat.  Was no better than a can of salmon, except at much higher price tag.  I was expecting a "gourmet food product" and was highly disappointed.
