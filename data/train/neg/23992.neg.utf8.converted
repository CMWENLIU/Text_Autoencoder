Hershey's supply line comes from West Africa where there is a prevalence of child slavery in the cocoa bean industry. They continually refuse to make their supply line transparent or implement changes to guarantee the safety of children.<br /><br />Don't think this is relevant to a product review? Consider if it was your child, friend, relative who lived in slavery - would you want people buying products harvested by them?<br /><br />It is no surprise that people do not find this review helpful.  Why would we ever want to know that our affluence and comfort is the result of abusing children?  Please let us go on in ignorance!!
