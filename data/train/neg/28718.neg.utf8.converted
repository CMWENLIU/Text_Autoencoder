I tried 5 Hour Energy for the first time today. Waking up quite groggy, I drank the whole thing at around 10am on my way to a meeting. I had the orange flavor, and while it wasn't the tastiest thing I've ever had, it wasn't the worst, either. Anyway, after seeing these commercials for years, the only reason I actually decided to buy one to try was because of all the surprisingly positive reviews here on Amazon. I took it fully expecting it to work... and it didn't. I did feel a slight perk, about what you'd expect from drinking a little less than half of a coffee, and given that the shot contains roughly the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee, that's no surprise. For the following 5 hours, I felt...pretty normal -- normal as in, "I don't feel any more energetic right now than any other day." I don't know how they get away with selling these little shots for $3 retail (about half that here on Amazon, if you buy in bulk), but you should save your money and just drink a cup of coffee, instead.
