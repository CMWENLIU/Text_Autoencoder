I bought the 2-pack of this product as I love to use garlic but hate peeling the stuff, so I use garlic powder extensively in my cooking. I bought this product thinking, wow this will last a long time and since it's Durkee it must be good !<br /><br />This product is so salty that it ruined a whole pot of all-beef chili that I just made which is a terrible waste of time and money.<br /><br />I have used garlic powder for years and because I need to restrict my salt intake, I have avoided garlic salt for those same years which is easy to do when the product is properly marked.<br /><br />Since lots of people like garlic salt, I don't know why Durkee didn't just market this product as garlic salt which trust me, it is.  And salty garlic salt at that.<br /><br />If you're a garlic lover like me, avoid this product like the plague.
