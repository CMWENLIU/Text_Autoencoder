I agree with the other reviews that said this did not have enough spice, not at all.  I mean when I buy a chocolate that has chili in it, I expect it to have a kick, but this had no spice or even a little bit of a kick to it.  It just tasted like chocolate.  If you want a good chocolate bar with chili that you can actually taste then I would suggest "Chuao Chocolate Bar: Spicy Maya"  It is so good and amazing!!!  Dont get me wrong, this is a great chocolate but dont expect a chili kick to it.
