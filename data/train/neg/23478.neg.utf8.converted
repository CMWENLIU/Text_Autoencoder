Sorely disappointed in this purchase. Price not too bad, easy to make and pretty convenient but yuk yuk my poor unsuspecting mouth. tasted like salt and not coconut at all. I tried 1 tbsp per package recommendation then moved on to multiple tbsp to see if that made a difference, sadly it did not. the following is a much better dessicated coconut drink:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PI32BA">Ajmera Coco Energy Instant Coconut Water, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 3)</a>
