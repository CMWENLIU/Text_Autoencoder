You are getting quantity over quality in this pack.  I purchased this and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E20E">Rishi Tea Organic Jasmine Pearl Loose Tea, 3-Ounce Tin (Pack of 2)</a> by accident at the same time.  I prefer Rishi over Adagio.  But I believe Rishi is a bit more expensive.  So if you want quantity go with this. Quality go with something else.<br />It's OK, just not recommendable.
