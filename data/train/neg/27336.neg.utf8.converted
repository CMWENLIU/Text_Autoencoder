Trader Joe's carried an identical product over the holidays and sold it for just $9.95. The $49.95 price is quite excessive for just 1 pound of chocolate. I was terribly disappointed with the TJ product because most of the flavors left a horrible finish (after taste) in my mouth. You should not have to pay an incredible $50 for a pound of chocolate, even if each package is single-origin. Buy some 100g bars of Valrhona at $3-5 each as the experience is much better.
