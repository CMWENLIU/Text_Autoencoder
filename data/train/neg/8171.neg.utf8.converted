This oil is substandard for cooking.  I've been cooking primarily in coconut oil for over a year now, and have tried many brands.  Most good oil has a very light flavor, maybe a bit buttery, but not overwhelming.  This oil has a very distinct coconut flavor, similar to the meat or milk of the coconut.  This renders it useless for cooking almost everything.  It's just not a clean oil.  The only redeeming factor for this product (which pushes it up to two stars from one) is the fact that it adds amazing flavor to dishes with tropical flavors like many Thai and curry recipes.  It makes them absolutely great, but spend your money elsewhere if you're looking for a coconut oil for general sauteing and frying.
