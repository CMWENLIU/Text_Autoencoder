I love Ezekiel bread so I thought I would give the pasta a try. I am giving two stars because the ingredients are great. Unfortunately, the texture is like wet cardboard. I will be going back to regular whole wheat pasta when I finish choking down the other 5 boxes of this pasta-shaped abomination.
