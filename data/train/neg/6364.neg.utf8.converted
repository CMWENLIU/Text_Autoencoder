I thought I would give this one a try since it is cheaper by the ounce and has good reviews.<br /><br />I suppose it has a better outcome for others.  For me, it gave the feeling of alertness and coherence, but I did feel a strong crash after four hours of consumption.  The other major brands did not do this to me.<br /><br />Red Rain is a huge disappointment for and I will not be investing in this one again.
