I put my cat on Evo for 2 years, she got a urinary tract infection.I had to change her food. Right after I changed her food. I found out Evo is terrible for animals, the food is causing alot of health problems and death.I got a letter in the mail stating there is a lawsuit against Innova Evo plus all Natura products.I'm currently in the lawsuit myself.. Evo lied about the ingredients in all their products...DO NOT BUY EVO AND NATURA PRODUCTS!!! (such as Innova Evo, California Natural, Healthwise, Mother Nature, and Karma Dog)Google it, it's called PetproductsSettlement.com.. It's for a $2,150,000 settlement
