Where should I start?? The one truly good thing I can say is that I've been a customer of Amazon for several years, and as always their shipping was prompt and accurate, I do not in any way hold Amazon accountable for my dissatisfaction with this product. That being said, I ordered this for my parents to give as a gift to someone else. When it arrived, I was appalled!! First of all, this being the HOLIDAY season, I was shocked that this was wrapped with a light green and gold bow with BLACK ribbon, looking more like a Halloween or fall gift! Even worse was the fact that the keepsake box looked NOTHING like what was advertised. You can see that it is supposed to be a cream colored leather box, but that is not what arrived....what arrived was a black and gray fabric box with a black leather lid, and very cheaply made. There is no covering (material or otherwise on the inside) just green cardboard, and the same for the bottom. After taking inventory of the items listed to be in the box, yes, they were all there.<br /><br />Perhaps worse than the quality of the box, the wrapping, and the fact that the keepsake box is not as advertised is what occurred when I called customer service at Art of Appreciation. I politely explained that I was unhappy with the box, and that it was nothing like the picture. The customer service lady stated that sometimes they had to substitute if they ran out. (Note that nowhere does it say in the description: subject to change). Upon giving her my order number, she said she could not help me because that was Amazon's number, so I would have to deal with them.....(really??? it's still their product???) I pointed out that they had the same picture on their own site, and asked if I ordered another of the same item but through THEM, what kind of box would I receive?  She said she would check with her manager, and came back with a description of the same piece of junk I had received. I said I strongly suggest they change their picture, because I am sure they will have a lot of displeased customers. Her response was to tell me they "hadn't had time".....really?? I know of it being advertised at least 3 weeks this way, and there hasn't been time to change the pic?? Needless to say, the response about the ribbon was useless, with the response being: I understand, I wouldn't be happy with those colors either. (Gee, thanks!) There was no attempt to please me as a customer whatsoever, not even a cursory apology, I was simply told several times that she couldn't help me because Amazon bought the product from them.....not satisfactory to me, since it is their product with their name on it, and obviously came shrink-wrapped by them! Finally, I found it completely laughable (and actually had to bite my tongue) when her reasoning for not being able to help me was that due to the order number belonging to Amazon and not Art of Appreciation, she couldn't help me BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE MY NAME OR ADDRESS!!! I had to bite my tongue to not respond: get a pen and paper if it's not too much trouble, because I'm fairly certain that "I" CAN GIVE YOU MY NAME AND ADDRESS....the only reason I did not, was because it was very apparent that she was not willing to help. At this time it has been over two days since that phone call, as you can see for yourself.....they are STILL advertising an INCORRECT PICTURE.<br /><br />The ONLY reason I did not contact Amazon to return this was because my parents did not have the desire to fool around with shipping it back and shopping for another gift. However I am quite certain that if I had, Amazon would have been much more helpful to deal with.
