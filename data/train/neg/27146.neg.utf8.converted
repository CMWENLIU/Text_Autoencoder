I bought this based on other reviews. Wow, I'm disappointed. Maybe, (let's give them the benefit of the doubt), I got a bad batch. I knew something was up when I opened the bag and smelled how skunky it was. Thought, hmm, that doesn't smell much like coffee. Not fresh roasted anyhow. Brewing in my Bialetti was a big disappointment. Tasted like it smelled, old socks. Weird aftertastes. I drink my coffee black so it is of course less forgiving. Perhaps one can get by with crutches to mask the flavor but it shouldn't be necessary. I'm going to cut this with espresso beans to mask the flavor somewhat and try not to feel to bad about my wasted purchase. Will not buy any of their products again.
