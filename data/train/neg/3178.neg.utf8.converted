I love this product!  My kids drink it instead of sports drinks when they play soccer.  It is much healthier for them.<br /><br />But, twice I have received this from Amazon and both times the product was poorly packaged. Both times there was NO PADDING and the cartons got crushed in shipping.  1 or more of the cartons had a leak.  Amazon responded well by shipping replacement cartons.  But they still had no padding and had leaks!<br /><br />I would like to continue to buy this from Amazon if they can figure out how to package it so the cartons don't get crushed!
