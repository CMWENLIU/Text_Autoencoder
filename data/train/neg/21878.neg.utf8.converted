This item was extremely disappointing.The boxes were damaged. The boxes were filled with filler (paper, styrofoam, etc) to make them look full and therefore there were very little sweets in the boxes! Not worth the price for the amount of goodies. Would have returned it if I had received it earlier, but unfortunately I didn't and had to give it as a birthday present anyway. It was embarassing! Don't waste your money on this.
