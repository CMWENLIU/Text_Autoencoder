Have used the sugar-free Hazelnut syrup for a couple years now. Just got this 3-pack and discovered the flavor is waaay different; and not in a good way if you liked the original. The new product is quite 'artificial' tasting. Called Torani's and was told that 'yes' the formula had been changed and there had been so many complaints that they will soon be releasing the original flavor again (which has a richer, more mellow taste) but under the name 'Classic Hazelnut'. We will order again when it comes out...
