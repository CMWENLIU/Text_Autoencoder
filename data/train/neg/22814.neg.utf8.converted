I am sure this is wonderful coffee for use in some other type of coffee pod machine, however, these pods do not work in my Melitta One:One Machine. I tried about 4 times and got very weak coffee (not even coffee, just what looked like tan water). My Melitta One:One works fine with Melitta Coffee Pods, but I wanted to try Lavazza. Beware, not all coffee pods are alike.
