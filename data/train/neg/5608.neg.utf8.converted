I had been buying these for several years.  As other reviewers stated, it usually took 3 tablets in a large glass of water to obtain the desired taste. The flavor was indeed ROOTBEER, without the effervescence. They were palatable, and tasted fine well chilled. Must have been satisfactory as I continued to purchase them in bulk (5-6 of the 6-12 pack boxes 2-3 times per year).<br /><br />The recent batch however, was a different story.  The concoction is now cloudy when mixed up. The flavor is what I would expect from gatorade if it had not flavoring added--the salty electrolyte with an aftertaste. Negative rootbeer flavoring, but a VERY faint taste of COLA.  It was simply dreadful.<br /><br />I am still awaiting a response from Fizzies as to what happened
