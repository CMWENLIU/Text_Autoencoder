I just purchased this in a store, thinking it was still Organic Zero, and it's no longer organic, nor does it say from what it's made on the package.  Used to be just made from sugar cane...could be made from corn, like other Erythritol products are...does say it's Non-GMO, but all bets are off IMO, since we don't know what is used to make it anymore.  I will be returning the one I have...very disappointed!
