This product is terrible.<br /><br />I use different types of bread mix in an automatic machine.  This bread did not rise at all.  I used 3 different packages out of the 6 and all were bad.  Basically<br />the bread did not rise.  I switched to another brand and the loaf came out fine.  Be warned...  not a great product.  Basically cooked a loaf that looked like a<br />softball.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!
