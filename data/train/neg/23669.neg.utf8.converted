I am not exaggerating. First off though, I have to mention that i bought a can of this stuff, not the one pictured here. Second, I am probably the least picky person in the world when it comes to junk food so my standards are not very high at all. Third, I have always loved Chef Boyardee products, I was practically raised on them. But when i tried this stuff for the first time, I could not eat more than the first spoonful, and even that was tough to get down. I have to wonder if i purchased a bad can (it didnt look like it though) because this macaroni and cheese tasted like bitter METAL. I am not joking, god honest truth. It didn't taste rancid it just tasted BITTER. I can't imagine even a homeless starving person wanting to eat this. If that is really what the flavor was supposed to be, I have NO idea how they expect kids to eat this stuff. it is absolutely horrible and I can't believe this product sells at all.
