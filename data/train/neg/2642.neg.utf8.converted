This oil was something else a decade or so ago. It was also pricier. When I recently bought it at a local Indian grocer, I was surprised the price had dropped significantly. Hair oils in India are traditionally coconut oil mixed with other essential herbs, extracts etc - which is what I assumed Dabur's would be too. What a disappointment to find this only but an unhelpful formula of 1. Canola oil 2. Paraffinum Liquidum (a fancy name for Mineral oil) 3. Palm Glycerides (Solids as byproducts from hydrogenating Palm oil)...search the internet for contra-indications for these and it should steer you far away...Goes to show, bigger brands are not necessarily better (DABUR is huge in India)Unfortunately my purchase was not from Amazon and I ended up tossing it - so no refund.<br /><br />I would highly recommend pure coconut oil: you can use essential oils to add to its perfume, but sometimes I even use Azulene oil on my scalp. Works like a charm for oily, greasy scalp days...<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Easy-clean-easy-Azulene/dp/B00011JN56/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1291331352&sr=8-1
