This bottle looked exactly like the front label that is on a current bottle of Hollywood safflower oil I have. They do not show you the back label where it states amt. of polyunsaturated fat (only 2 when needed 7+), or any other info. In my opinion, this is deceitful. Are they trying to taking advantage of those looking for the safflower oil that Dr. Oz refers to on his show. I believe it is why they don't show the back label, but just the front. Amazon and all vendors of this and any other food product should show all the information, front and back labels. I am so disappointed in Amazon that I can't say I would purchase from them again. I now have three bottles of safflower oil that will not be used and I am out $20+ because it cannot be returned. ANYONE LOOKING FOR THIS PRODUCT GET THE CLA FROM COSTCO made by Trunature. IT IS MADE WITH PURE SAFFLOWER OIL. I HAVE BEEN USING IT AND IT WORKS. It is about $20 for a bottle of 160 or 180 softgels. I just thought I could get something a little cheaper. I wouldn't buy CLA on Amazon. It is more expensive.[...] is the place to go if you have an account. Otherwise, try Truenature.com I hope others weren't suckered like I was. I guess I should have inquired before purchase, if that is possible.
