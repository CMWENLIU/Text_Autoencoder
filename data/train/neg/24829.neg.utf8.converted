As a diabetic, I appreciate having alternatives to white table sugar.  I can't get through winter without teas and coffees, and I can't seem to drink those without some sort of sweetener.  I was really excited to try this when I saw it in the store, however this was NOT the sugar alternative I was looking for!  Not only did it taste "funny" in my drinks, it also left a disgusting aftertaste.  If I had to choose between Truvia and table sugar, I'd take the sugar, despite diabetes and its associated health risks.  Truvia was truly THAT unpleasant!
