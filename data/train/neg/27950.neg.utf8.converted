I've order the Seasame Blues before and thought they were great. The 7.5 ounce bags are round compared to the triangles. When you open the bag you get a strong odor of bad oil. The taste also has the bad oil to it. Unfortunately I sent a box to my sister after bragging about them. I called company but no word yet.
