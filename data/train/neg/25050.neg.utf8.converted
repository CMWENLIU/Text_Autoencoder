Under normal circumstances, I can begrudgingly stomach "diet" drinks, but this is probably the worst drink that I've ever had in my life.  It tastes like what I imagine cleaning products to taste like.  The "sweetener," which they added way too much of, actually leaves a noticeably bitter aftertaste.  I would much rather drink just lemon water with no sugar added, as a healthy and palatable alternative.  Horrible, just horrible...
