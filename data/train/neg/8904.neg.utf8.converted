I would love it if I could buy Bob's of Red Mill Products.  Unfortunately, they process their items on non-dedicated equipment and our family is tree nut and peanut allergic as well as gluten free.  The sad thing is that this company is slowly moving the competition off the grocery store shelves and making it more and more expensive to find safe alternatives.  We buy from Gluten Free Oats
