I bought this and fed this mix to my baby for months under the assumption that the packaging, which stated 120% RDA of Iron was correct.  No.  Actually, according to Ella's Kitchen's website there is only 4%!  A huge difference!!!!!!  I am gobsmacked there wasn't a sticker on the box or an email from Amazon.  Shame on the Ella's Kitchen AND Amazon!  Iron is so crucial to a baby's growth and development.  What a terrible thing to let slide.  Leaving a Mama thinking one important nutritional category was covered.  I am furious!
