WARNING: NO matter what this picture shows, this is NOT a TIN !!! I only ordered this as I thought I was getting the TIN of quality street like it states in the picture AND description. All I received was the 2lb plastic jar container !!!<br /><br />I'm not in the UK anymore but ordered this as I wanted the TIN to put under the Xmas tree to rekindle an old Christmas tradition like we did many years ago when I was younger... Safe to say that won't happen this year !!!!<br /><br />Giving a rating of 1 as it will not allow me to give 0 !
