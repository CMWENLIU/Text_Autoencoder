Well, we just opened our box for a New Years breakfast.  Not what I expected.  First, there was no wooden box.  Secondly, it was not the typical smoked salmon we are used to.  As stated previously, this is packed in brine liquid.  The fish did not appear to be smoked in either flavor or appearance.  Although it is salmon, it tastes and smells more like a can of tuna.  I give one star only because ZERO is not an option.  I will not purchase this again.
