I tried this syrup just to avoid all the calories in regular maple syrup. I used a moderate amount on my pancakes and thought it tasted pretty good. About an hour after eating, I began to paying the price for consuming a product containing maltitol as the sweetener. I've never had so much gas and intestinal discomfort (for about 8 hours). These are well known side-effects of consuming this sugar alcohol and I am quite surprised it's been mentioned in only 1 other review of this product on Amazon. Just Google "maltitol side effects" and you'll get the picture. In my opinion, this product should be not be sold until it is reformulated with another sweetener. There are much better sweeteners than maltitol.
