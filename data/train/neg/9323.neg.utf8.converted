My mom and I have been drinking this coffee for years and absolutely love it.  It is well-priced, tastes great, and it's easy to keep in the office to make at work - not to mention way less money than heading to a coffee shop.  BUT, I really hate the new packet format.  First of all, one packet really isn't enough for me for a good cup.  Second, they are annoying to open.  And most importantly, these are the opposite of environmentally friendly.  Why do we need all the excess packaging?<br /><br />Bring back the canisters!
