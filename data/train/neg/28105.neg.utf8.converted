I used these Frontier brand seeds (ordered from amazon) on a couple of occasions recently for tea and was NOT impressed.  I order the same frontier seeds from other vendors and they are good quality for PST, but maybe this batch of froniter seeds that amazon currently has (in their Tennessee warehouse) have been washed or something.  They do not do the job at all.  Quite unfortunate really, considering the price and prime shipping.<br /><br />I will reorder in about 6 weeks and update this review then on the quality of the seeds when I try them again.  I hope this will be useful advice, leave a comment if you have any questions about other vendors and such.<br /><br />EDIT: I just received another order 03/02/12,  and unfortunately they are the same seeds as before.  The seeds are almost all grey with only a couple of black seeds here and there.  The good quality frontier seeds are the other way around ie: mostly black with some grey seeds.
