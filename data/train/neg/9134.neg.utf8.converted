Our Great Pyrenees has to take antibiotics for three weeks and figured out the cheese trick after a few tries.  So I bought these, and he chewed the greenie and spit the pill out.  His mother will down almost any food without swallowing, but my dog insists on chewing, therefore, he finds the pill.  Waste of money.<br /><br />If your dog is a "chewer", I'd think twice.
