Purchased two boxes in the past. Latest order tasted very different and was stale (kind of had a moldy taste but no visible mold). Called Mrs. May's and they said there was nothing they could do about it. These are a product of China and the bars tasted really different like they had bad ingredients or had gone bad. Mrs. May's representative was not concerned and treated me like I was trying to scam them. Great product idea but I won't be buying any of their products in the future. Read the label and consume at your own risk.
