i've been feeding my cats wellness for over six tears. i tried for a change. they weren't at all fond of this food. and as i read in other reviews they tended to leave the chunks of fruit and veggies behind in the bowl. i only fed them about a fourth of the bag, bought wellness again and gave the rest of the bag to my neighbor. i wanted this food to be well liked by my kitties, but it wasn't. they weren't into the soft food, either. but, they do LOVE the organix cheddar treats. sorry i couldn't say better things. i wouldn't recommend this food and will never purchase it again.
