Why does this bone have to contain chicken meal and poultry flavor???  It's a PEANUT BUTTER bone.  The reason I purchased it is because it was advertised as PEANUT BUTTER.  My dog has a chicken sensitivity and would've gotten the runs like mad had I not read the label before giving it to him.  Rather than return it because the shipping would've cost the same as what I paid for the item, I took the filling out and gave him the plain bone.  I'll refill it with some regular Jiff if need be.  It would've been helpful for the company to disclose the ingredients in these so-called peanut butter flavored things.  Chicken is not peanut butter.
