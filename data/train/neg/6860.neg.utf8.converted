I got this Chantea thinking my Mother and I might like as a change from colas. She would not taste it after looking closely at it. I drank as much as I could bear. I cannot stress enough how nasty this Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea, Passion Fruit is. The first impression was the smell and it actually smells really good. Second was the look of the drink - it has a yellow tint and these chunks of aloe vera pulp suspended in it. Shaking the bottle vigorously did not force the pulp to the bottom. Third - the taste. It is VERY VERY sweet, followed by the slimy pulp hitting your mouth and finally a bizarre aftertaste. When I say this stuff is loaded with sugar, I mean it. The Chantea is 11.5 ounces and is broken into two servings per bottle. That means there is 38 grams of sugar if you drink the entire bottle. A 12 ounce Dr Pepper has 38 grams of sugar and tastes better. If you are diabetic or concerned about sugar intake, steer clear! I won't buy this ever.
