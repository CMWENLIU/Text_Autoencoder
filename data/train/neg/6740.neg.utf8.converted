I initially wanted to make my own fruit leather but in a fit of impatience, purchased this brand. The only other fruit leather I had before this was the Archer's Farm brand (Target) and honestly, I felt like the taste and texture of Stretch Island did not measure up. After the disappointment began to settle in I started doing more research into the ingredients and process involved in making fruit leather and stumbled upon some eye-opening information. Most companies are trying to market their fruit leather as a healthy alternative to the sugar/corn syrup fruit snacks but in reality, there is little difference in the amount of sugar you are eating. When a product like fruit leather is produced commercially, it often contains fruit concentrates (Stretch Island is made almost entirely of concentrates). Knowing nothing about that process I researched it and found how fruit concentrates are made and how the process destroys nutritional value and dietary fiber that would be found in homemade (or a higher quality brand) fruit leather. While this may be a good alternative to someone who is eating a lot of junk food, people who are already health conscious should be aware that this is borderline junk and holds very little of the fruit's original vitamins or dietary fiber but ALL of the natural sugars. Yes, I know, fruits have a lot of sugars...but when I eat something made from fruit I want to eat all the nutritious parts too...not just the sugar left over after heavy processing.
