Well I can tell you this chocolate when purchased from a store, where it is refrigerated is awesome..!!  However, when purchasing it over the internet and having it shipped to your residence.. that's another thing. First off UPS can't find their way even with GPS.. so I didn't receive my 4.4lbs of candy until a week after it had arrived at the wrong address.. When I opened it, it was 4.4lbs of solid chocolate in two individual bags.<br /><br />USE extreme caution when ordering this stuff over the internet!!!!!!!!!!!
