Very deceptive marketing. There is sucralose in this product used to make it sweeter. I fed this to my children not realizing they had not reduced the amount of sugar, simply replaced real sugar with a chemical (sucralose). If I wanted to feed my family fake sugar I would have bought the diet oatmeal. It should clearly read SWEETENED WITH SUCRALOSE on the label and NOT LOWER SUGAR.
