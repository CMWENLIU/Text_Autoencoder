This Snack time special was a gift from a relative, and so I feel pretty bad about giving it a one-star review. And yet, I feel compelled to warn others away from spending this amount of money, PLUS shipping, for snacks that are definitely lacking in TASTE, and are TINY. When I say "tiny", I mean this: the sausages are the size of a woman's index finger--IF she has a small index finger. The cheese bricks are 2 oz--a small man's index finger. The jar of jelly (grape)--1.5 oz is about a heaping tablespoon--enough to cover (maybe) both sides of a bagel (lightly), and you're done.<br /><br />Small size isn't all that important, I suppose, because these are supposed to be snacks. But here's the important part: TASTE. And folks, let me tell you, this assortment was sorely lacking in that department.<br /><br />Everything was either too sweet (do you care for sweet "mellow cheddar"?) or too bland ("brick cheese" had NO flavor) or too greasy ("summer sausage" left a distinct fatty taste in the mouth. Not to mention that one sausage (the index finger size) has 550 mg of sodium.<br /><br />A word about packaging: This arrived in a small box, which, when opened, revealed a MESSY JUMBLE of products. It did NOT in any way resemble the box you see pictured, when it arrived.<br /><br />I tried to post a review of this product on the Swiss Colony site, but wasn't sure they would publish it, so I thought I'd take the time to post here, so others can be aware that they might do much better in choosing a gift for themselves, or friends, than this selection.<br /><br />I hope my relatives don't read this review, because I KNOW they meant well, and I hope this review will help you to choose better for your family and friends. :>)
