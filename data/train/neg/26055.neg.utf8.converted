I have to say that I looked at the high marks that this got but didn't read the recent reviews. Silly me.<br /><br />This coconut milk is thin and I don't believe as good quality as some other ones on the market.<br /><br />The tins came in a big box and at least a third were badly dented.<br /><br />I won't be buying this again and would suggest you look elsewhere for your coconut milk.
