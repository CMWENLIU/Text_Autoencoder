I was excited to find high heat oil since our local store was temporarily out of our usual brand. I assumed this would be natural and just oil like the sunflower and safflower oils we usually buy at New Seasons.  Then there's that word, "Amish" - evokes images of natural, of the earth.  It arrived with its Beta Carotene enhanced color - OK, I'm all about carrots, but then I read the rest of the ingredients, "partially hydrogenated canola oil."  I don't need anything hydrogenated, partially, or otherwise, on my popcorn. If that's what I want, I'll walk down to the Valley Theater and buy a bucket.<br /><br />At least Chefs.com found irony in it as well and quickly gave me a refund over the phone for the amount I paid.
