I am disappointed these pumpkin seeds originated in China.  I have reservations about consuming food known to be from China given their recent incidents involving food safety. The fact the pumpkin seeds did not come from North America should have been noted in the product description.  I will return them or throw them out and will not order any food item from Woodstock Farms again.
