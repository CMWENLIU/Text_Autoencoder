I tried them in three different ways.<br />Open it and eat it right away, rinse it, leave it in the water for a while then eat it, or after rinsing them, cook it.<br />No matter how, it still retains a preservative kind of taste and because I have a rather sensitive tongue. It stayed on for a day or two which bothered me a lot. So I still have the rest. Sitting there...
