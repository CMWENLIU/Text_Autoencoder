I used to buy Manuka honey from a distribution who got it from NZ right off the ship. Manuka honey has a very specific taste and dark in color. You feel like eating something precious. This jar was tinted dark brown to resemble a dark Manuka honey in the picture, but inside the jar is a plain floral honey which is $5 in value, not a $32.68 per 2 jars as they charge. They took the expensive honey home and selling this one. I also was surprised that they put UMF 5+ (Unique Manuka Factor)-usually no such a low UMF. I felt being cheated! Do not buy this honey!
