I've purchased Organic Valley's milk for quite some time now, always in the form of half-gallon containers, which taste perfectly fine. So this time I decided to try out the aseptic cartons. the plan was to keep these on hand for when i run out of milk during the week.<br /><br />When drinking it by itself, it seems to have an off taste. Can't quite describe it in words. Just a strange taste that doesn't stay in your mouth, but its hard to ignore while drinking it.<br />I've also tried it with my coffee, and luckily the coffee successfully masks the weird taste.
