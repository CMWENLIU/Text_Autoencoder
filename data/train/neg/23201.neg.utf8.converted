Not worth the money.<br /><br />The plant that I received is not even close to the pictures that are shown. There is no single trunk, it's just a bush.<br /><br />Bonsai's are supposed to look like trees but without a trunk there's not really anything I can do to remedy this... Rather disappointed, and I'm not sure if I can return it or not.<br /><br />What I have received makes me quite suspicious of the 5-star reviews that this product has also received.
