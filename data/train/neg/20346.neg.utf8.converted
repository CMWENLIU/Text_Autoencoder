The other reviews are right on the money.  I have tried several types of vegetarian "jerky" in an effort to find one that had a good taste, provided a good approximation to the typical beef jerky consistency and was reasonably priced.  I was suckered into buying this product because of the Amazon price break and several positive on-line reviews (that I now believe were probably placed by the manufacturer).  Anyway, I can't give this stuff away - my wife and kids won't eat it and I don't want to be accused of mistreating my dogs by feeding it to them.  This stuff tastes bad and chews as if it was made from a piece of old leather.  Definitely not worth it.
