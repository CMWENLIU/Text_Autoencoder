I ordered these based upon the fact that I needed them quickly (through Amazon Prime) and the customer reviews were great. The box was white and not red, but was still nice. The bow and tag was missing, and the glue clump was still left that held it in place. The tape that closed the box was dirty- I had to take it off, and luckily, it peeled off easily. I was able to open the box and observe the contents. The crepes were wrapped in a separate interior container. The containers were cheap, brown flimsy plastic holders and several of the crepes were broken. I am ashamed to give this as a gift, but have no choice. I can't understand the high price on these! I think it is the outer box as it seems to have a magnetic closure.
