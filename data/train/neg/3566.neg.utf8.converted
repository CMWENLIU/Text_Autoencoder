I was informed by my gift recipient that these crackers arrived with incomplete packages. That is to say- something occurred at the factory and instead of six little crackers in the package, you get perhaps four, and the entire side of one cracker is exposed with the cheese uncovered in the pack. Obviously a defective run, but why wouldn't someone notice? When you have a 90 count package and most are defective, I mean...what the heck?<br />The taste is good on these crackers, I can say that for them. But it embarrasses me to purchase something for someone else and have it be defective.
