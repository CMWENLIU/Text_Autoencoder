I belong to  a part of India where coconut is part of our staple diet. After moving to the US I had almost given up on the thought of drinking coconut water everyday. Prohibitive costs and availability being the primary reasons. When I saw this deal, i was really happy and ordered it immediately. The first packet came in July, my concierge who collected the packet called me immediately stating there was a leak in the box that had arrived.<br />To my relief only one of the packs had a small leak. The packs were good sized and i knew  instantly that i had a months supply of coconut water.<br />When i chilled it and tasted it, I had mixed views, while it had  distinctive sweet flavor, there was certainly an aftertaste probably coz of the packing. Anyway i developed a taste for it and it was a good month. The shipping of the second package was announced late july. I was later notified that the package had been damaged during shipping. I was refunded my money and no package was sent for the month of august.<br />I received an intimation about the packet for September arriving in late august. Again, it was the same story replayed. My concierge called me to tell me the packet is leaking. I rush down to see this time not 1 but 3 packs are damaged. I decide to return the pack, and i get notified by amazon that i cannot return the product.<br />Well i have cancelled the subscription and now a happy amazon prime customer is dejected with their level of service.
