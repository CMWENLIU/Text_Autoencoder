I have tried 3 recipes, so far, & cannot say I am thrilled. The first was a quick bread that didn't rise & did scorch (not sure why.) When I cut off the scorched bits, I didn't much care for the flavor of the bread. Then I tried coconut muffins with chocolate chips & dried cherries. The recipes in the book I got rely HEAVILY on eggs, & the muffins proved to be rather heavy, with a pronounced eggy flavor. My third attempt was peanut butter cookies. Normal peanut butter cookies tend to disappear rather quickly around here, but these are loitering in the cookie jar. This may be an acceptable substitute for folks with wheat allergies (if the are not also allergic to eggs!), but so far, my family is unenthused. I still have plenty of flour left, & plan to work my way through the cookbook. I would like for my family to be able to experience some of the alleged health benefits of coconut flour. But my guess is that people who can tolerate wheat are not going to be bowled over by coconut flour.
