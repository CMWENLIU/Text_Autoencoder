When I returned to work my supply really went down. I was afraid I would not be able to continue breastfeeding. Just one cup of tea a day has increased my supply so much that I have to wear nursing pads again! However, my baby does not like this tea. Whenever I nurse her after drinking this tea she screams like she is in severe pain. I don't want her to hurt, so I have discontinued use of this tea.
