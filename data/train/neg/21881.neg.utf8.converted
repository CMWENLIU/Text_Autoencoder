Not as described! When ordering, the picture shows box's over-flowing.<br />In all actuality,the contents barely covered the bottom of each box!<br />There were no pistachio's as promised and there was no gift card,<br />(TO:/FROM: CARD), Very Disappointing! I would not recommend this<br />product to anyone! My views could possibly change, if they were to<br />redeem themselves. I will update this post at a later date.<br /><br />*****This item was originally purchased through Amazon.com, so they handled<br />any problems with this order. Since this item was a grocery item, returning<br />it was not an option. Never the less, Amazon handled my complaints in a<br />truly professional and very courteous manner! Amazon is my go to place<br />for all my online purchases! A+!******
