I ordered this basket for a gift. WHen I saw that it was over $50 I thought I would be getting a really nice basket.  I would have done better to go to Starbucks!  It seems like a very cheaply put together basket and very overpriced.  It is too late to exchange but would not get if you are trying to give a nice gift.
