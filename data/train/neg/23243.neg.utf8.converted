[edit to previous review below]<br />Imagine my surprise when my bars arrived today. Same Shop and Save order, same order history, smaller bars and NO notification to indicate the size of the bar had changed. It is essentially NOT the same product. Shame because the taste is still good but terrible service on the part of the manufacturer not to notify buyers of the change to the product. It dropped from 2.2 oz to 1.8 oz and is now more of a snack than lunch.<br /><br />*Original Review:<br />Love these bars - satisfies my chocolate craving in a good and healthy way. Like these better than Larabar - no aftertaste and better price.
