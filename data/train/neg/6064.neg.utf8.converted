This has a distinctive taste, so I am not saying that it is not chocolate tasting or has no taste, but it IS extremely thin. Quite watery for something you are just supposed to add water to. My family does not like it and I only drink it when made with 1/2 water, 1/2 milk. The taste is not the same as other hot chocolates, this is not to say bad but certainly different. It is simply not to our liking and due to that and the thin, watery consistency we won't be buying again. Amazon's part in purchase and shipping was fine per usual.
