I'm a fan of spice. It's almost a problem, in that I put hot sauce and/or seasoning on almost everything I eat lately. It's not uncommon for me to have a mean sweat going on while I eat. Yeah, some people would probably find that weird or even crazy... but for me, I enjoy it. I love spicy food.<br /><br />Which brings me to the review. I bought this 4 pack of Da Bomb ghost pepper sauce looking for a kick similar to what I experienced with the Dave's Gourmet Ghost Pepper sauce. But it's not. It's nowhere near the intensity as the Dave's sauce. In fact, Da Bomb's sauce is mostly habanero based, according to the ingredients. Habanero usually has a kick, but this sauce is no spicier than the habanero hot sauce I can get for a buck per bottle at my local grocer. I feel like I basically paid a premium for a sauce because they call it "ghost pepper", even though it has ghost pepper listed as the last ingredient in the list. Lame.<br /><br />Taste wise, it's ok. Spice wise, it's mild for me... particularly when compared to competing brands. With Dave's, I'd put a couple of drops on my food and the level of heat was fantastic. With Da Bomb, I'm dumping this stuff on my food and adding some habanero powder on top to give me my fix.<br /><br />Bottom line -- if you're looking for a really tasty, spicy hot sauce, this probably isn't for you. If you're serious about spice, try the Dave's Gourmet sauce. Amazon doesn't always carry it, but it's worth hunting down. Just don't waste your time with this.
