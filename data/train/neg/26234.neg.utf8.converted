My sweet 6 month old might have food allergies - he's thrown this up about three times now (last time I'll try with this.) He's been exclusively breastfed until now, and I've introduced sweet potato, pears, applesauce, squash, carrots and mixed veggies with no drama. I've noticed that this ceral not only contains rice, but soy, tuna, and pork-based gelatin. Going to a pediatric allergist tomorrow to check out what's going on. Poor baby! Would love to hear if anyone else has a similar story.
