The principal ingredient of this bar is sugar. It also contains milk.  The cocoa content is less than 50% .  If you are looking for a semi-sweet dark milk chocolate this could be very satisfying.  If, like me, you prefer a high cocoa content without milk and all that sugar you will be disappointed and resent the misleading labeling.
