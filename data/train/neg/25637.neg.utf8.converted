I'm a huge peanut butter fan, and I bought this imagining all of the delicious things I could make with this.  It absolutely failed the first test: eating it by the spoonful.  It just doesn't mix up into good tasting peanut butter.  So how about adding it to flavor other things?  I made some cookies with it, and they weren't very good either.  It provides neither an authentic peanut taste, nor even an authentic ultra-processed peanut butter taste.  So far, the best use I've found for it is mixing it up with yogurt.  That's not bad, but I'm left wondering why?  I was always perfectly content to eat yogurt without peanut butter flavoring, and it didn't actually taste better than the yogurt without it, it just didn't taste worse like everything else I've been flavoring with pb2.
