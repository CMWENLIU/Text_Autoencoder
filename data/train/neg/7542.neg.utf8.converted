I was elated to receive this as a gift, always wanting to prepare my own baby food. Looking at the reviews, it seemed like a fantastic buy. Upon first use, the plastic base holding the blades produced hairline fractures where food can now get lodged. The piece holding the blades is also supposed to be easily removed for food removal and cleaning; it's become harder to remove with each use and now is near impossible to separate from the shaft. The gray plastic, stains very easily; and now, after only a handful of uses, the plastic, hinged cap to the water reservoir snapped off. Approx 20% of the time, the device will steam and fail to blend.
