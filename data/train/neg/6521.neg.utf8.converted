With disparity between the Dollar and the Euro, the price of this cereal has been rising where a lot of groceries have simply dropped it.  I was glad to find it on Amazon; actually it was pointed out to me via an e-mail to Switzerland.<br />I have been eating this cereal for over 20 years on a daily basis.  They have changed the formulation over the years a little [more oats initially]but it still the closest to true Swiss Muesli since I was introduced to it in the 1950's.<br />Only one local store comes close in price but they do not always have it.<br />***They ran out of this on Amazon and through one of their vendor it is now $72 per carton with shipping!  That's $12 a carton!  You can get it typically for under $9 in the store.  I tried a carton of the Original (Orange) formula.  Still the old price.  But it is very sweet.***
