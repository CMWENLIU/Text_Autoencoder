I first purchased a pack of Nutri Dent puppy chews for my Welsh Terrier when he was just a few months old. He LOVED them and they kept him busy for a while. Around the same time, he started itching and chewing on his paws incessantly and would not stop, even for a treat. Initially we thought it was the flee protection, then the shampoo, then the treats, then the peanut butter and lastly these. We continually phased each of the previous items out of his diet/lifestyle until finally we determined that the itching and scratching was related to these. We've obviously stopped giving these to him and now he rarely scratches or chews on himself. Your dog may have a different reaction to them but if he's experienceing any of the above symptoms, it may be related to these.
