After great experiences with Ancient Harvest Quinoa pastas I decided to try another brand of quinoa based pastas...while it's not as bad as some of the rice based pastas, it's not that great. Edible at best. A test bite from the boiling water at less than 5 minutes yielded something kind of mushy on the outside and firm on the outside. I decided to drain. After letting the 'pasta' rest for a few minutes it gained a better texture, not too pasta-like, but edible. The taste? Kind of bitter. Best to mask this with some garlicy sauce.
