...the humans, not so much. We bought a few boxes for a petsitter's use, thinking that pouches would be more convenient than canned. In fact, we found them to be much less convenient. About a third of the time, the top tab doesn't tear all the way off as it should, thence getting in the way and dripping gravy all over the place. A significant portion of the food stays at the bottom of the pouch after dispensing, requiring scooping out with a spoon - also a messy endeavor. All flavors have lots of gravy, which the cats love, but makes me feel as though I'm paying for a lot of water. We've happily switched back to Trader Joes' canned catfood, which the cats really like; is a good quality product; and is more reasonably priced - with the added advantage of having recyclable packaging.
