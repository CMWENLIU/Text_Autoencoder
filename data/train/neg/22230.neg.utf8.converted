Taste of the Wild has recently issued a recall. I ordered this from Amazon and got a tainted bag of food. I am currently on the phone trying to get ahold of the dog food company's customer service. I'll post with an update of what they say to do, and then may contact Amazon. (Hopefully shipping back will not have to happen - the idea of shipping 30lb of dog food does not appeal). In the mean time, hold off on ordering this food until Amazon can assure us that they will not send tainted products. Here is the article about the recall.<br /><br />When Diamond Pet Products recalled their Chicken Soup for the Soul food, I expected a recall of Taste of the Wild to follow. The holistic, grain-free food is made by the same company.<br /><br />And today comes word that, indeed, Diamond Pet Foods has issued a recall of a limited run of Taste of the Wild dry dog food over concerns about possible Salmonella contamination.<br /><br />According to the press release:<br /><br />To determine if your pet food is recalled, consumers should check the production codes on the back of bags. Any production codes that have a number "2" or a "3" in the 9th or 10th digit and an "X" in the 11th digit in the production code should be discarded. The best before dates are December 9, 2012, through April 7, 2013.<br /><br />The recall affects only products distributed in the following U.S. states and Canada. Further distribution to other pet food channels may have occurred.<br /><br />Alabama<br />Florida<br />Georgia<br />Indiana<br />Kentucky<br />Massachusetts<br />Maryland<br />Michigan<br />Mississippi<br />New York<br />North Carolina<br />Ohio<br />Pennsylvania<br />South Carolina<br />Tennessee<br />Virginia<br />Canada<br /><br />Pet owners who are unsure if the product they purchased is included in the recall, or who would like replacement product or a refund, may contact Diamond Pet Foods via a toll free call at 1-866-918-8756, Monday through Sunday, 8 am - 6pm EST.
