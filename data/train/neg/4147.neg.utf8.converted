I have been a faithful buyer of Natural Balance for years for my large dog with allergies.  Thinking I was getting the best.<br /><br />My dog developed a yeast infection that my vet told me was allergies.  He has constant ear infections, itching and he started to lose weight. His skin was like an elephant and it started to flake off.  Turns out the potatoes and sweet potatoes in the Potato and Venison dog foods was feeding the yeast infection and it was killing him.  He was losing weight and went from 75 pounds to 57 pounds before we found out the cause. I contacted the food company who were no help at all.  They didn't even respond to my reply.  I wasn't asking for any miracles, I just wanted some answers and I got a big fat NOTHING.<br /><br />After switching vets my new vet discovered the yeast infection and we switched the dog food.  He started to gain weight but we have a long road ahead of us to keep the yeast at bay.<br /><br />I am just disappointed in the company's customer service. I spent about $50 on a bag of food every two weeks plus treats.  My money will be better spent elsewhere.
