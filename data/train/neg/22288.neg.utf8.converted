I purchased a pack of 4 of these to use for collecting kitchen scraps to add to my three compost piles (each in different stages of decomposition). Over the last year, I have had to screen out the green bags and pass them to the next level of decomposition along with things like corn cobs and branches. The corn cobs break down faster than the biobags! I had torn the bags into small bits to help them break down faster but that hasn't helped. I've stopped using the bags. And have two unopened boxes in my basement. What a disappointment!
