I received the variety pack as a gift, but I don't have a single cup machine. Since "grocery" items are not returnable, I tried mixing it with the regular coffee in the filter for a different taste. Unfortunately, the packet clogged the filter and it overran onto the counter. Now, I have a mess to clean. Gracious gift givers, please check what you recipient has before sending.
