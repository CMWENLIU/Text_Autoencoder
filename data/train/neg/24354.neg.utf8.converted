Shipment arrived promptly, but every can (12 in total) were damaged (some nearly crushed). I'm certain this wasn't the shipper because the box arrived fine and in tact, but whoever packaged the items in the warehouse was careless. Cans were placed in a thin bubble wrap (all 12 together), and should have been in a box to remain upright during shipment.
