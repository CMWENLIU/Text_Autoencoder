The chocolate layer on these expresso beans is much thicker, softer, and have a slight cigarette-smoke taste compared to the Kona version <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002M53GFC">Koppers Chocolate Covered Kona Coffee Beans, 5-Pound Bag</a> that I really liked.  My initial impression is that I'll probably have to give these ones away because I can't stand the cigarette smoke taste (I'd prefer my chocolate to taste like chocolate, and my coffee to taste like coffee).  Once again Amazon just threw the 5-pound plastic bag into a cardboard box and it got ripped open a bit during shipment (but this time it didn't melt since it was shipped in the winter).
