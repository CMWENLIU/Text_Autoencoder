This stuff is horrid! I would give it minus 5 stars if I could. It doesn't even taste like lefse so I'm surprised it has been around for so long. My mom warned me not to get it, but I was craving it so bad and didn't have any homemade in my freezer. What a mistake, I should have trusted my mom. Please don't buy this, you will just end up throwing it away. It is well worth the time to make your own.  Your taste buds will thank you.
