Last night I ate a handful of the Gummi Bears that I got for Christmas.  A couple of hours later, I was in excruciating pain and passed enough gas to inflate the Hindenberg.  Of course, I didn't make the connection between the candy and the pain.  Today, I brought the candy to work.  My co-workers are chowing down big time!  And I've eaten another handful.  I don't know why, but the little voice inside my head prompted me to check out these sugar-free bears on Amazon.com.  OMG!  They ARE the culprit!!  Now I have more painful gas to deal with.  Should I warn my colleagues?...<br /><br />The lesson learned:  Check things out on Amazon.com BEFORE you eat them...
