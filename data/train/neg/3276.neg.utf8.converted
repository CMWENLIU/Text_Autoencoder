Honestly, that's what I thought throughout trying this tea.  The smell and taste is entirely of cinnamon.  I couldn't ever taste the tea- and even in my smallest cup it tasted weak and watery.<br /><br />If you want caffeinated cinnamon, go for it.<br /><br />If you want true chai... look elsewhere.<br /><br />PS.  What's with the size of the bags?  Not even 2 grams per bag.  Even for American-style tea bags, this is small.
