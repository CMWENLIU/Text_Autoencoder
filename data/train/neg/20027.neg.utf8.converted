This is one of the most disgusting Hamburger Helper Meals. The glaze was so sweet, it reminded me of lemon cookies. The pasta wasn't good either. NO flavor what so ever of lemon and herb chicken. Overly sweet and lemony grossness is more like it. What a waste of $2.50 and not to mention my expensive chicken breasts.
