I lived in Hawaii (island of Oahu) for 6 years and drank Kona coffee every day. Now back on the mainland, I have been purchasing Kona blends. Having grown tired of these blends, I decided to try this coffee, based mostly on the reviews. It's not even close to classic Kona. The beans seemed dry, did not have much aroma, and it took about 50% more beans per cup to make it as strong as an average cup of coffee. There was definitely some Kona characteristics to the flavor, but barely as much as you would find in a good Kona blend. I can only guess that the bag of beans that I received had been in storage for a long time or simply not stored properly. Whatever the case, I would not buy this again.
