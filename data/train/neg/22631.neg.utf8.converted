These are the worst potato chips I have ever had. They are way, way too salty. And, to make matters worse, the manufacturer adds fructose sugar to the recipe, which adds an inappropriate sweet note. I would definitely not recommend these chips. Luckily, I did not buy a case. I picked up a single bag from my local grocer. I do not understand all the favorable reviews for this product! I think these chips are just awful!
