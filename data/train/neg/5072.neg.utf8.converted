I did a search "decaf k cups subscribe and save" and this item popped up.  Of course when I ordered it I was loathe to discover that they are pods.  So disappointed, obviously.  Granted I could have read the description more carefully.  Just don't want anyone else to have the same problem.  Of course this is also a non returnable item.  Now I'm just stuck with them.  My rating is not for this item but for Amazon's misleading search results.
