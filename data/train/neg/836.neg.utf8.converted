Ok I bought these, thinking they'd be along the lines of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EQX6QK">Terra Sweet Potato Chips, 1.2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>, just with carrots instead of sweet potatoes. Or maybe like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MUZYWQ">Sensible Portions Veggie Straws Original Sea Salt, 20 Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong. These chips taste like odd corn chips. They are very bland, and have only a *hint* of the carrot taste.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, they aren't so bad that they are inedible. They just were NOT what I expected.<br /><br />Also, they are greasier than I would prefer.<br /><br />If you're looking for good tasting chips that taste like carrots, I would not recommend these. If you are looking for corn chips that kind of taste like carrots, then maybe these are for you.<br /><br />I still have like 4 bags of these unopened because nobody in my house wants to eat them :-(
