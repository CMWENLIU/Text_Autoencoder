My dog is a 15 pound Maltese. He is really picky about what he will chew, so I did not think he would like these, but I figured  it was worth a try to see if he would like them. I put it on the floor and he ignored it, just as I had expected. He  only likes a couple of types of chews. The next evening, I was happy to see he was chewing away at it with glee. He was really liking it, I was glad I found something he actually likes. But the next morning, he was throwing up, and had really bad diarrhea all day. Poor doggy! The ironic thing is that these chew bones call themselves "digestive support"  "Health and Fun" NOT!!!! I threw them away and will never give them to my dog again. I would not recommend these dog chews.
