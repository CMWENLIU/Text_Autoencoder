C'mon Amazon...we all love you and we're willing to go the extra "dollar" for your convenience, but this is going too far...!! More than $15 for a box of cereal...??!!...not to mention the $8+ shipping fee...that's >$17 per pound for Captain Crunch cereal?<br /><br />Hey fellow-Amazon shoppers...I did the math...you can make a breakfast FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR using USDA choice NY Strip steak, jumbo eggs, whole wheat toast, home fries and OJ for what it costs you to buy just ONE box of CC cereal from Amazon and a half gallon of 2% milk.<br /><br />Oh yeah...and the diner down the street from me (I live in NJ...a convenience store and diner on every corner) has the same meal for $7.99...so TWO of you could eat out for the price of one Amazon box of Capt Crunch...that's disgusting and unethical.
