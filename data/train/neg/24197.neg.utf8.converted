This is awful. It had an off-putting medicinal taste. Maybe if it was smothered in icing it would be better, but don't waste your money. I made it according to the directions and served it to people at Thanksgiving and not a single person liked it. I threw the whole thing away. It has nice texture and is attractive but the taste of this mix is just wrong.
