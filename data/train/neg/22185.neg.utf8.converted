Tastes like powdered milk and artificial tea. I really don't like the aftertaste. I've had the real deal in coffee shops and this is nothing like it.  By the way, ingredients say artificial creamer, powdered dry milk, and instant tea.... among other things. The flavor while drinking may get 2 or 3 stars, but the immediate and lingering aftertaste takes it down to one star.
