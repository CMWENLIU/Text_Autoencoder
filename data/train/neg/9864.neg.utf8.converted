That's what it tastes like, too.  Just get the medium roast 100% Kona pods from them, it's fantastic.  This is junk tho, IMHO. Don't know why they did it, there's Hawaiian non-Kona coffee that tastes good.  What you wanted was the larger <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007SN8JA">100% Kona variety pack version</a> of this from Aloha Coffee Co. which costs about $39 + S&H.  Still a bargain compared to Starpucky's at about $0.75/cup.  Also look at the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007YHARK">100% Kona Medium roast pods</a> which are totally delic. and comes in 1-cup and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ZBKZW">2-cup pod</a> sizes.
