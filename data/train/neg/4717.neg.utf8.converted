I ordered these because Nate said he could eat one no problem. They showed up on time and nicely packaged.  however when the moment came, he was able to eat a whole pepper no problem. His eyes didn't even tear up. I had all my friends over to watch him be encompassed by pain and misery, but no luck.  I cannot express in words how disappointed we all were.  will not buy again
