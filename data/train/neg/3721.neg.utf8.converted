This is another product with a misleading illustration.  It is much soupier than illustrated and you need to eat it with a spoon, not a fork.  I did not particularly like the flavor, and did not find any large amount of chicken.  It is mainly large thick noodles with a few peas and pieces of carrot.  it is listed as having 15 grams of protein, but has little of anythiing else except for salt.  It indicates 990 mg of salt.  I did finish eating it, but will not buy it again.  There are better products on the market from other companies.  See products by Dinty Moore and Healthy Choice reviewed separately.
