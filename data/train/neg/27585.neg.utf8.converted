Peaches are my favorite fruit, and after having wonderful experiences with the other "Just Tomatoes" products, I was looking forward to trying these. I expected something like the concentrated flavor of peaches in a tasty, very crunchy package.<br /><br />Sadly,my expectations were not met.  At all.<br /><br />The package I had was not crunchy in the usual sense:  the little cubes were tough to bite into, and little bits of cube stuck to your teeth.  The cubes were barely sweet and had no discernable taste of peaches. After an initial handful, no one in our family would go near the things.  I ended up throwing the remaining cubes into a batch of cupcake batter, figuring that it might add a bit of extra nutrition.  It did that, but even better, the chocolate cupcakes have a mild taste of peach.<br /><br />But there is no way I would buy these again as a subtle cupcake flavoring.  I'll eat the strawberries and blueberries, and leave these peaches to find a nice home with someone else.
