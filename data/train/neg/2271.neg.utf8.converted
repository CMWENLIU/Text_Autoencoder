China recently refused to let the FDA inspect pet treat manufacturing facilities.  [...]<br /><br />There is no inspection, legal system, or quality control to make sure you do not give your pet toxic rawhide if the rawhide is made in China.  There are other treats on Amazon that are American or European made--buy those.<br /><br />I threw out the rawhide rounds and cut pieces of US-made, no toxic chemicals rawhide into rounds to slide on this.  I put edible toothpaste (liver flavor--yum! yum!)on the bristles.  It is keeping my dogs' teeth much, much cleaner.  Great product, but dangerous to give your dog rawhide from China.  Over 6000 pets have died just from jerky treats alone.
