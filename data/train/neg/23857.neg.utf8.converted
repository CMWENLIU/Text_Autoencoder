Having purchased a package of this tea and one of Stash's Pinhead Gunpowder Green, I can safely say that the Gunpowder is much better tea. The "Organic Premium" is unacceptably heavy on stems and twigs, with an unpleasantly mulchy taste. The Gunpowder, on the other hand, is much lighter and more delicate. Same price, same distributer, both organic. Stash Gunpowder is simply better.
