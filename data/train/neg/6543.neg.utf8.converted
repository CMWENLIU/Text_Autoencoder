See the Core Wellness forums for confirmation. They are shifting the formula now that they have been bought out by Berwind Corporation. A note was in our last bag of food confirming this, and with the most recent bag, the food has a whiter appearance and our cats actively refuse to touch it. This leaves us in a bind because we have a cat that requires grain-free food. I will not be going back to this product ever again.
