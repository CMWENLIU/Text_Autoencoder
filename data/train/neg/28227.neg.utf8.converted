I bought this because all of the reviews were so good, but I just don't like it. It's slightly bitter and the texture is unpleasant to me. It's unusual for me not to like something-I'm not really picky about much.I really love Bob's Red Mill "Mighty Tasty". I also love Cream of Rice.  I hope I can give it away to someone who will use it up, because I now have 4 boxes and just can't eat it.  I fixed it both in the microwave and on the stove. I doctored it up with butter, pecans and maple syrup and still didn't like it. Then I tried it with butter and cheddar cheese-no luck. Maybe I'll try using milk instead of water.Does anyone have any suggestions?
