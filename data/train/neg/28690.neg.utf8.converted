I want to clarify that this review is more about the description and confusion over the product than the quality of the product. I did not realize that this item actually involves 9 jars of honey. Even though there is a "3 Pack" sign at the top - it gets confusing when you read the 3 - 3 ounce jars. I made the mistake of assuming the 3 pack was referring to the 3 jars in one pack. I suppose the price should have lead me to question it. Admittedly my mistake and maybe someone else is smarter. But for those who are not very used to ordering in packs - please note that this 1 item involves 9 jars of honey: 3 separate packs of 3, 3 ounce jars! What you see in the picture is just 1 pack. So, the picture is misleading as well. And this item wont return (because it is a grocery item). So be careful when ordering. I am sitting with 18 jars of honey (because I needed 6 and thought I was ordering exactly that when I ordered 2 of these items) - instead I got 2 times 9 jars.
