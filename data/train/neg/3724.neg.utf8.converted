I also had ordered these bars and had my order cancelled. They sent an e-mail stating that this item was on back order and should ship within 7-10 days. Then a couple days later, they decided to cancel my order. It was LIE!!!  They never had stuff on backorder.  They just didn't want to sell it at the low price.  The email indicated that I could search for it again and buy it if I wanted.  Conveniently, the price jumped to over $18 for the 6 boxes.
