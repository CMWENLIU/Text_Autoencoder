Studies show high levels of arsenic in this formula due to the organic brown rice syrup.  Nature's Only is refuting the studies that show that the arsenic levels are a concern, but I think they are making small talk of a big problem.  On their website, they are talking about "adult" exposure.  As any parent knows, a child's body (and digestive system, and metabolism) are vastly different from an adult's.  Children are developing, and take in a much higher amount of calories vs. body mass, and are much more heavily influenced by toxins in their developing system.  Nature's own comparing it to an average adult intake in water is almost comical if it is supposed to be reassuring, it is like comparing cherries to grapefruit.  I'm upset that I purchased a 3 pk immediately before the studies came out, and would like to get my money back.  My daughter is 14 months and no longer 'needs' a formula supplement, so we will forego it, all of the regular types you find on the store shelves smell awful, and are full of concerning ingredients, so we are just going to go pure and simple with organic dairy and goatsmilk products instead.
