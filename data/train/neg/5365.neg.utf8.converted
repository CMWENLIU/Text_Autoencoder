The product I received, yesterday (3/18/2011), were the ordinary Italian Tomatoes that you can find any where.  The description and picture with the San Marzano region name name is for a totally different product from Cento .... the pricey, certified San Marzano tomatoes. These are around $5.00 a can in my local supermarket.  The ones received are imported from Italy ... but are really just "everyday" use tomatoes. I'm keeping them because the price is a little less than if I had bought these in my local supermarket.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE MY OTHER COMMENTS FOLLOWING. I'M A BIG FAN OF CENTO PRODUCTS ... AND I JUST BOUGHT (6/06/2011) 6 MORE CANS (3 CERTIFIED AND 3 CRUSHED) ON SALE AT MY SUPERMARKET.<br /><br />Matt
