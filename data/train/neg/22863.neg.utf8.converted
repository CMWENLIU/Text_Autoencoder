I've championed a number of Rishi's Chinese teas (and their chais) because they're excellent. This, unfortunately, was my introduction to Wu Yi oolongs many moons ago. Had I not looked farther, I'd have dismissed the entire category.<br />Wu Yi "rock" oolongs are processed from bushes that thrive in mineral-rich soil. They tend to be on the "dark" side, i.e., rather highly oxidized. The best of them are sublime; however, that's not to say that there aren't good rock oolongs to be found that won't require that you refinance your home.<br />In general, though, you get what you pay for. I trusted my previous experiences with Rishi, plus their description of this one's profile sounded right up my alley (someone over there writes very good copy). At the price, I figured that I couldn't go wrong.<br />I was in error.<br />The only thing I taste in this tea is smoke; it tastes like the leavings of a campfire. This is fine for a Lapsang red tea, but it's totally out of place in an oolong. Quite frankly, this is the worst "specialty" tea I've ever bought, and I don't believe it's due to a mere matter of taste--it's just bad, like Liquid Smoke. The fact that it's organic in no way compensates for the fact that it's almost undrinkable.<br />I wasn't going to review this tea given that "if you can't say anything nice, ...," etc. However, Amazon made the point of recommending this to me, so I felt I had to set the record straight. Bottom line: look elsewhere to become acquainted with Wu Yi oolongs...unless you're a pretentious Finnish ugly-boy stalker-troll with liver-lips, of course.
