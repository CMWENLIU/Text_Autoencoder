I purchased Yogi because it was cheaper than Traditional Medicinals Mother's Milk. However, this brand for some reason did not help to increase my supply at all, even with drinking 4 cups a day. However, Traditional Medicinals seemed to increase my supply significantly. I would recommend only purchasing a case if you really know that this tea will work for you.
