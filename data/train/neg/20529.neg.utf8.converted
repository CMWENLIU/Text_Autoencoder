As far as the drink is concerned, it's 5 stars.  I think it's the best sports drink on the market.  My review is strictly concerning the price.  You can buy the same exact thing (24 pack of 20 oz. bottles) at Sam's Club for $14.88 ($14.23 less/49% cheaper).  The only difference is that it is a variety pack that includes 8 Lemon Lime, 8 Fruit Punch and 8 Grape.  I think Lemon Lime is the best flavor but I'm not sure it's worth paying twice as much for it.  Amazon should cut their price significantly and be more competitive.
