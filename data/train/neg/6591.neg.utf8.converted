Like all the other reviewers, I find this is a virtually inedible mess. Apparently it used to be a good product, but they changed it, no doubt to save a few bucks. And aren't they committing some kind of fraud when the box says prominently "100% REAL POTATOES"  - which I why I tried it - and then the ingredients list Mono and Diglycerides, Sodium Acid Pyrophosphate,Sodium Bisulfite and Citric Acid.<br />No matter what small percent these things may be (they don't give figures) then the product is NOT 100% potatoes.<br /><br />Sheesh.
