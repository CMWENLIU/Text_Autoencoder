Like the other 1-star buyer, this powder was shipped to me in a ULINE static shield bag which indicates that it is "ROHS Compliant." ROHS compliancy means that certain metals are banned from being used in packaging, but not necessarily lead! There is no indication this bag was not used previously for electronics, there is no origin marking anywhere on the bag and there is no nutrition label. There also is no "organic" label on the bag aside from a shoddily printed sticker that says "Organic Herbal Essence". Because of all of this I can not be sure this product is not adulterated, let alone organic. I will not purchase this product again from this seller and suggest that other buyers beware. The product itself may be fine, but why take a chance (especially if you are looking for what is supposed to be an 'organic' product free of contaminants)?<br /><br />UPDATE 4/12/12:<br />I complained about the improper packaging and submitted photo evidence of the static shield bags to both the seller and Amazon. Originally the seller claimed the product was shipped in food-grade ULINE bags, but after I sent photo evidence to the contrary I heard nothing further from the seller. Amazon granted me a full refund today. If you do order this product, I recommend you double-check that the packaging is safe before opening it!
