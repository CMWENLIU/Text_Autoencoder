If you have only tried Indian food in restaurants in US then this might be something you might find edible. But if you are an Indian/Pakistani and know what Indian food tastes like, this would be a huge disappointment. It was for me and my wife. I have tried it once and there is good chance my rest of the stock will prob just sit there till it expires. :(
