I love restaurant quality Thai. *Love it.* I made this stuff and almost gagged at the smell. It smells like what I would expect boiled dry dog food to smell like. We made it with chicken and I was determined to try to gag it down to not waste the chicken. I couldn't do it. I tried putting Thai sauce on it, soy sauce on it - anything. Nothing could hide the smell and stale musty flavor.<br /><br />Save your money and your senses and avoid!
