While this is packaged well and convenient to open and pour out, it doesn't matter how easy it is<br />or how healthy if you can't get the baby to eat it! This is extremely blah, bland mush. I certainly<br />expected much better from this brand. In addition, since it's a stage 3 food, I expected there to be<br />pieces of meat and vegetables, however there's just a bunch of lightish brown mush my baby wont eat<br />even why I try to force it down her. Definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone despite it's health rating.
