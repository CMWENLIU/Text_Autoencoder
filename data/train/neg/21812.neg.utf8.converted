I bought a 2-pack of the orange flavor 5 hour energy drink at Wal-Mart.  I tried one bottle in the afternoon, the other 2 days later in the morning.  I drank the whole bottle, but saw no real change.  I don't drink coffee, so I can't imagine I have made myself insensitive to caffeine.<br /><br />The orange flavor tasted fine though.  Kind of like orange drink in elementary school.  It sounds like other reviewers don't like the berry or lemon-lime.
