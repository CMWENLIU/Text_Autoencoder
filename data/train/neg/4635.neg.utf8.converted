The picture on the bag of the food looks really healthy. One can only assume by the name they are trying to push a better food product for our beloved pets.I mean Chef Michael's? How can someone not buy it? It has to be great!<br /><br />My dog ate it quickly, but then again, my dog isn't a picky eater.<br /><br />I had a bag of Blue Buffalo. I try to feed my dog better food. Here are the list of the first few ingredients: deboned chicken, chicken meal, whole ground brown rice, whole ground barley, oatmeal.... etc. etc.<br /><br />This is what is in the Chef Michael's: beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed tochpherols(eh whats that?) brewers rice, soy protein concentrate etc. etc.<br /><br />As you can see there is a big difference. While the food looks decent. Its softer. The brown stuff looks like meat. And it has bits of yellow/brown and green hard nuggets.<br /><br />While your dog will probably eat it, I'd say spend the extra 4 bucks and get a bag of something better. Its $13.87 in the store for a for a 4.5 pound bag.  I think I paid $17.00 for a 6 pound bag of BB. Or something a little healthier.<br /><br />Bottom line is that each pet owner must choose what they think is best for their four legged buddy.
