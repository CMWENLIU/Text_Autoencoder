I plain just don't like these fruit snacks. Texture is really important to me when it comes to fruit snacks, and these are more hard than gummy. The orange ones taste pretty good, and none of them taste bad, but they just aren't awesome. I recommend Annie's brand (particularly the Berry Batch) or Ocean Spray (the Berries and Cherries is really good).  Both of those brands have an amazing soft texture and don't have to sit there chewing forever as you do with the Welch's.
