So I had been looking around for someone diabetic who could post their sugars after eating a Chocoperfection bar, since the company makes so many zero glycemic index claims. I'm not diabetic, so I figured my results wouldn't help anyone. Well, after not finding anyone who had done this experiment, I just figured I'd give it a shot. I'm not diabetic, and I'd imagine if you were, your results would be way higher.<br /><br />I took my blood sugar at the 00:00 mark, and the ate the bar. Then I took my blood sugar again once every 10 minutes for an hour.<br /><br />00:00 75<br />00:10 73<br />00:20 82<br />00:30 83<br />00:40 83<br />00:50 91<br />00:60 93<br /><br />For me, almost 20 points difference in an hour, is major. I won't be eating them. I could eat a bag of skittles for the same glycemic cost. I don't know if it is the glycemic index, or the insulin response, or the leptin response that causes this fluctuation, I just know I don't need it.
