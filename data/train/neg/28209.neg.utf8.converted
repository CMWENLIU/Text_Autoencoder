According to FoodSafetyNews.com on 11/07/2011;  77 percent of the honey sampled from big box stores like Costco, Sam's Club, Walmart, Target and H-E-B had the pollen filtered out. Ultra filtering is a high-tech procedure where honey is heated, sometimes watered down and then forced at high pressure through extremely small filters to remove pollen, which is the only foolproof sign identifying the source of the honey. It is a spin-off of a technique refined by the Chinese, who have illegally dumped tons of their honey - some containing illegal antibiotics - on the U.S. market for years.<br /><br />Amazing what corporations do for profit. Pollen is what I consume honey for. Pollen is what helps my body as a medicine, a super food, antioxidants, etc. for my health. Without pollen, I might as well consume sugar. Fancy Grade A, Natural, Pure and even Raw are very misused words. These words are used to fool consumers just like it is done in every sector of the food industry. Conventional honey simply does not even come close to organic since it has many unwanted ingredients like GM plants, pesticides, etc. which harm the environment, the honey bee and my health. I consume Manuka as well as certified 100% organic raw honey from reputable source. That way I get the pollens and the antioxidants in the honey like I am suppose to. You will be surprised what you will find in your neighbourhood organic stores. I purchased one container from Costco but now I know better.
