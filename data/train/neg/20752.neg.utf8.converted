The description for these noodles is "Wide rice stick noodles are typically used to make Kee Mao (drunken noodles) or pad siew. They are 3/8" wide, and after soaking get about 1/2" wide. Aside from being wide, they are identical to the more common but thinner rice stick used to make the famous "Pad Thai"....The noodles should be soaked in warm (hot to the touch) water for about an hour or so depending on your preference."<br /><br />These are NOT the wide noodles for Pad Siew.  We tried soaking these noodles in warm water, but after about 45 minutes, they just dissolved and disintegrated into the water!!!  They DID NOT EXPAND!  I bought these noodles specifically because the description notes they are NOT the pad thai noodles - but they ARE!  They are the same thickness (i.e. NOT thick) as pad thai noodles and I could have bought this same package at my local asian store, and NOT waited for shipping!<br /><br />VERY disappointed, will not purchase from this seller again.
