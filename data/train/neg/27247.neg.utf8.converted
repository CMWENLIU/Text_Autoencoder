I have been eating candy bars from the Mars company as long as I've been alive. That's 50-years (give or take). Now, in all that time I formed attachments and allegiances to various bars in their line of candy. One might be my favorite, while others were less so, but any of them, from number one to the very bottom of the list was a joy. Every one was different with varying ingredients and combinations of flavors, but they all had one thing in common, great taste. Hand any of them to me as a child and my face would light up. That's why the 3 Musketeers Chocolate Bar, Coconut is such a huge disappointment. Simply put, it tastes bad, really bad.<br /><br />It amounts to a regular 3 Musketeers bar with a terrible artificial coconut flavoring added. I am a huge fan of coconut sweets. I also have a soft spot for chocolate. These bars are the worst of all possible worlds. The artificial coconut flavor is overpowering, chemical and leaves a nasty aftertaste that lingers for a considerable time. I would have never thought it possible for Mars to create something like this. How in the world did this get past the product development process at the company? I know it's just a candy bar, but it also feels like a little piece of my childhood was ruined by this. There were never many things you could absolutely count on in life. Now, there is one less.
