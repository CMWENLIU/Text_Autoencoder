I bought this thinking it would be a sweet treat. I am glad others liked it. I made one cup even after smelling the tea. It smelled rancid or putrid. Musty dirt like others said. MAYBE we all got a bad batch or something. But something is off. I took these to work and wrote "Free! Please Use or take home!" They are still sitting in the cupboard. My Bigelow French Vanilla Regular AND Decaf and the Caramel Vanilla by Bigelow is sweet and scrumptious---and my coworkers are always 'borrowing' a tea bag or two. I am not a tea drinker till this year. I liked Constant Comment by Bigelow too---my mom had a sampler kit at home and I had just started trying tea. My baby girl beagle Daisy died at age 14 and I was in tears. Later that night my mom brought in to me a cup of the French Vanilla Bigelow tea and it was so nice! It has been my favorite ever since. Great all year round. Although like I said the orange spiciness of the Bigelow Constant Comment is perfect for Fall and Christmas time. SO if you want great vanilla go for Bigelow. Like I said maybe I got a bad batch but I had bought two boxes at one time. If they improve this I will try it again. NOW For Liptons French Vanilla in regular bags THAT DOES TASTE GOOD----runs a close second to my Bigelow...but this,,,this no!
