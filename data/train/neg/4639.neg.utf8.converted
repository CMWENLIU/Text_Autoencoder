I think this dog food is a complete scam.  The bag claims "well-rounded meals for adult dogs."  This stuff is well-rounded only if you consider a fast food diet as a well-rounded diet.  Beef may be the first ingredient, but who knows what quality it is and it is directly followed by soybean meal, soy flour, preserved animal fat, brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest.  The list goes on of junk food for dogs with some artificial flavors and coloring added in also.  They are counting on pretty packaging with healthy claims distracting people from the actual ingredient list that contradicts those claims.  The feeding instructions say that you should feed your dog 1 cup for each 10 pounds of body weight, which means my 70 pound Lab would go through 7 cups of this junk food a day and at 22 cups of it a bag, would last her 3 days.  So this would not only be bad for her health but also bad for my wallet.  I can get a bag of quality grain-free food for her for significantly less than what it would cost me to feed her this for a month.
