After finding out that what we THOUGHT were the best brands (Science Diet, Iams) were chock-full of fillers and by-products, we decided to upgrade our kitty's diet.  After doing some research, we decided to give several brands a try, and this was the first.  Despite quality ingredients, Caesar would not touch this stuff!  Even when mixing it in with a brand that he liked, he completely avoided the bowl altogether.  Talking to several clerks and cat owners, Wellness has a high rejection rate among cats.  Some love it, but many just turn their nose up at it.<br />I'd normally give it one star, but the quality of ingredients in here is quite good, so that earns it an extra star.  But what good are quality ingredients if they never leave the bowl?
