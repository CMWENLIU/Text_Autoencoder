Look at the label in the picture.  Sorry folks, but 610 mg sodium per 100 g (that's only about 3.5 oz) can't really be "low sodium".  I don't understand Zing Zang's claim especially since Tabasco Tomato Cocktail Bloody Mary Mix, mild  claims 485 mg /100 g and Mr./Mrs. T claim 640 mg / 120 g.  They are all way HIGH in sodium.  American Heart Association recommended sodium intake per day is about 1500 mg - so 2.5 servings of this stuff is it for the day?  I don't think that any of us can really believe that this stuff is "low sodium" as it says in the description of this product.  Amazon should insist that the description be changed.
