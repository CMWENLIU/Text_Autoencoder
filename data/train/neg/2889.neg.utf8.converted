This product IS misleading.  Soybean and/or canola oil are the first ingredients, and olive oil is further down on the ingredients list.  I'm looking for a mayo made with olive oil.  Soybeans and canola are now genetically modified, unless they are organic.  But even organic soy is not good for people with thyroid issues, autoimmune disorders or digestive issues.  Soy is causing a plethora of health issues.  Organic or not -- soy is not good for us...and neither is genetically altered canola.
