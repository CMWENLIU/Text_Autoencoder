I have been rushing through this product line and this is the third product I've tested. I'm not sure what they were thinking of when they dreamed up the product. It does not come with directions for usage. I winged it and liberally applied it to my dry scalp. My hair was pretty oily and I massaged some more into my scalp, wrapped my hair under a shower cap, and put on a heat cap on the medium setting for 30 minutes to allow the product to absorb. I followed all of this with a shampoo.<br />The end result was an oily mess. My hair was droopy and still slick looking. I shampooed twice and finally got this goop out after using a clarifying shampoo followed up by a warm and then cold rinse. My scalp wasn't dry but it didn't feel any different from when I started.<br />The main product listed first in the ingredients was mineral oil. Mineral oil is greasy. My advice is avoid this product.
