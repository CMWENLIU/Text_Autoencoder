The food itself is great. My cat loves the variety and it's a great deal. However, I am subscribed to this product for a shipment every few months and without fail each shipment has arrived VERY bashed up. The outside box will be fine but then a few of the cans will be smashed in. One case even came with dripping cat food liquid on it- YUCK! I wrote a message to packaging for Amazon and received no assistance or changes. Product gets 2 stars because of the food itself. Amazon gets 0 stars for the way they handle/pack/ship this product.
