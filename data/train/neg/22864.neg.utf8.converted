Before buying this coffee, I read the other reviews, including the reviews on the box of 50.<br />I didn't heed warning to several claims of the coffee being weak - my mistake.<br /><br />After trying more than 24 varieties of K-cup coffee, Green Mountain "Our Blend" is easily the weakest coffee of ANY K-cup I've ever tried. I was disappointed, but if you like extremely mild coffee, then this one may be fine for you.<br /><br />I tried brewing on the smallest Keurig cup size - a half cup of coffee, but this idea didn't work out. I learned to use only a fraction of half & half, otherwise the coffee would be as white as milk.<br /><br />For me, this box of 24 is more like having a box of 12 - because I need 2 k-cups to make a full cup of coffee.<br />With a higher cost of coffee these days, it's important not to waste money. I personally would not recommend "Our Blend".<br /><br />Thanks for listening,<br />Jeff
