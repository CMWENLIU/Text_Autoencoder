I will say that my son has enjoyed this product.  HOWEVER, i'm extremely disappointed to see that the nutrition facts on the package are incorrect.  The package says 45% of iron RDA but if you check the website, it only has 4%.  It feels like the company is intentionally misleading (similar error occurred on other flavors) to get people to buy this product.  Disappointed in the company.
