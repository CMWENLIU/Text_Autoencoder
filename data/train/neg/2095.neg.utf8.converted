I have a Nespresso C100 and use the Ristretto capsules. Ordered these as I like the concept of 'ethical coffee.' Huge disappointment. I find the coffee is weak and not like espresso at all. Plus, the aftertaste has a bitter quality to it. The crema is thin with no richness. Overall, a poor substitute. If you like your Nespresso, you can try these but beware, you are not getting the same product.
