I bought this with the intent of eating it straight from the box when I'm busy at school and thought it'd be stovetop stuffing quality.  In other words I wasn't expecting the world and that I'd know it would be a bit dry.  I also knew that the recipe for making falafel was dead easy.  But reading all the positive reviews I felt, "well why not".  I need to be  brutally honest and say the only thing worthwhile about this mix is the crunch.  Otherwise it is similar to eating glorified sawdust when prepared as instructed and will never pass as homemade falafel as per another reviewer's commentary.  Honestly homemade isn't hard if you have the kitchenaid hand blender, but the convenience factor was something I was really interested in.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Crunch<br />Convenience<br />Ease<br />Can be baked<br /><br />Cons:<br />Flavour and texture is like sawdust (must soak at least 30 minutes though that won't fix it)<br /><br />Because I had the version from Mediterranean Cafe east of Los Angeles (Pasadena to be specific) one might think I'm picky, but honestly they could have at least tasted what they created and said that you needed to add fresh cilantro, parsley and onion to compensate the texture of the dry mix.  I actually had to guess what was missing then, with a receipe online, and make a brand new batch of falafel from hand in order to fix the flavor and inside texture of this one and my family and I still think it's weird.<br /><br />Simply put if this is the best of the box falafels I'd stay the heck away from all else.  If you feel the same way and you're stuck with 12 boxes, what you can do to fix it is to add some cilantro, onion and garlic until it develops the falafel greenish hue.  I did this and it was definitely much much closer to the falafel I had.  Perhaps I should also add breadcrumbs but a part of me goes "is this honestly necessary!?  Why am I REMAKING falafel?"<br /><br />IMO if convenience is ruined by forcing one to remake the item they're supposed to imitate the product fails.  I am therefore giving one star for the crunch only.
