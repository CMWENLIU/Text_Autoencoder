I ordered this discounted food knowing the discount would off set the shipping.  My cats LOVE this cat food, I've fed it to them for years and will keep buying it.  Solid Gold is an excellent brand, never had any of the cat food recalls.  So I felt I made a wise decision even though the product listed didn't include the size bag.  Turns out the size was a 4 lb bag, still a savings with the discount.  I've also ordered through PetFood Direct, never had a problem with their service or with their products.  The drawback was the bag was expired.  Ordered 12/10 and expired 2/10.  I am very disappointed I spent the money on expired food which I will not feed my pets.  There is a reason why a manufacturer puts an expiration date on their food.  So no, I won't order this product again and I wonder if that was what the discount was all about - Getting rid of expired food the only way they could.  I won't order dry cat food on line again, not through PetFood Direct, not when their people do this to a customer.
