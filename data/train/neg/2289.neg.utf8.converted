Please don't buy these for your dog. These have artificial colors and pork in them that is not listed on the product description online. These made my dog very ill. He had diarrhea and was throwing up for a week. I was very worried about him. This was the only change in his diet, I feed him all natural food with no artificial anything. I thought these were made of chicken & natural accourding to the online description but they are not.
