I bought these for years for my little guys and they loved it.  Unbeknownst to me, it turns out these things will break and crack your dogs teeth!!!<br /><br />After a routine visit to the vet, he found one of my dogs had infected and broken back molars.  I guess it's a common occurrence judging by other reviewers on here.  And my vet also said he's had 8 dogs come in with the same problem in the last 2 years, all with Nylabone dental chew toys.<br />Had to get dental work done on my baby and her teeth were extracted.  Poor gal was crying all night long after surgery.  The vet says this happens w/ large dogs too!!!  So NYLABONE needs to stop selling this item as a dental chew!  I'm going to report this directly to Amazon corporate.
