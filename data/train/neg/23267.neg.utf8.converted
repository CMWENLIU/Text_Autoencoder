These dog cookies were suppose to have limited ingredients for dogs with food allergies. Problem was they did not list all of the ingredients and these stupid cookies ended up having copious amounts of hickory smoke flavoring!!  My Papillon gets sick on smoke flavoring and many of the additives that do not need to be in dog treats or food. The smell of smoke flavoring  was so strong how could they leave it off the ingredient list and why do they even need to add it if there is actual duck in the cookie. What dog in his right mind would choose smoke flavoring over duck flavoring. Money down the drain and damn aggravating that Amazon product descriptions can not be trusted.
