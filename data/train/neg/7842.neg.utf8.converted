Sardines with skin are toooooo fishy to enjoy and the skin makes them basically inedible. I can only eat sardines with skin removed. I could not even eat one sardine out of the one opened tin.  I was assured before ordering the sardines that they would arrive without skins but,alas, they arrived with skins intact.  I sent the entire order back and requested a full refund . A bad experience.
