I thought I'd give these a try because they were cheap on lightning deal.<br /><br />Like most all Kashi products, they're lacking in the taste department.  I took one bite & tried to chew it, but it was dry and tasted bad.  I threw all three boxes in the trash the next morning.<br /><br />If you're trying to eat healthy and want a cookie, just splurge.. eat some Oreo's or whatever your favorite is and don't write down the calories in your book. Skip these; your taste buds will thank you!
