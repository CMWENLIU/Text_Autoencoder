I am not a coffee expert, but I know what I like, and I'm not crazy about this. I usually buy French Roast beans, or sometimes Espresso beans at Trader Joe's or Starbucks and make my coffee pretty strong. I was fooled into buying this because the description said it was for Espresso and there were a lot of good reviews. This coffee is a little better than the cheap coffee at the grocery store, but not much. What's worse, there is no way to seal the bag. I look forward to either using it up or putting it on the top shelf, so I can go back to what I like.
