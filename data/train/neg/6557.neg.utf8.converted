I have bought donut shop coffee K cups for years through amazon with no problem. However, this last batch seems defective...not in taste but in assembly.  they burst open at the seams and leave coffee grounds behind. This is the first time I purchased through this particular amazon source and was wowed at the cost per cup ... now I know why.
