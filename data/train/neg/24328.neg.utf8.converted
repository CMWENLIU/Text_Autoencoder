This tea lists green tea, jasmine, and "natural flavor" as the ingredients. This tea taste nothing like other jasmine teas I have had - it is much sweeter. My first taste impression was of pez (yes, the little sugar candy pellets that come from pez dispensers). I guess some may like it but it is not my cup of tea.
