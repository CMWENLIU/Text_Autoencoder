I had to come here and review this product because I saw the reviews and had to let people know the truth. All the other people who reviewed this product are the people who are selling the product. A friend of mine works for this "company" and gave me some free samples of this product because i like energy drinks and this was an all natural/healthy energy drink. Well this drink is a joke. I had 5 different kinds including this one, and they all tasted awful. They gave me absolutely no energy at all. After i had drank the peach tea one(or whatever tea flavor one it was), i fell asleep.<br /><br />listen, if you are into healthy energy drinks because you dont want the chemicals and extra sugar, thats fine, but you are going to want something that tastes good and at leasts gives you the extra energy you want, which this product does not have.<br /><br />I really cant think of a "healthy" energy to recommend just because most have sugar or the ones that are sugar-free have some kind of chemical in it that makes it that way. I did used to get FRS a lot, i didnt mind the taste and they gave me a nice little boost, but it started to get alittle pricey.<br /><br />Just stay away from this XS brand and company, they dont sell quality.
