Having tried several of Krusteaz's products in the past and not being impressed, we decided to give them another try, this time their Gingerbread Cake and Cookie Mix.  Christmas was upon us, and gingerbread sounded good.  We purchased it at ALDI (a special buy) in December.  The expiration date was April 2013, so there's no question it was fresh.  I tried the gingerbread cake recipe on the side of the box.  Following the directions exactly, I mixed the ingredients and baked the cake at the recommended temperature until a toothpick inserted in the center came out clean.<br /><br />The first thing we noticed was the smell.  Gingerbread typically has a strong odor, but this was beyond strong.  It had an overbearing "perfumy" chemical odor that burned your nostrils.  After it cooled we served it with a little whipped cream.  We each tentatively took a bite and pushed it aside.  My throat burned for several minutes, and I could still taste it the next morning.  Needless to say we threw the rest of it out.<br /><br />This is not the first Krusteaz product we've wasted eggs, other ingredients, time, and money on.  We've tried their blueberry bread/muffin mix (extremely heavy), raspberry bars (heavy, perfumy), lemon bars (a soggy mess), some kind of orange bars (tough and dry), and chocolate chunk cookies (fell flat).  Without exception every Krusteaz product we've tried has been inedible.  The thing is our current oven is the best we've ever owned.  It bakes evenly and turns out beautiful cakes -- that is, when the cake mix or recipe is good.  Even our incredible oven can't help Krusteaz mixes.<br /><br />I contacted the company and was told that the remaining box of lemon bars I have is out of date.  There's no date on it, but I don't doubt that it's out of date since it's been in the pantry for a couple of years.  We had bought two boxes at the same time and tried one immediately only to have to throw out the whole pan.  I was just cleaning out the pantry and decided to call the company after the latest failure to deliver by one of their over-priced products (the gingerbread).  All they could offer was a coupon for a replacement Krusteaz product.  Thanks but no thanks.  The lady said, "It sounds like you just don't like our products."  Having tried several of your products I have to concur.  Because all of your products that we've tried are awful!  Judging by their prices their products should be the "Cadillac" of baking mixes, but they're anything but.  The stores here carry only a limited variety of Krusteaz products, and I think we've tried just about everything locally available and couldn't eat any of it.  We'll be sticking with Betty, Duncan, and Pillsbury from now on.
