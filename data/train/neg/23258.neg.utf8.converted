I bought this thinking I would use this instead of the King Arthur Bread Flour that I normally use for my bread machine.  I was mistaken.  Its too dense and the bread does not rise in the bread maker.  I now use this as I would whole wheat flour. I have better results when I mix this 50/50 to bread flour.  They should have labeled this as whole wheat flour.
