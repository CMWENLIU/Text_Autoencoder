Well, the company DOES state they have a 'germination' guarantee - if a pod does not germinate, they will replace it free of charge... The problem is that after following the directions for the peppers - pruning, pollinating, etc -NO PEPPERS... So I called - they said to totally drain the Aerogarden, which I did, then refill with water and a 1 tablespoon of Epsom Salts - which I did - still NO PEPPERS; so, I called again - they said, drain again, more Epsom Salts - STILL NO PEPPERS.... so I called again - they then told me I should just toss the plants and start over - THEY GUARANTEE GERMINATION --- NOT FRUIT!!!! Here is a clue - what if I DON'T START OVER... and donate this piece of junk to the Salvation Army! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT unless you can find the seed pods elsewhere!
