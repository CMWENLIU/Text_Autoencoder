I wish I would of read the reviews before I ordered from these scammers.  I ordered the Italian Parmigiano Reggiano 10 oz. The cheese was actually wrapped in a priority envelope from USPS (YUK!!!) and not wrapped like the picture shows.<br />I paid $30.99 in shipping alone and it cost them 4.95 shipping via another priority envelope that the cheese was wrapped in to send it to me. I asked them to justify why not expedited shipping (it took 7 days from when I ordered to receive it) but they never answered my question.They used USPS shipping envelopes as wrappers. The cheese had black dots on it and was so disqusting.<br />I wrote to their customer service but all they did was make lie excuses and not answer my questions directly and then got nasty with me.  Worse customer service I ever dealt with although I don't ever remember having this type of problem before with anyone else.  I order online all the time.  Avoid this place unless you want to waste money. Everything about this place is disqusting including the owner Jason that responded to my emails, not answering my questions directly and beating around the bush.  I hate being scammed.
