I was using this product and loved it. They just sent me the new and improved and I thought I had soap in my coffee cup. Washed it out and found out it was the new flavor. It taste more like butterscotch or carmel. It gives you an after taste. Not impressed, canceled my other orders. Amazon it still the place to shop, there shipping is great etc.
