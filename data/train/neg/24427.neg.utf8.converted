As a fan of The Real Housewives, I decided to try the BLK water that they talk about and promote on the show. I have to say the thought of a BLK water made me a bit apprehensive but I wanted to try it. The bottle itself and design is really nice, packaging great. The color of the water looks almost like a flat coke. There is no smell to it really. However, I am so disappointed to say, the taste is really bad. It has a metallic aftertaste that does not taste good at all. I purchased one bottle for $6.99, this is not cheap water. And, I guess we don't even need Fulvic Acid to survive nor does it really do anything for us (based on opinion from what I have read online,not a Doctor). All in all, overpriced, tastes pretty bad with not good aftertaste that lingers for awhile. I am so sorry, I wanted to like it!
