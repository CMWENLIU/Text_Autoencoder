These are the worst dried fruit I have ever had. I agree with all the other posts. These should have been slices and the taste left a lot to be desired. The Asian Pear and Apple are excellent. I have even had the banana and strawberry and they are a great chip replacement, but steer clear of this one and the peaches. Both are just awful!!!
