I am from West Bengal, India. I grew up with finest quality Darjeeling and Assam tea. I never got such good tea here in the US. All the glowing reviews made me buy this tea thinking that I would at last find a good tea. The tea is simply horrible. I am not sure how the other buyers are making this tea but this tea is far from strong and it has no flavor. Two packs of simple Lipton tea make a better cup. Don't waste your money on this one.
