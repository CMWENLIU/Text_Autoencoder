I was excited to try Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla coffee, and I ordered two bags of it.  The first pot of coffee is brewed and I am not pleased.  It has a great smell, but the taste is far from satisfying.  It is quite strong and bitter...actually almost has a Folgers taste.  Not at all what I expect from Starbucks!
