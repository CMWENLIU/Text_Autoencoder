I bought this as a little treat for myself and after all the glowing reviews, I could not wait to try the tea.  Steeps three pots and a pretty gift-box to boot?  Needless to say, I was excited to watch those tea blossoms form.<br /><br />First annoyance: Dear lord, is that bamboo box a splinter hazard.  The woven clasps at the side were incredibly difficult to get off and I had to be very careful handling the box itself all the while because the edges are sharp and they hurt!<br /><br />Second annoyance: Superfluous and messy inner packaging.  Bamboo is so renewable and environmentally-friendly that they decided, hey, what's more wasted paper inside the box?<br /><br />Third annoyance: The teapot barely makes enough for one person.<br /><br />Fourth annoyance: The tea blossom not only floats to the top as you pour hot water, it crumbles coming out of the plastic packet.  And on the subject of the packets, I have no idea why "biodegradable tea bags" are listed as a product feature- there most certainly are none present.<br /><br />Fifth annoyance: The most horrendous and unbelievably weak tea I have ever tasted.  It was like boiled grass clippings and I can actually tolerate wheatgrass and spirulina.  I've tried Stash, Choice, Guayak&iacute;, you name it, so I know how tea is supposed to taste.<br /><br />Sixth annoyance: I did not even get to enjoy the visual splendour suggested by the dazzling pictures of tea leaves in full bloom.  They do not open completely and the smell was unimpressive to say the least.<br /><br />Given how awful the tea tasted, I'm beginning to question how "natural" the tea was in the first place.<br /><br />If you want to go with organic, fair-trade, and interesting blends, try something along the lines of Zhena's Gypsy teas.  At this price, I could have gotten the equivalent of 44 corn silk sachets.<br /><br />I'd normally let something this lacklustre go and forget about it, but it infuriates me that this product is being marketed as some sort of luxury item when it is neither fun to drink nor to look at.
