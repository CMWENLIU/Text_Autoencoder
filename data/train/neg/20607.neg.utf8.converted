I was so excited to finally have hunted these oreos down and try them. Sadly, they weren't what I was expecting. If you have had the birthday cake oreos, don't buy these. They have the exact same smell and the only difference is its on the vanilla cookie. The icing tasted like birthday cake and no taste of candy corn at all. They look cooler than they taste. Save your money or just get a bag of actual candy corn, you'd be happier with that.
