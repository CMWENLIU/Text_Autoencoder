THE NESTLES CHOCOLATE BAR DOES NOT TASTE AT ALL LIKE IT DID WHEN I WAS A KID!<br />THE RICH VELVETY SMOOTH CHOCOLATE TASTE IS GONE. SOMEONE MUST HAVE CHANGED THE FORMULA.<br />THIS BAR USED TO TASTE 100% BETTER THAN A HERSHEY BAR BUT NOT NOW. HERSHEY TASTE BETTER.<br />I WASTED OVER 18 DOLLARS FOR 24 OF THESE BARS. THE OLD TASTE IS JUST NOT THERE.<br />NO WONDER YOU DONT SEE THESE SELLING ON STORE SHELVES ANYMORE.ITS JUST DOESNT TASTE THE SAME AS IT USED TO TASTE.<br />I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THESE TO FRIENDS AS THE QUALITY AND TASTE ARE JUST NOT THERE LIKE IT USED TO BE.<br />SOMEONE AT NESTLES DECIDED TO CHANGE THE FORMULA AND MAKE THIS BAR USING CHEAPER AND ARTIFICIAL<br />INGREDIENTS TO SAVE ON MONEY AND NOW WHAT THEY HAVE NOW IS AN INFERIOR CANDY BAR!!!
