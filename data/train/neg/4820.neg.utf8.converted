Most of Dr. McDougall's stuff is OK.  It's convenience food so I never have high expectations.  However, this is an exception. I made this using the boiling water method.  This is the same method I used for his other products.  I let the product sit for 6 minutes.  Stirred it up and tasted it.<br /><br />Oh my God it was so nasty.  I let sit some more.  Still nasty.  Honestly I couldn't eat it.  It tasted so bad, to me, that I just threw it out.<br /><br />I've tried a couple other of his Asian Entrees and they are not too bad. But, they are NOT entrees, not by any stretch of the imagination.  It's a 1/2 container of noodles and whatever powdered stuff is added.<br /><br />Beware when ordering the Asian Entrees.  The only one that tasted like I would eat it again is the Thai Peanut Noodle.  The Soy Ginger Noodle is just passable.  I don't think I will be wasting any more money on the other Asian Entree varieties.
