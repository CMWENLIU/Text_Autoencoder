The label on the back went as far as making this claim: "100% Whole Leaf Powder...not from juice!"  Ummm... the reason we drink wheatgrass JUICE, is because it's 99.9% digestable, because it doesn't contain any fiber.  Throw the fiber into it, and it takes a lot more effort and energy to digest.<br /><br />This Amazing Grass powder is gritty, and doesn't taste ANYTHING like real wheatgrass juice.  The gritty-ness is so bad, that it's very, very difficult to drink.  Do a google search and look for Wheat Grass JUICE powder.  Not just wheatgrass powder.  This stuff is 25% fiber by weight, so 25% of this product is filler.<br /><br />I used a similar cheap powder that came in a glass jar a number of years ago, and I was wary that this was the same stuff.  Sure enough, it's EXACTLY the same stuff.  You can find this stuff in bulk in canisters at Vitamin Wholesalers for 1/3 the cost.<br /><br />Again, the gritty taste and the fact that it doesn't even come close to dissolving in water should tell you something.  If it doesn't dissolve in water, it doesn't digest well in your body.
