Notice it doesnt say Acai BERRIES?<br /><br />That's because the interior of the candies are actually just a berry flavored gelatin - like the inside of a jelly bean. So these are just chocolate covered jellybeans, not real chocolate covered berries. Ingredients are fruit juice and fructose. Frankly it tastes like the main flavoring ingredient is sugar and cheap grape/apple juice to me. You cant even taste Acai.<br /><br />This product is intentionally trying to ride the healthy berries and chocolate bandwagon.<br />Yet it is full of unhealthy ingredients unlike what it label shows.<br />So this is NOT a healthy snack like they are trying to portray.<br /><br />If chocolate jelly beans are what you want thats fine, just be aware that the label is very misleading IMHO.
