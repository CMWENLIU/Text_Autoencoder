This product was extremely disappointing!  No way did it look anything like the picture and it was full of hulls.  The last time I was at a Farmers Market and purchased kettle corn, I asked them what kind of popcorn they used to get such big kernels.  I was told mushroom popcorn, so I was so excited to find this product at Amazon.  I followed the directions for popping and the kernels were no different from the corn I buy at the supermarket at a fraction of the cost!
