I read the other reviews on this item before I ordered it. Based on those, this coffee sounded wonderful! I ordered it along with a French press so that I could enjoy a cup of coffee before class. When I received both items, I immediately tried to make a cup of this "amazing" coffee. What I found was a coffee that had a repulsive after taste. I cannot describe it, but it tastes like chemicals. Not willing to write off the reviews I had read that easily, I thoroughly cleaned the French press -again- and tried the coffee. Same taste. Finally, I used a different coffee in the press and found that it tasted wonderful. My conclusion? Either this coffee is GROSSLY overrated, or I got a bad batch. Either way, I will not be buying again.
