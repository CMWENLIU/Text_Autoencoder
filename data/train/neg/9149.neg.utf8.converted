The first time I made this mix it was outstanding, to the point I doubted it was actually gluten free.  Today made mix and it was totally different in making it and had totally different taste/texture.  Totally lacked any chocolate taste or smell.  Soon after eating it I developed the same sharp stomach pains that happened with the chocolate chip cookie mix I made the week before. Very disgusting products, sadly!
