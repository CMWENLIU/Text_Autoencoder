The Greenie's pill pockets I purchased through Amazon are NOT like the bags I've been buying from my local store and veterinarians.  This bag contained product that was slippery, crumbly and they are not pliable like original Greenie's!  The texture of these pockets is totally different from original Greenie's PP and they could NOT be squeezed around a pill - the product breaks apart.  I know the difference because I've been using real Greenie's for month's to hide medicine from my 13 year old dog.  I will NOT purchase this product from Amazon again as I believe they are are knockoffs.  Who knows what's in them, and with recent information about poisonings I'm not taking a chance with MY dogs! I'll pay the extra dollar and get them from my local vet.
