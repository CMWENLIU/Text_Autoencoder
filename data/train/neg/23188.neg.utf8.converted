I picked up a jar of this recently at the store to make green curry chicken at home, and was very disappointed in the level of spiciness. I used a full 3/4 of the container along with a can of coconut milk and the other ingredients listed on the recipe on the jar (fish sauce, a little brown sugar etc). Even with that amount, the dish was barely flavorful, let alone spicy. My husband who really doesn't much care for spicy food said it was underwhelming, so overall it was really disappointing. The sauce did turn out smooth and creamy, but if it's a good, spicy green curry you are after, I'd try another brand!
