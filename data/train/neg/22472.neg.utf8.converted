Somehow a fruitcake called Trappist Abby sounded "pure" to me so<br />I didn't check ingredients - mia culpa. After attempting to<br />read them, I at least recognized "high fructose corn syrup" The<br />disappointing taste of this fruitcake led me to consider the contents so,<br />finding them less than pure, I pitched it.
