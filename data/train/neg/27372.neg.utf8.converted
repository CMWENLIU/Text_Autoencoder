I love Nexcite!  But, after Nexcite 'reconstructed' the US Company and having no product availabity for MONTHS.....it is now back but the price has DOUBLED!  A little increase isn't bad but 100% more is a little steep, don't you think?  I would love to have 3 cases of this stuff per month but the pricing just knocked me out of the ballpark.
