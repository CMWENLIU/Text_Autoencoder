I have not been gluten free for that long that I don't recall what Rice Krispies tasted like, and this GF cereal version is not a good approximation of the original. The cereal has little if any flavor. A big food company like Kellogg's should be able to come up with an acceptable barley Malt substitute that adds some of the original flavor. With GF Rice, Corn, Cinnamon, Honey Nut Chex now widely available in grocery stores, at reasonable prices, and which taste EXACTLY the same as the original versions, why would you want to choose a cereal as bland & flavorless as these GF Rice Krispies. C'Mon Kellogg's, you can do better.
