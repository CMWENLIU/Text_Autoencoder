Yes, indeed!  These are really yummy bars with a delightful chewy texture, but OH MY GOSH!  THE GAS!  I ate one this morning and am still suffering from gas and groaning bowels.  I don't give up easily, either.  I got a box of 30 of these things from Costco and have "tested" about half of them and the same thing has happened every time I've eaten one.  I am giving up and throwing the rest out.  Please note that the first listed ingredient is chicory root extract.  I looked that up online and found out that chicory root is a mild laxative!  Goodbye tasty little bars!
