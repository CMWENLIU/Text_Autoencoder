My little Lhasa loved these, but she threw up big balls of starch.  Apparently, this is such a common problem, Zuke's is soon taking this line off the market and releasing a new replacement product in the next few months.  Small dogs don't have the digestive track needed to process these.  They will be switching from the existing potato formula to a more digestible Tapioca line.<br /><br />I need to hand it to Zuke's though. I told them about the product, and they rushed to send me samples and refund my money.
