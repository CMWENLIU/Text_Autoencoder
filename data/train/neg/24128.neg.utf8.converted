This frosting is sweet, and it is low in calories.  Whenever I come across the term &quot;cloying&quot; I think of this frosting.  It is sweet and sticky and has an obvious chemical taste.  I also have had difficulty obtaining a frosting like consistency.  I enjoy using the Sweet 'N Low cake mixes so the first few times I used this product I assumed I had not followed the directions properly. (Okay, so the directions were basically to add water and beat.)  If you have to have sugar free frosting on your cake I suggest using the Sans Sucre brand dessert mousse mix and spreading it quickly on the cake as you would a whipped frosting.
