This is my first review on Amazon.  My daughter has been enjoying these pouches since she was 6 months old and eating solid food.  I used to buy them at a retail store, but switched to Amazon a few months ago when my local store stopped carrying them.  This review in no way has anything to do with the contents of the pouches at all, these are great foods for infants and great snacks for toddlers.<br /><br />My review is to alert consumers to a bug infestation I got because of the packaging these items come in.  Soon after getting these from Amazon, I started finding miller bugs in my pantry.  I would clean out my whole pantry and remove them only to have the problem recur and worsen.  I finally identified the source as these pouches!  They come in a pack of 6 and the last two shipments I have recieved have definitively without any doubt had eggs of these miller bugs in them, the last batch of which I watched hatch into disgusting maggots as confirmation that I had identified the source correctly.  I would never write this if it was not true, buyer beware!  I now have a huge problem with these bugs and I am having difficulty getting rid of them.  I have cancelled my subscriptions so I will no longer introduce new eggs into my pantry every month!
