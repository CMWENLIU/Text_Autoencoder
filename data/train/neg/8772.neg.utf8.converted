seriously, don't waste your money. The gift would be great if the portions of fruit and nuts were reasonable. Sadly, this is not the case. The packaging, which is really nice, contains mostly filler. This was a terrible way to spend $25. I feel too embarrassed to even give this as a gift. I will have a really expensive snack for myself, I guess.
