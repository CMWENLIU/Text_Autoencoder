Kamut pasta is my favorite and I love the plain ones. These vegetable spirals just don't taste right though. They have a very odd flavor. The texture is good and I will use them in soups and with strong flavored sauces and hope no one notices.<br /><br />I was disappointed when I tried these and no one in my kamut loving family ate more than a bite.
