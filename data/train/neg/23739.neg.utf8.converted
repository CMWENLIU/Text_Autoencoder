I recently found this caviar product here on Amazon and was tempted to try it given the fact that the shipping was free with Amazon Prime. Some time ago I bought Black Capelin Caviar 12oz here on Amazon, but the $18.00 or so for the shipping nearly doubled it's cost, so free shipping with this Marky's caviar was very tempting for me, so I placed the order. The shipping was fairly fast 4 days, and when I opened the box I found 4 jars, each packed into a clear bubble wrap and then wrapped into a sealed green plastic pouch. Upon the opening the bubble wrap from all 4 jars, I unintentional touched the lid of one of the jars and heard a distinct "pop", which meant that the lid was not hermetically screwed to the jar. I immediately notified Amazon about this and when I woke up on the next day, a refund of $6.00 was issued to me. Each full and sealed jar weights 202 grams and an empty one (jar and lid) weights 105 grams, which means that you get 97 grams of caviar per jar. All the caviar roes are very uniform and glossy. When I tried a teaspoon of this caviar I immediately noticed how artificially salty it was outside, probably due to added preservatives, stabilizer and spice. I also noticed that the small roes were somewhat hard but made distinct "pops" when you bit on them, and the internal flavor was bland to nonexistent. Later when I spread the caviar on a slice of bread, the whole caviar mass was difficult to spread around and the roes stuck to each other very firmly. In the end I concluded that this caviar is mediocre and most (if not all) of the flavor comes from the added ingredients. I did not feel like a sultan while eating this caviar, but rather than like an easy mark who fell for the low price and free shipping.<br /><br />The ingredients of this Lumpfish Black Caviar are the following:<br />- Lumpfish roes<br />- Salt<br />- Water<br />- Stabilizer (Xanthan Gum)<br />- Spices<br />- Citric Acid<br />- Sodium Benzoate<br />- Blue #1 Food Coloring<br />- Yellow #6 Food Coloring<br />- Red #40 Food Coloring<br /><br />I would not buy this caviar ever again, even with free shipping. The Black Capelin Caviar 12oz was distinctly better than this mediocre caviar. And like with the Black Capelin Caviar 12oz, you also get green poop if you eat 3/4 of the 3.5oz jar.
