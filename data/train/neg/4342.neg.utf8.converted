I got this gardenia bonsai in mid-February and it is not as I expected. Upon opening the package, the leaves are dull green, no buds, dried out and mostly dark brown. I followed the instruction and even did some research work through the internet. I even bought extra stuffs like plant food, cool mist humidifier just to revive the plant. Well now, after 3 weeks, 90% of the leaves are gone, branches bare, looks like those bare trees that you see during winter. I tried to contact the merchant and ask for advise, but I did not get any response. I have other bonsais and regular gardenias that are healthy and I really wanted this gardenia bonsai so bad.
