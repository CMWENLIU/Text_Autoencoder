This is supposed to be a light roast coffee but it states extra bold on the label. How can a light roast coffee be extra bold. The outside of the box does not state that it is extra bold it only says light roast. Threw the entire box in the garbage after I tasted the first cup. Did not want to be bothered with returns.
