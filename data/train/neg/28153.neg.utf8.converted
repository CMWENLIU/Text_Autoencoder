I bought the powdered wasabi (actually faux wasabi) because I was hoping to stop buying wasabi in the tube at $5+/tube.  But, the powdered wasabi was very disappointing.  Where one would use a "tine"ful of tubed wasabi, one has to use a 1/2 tsp of powdered wasabi.  My husband complained after the first mouthful..."Hey, where is the real stuff?"  Oh well,
