I purchased the cherry tomato 3 pod seed kit about one year ago. I followed the booklet's guidelines exactly. There was much leaf growth and occasionally a few flowers, but no tomatoes ever appeared. $20 is way too much for zero production! I'll stay with herbs from now on. By the way, amazon's service and speed of delivery were excellent.
