I purchased this Pectin on April 16, 2012 (this year) and paid $23.58 for the (6) 1oz packages (with Free super-saver shipping). Its a GREAT product, and I love being able to have all my creations *sugar free*.  HOWEVER, I guess since the spring harvest has officially started and canning of jams/jellys is offically underway, the price has been jacked up by almost 100%.  I had come back to buy more, (remember I place my first order just over a month ago) but I was shocked at the price increase. Instead of buying from Amazon I'll be buying from the manufactuor, where I can get 2lbs (32ozs) for under a hundred dollars, including shipping. I know the star system should reflect the product, which in my opinion is top notch.  But in this instance I think the consumer should be made aware of the price gouging being done, which happens to alot of *canning items* from May-September.
