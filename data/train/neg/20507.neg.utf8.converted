I was excited to get these but  did not read the ingrediants before purchasing. Big mistake. To me they are far too sweet and almost sappy tasting.  I dont feel like im eating something healthy rather some of those chewy snakcs they make for kids.  The high fructose is insane and really  i feel they would be  better off with a fraction of what they add.
