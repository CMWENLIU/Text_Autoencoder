Short and sweet:<br />My girlfriend sent me a bottle for Christmas. She lives in Alabama. I live in Maine. I'm not a 'health nut' and I love good steak sauce. This is not it !  The stuff tastes like Kikoman on steroids. It is so salty that I couldn't deal with it. The bottle says an avg serving has 1200 MG of salt (sodium). That is more than HALF THE DAILY ALLOWANCE for someone with no heart problems, cholesterol, yadda yadda. This stuff is HEART ATTACK IN A BOTTLE !  It also has a bunch of MSG. I am not concerned because I think the MSG scare is a bunch of hoopla from the moonbat lefties crowd. If you're a moonbat type, be advised.  My main complaint was the flavor. As I said it tastes JUST LIKE SOY SAUCE. Not my first choice to flavor a good steak. I would STRONGLY recommend A1 steak sauce or Worcestershire Sauce over this stuff ANY DAY. Also, McCormick has some EXCELLENT marinades that come dry in an envelope. Just add oil.  Sorry to dump on this stuff, but I am being as honest and objective as I can here.
