Awful, awful, awful. After the first sip I thought I somehow screwed up the coffee without knowing it. I kept sipping, and with each swallow, I realized that it wasn't getting any better. This is the most disgusting creamer I have ever tasted. What a disappointment! The taste reminded me of burnt popcorn covered in moldy chocolate. Gross!
