My negative review is not at all towards Red Bull, trust me, I've been a Red Bull Junkie for years.  It was the highlight of my life when they finally started making larger cans! But seriously, 45 bucks? Go to any grocery store and you can get a 24 pack for 32.99, and I'm completely aware how sad it is I have that price memorized.
