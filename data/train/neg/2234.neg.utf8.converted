WARNING: IF YOU HAVE A WEAK STOMACH DONT READ THIS!<br /><br />I am giving this one star since I don't think you can leave it blank.  I have written to the company about my problem and sent pictures, three weeks have gone by with no response from them.  I was hoping for an acknowledgment and an apology but alas...<br /><br />I ordered the cookies because of the great comments on Amazon and I am a newly diagnosed diabetic who loves cookies.  I opened the Lemon cookies and was reading my Kindle when something in my mouth didnt feel right.  I spit out what can only be discribed as a TAIL.  It appears to have been baked into the cookie and was hanging out of the piece I spit out of my mouth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I am a 63 year old grandmother of 3, conservative and have NEVER posted anything like this anywhere.  Heaven only knows what I ate in the cookies preceding the tail (assuming it is a rodent tail).<br /><br />Amazon is a trusted part of my life and let me tell you I am terrified to eat anything out of a package again. Beware of these cookies, obviously they have at the least a terrible quality assurance dept and NO CUSTOMER SERVICE.
