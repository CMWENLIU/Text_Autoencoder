This is by far one of the worst products I have ever tried.  The lemon flavor is so strong and sweet, it's almost impossible to taste anything else.  My family really likes lemon chicken, which lead us to think this might be a good option for a quick meal on one of those busy days.  Couldn't have been more wrong!  I agree with a previous poster - not sure how this flavor got past a test panel.  I was reaching for ANYTHING else on the table to get the taste out of my mouth.  Save your money and stick with something safe like the cheesy mac flavor.  This one will surely disappoint.
