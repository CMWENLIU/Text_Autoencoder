I was so excited to use this when my daughter started on vegetables. When I went to blend the food, the darn blade was broken! Needless to say I was not happy and had to return it for a refund. Rather than buying another one and trying again, I'm going with another product altogether. Very disappointing but glad Amazon gave me a full refund!
