I bought this almound flour since my other source was currently unavailable.  I recieved it and made my usual fruit cake.  My cake was just horrid tasting.  I tried to force myself to eat it because I dont want to waste food but just couldn't.  The product I recieved I noticed tonight was almound meal and not almond flour like in the picture.  The two shouldnt taste difference so I doubt that is the reason.  I tested to smell also with the leftover flour from my other supplier and the two are completely different.  Its like comparing old gasoline smell with fresh gasoline.  That how the two were different.  I could be just one of the unlucky few to recieve out of date flour but I thought it would be good just for a heads up for future customers.
