Chex Mix Trail Mix is one of my favorite flavors, the low rating has nothing to do with the product.  Rather it has to do with the freshness of the items I received.  When you purchase food by the case I just expect it to be fresh.  Instead what I got was 3 months from the expiration date and it tasted like it.  If you find a similiar Chex Mix item locally it will most likely have a freshness date almost a year out.  I will think twice before buying anymore food items from Amazon.
