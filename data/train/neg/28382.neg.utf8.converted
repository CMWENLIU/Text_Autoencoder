The first time I bought coca tea I bought Delisse and was very satisfied by its flavor and its underlying properties. When it was time to buy more, I decided to go with this brand due to the "A-Grade" in the title and some of the positive customer reviews.<br /><br />This tea is nowhere near as tasty as Delisse and is completely ineffective at the rejuvenatory things coca tea has a reputation for, much less so than a regular cup of coffee.  Just tasted like dirty water.<br /><br />I also don't like how the seller sells the tea in his own pouches instead of factory cartons. who knows what has transpired between the two?
