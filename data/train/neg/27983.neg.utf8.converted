I purchased a bag of this product which cost about $20 with shipping. The bag isn't quite as big as buying a bag of regular sugar,so in comparison, it's really expensive. That wouldn't bother me if I had been more pleased with it, but it really IS NOT just like sugar.. It's not as sweet at all and just doesn't work that great for baking, which is what I purchased it for. My husband is diabetic and really misses cookies, and we don't want to use any of the artificail sweetners on the market because of all the health hazards connected to them. But Just Like Sugar is not the answer. I made one batch of oatmeal cookies, one pan of brownies and one batch of no bake cookies with this one bag of product, so it cost almost $7 per batch for the sweetner!!! The oatmeal cookies were just so so.. not bad, but not great.. definatly not as sweet as they should have been and they had a different kind of texture.. I'm not quite sure how to describe it..Kind of grainy... The brownies, horrible!! A recipe that normally makes delicious brownies turned out flat and not very tasty. We ate one brownie each and threw the rest out. The no bake cookies were ok, probably the best out of the three recipes, but still not that great... My package of Just Like Sugar also included a small sample of the Just Like Brown Sugar.. I put it on my oatmeal but could barely tell there was any sugar on it..<br />All in all, I guess if you have no alternative it's better than nothing, but I won't ever purchase it again.. I'll stick to Stevia, which is also a natural product and is super duper sweet! I thought the Just Like Sugar would be more convenient because the makers of it claim you use the very same amount in recipes as real sugar, and with Stevia, there's a lot of conversion.. But the claims just aren't true... You'd need to use quite a bit more of the Just Like Sugar in order to have the same sweetness as sugar. Very dissapointing.. After all the hoopla about this product and supposed feedback from happy customers, it just simply doesn't live up to the claims.
