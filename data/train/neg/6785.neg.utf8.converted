I used to drink this tea every day. It was refreshing, left no after taste and doesn't taste like a diet drink. Well, they did something a certain soda company did and changed the formula. It's absolutely horrid now. After twenty minutes the after taste is<br />Still lingering and it gave me a headache! Right now only the hourglass and spiral shaped bottles contain the new flavor. Avoid them at all costs!
