When I tasted this product, I was so impressed by the flavor. It tasted just like the Beef Top Ramen Flavor I enjoyed growing up. I bought this bouillon because the packaging said NO MSG. This was important to me because I avoid MSG at all costs. I recently realized this product has yeast extract (which always contains MSG). Another review mentioned that the company recently retracted the "NO MSG" claim, but too little, too late. I have already consumed and gifted away most of my 12 boxes with the understanding this was an MSG-free bouillon. If you are avoiding MSG, I recommend doing some research because there are about 50 different names that can be used to hide MSG in an ingredient label. "Yeast Extract" is the perfect example of this. There are a lot of other names for flavor enhancers out there that always or sometimes contain MSG. Unfortunately, I did my research about a year after I purchased this product, but hopefully this review will save some other health-conscience consumer from making a purchase they regret.
