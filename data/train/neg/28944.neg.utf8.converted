I bought this sauce tonight because I felt like some linguine alfredo and it was on sale.<br /><br />I opened the jar and got a whiff of something completely artificial.  I can't even properly describe it... it was like plastic.  I thought, huh, maybe it just needs some garlic (I could smell no garlic whatsoever despite the self-described "roasted garlic" label).  I mixed in half a tsp. of minced garlic.  Nope... still smelled like melted plastic.<br /><br />I heated it up.  It smelled worse.  I tasted it.  It tasted worse than it smelled.<br /><br />Bottom line is this... if you like alfredo, don't buy this.  You'll only end up throwing out your dinner and most of a jar of sauce like I did.
