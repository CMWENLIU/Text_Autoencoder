I wanted to like this.  I REALLY wanted to like this.  It is, in a word- HORRIBLE.<br /><br />The idea is a good one.  Meals that you can throw in a backpack or messenger bag, eat on the go, eat in the office, or just have in case you need a quick snack.  Each "meal" comes with several items that are differing in quality and texture- and appeal.<br /><br />Included in this package:<br /><br />Chili Lime Salmon Spread- nasty.  It is a fishy paste of minced up yuck flavored like leftover salmon and a too-sweet chili imitation.<br /><br />Organic Classic Rich Crackers- six crackers that taste as dry as the cardboard box the meal comes in.  A bad imitation of a Ritz cracker that misses the mark entirely.<br /><br />Ginger Zip Fruit & Nut Mix- its a sweet, very ginger infused, trail mix with sweet covered/candied peanuts, clusters of stuff, and craisins. Actually- the best part of the meal.<br /><br />Dry Roasted Edamame- on the box front, you see a picture of a vibrant, green, plump dish of Edamame.  Inside, you have a package of funky looking rejects of a food mumification project.  They taste like dust, diry, and the back end of a yak...I would imagine.  Horrible.  Just horrible.<br /><br />Robust Dark Chocolate Square- actually, this wasn't bad either, but reminded me of cheap chocolate.  The dark chocolate flavor felt too "fake" and the texture was a bit too waxy for me- but all in all, not bad either.<br /><br />So...great idea- but a terrible execution.  The food was a total mixed bag- but I did find use for the box of 6 that I was sent.  I ate two meals for review purposes...then to further cement my review I ate the remaining chocolate, the remaining trail mix, gave the fish paste posing as food to the cat, the crackers to the ducks in the pond and threw the dried edamame in the trash.  A better pre-packaged meal option is a military grade MRE- seriously.  And we all know the sterling reputation those lil' packages of awesome have.
