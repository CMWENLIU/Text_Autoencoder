These seeds pretty much taste like dirt with cayenne pepper and soy sauce.  Every handful you pop in your mouth has a few 'bad seeds' that make the decent ones taste bad too.  I bought a case of these and can't even make it through the 1st bag.  I was hoping for a taste similar to a davids pumpkin seed without all the shells and salt but add some spicy flavor. These are tiny little seeds that are mushy.  The spicy flavor gets very tired quickly, and the overall taste is not good.  I hate to write a bad review, but I wish I read one before buying.
