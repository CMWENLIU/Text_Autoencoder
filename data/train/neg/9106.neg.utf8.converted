I've always gotten another popcorn, Orville's - and love it, but I was happy to see an organic brand. Made it for the first time tonight and blech. Perhaps it's an old bag, but it really needs some flavoring on it because it tastes like nothing. I actually at one point forgot I was eating popcorn and thought - wow, this puffed rice is getting stuck in my teeth.
