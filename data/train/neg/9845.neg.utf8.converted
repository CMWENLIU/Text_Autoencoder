I am sorry to say that I was disappointed in Maxwell House International Coffee Peppermint Mocha Latte. If Teddy Roosevelt had been served this coffee at the Maxwell House hotel, Maxwell House may never have earned their colophon ("Good to the last drop.") This beverage boasts of two flavors; peppermint and mocha. Peppermint flavor has a strong beginning and a weak ending. Also the peppermint flavor does not linger. The mocha flavor is weak to non-existent throughout. I tried following the package directions; four teaspoons per six to eight ounces of water. I then kept adding more and more mix. Unfortunately, I could not find an acceptable ratio. This has to be the worst Maxwell House product I have tried. I do not think it is worth the money. It is very expensive. For the same cost, you could buy coffee beans, peppermint candy, cocoa and milk and create a much better home-made concoction. For the price of one canister, you could probably buy two cups of latte at Starbucks and enjoy it much more.
