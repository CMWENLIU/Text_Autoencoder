I bought this to use as a hair conditioner after reading about it in a magazine. I have long thick hair with split ends. When it came in I decided to try it. It has a wonderful nutty smell and is solid at temps below 70 degrees. I took a chunk out and rubbed it into my palms and then into my hair after shampooing. I made the mistake of just rinsing it out instead of following with another shampoo. Don't do this unless you want grease head! So, the next time I did the same thing, shampoo my hair first apply the coconut oil and allow it to sit for a while, but this time I shampooed it out. Boy what a difference! My hair was soft, shiny and manageable for the rest of the week. I now use it about once a week as a deep conditioner. Great stuff and I'm glad that I found it.
