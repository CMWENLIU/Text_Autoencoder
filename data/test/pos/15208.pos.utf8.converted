Yes, you are right.  This tea is expensive.  It is also quite marvelous.<br /><br />Right off the bat, I was impressed with the packaging of this tea.  The tea comes packed in the correct kind of tin, with both outer and inner tightly fitting lids.  When one pops out the inner lid, one is instantly rewarded with a waft of the wonderful scent of jasmine.  Ah..... Heaven.  Or, if not Heaven, at least a tropical garden at twilight.<br /><br />Now what's this? you might ask.  This doesn't smell like the jasmine tea from the local Chinese takeout place.  Yep.  It sure doesn't.  That's because this is The Real Deal.  This tea is made up of whole baby tea leaves ("white tea") and whole jasmine flowers.  No raggedy bits and pieces of leaves and twigs were to be found anywhere.  No jasmine "flavoring."  No bitter aftertaste.  Mmmmmmmmmmmm.....<br /><br />I carefully prepared the tea according to directions - one tablespoon of tea leaves per 8 oz. of water heated to 185 degrees.  The directions said to steep the tea from four to five minutes, which seemed excessive to me, as I didn't want bitter tea.  But in a real test, one must follow the directions, so I let the tea infuser sit in the water for a full five minutes.  And I was rewarded.  This is an utterly delightful tea, completely lacking the bitterness that can be associated with green teas.  This tea is wonderful "as is" - no sweetener or milk should be added, in my opinion.<br /><br />The directions also stated that one tablespoon can be steeped "multiple times." Well, how many times is "multiple?"  Good question.  The first cup steeped was delightfully aromatic.  The second cup less so, but still good.  The third cup was rather pedestrian, the fourth cup just bland.  Not bitter, not awful, just bland.  I didn't try a fifth round of steeping.  This is a tea best suited for someone who is going to want more than one cup of tea within a fairly short time span - if that is you, you will find there is a lot of bang for the buck with this product.<br /><br />All in all, I find this tea to be just wonderful.
