Avid user of QUINOA (Keenwa).  This grain is a great cereal (add a sweetner or fruit (fresh or dried), add some nuts (chopped almonds, pecans, brazil, filberts or sunflower seeds)add juice or milk and you have a filling breakfast.  My favorite is grated apples, dates and chopped pecans, I add some cinnamon, nutmeg and milk.<br /><br />For Lunch I add any chopped veggies (tomatoes, cucumber, green onions, bell peppers, avocado, olives, raw peas, corn - you get the idea) I have on hand (raw & chopped), with some basil, oregano, parsley (any combination of herbs you enjoy) with some olive oil and balsamic vinegar  on a bed of lettuce and you have a great and filling lunch.  You may add cooked or leftover chicken.
