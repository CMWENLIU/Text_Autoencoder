Finally, a vegan bouillon stock that I can actually enjoy.  I add this to the water when I am making quinoa or rice, and the flavor is outstanding - it really does taste like chicken!  I wouldn't want to drink a lot of the broth, since it does have 1600mg sodium per cube.  However, when making soup/stew/quinoa/rice, this product can't be beat.  It contains no MSG and is gluten-free!
