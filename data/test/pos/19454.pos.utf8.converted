I was a little leery about trying Vegemite...it has such bad press outside of Australia, but I find I absolutely love it.  It is extremely salty, slightly beerish and very savoury.  So far I have mostly consumed it with bread and butter...but I have already started taking tastes straight from the jar.  I also find I like it better with whole wheat bread than white.<br /><br />I think the main challenge for the uninitiated is that it looks like it might be sweet.  It is not sweet at all and you should use it very sparingly mixed with plenty of butter, at least at first.<br /><br />Sadly, my husband also likes it and my supply is dwindling rapidly.  I wish they sold it in a larger size.
