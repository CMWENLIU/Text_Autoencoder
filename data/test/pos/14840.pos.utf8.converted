My wife loves Dubble Bubble. Things are a little tight this year so we decided not to get each other anything for our anniversay and that we'd go out for dinner and a movie instead.<br /><br />Since our anniversary is around Halloween, there's always bags of candy in every store around that time. On our day, I was picking up some office supplies at the local discount store and saw a bag of DB in with the other Halloween candy. I grabbed it cause I knew she'd like it. Just to be weird, I also picked up a little glass decorative kitchen jar and when I got home, I put 6 or 7 pieces of gum in the jar and hid the rest of the bag.<br /><br />I gave her the jar and told her that it was the bottomless Dubble Bubble Candy Dish. She thought that was kind of funny but didn't pursue the reasoning. She took a couple of pieces with her and we went out to our dinner and movie.<br /><br />She only eats a couple pieces a day, so I watched the jar and when it got down to 2 or 3 pieces, I added 4 or 5 more while she wasn't around.<br /><br />Well, the bag lasted for about a month but then I needed to replenish the supply. So I found this giant tub of 380 pieces that should last until the end of April and then I'll get another one. The bucket is great. When sealed, it keeps the bubble gum scent in and hopefully the gum fresh for 6 months.<br /><br />By the way, she's never said a word about the bottomless bubble gum jar but she eats 2 pieces a day. I've never mentioned it again either but every couple of days I add a few more pieces.<br /><br />Dubble Bubble Tub Original Flavor 380 Ct - 5 Stars!
