I bought these Anthon Berg Chocolate Liqueurs Candies for my daughter who is serving in the military overseas.  These are packaged safe; bubbled-wrapped for extra protection from the weather elements and damage.  They arrived in excellent condition.<br /><br />I asked my daughter if the chocolates were fresh -she told me they were the best chocolates she has ever eaten (along with her many friends who shared in the delightful treats).  All wrote back thrilled with how "yummy" they were and said the quality of chocolate were some of the best they've all ever had.  I wasn't sure if it was because they were deprived of such good treats or if they were as delicious as they claimed -but my daughter just came in for the holidays and I purchased more for her and she said they were as delicious home as they were overseas.  So I presume the candies are of high quality and enjoyable.<br /><br />I know what I will be sending in my next care packages overseas to our military and also in the care packages to my daughter!
