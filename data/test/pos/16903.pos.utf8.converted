I live on these! I started taking a medication last year that made my incredibly nauseous all hours of the day. Ginger Chews saved my life (and many dinners). I cut them in half because they are slightly awkward when speaking in public but, I never leave home without them. They live in my car, bag, desk, night stand... you name it. It is a delicious candy to boot but, I highly recommend them for early pregnancy and problematic birth control pills.
