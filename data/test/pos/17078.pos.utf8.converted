I have never written a review before, but I am so enamored by this product I wanted to share my experience. I have two cats, and litter tracking has been a problem for years.  For health and dust issues I stopped using clay litters a long time ago, but have tried everything else.  Any of the crystal litters were hard on my cats paws and not scoopable.  I love the pine litter, but tracking was a major problem.  We have a covered litter box with an internal ramp.  When they came out of it, they step onto a litter mat that was grated and captured litter in a tray below.  They then walk across a fleece mat to capture more.  And finally, they move through a kitty door (a nice sized hole in the closet door - the litter box is housed in the office closet) where there was another blanket.  We did as much as we could, short of personally washing their paws each time they exited the litter.  It didn't matter.  Within hours after daily cleaning and vacuuming the floor would be a mess again.  We had litter everywhere, even beyond the room the box was located in.  It became a joke - a frustrating one.  We love our animals, but the litter was a huge problem.  About a month ago I came across the Green Tea Litter, and tried it.  AMAZING.  Happiness, bliss and wonderment hit immediately.  It is comfortable for the cats paws, easy to scoop, better at covering the smell, and DOES NOT MAKE A MESS!  The daily cleaning ritual of the floors has ceased.  It took years for me to find this solution, I hope to save you some of that time by writing this review.
