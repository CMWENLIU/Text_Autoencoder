I wont go into the quality of this product or the nutritional benefits as I think the 4.5 stars and the customer reviews speak for themselves. However, I think you will find the 54 oz for 20 bucks is the best deal on the Internet, especially when you buy two and choose the super saver shipping option. I would challenge anybody to find a better deal for pure coconut oil of the same quality.
