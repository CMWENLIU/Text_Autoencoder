Since moving to the US, I thought my times for enjoying Biltong were long gone. Well, not so. This chewy, flavorsome delght is just about as good as it gets.<br /><br />I would like to say the bags are too small but that would me being greedy.<br /><br />If you have never had biltong before, its a little different but after your third peice, you will be ordering again.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />p.s. as for the sausage, did I like? Not so much.
