I don't generally review products, but this works so well for me that I wanted to write about it in hopes someone with the same problem will read this and give coconut oil a try.<br /><br />For years I've been trying to find some sort of moisturizing lotion, ointment, or oil that would relieve my extremely dry skin. Lotions required constant reapplication, so they were expensive and inconvenient. Ointments were too thick and would make my skin hot and sometimes exacerbate itching. Baby oil didn't seem thick enough. The best solution I found was dissolving a bit of ointment in sesame oil with a dab of steroid ointment to control itching. It was okay, but not great. Plus, I quickly tired of smelling like popcorn.<br /><br />My dermatologist recommended that I try coconut oil. I've been astonished by how well it works. After only two days of use, my eczema rashes had faded considerably because they longer itched. Patches that I had for months were suddenly gone. The rest of my skin no longer feels dry and tight, which means no new rashes! I only have to apply coconut oil in the morning and after my shower with no need to reapply throughout the day. Best of all, I smell (quite literally) like a fresh coconut right after I apply it, and the scent fades rather quickly (so I don't get sick of it).<br /><br />I realize this sounds too good to be true, and I'll be sure to update if the product suddenly stops working. But for the time being, I'm absolutely thrilled with the improvement I've seen in my skin!
