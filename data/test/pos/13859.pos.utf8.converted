Of couse, you have to like creaminess.  If you do, give this creamed rice a try.  Yeah, I know it's not cheap; so use it for a special occasion.  However, don't think you're going to eat maybe half a can and save the rest for tomorrow.  You won't stop until that doggone can is empty.<br /><br />It's sweet; but a pleasant, soothing sweet.  Very old-fashioned and came in real handy one day when I was feeling just a bit yucky.  You know, you feel like you need to coat your stomach with something rich, but not upsetting. Like maybe a baby food with grownup flavor?  Yeah, open a can.  Make sure it's in the refrigerator waiting or you.
