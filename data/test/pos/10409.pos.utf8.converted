Taza chocolate is hands down one of the greatest tasting chocolates one can buy.  The consistency may not be for everyone (some people don't seem to like the somewhat grainy texture) but I find it enhances the flavors.  These small discs contain such intense flavor and taste, you will not be disappointed.  I've had several different flavors and they are all amazing.  Taza has the taste of fresh, quality ingredients and carefully selected flavors.  There are fancier, more expensive chocolates out there but few compare to Taza.
