My dog who is used to being spoiled with a little bit of everything "mommy" is eating, lol, loves this food.  And I can't blame her.  Sometimes I find myself getting hungry just by the smell of it, during her feeding time...it smells a lot like people food.  And although I would NEVER try it, lol, for those of you snickering at my review, lol...I could swear I see chunks of potatoes in there! Great food, will continue to buy it...saves me time, she loves it, and it smells healthy.
