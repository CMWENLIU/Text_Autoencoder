This past Christmas I received two bags of Vinacafe as a gift from one of my students. It was "love at first sip"!!  I reluctantly shared the coffee with my husband and father.  They were just as delighted with the coffee as I was. My student told me where I could purchase more.  I did, BUT unfortunately our local 88 Market has since closed.  I Googled the coffee and found it on Amazon.com.  I now purchase this great beverage online.  It's convenient and delicious all at the same time.  The price of the coffee is the same that I was paying at the market. Try it! I'm sure you'll love it too!!
