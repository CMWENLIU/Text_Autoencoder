Honestly, it's unfair to review these negatively.<br />Don't buy a feces sandwich if you don't like the taste of poo.<br />That's all I can say.<br /><br />The seller I ordered from sent me a bag of many beans. A pound of buttered popcorn jellybeans just for me. They're soft, chewy and pack one heck of a punch of flavor.<br /><br />So, if you enjoy this flavor, buy them. Don't if you're going to complain about how you willingly bought something you don't enjoy.
