I have searched everywhere for an effective clay mask. This is not like other powdered clays. Redmond clay "swells" when you mix it in water. Try adding 1/4 clay to 1 cup water. Stir it and let it sit. At first it will be clumpy. But then the clay will absorb all the water and become almost like a gel. Give it a good stir with a wire whisk and store the wet clay in a jar. I use it for any skin problems I have. It can be used as a detox supplement as well. Great natural product!
