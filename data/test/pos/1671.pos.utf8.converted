This is the year I vowed to lose 100 lbs. I did that and more and still going. I discovered these gems by accident through an ad online that boasted about a zero calorie noodle. I was suspicious. I read and researched it and put in my first order.<br />I rinsed them thoroughly and prepared my first meal with them using tomato sauce and eating them like spagetti. I was HOOKED! I eat these in several meals a week. I usually throw in some veggies, some low sodium soy sauce and a few ounces of protein and feel like I'm eating like a queen. They keep me full and I feel like I'm indulging. Ignore the negative reviews, honestly, I think these people are expecting the same old starchy heavy noodle they are used to eating with regular pasta. I haven't gone back to wanting or eating "regular" pasta since I started buying these! I even throw them in my Ninja blender to make the noodles very small and mix them with a fat free yogurt and some honey and it tastes like tapioca pudding. (after they are rinsed and patted as dry as possible with a paper towel) Miracle Noodle also makes a "rice" size that is perfect for adding to yogurt and enjoying like tapioca pudding.<br />The biggest secret is RINSE them and even boil them in water for a few minutes and it really does remove any fishy smell. My diet is a priority and I don't mind the couple of extra steps because the results really are amazing. I've also made a Vietnamese style Pho soup with these noodles. Very versatile. It's my secret weapon of weight loss!
