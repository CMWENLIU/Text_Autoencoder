Bob's Red Mill Whey Protein Concentrate stands out among the many protein powders I have experimented with over the years as the purest, best tasting, and best textured. Whey protein (as opposed to soy) is hard to find in a pure form, but Bob's is unadulterated with artificial sweeteners, texturizers, flavorings, etc. It performs brilliantly in low-carb flour replacement mixtures, adding a strechy, spongy, texture that I frankly have not been able to duplicate without a wheat product otherwise in years of trying. Because it is simply the unflavored protein, it is versatile, too; you're not limited to sweet or savory applications. If you bake low-carb, give Bob's a shot! I hope you will be as delighted as I have been!
