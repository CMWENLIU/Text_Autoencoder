This brew is a VERY robust and chocolatey coffee. If bold brews are your favorite, this is the right blend for you. It offsets sweets and desserts well because of its strong aroma and flavor. It also has cacao undertones of its own that will remind you of a dark chocolate bar. It is NOT a very good iced coffee unless you plan to use it as an iced mocha.<br />In a french press: be sure that you add a little extra beans, itll give this blend that extra punch that makes it chocolatey. be VERY careful not to over brew, 3-4 minutes is enough. It will quickly go bitter if you aren't careful (I smell it on occasion to make sure it doesnt get bitter).<br />Compared to other Raven's Blends: This is definitely one of their darkest roasts. If you're not sure what to expect, expect VERY robust full bodied flavor. This blend has a very full bodied cacao flavor.
