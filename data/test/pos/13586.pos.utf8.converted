This Junket mix is fast, easy and tasty. I've used this for years and it never fails to please. You can even add any flavoring or fruit you like for a change, peaches, cruched pineapple, cherries, mint with chocolate chips, oooh crushed Butterfinger, maple and pecans, banana and walnuts, coffee, whatever you want. If you prefer the extra rich creamier high end brand ice cream just add a tablespoon or two of heavy cream powder (Amazon.com) and an touch more vanilla or other flavoring (a Teisseire Syrup maybe? also at Amazon)to the mix and you have a world class ice cream. If by some strange chance you have some left you can put it in popcycle molds and pop them in the freezer for later - much later - when everyone is gone (or napping) and everything is done and you can sit and relax while the dragonflies fly and the hummingbirds hum and watch your flowers grow.
