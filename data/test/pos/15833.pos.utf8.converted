Upon receiving the product I conducted a taste test against the accepted standard -- McCann. I prepared tow batches of 1/3 cup oats, 4/3 cup water, one ounce granulated brown sugar. Served each portion with a pat of butter and 1/4 cup of milk.<br /><br />I could tell no difference in texture or 'creaminess'. The CC, however, had a fuller, more natural taste to me.<br /><br />CAUTION: six cannisters contain a LOT of oats. I live alone and this could probably sustain me through nuclear Armageddon, or at least through global economic collapse.
