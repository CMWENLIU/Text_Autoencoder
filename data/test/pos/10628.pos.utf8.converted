Great Product.  Made of strong durable metal.  Will last a long time.  I had best success by not using the product like explained on the box.  I used a shovel or axe to make slit in the ground for the "clamps" to fit into to secure a clean catch when tripped.  Before setting the traps walk on top of the raised tunnels to find the most active sites to know where to set the trap.  I have killed 5 moles in my yard in the first week.  Happy Hunting and Good Luck.
