I ordered this plant and forgot that I was going to be gone for 3 days. When I opened the box, the plant looked like it was beginning to die, but that probably has to do with being in a box for at least a week.<br />It almost instantly regained its health after I took it out and watered it.<br />It moves (changes orientation based on sunlight) faster than any other plant I've ever seen! It seems to do fine with only being watered a couple times a week.<br />I love this plant.
