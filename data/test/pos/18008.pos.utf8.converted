I ordered the Nesco beef jerky spice after using it in a batch I made some time ago! I have used wet rubs and dry rubs for years to get that jerky taste everyone loves! Nesco makes the only jerky spice that gets everyones attention. I give it to people who have the look of "Oh Great..... another guy who makes his own jerky" and after the first bite I usually hear "YOU MADE THIS? IT'S FANTASTIC". I usually make a few pounds and give it to friends at work and tell them to give it to their families to taste and give me feedback. VERY LITTLE makes it home if any! The "other" jerky makers at work are very jealous!
