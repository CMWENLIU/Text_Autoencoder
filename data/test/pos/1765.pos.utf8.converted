To be honest, I was at first skeptical about this drink.  In my mind, an energy drink had always been any drink with sugar and caffeine levels as high as seen in Monster and Redbull.  My mother one day brought this home from Costco and told me to try it out.<br /><br />It took me probably 2 or 3 drinks to get used to the taste. It wasn't that it was terrible. I guess the "problem" when I started out was that the taste was just a bit different from what I'm used to.  But I have to tell ya this company did a great job sweetening the drink without using sugar or some other artificial crap that's seen in others.  Once you get used to this drink you find yourself popping one out casually once a day.<br /><br />That being said I've noticed that this drink doesn't have the same type of boost you get with caffeine.  The problem with Red Bull and coffee is that the caffeine, while kicking in a lot faster than this drink, also causes you to crash and burn several hours later just as quickly.  This drink however doesn't have that effect.  It gives me a subtle yet noticeable boost for several hours before giving me a "gentle landing" back to where I usually would be without the drink.<br /><br />Anyhow, that's where I am.  Down to 5 tubes and hunting for any deals on this at Costco and here.
