I love this RAW COCOA BUTTER!!!  Once it is melted down and mixed with a little extra virgin olive oil, it's second to none! It's GREAT for any type of skin repair and/or maintenance.  It feels so-ooOh smooth and silky and best of all, after only a few applications my skin felt and looked like a baby's too.  I would recommend this brand of cocoa butter to anyone who has dark spots or scars that need clearing up.  I think it's especially good for darker skin tones, which tend to be more sensitive and should avoid chemically enhanced products.  There is nothing like "purity" for the more melanated skin types.<br /><br />C.A, Los Angeles
