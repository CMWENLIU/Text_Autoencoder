I bought this with fairly low expectations.  I figured it would be dry and crunchy throughout and bland.  Was I wrong!!  This stuff is great dry or in cereal!  While the chocolate isn't creamy, it's definitely not hard and crunchy either.  Kellogg's hit a home run with this one, and I hope to continue seeing it on store shelves!
