I bought this for its lack of sugar and sodium.  It has good flavor and a crisp crunch, even after sitting in milk for a while.  Huge plus is all the fiber you get in just one serving and it is low calorie.  Wonderful for someone who must watch their sugar and sodium intake.  Will buy again and again!  My kids even like snacking on it, I have replaced sugary cereal with this and they have no complaints.
