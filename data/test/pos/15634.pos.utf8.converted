This is the second time i have purchased this product - it far exceeds other brands in flavor. It makes a wonderful pasta or salad oil, and adds delightful flavor to sauteed or roasted veggies. Since it comes in a package of 3, I used one as a very much appreciated hostess gift - aha, another convert.
