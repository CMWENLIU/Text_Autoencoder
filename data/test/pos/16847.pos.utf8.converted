I tried this despite the mixed reviews and am glad I did.  I question whether the critical reviews are of quinoa, often an acquired taste, rather than this product.  I like quinoa and use it in place of rice for its nutritional value, and this product is well-prepared quinoa.  It does not have the soapy flavor of the inadequately pre-rinsed  grain, and it's thoroughly cooked but not mushy.  I've had two containers of it now, and took a big bite of it alone from the first to evaluate the flavor and was happy with it.<br />The packaging is handy for a healthy portable lunch - one of these with a packet of prepared beans is quick and convenient.
