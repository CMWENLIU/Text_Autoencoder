I was planning a menu for a book club party for The Forgotten Garden when I came across a character in the book that put cream on their jam-laden scone.  This was new to me.  I did research and found they were talking about clotted cream.  There are many imitation recipes for this, but I was curious how an authentic clotted cream would taste.  Wow!  This was amazing.  I made cream scones and topped them with the clotted cream and strawberry jam.  I will be sure this clotted cream is in my refrigerator every time I make scones...I cannot imagine there is anything better.
