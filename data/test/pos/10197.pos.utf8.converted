I have always bought this rice milk at Whole Foods, but recently they have taken them of the shelves and put the Rice Dream as their main rice milk. Personally I don't understand why, this milk have less sodium and sugar then rice dream and taste better too. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a milk alternative to taste great and is healthier.
