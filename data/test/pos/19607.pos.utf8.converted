This is genuine North Carolina type BBQ sauce. Vinegar based with spices. None of that thick tomato paste. If you like your sauce to overpower your meat so you only taste tomaoes this is not for you. I'm from NC and this is the kind of sauce I grew up on. It enhances the flavor of the meat and you can make it as hot and spicy as you like. I've been using this sauce for over 25 years.
