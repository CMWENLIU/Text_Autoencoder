This is the best popcorn I have ever bought, outdoes Orville Redenbacker's popcorn in size and taste.  It is also the cheapest at approx. $1.20/lb.  It pops up really well in the microwave (avoid all plastic microwave containers). I use a 3 qt glass bowl with a glass plate on top as a lid.  It fits loosely enough so that when I overfill it with popcorn, the popcorn can lift up the lid easily and let excess gas escape.  Most popcorn is pressure-sensitive so that if there is too much popcorn in a bowl to pop, some kernels will not pop.  Almost every kernel pops when I microwave on high in a 1500 watt microwave oven for about 5 1/2 min (about 1 1/2 TBLSP popcorn) and no added oil.  In fact when I popped about 8 bowls of the popcorn (had to cool off bowl each time to avoid overheating the microwave and burning popped pieces), I found about 5 unpopped kernels in the bottom of the large paper bag.<br /><br />This popcorn outdoes all of the microwavable popcorn brands that you will see in the grocery stores since you are not popping them in teflon/PfoA lined paper bags which will leach out dangerous chemicals (PfoA) into your popcorn with the heat necessary to pop the corn.  If you try to use a lower heat on your microwave you will get progressively more unpopped kernels.  Microwave is better than the hot air corn-poppers since it doesn't cool down kernels in between the pulses of hot air that corn poppers do.  I watch the timer as it counts down and start to note when I hear a pop as the popping slows down.  When I do not hear a pop for 12 sec, it is time to pull the bowl out of the hot microwave. Thus the time to pop a bowl of popcorn will vary from 5.3-5.7 min when starting with a cold bowl and lid.
