I was thrilled when I saw this baking powder at such a great price in the bigger cans. I only use aluminum-free baking powder. It has no bitter taste and is better for you. It's becoming harder for me to find, especially in the bigger cans. The inside top of the can has a straight-edged lip so that it's easy to measure the correct amount by scraping the top of the measuring spoon across it. I love that little feature. I hope that amazon keeps carrying this item!
