Since I buy this locally at 6 1 oz. packs for $2.50 in the supermarket, that's less than 42 cents each, or $8.34 for 20. The most I've seen them sell for was $2.99. That would make the cost $9.97. I only buy the 4-Cheese, since I like them twice as much as the cheddar. So I'll continue to buy them locally instead of getting the convenience box. It sounds like a deal until you figure it out. I will say, though, that these crackers are by far the best new crackers to hit the market in a decade.
