My cat is a picky eater. I ordered this product because I was concerned about my cat's nutrition as she has recently started losing her hair. My vet recommended weaning her onto a healthy, high protein, wet cat food. I had been feeding her cheap dry food.<br /><br />My cat absolutely LOVES this stuff! As soon as it arrived, I opened a can of it, just to see what it smelled like. THIS STUFF SMELLS FINE! I think that is smells BETTER than most cans of cat food that I have opened. It does NOT stink-up my house at all.<br /><br />My cat does not usually eat a whole 6oz can of wet cat food in a day, but she will happily gobble up as much of this as I give her each day! I HIGHLY recommend this product to any one looking for a healthy food for their loved pet.
