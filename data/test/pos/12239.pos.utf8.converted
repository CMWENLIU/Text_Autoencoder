I'm a food scientist with years of experience leading and participating in sensory panels and I'm also a supertaster.<br /><br />I'm always looking for ways to be healthier and I was skeptical about this product because normally things like this are too good to be true.  After a couple years of prompting by my doctor I decided to try Xylitol and I must say that I am impressed.<br /><br />On the plus side this is not a sugar substitute, it is just a different type of sugar so you don't have to worry about chemicals, etc.  There are other brands of Xylitol that are sold on Amazon that contain other things like Sucralose (aka Splenda), which I would avoid because I believe the jury is still out on how safe it is (Sucralose is made by exchanging three Chlorine atoms for OH groups on sucrose molecules).<br /><br />The only way I have used this Xylitol is in my coffee, and I give it two big thumbs up!  And being a supertaster, I require A LOT of sugar (and milk) in my coffee to make it palatable, and even with a lot of Xylitol, my coffee still tastes great.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product, I just wish it wasn't so expensive!
