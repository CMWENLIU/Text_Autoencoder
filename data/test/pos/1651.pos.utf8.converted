I am not sure how long Miracle Noodles have been around, I discovered them sort of by accident.<br /><br />I am about 8 to 10 years late to the low carb lifestyle but I figured any diet that allows me to eat meats and cheeses can't be too terrible.<br /><br />All was fine until I started missing my old carb friend...pasta.  IT was a crippling blow to my diet as I literally went into anxiety mode everytime I saw pasta in a tv show, commercial, movie, read about it...hell, I almost had a breakdown while watching "Lady and the Tramp".<br /><br />Almost as a joke I Googled "zero carb pasta" just to laugh at myself but something unexpected happened. No, Google did not grow a hand and smack me for being stupid, it actually returned the Miracle Noodle page in the results.<br /><br />I was skeptical...who wouldn't be? It is simply not possible to get a real pasta experience from a plant.  Or so I thought!  On a whim and without doing a terrible amount of research I ordered a ten pack of angel hair noodles. 70 glorious ounces of zero carb/zero calorie noodly goodness.<br /><br />For the record, the following is true:<br /><br />They stink.  Yes, there is an odor when you open the package due to fermenting, but once the noodles are washed and boiled the smell is gone and there is no foul taste associated with the smell.<br /><br />They are flavorless.  Yes, they don't have a starchy flavor so common in pasta and noodles because they are not made from starch. They are simply plant fiber.<br /><br />They have a rubbery texture.  Sort of, but if you follow the instructions this is minimized and the end result is on par with a toothsome al dente pasta. It is not like chewing on rubber bands.<br /><br />The noodles do take on the flavor of whatever you cook them in, sort of similar to the way tofu operates. Because of this, I recommend not using the noodles as you would spaghetti. If you boil your noodles and cover them in pasta sauce you are setting yourself up for disappointment, and the makers of the product know this, hence they give you a recipie booklet to take full advantage of the power of the noodle.<br /><br />I usually make a spicy stir fry in szechuan sauce and add the noodles at the last moments and allow the noodles to absorb the peppery sauce.  The entirte dish has only 4 grams of carbs and is filling.<br /><br />Let's not forget that the noodles are a great source of fiber!<br /><br />Do not go into the order process expecting spaghetti or egg noodles. But if you are on low carb, gluten free, or simply trying to change your eating habits then Miracles Noodles are simply that, a miracle.<br /><br />Thank you Miracle Noodles for allowing me to enjoy my food once again.
