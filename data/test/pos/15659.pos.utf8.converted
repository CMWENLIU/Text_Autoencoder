Great Coffee taste with all the flavors of fresh ground coffee and a French Press with out the mess.  Solofill Cup is almost idiot proof.  If you can read and follow directions you will have no problem with this.  My K Cup works fine, but the Solofill Cup works better.  Easier to use, better flow, more of the flavors of fresh ground coffee come through.  If you use the right grind, only fill to the fill line, make sure the gasket is clean and snap the lid shut it will work right every time.  Added bonus, when I am in a hurry and snap a factory K Cup in, I don't have to change the filter holder.  Best $15.00 spent in awhile.  Get to use local custom blend fresh whole bean coffee that tastes as good as French Press.  My K Cup coffee always lacked some of the flavor, Solofill Cup does not.
