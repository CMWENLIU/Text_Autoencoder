My Aussie loves these! They last more than a week - I don't let her go at it for more than 30 min of course. First she'lll work on the 'stuffing' - eventually getting down to the bone inside ( breaks down to 2 bones) and then finally there is the hoof. And remember, X2 because it is a pair! They are not messy either. Great value, after buying 3 I bought a dozen more on sale!
