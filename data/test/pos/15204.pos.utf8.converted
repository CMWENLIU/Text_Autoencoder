I have been making my own yogurt for a couple of years now and I needed a new starter.  I don't have any other brand to compare to, as my previous starters were finished yogurt from another batch.  I decided to start each Spring off with a fresh starter, so I bought this product and it performed nicely.  I reserve some from each batch to start the next batch and that works just fine too.
