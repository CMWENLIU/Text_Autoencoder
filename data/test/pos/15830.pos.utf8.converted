Thanks to a tip from a friend we recently bought a Zojirushi rice cooker which also has a "Porridge" setting. Wow, are these oats ever delicious when cooked that way. We will never go back to rolled oats and it is terrific to have such an easy way to make them perfectly. As much as I love this product, I don't love Amazon's price. I just bought two 30 oz containers of this exact product at our local Trader Joe's for only $2.29 each.
