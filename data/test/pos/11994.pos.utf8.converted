I use to go to Jamba Juice every morning and spend at least $2.95 on my matcha drink. Then I learned about this product on line, thinking that it couldn't be as good I thought that I would try it anyway's.Well to my suprize this product is as good if not better than Jamba and ounce for ounce I use to pay $59.00 a month at jamba now I pay 20.00 for 3 months worth!!!! Just a suggestion try it mixed with pineapple juice, Yum!!!!!!!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F10XUU">Matcha Green Tea Powder (1/2 lb.)</a>
