I love this tea. I suffer from fatigue, mild depresssion and fairly severe social anxiety. I have found that this tea gives me a little pep without being overly stimulating. It helps with motivation. It brightens my mood significantly. It also takes the edge off in social situations to some degree for me. It has a pleasant taste and aroma. It seems to help settle a slightly queasy stomach also. Once it helped a pretty persistent (but not  severe) headache quite nicely as well. I am very pleased with this product. For me it is the best tea I've found thus far.
