These are my favorite cookies.  They are so easy to make but you must use real butter for the best taste.  I always keep a package in the cabinet for short notice needs.  Just add butter and egg!  I love to roll the dough into balls and then roll the balls in sugar and cinnamon to make a special snickerdoodle.
