These peaches are excellent, and extensive surfing and cross-verifying on the internet assures me that Edward & Sons' Native Forest Brand products are packed in BPA free cans.  Also, the USDA is pretty careful about who they allow to use their USDA Organic label, so I trust that a whole lot more than reviewers whose main complaint seems to be that these peaches are produced in China.  One of these reviewers has posted very similar reviews of Native Forest Mandarin Oranges and Native Forest Pears.  He states that the peaches, pears, and mandarine oranges are all either "delicious" or "fairly tasty".  But if he is so fearful about China and what he claims (falsely I believe) that these products are packed in BPA lined cans, I can't help but wonder whether he really tasted any of these products.
