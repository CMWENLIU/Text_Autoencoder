After reading the reviews here I was a bit leary of this stuff, but the price on it was just too good to pass up, I figured it couldn't taste that much worse than whey. Since going vegan I've been looking for a replacement to whey, and I don't really want to use soy powder because my diet already has a lot of soy in it.<br /><br />The taste is fine, after seeing the reviews here I expected it to be god-awful, but it doesn't have much of a taste and isn't really noticeable. I mix it in a blender with ice, a banana, and some rice milk or soy milk or water and I barely even notice the taste at all. The only complaint I have is that the powder tends to sink to the bottom of the glass, so I have to stir it with a spoon a few times to make sure it stays mixed with the liquid.<br /><br />And the price is really great, definitely buy it from amazon.com if you can.
