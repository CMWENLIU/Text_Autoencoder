A coke or pepsi fan would probably disagree since they are addicted to the heavy sugar or artificial sweeteners, and I never was a big cola fan, but this was really, really good.  Sweet but light; no mistaking the authentic cola flavor though.  Now if they would just make a grape soda I would be in heaven!<br /><br />I've been using stevia in my tea, smoothies, and hot cereal for years and hoping that it would start being used in food/beverage products like this so I hope this is just the beginning.  The FDA and an "unnamed" corporation have been trying to keep this all natural herb from American consumers as a sweetener.  It just kills me that we are the fattest, unhealthiest western nation in the world, mostly due to our addiction on sugar and artificial, processed food additives, and yet, something that is not only non-glycemic but actually healthy is being conspired from it's use.
