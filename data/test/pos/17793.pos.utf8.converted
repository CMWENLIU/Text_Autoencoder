I never liked mayonnaise until I went to Japan, where I gained a new respect and appreciation for the condiment. The reason? Japanese mayo is different. And it tastes better.<br /><br />Before that, I was only familiar with standard American supermarket varieties like Hellman's and Kraft, and the idea of putting them on things like leaf salads and fries wasn't particularly appealing.<br /><br />Kewpie, though the ingredients are similar, has a pronounced tanginess that balances the rich creamy texture, making it ideal as a mainline topping for a wide variety of foods. They go great on fries (Belgian style), leaf salads, and grilled meats. Japanese people put mayo on a lot of things, including okonomiyaki, takoyaki, yakitori, even pizza.<br /><br />There is something decidedly fun about the squirt nozzle. It is much more convenient than American jar mayos that you have to scoop out and then plop onto the food in a big glob. The bottle itself is shaped like a pastry bag, with an opening about the diameter of a strand of cooked spaghetti. This allows you to squirt mayo with precision over your food, letting you control its distribution as well as design. Food I had in Japan often came with cross-hatched mayo patterns, like the pattern you see on the bag. If you remove the cap, the inner opening is star shaped, allowing for more decorating fun if you have kids.<br /><br />It is far superior to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5EAK">Kraft Mayo Real Mayonnaise, 18-Ounce Easy Squeeze Bottles</a>, which come in an overly-rigid bottle with a horizontal slot that easily introduces air into the bottle as it re-inflates for the next squeeze, causing frequent splatter. Mayo also clings to the bottle's side and I have to give it a good hard jerk to get enough dislodged for another squeeze. Kewpie doesn't have this problem. It is soft and pliable like a toothpaste tube. Splattering is never an issue and the free-flowing consistency of the mayo formulation makes getting it all out quite easy. The bottle is also transparent and devoid of any stickers and labels, making it easy to see how much is left, and its tapered design channels the mayo into the opening.<br /><br />Nutrition values are similar to American mayo. 100 calories per tablespoon (90 from fat), 20mg cholesterol, 100mg sodium. It does not contain any preservatives or artificial additives besides MSG. Kewpie is made in Japan, not in US subsidiary factories, so this is a true taste of a Japanese favorite. Give it a try and see why this is loved by so many people in Japan and Japanese food lovers the world over.
