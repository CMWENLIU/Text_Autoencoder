Currently we use only Pedigree Puppy dinner's and products, it's my number one choice, the puppies love this product, it provide, excellent nutritional value, and has never been on the list of recalled products to date. Pedigree web site is always happy to send you any information you ask of them concerning a product they sell. They will also keep you informed, if by chance there is any problem with their products, simply visit the site, and request product updates. Highly reccomend, and have used Pedigree, for more than 20 years.
