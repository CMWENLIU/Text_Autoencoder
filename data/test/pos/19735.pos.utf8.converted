For digestive reasons, I decided to try a gluten free diet: not so easy and Eden offers a lot of gluten free products.  This grain was very easy to cook, and to make it more flavorful I added chopped shiitake mushrooms (great for the immune system) and pucini stock cube with low sodium chicken stock.  Even my husband liked it (not easy getting everyone in the family to try new and healthy products).<br /><br />The grain may not open up after cooking for 20 minutes, but I found it very soft.  So dont over cook to get the 'open' grain look like that on the package.<br /><br />The price that is offered on Amanzon is fantastic compared with our local health food store.  Once I finish the pack, I will order from here.
