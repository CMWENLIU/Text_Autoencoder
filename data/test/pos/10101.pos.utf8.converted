It really stinks that eating the healthiest foods costs the most but in my opinion, it's worth it.  I love these cereals.  The first case I bought from amazon was the original and I wound up eating it for breakfast, snacks, lunch, whenever, without milk or adding anything... I love the crunch and the taste. I actually ate the whole case in about 2 weeks and very little else... and it is amazing that I didn't gain weight, my bms were much better, and I had great energy and felt well- my body was craving it.  Try that on Coco Puffs, Cornflakes, and even any of the other "healthy" cereals in the healthfood stores!<br /><br />I actually make my own sprouted grain breads and crackers which I could easily break up to make this type of cereal- there is nothing in the world like it, but it takes 2 days of sprouting and a couple of hours to complete the food processing and spreading on the baking sheet process, and then 3-4 hours of low-heat baking.  So when I don't have time to do this, a very close second are the Ezekiel products (their bread, english muffins, cereals, and pastas).<br /><br />Anyone who makes health their top priority will eat very little of non-sprouted grain products (flour products).  For those interested, Amazon sells a book called the Essene Gospel of Peace which contains writings found in the Vatican archives- in this little book, Jesus teaches his followers how to make bread, and it has nothing to do with taking the dry grain and grinding it up into flour and using yeast- he teaches them to soak the grain, let the sun bring it to life, grind it up alive, and then let the sun bake it.  That makes the only truly living, healthful breads and cereals.<br /><br />Yes, these products will feel and taste different than most are used to, but the more one eats this type of real food, the more the body starts remembering and then one begins to really enjoy the taste and textures because they equate to life and health.  :)
