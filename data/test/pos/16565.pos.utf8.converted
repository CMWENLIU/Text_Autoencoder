I ordered a box of these from Butler and made our first meal with them last night.  I rehydrated them per the package directions with 4 1/2 cups warm water with about a 1/2 cup BBQ sauce, for flavor, stirred in for 10 minutes.  Then I drained them, carefully pressing out the excess water.  Moved them to a pan and simmered with remaining BBQ sauce (what was left from the bottle - about 3/4 cup) for about 20 minutes.  Served them on crusty hoagies.  YUM!  The texture was SPOT ON.<br /><br />These are the best vegan meat replacement I've had since becoming vegetarian.  If I had to say one negative about this product, it would be that they are pretty sauce/seasoning dependent (so you really need to get your sauce/seasoning right!). My normally picky vegetarian teen had two servings!  These are definitely going to be a staple in our house!
