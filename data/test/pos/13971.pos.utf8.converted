If you notice, all the bad reviews are from people who seem not to understand there are k cups and there are coffee pods...2 totally different systems. by their inability to read, they create a negative view of this product. The coffee is excellent and much cheaper than k cups. Not sure it is as good as Java One Sumatra coffee but pretty darn close. For those who own pod brewers this is worth a try. For those of you who own keurig k cup brewers be a little smarter and don't knock the product because you can't read or don't know the difference between k cups and coffee pods.It is not the products failure.
