These wheat berries are clean and very fresh.  The Subscribe & Save is a great deal if you don't have a local source for wheat berries.  I made the most amazing bread I have ever tasted with these freshly ground wheat berries.  I would recommend these and Bob's Red Mill products in general to anyone wanting healthy, quality ingredients to feed to their family.  Yum!
