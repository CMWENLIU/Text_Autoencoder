I bought these for our weekly grilled pizza night.  We just smash up the tomatoes and use them for our sauce, no spices or anything!  My toddler and preschooler can't get enough, and I've given cans as parts of pizza kits to friends and family.  They are a huge hit around here.  It's not necessary to spend money on the certified pricier San Marzanos, in my humble opinion.
