well now i no longer have to wait for friends to send me arabic coffee from palestine, i can make it myself here in the US of A. i typically roast a handfull of cardamon and then mix it with the Arabic Yemini coffee -also from amazon- and grind it realy fine. this makes a perfect cup of coffee.<br /><br />cardamon is also great on ground meat, i usualy add it to my burgers and they taste fabulous.
