I hesitate to write a review to add attention to this coffee.  I want to keep it a secret!<br /><br />My husband and I decided that if we are going to be drinking something everything morning for the next 50 years of our life, we want it to be organic.  Fair trade just happens to be another bonus.  Both coffee and sugar are the highest sprayed crops in the world.  Coffee especially so we first made the switch over this brand and tried this flavor first.  We grind it at home and brew it with an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HBCVX0">AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker with Bonus 350 Micro Filters</a>.  The combination of grinding it fresh every morning and brewing it with the aeropress makes for the best cup of morning coffee EVER.  We use a simple <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SPEU">Krups 203-42 Electric Coffee and Spice Grinder with Stainless-Steel blades, Black</a> and simply grind it for 15-18 seconds.  We also switched sugars and now use organic and fair trade sugar as well along with locally bought raw milk.  The best sugar for this is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZIO">Rapunzel Pure Organic Whole Cane Sugar, 24-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a>.<br /><br />YOU CANNOT GET THIS TREATMENT AT STARBUCK!<br /><br />It really does make for the best coffee in the world if you grind it right, brew it right and use wholesome ingredients.  My husband threw out his old coffee pot and went from being a die hard pot of Folgers a day to simply drinking four shots of this in the morning.  We both feel like we are drinking delicious coffee from Vienna every morning.  We tried this flavor first, but we are going to try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L6OZRO">Equal Exchange Coffee, Organic Colombian, Whole Bean,12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> next by the same brand.  We prefer light roasts instead of darker roasts like French.  Incidently, most people don't know this, but the lighter the roast - the more caffeine in it and in our opinion, the better the flavor.  Darker roasts seem to really kill the flavor of coffee and you run the risk of more oils and higher acid and bitter flavor.  I don't really know why people like dark roasts and I think it is more the sound of it than the actual flavor that they fall for.  We both discovered at one point that lighter roasts such as breakfast blends and Columbian has better flavor, more caffeine, less acid, etc and ever since stay away from darker roasts.  We might also try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5WQI">Equal Exchange Organic Coffee, Breakfast Blend, Ground, 12-Ounce Bag (Pack of 3)</a> at some point as well along with the decaf so we can enjoy an afternoon drink.  I notice this particular blend seems to have two colors of coffee beans in it, one is light and one is medium.  No darks which we love!<br /><br />This might seem like an elaborate set-up, but we actually came about all this after struggling for a couple of years drinking coffee and getting sick from it.  I finally discovered that I am sensitive to the acids in coffee.  This put me on a lot of research on coffee, the acids in it, how it is made and the best ways to grind and brew it.  Both my husband and I are fairly frugal but after reading that coffee is the worst sprayed crop in the world except for Christmas trees (ever notice how Christmas tree farms have nothing but dead ground around the trees.... yeah, exactly like that!), we made the decision to do this.  Also, I now can enjoy and drink coffee every morning without any abdominal pain.<br /><br />So remember, this coffee + good filtered water + fresh grind + aeropress + rapunzel sugar + raw milk = best coffee in world!<br /><br />Enjoy!
