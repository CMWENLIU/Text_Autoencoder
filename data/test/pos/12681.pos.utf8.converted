I am a fair weather tea drinker & I can only palate most teas with a lot of sugar. This tea is the ONE exception. I first drank this years ago in a Good Earth restaurant (the first really healthy restaurant) & I was hooked immediately! I have never since found a tea that was even close to this. Most teas have a leafy, stick taste that screams to be covered up with sugar. This tea stands alone, no sugar, no cream - nothing but incredible full flavor. It is not much like typical tea but rather almost a cider instead (minus the apple juice). It has the most wonderful cinnamony flavor that is warming & relaxing. I have even made it cold & it is good, but so different from the usual ice tea.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anybody who is looking to enjoy tea but who doesn't like the leafy flavors of typical tea, try this one!
