This soup is not only high in Vitamin A and C but is great to have on hand for a quick lunch or dinner, either alone with supplemented with bread or crackers and a salad. It is also completely gluten-free.<br /><br />Imagine this: you're hungry, don't have anything on hand, don't want to out and buy groceries. With a 12 pack of this on hand (currently averaging $2.50 a can but a deal because it is so filling), you simply need to open the can, heat it and add whatever you want to offset the low sodium - unless you are on a low-sodium diet. I'm NOT on a low-sodium diet and don't mind the lack of salt. However, if you want a stronger or saltier taste, you can add a bit of regular or garlic salt or salt substitute. I also prefer to add a dollop of sour cream or low-fat yogurt and that makes a HUGE difference. With some crackers, I'm set for lunch or even dinner.<br /><br />Look below for the nutritional content and other benefits but don't overlook those impressive amounts of Vitamin A and C. Sure, you'll need more for your daily requirements but this doesn't have that horrible preservative taste of other canned soups and my whole family loves it. I sometimes add a bit of chicken or vegetable broth and add some lightly sauteed onions or celery. But none of that is necessary. Good to have on hand for power outages, blizzards or times when you need food and the stove won't work. It can be eaten cold in a pinch.<br /><br />Other pros:<br /><br />1. No trans fats, MSG or preservatives. NO GMOS, no bio-engineered ingredients.<br /><br />2. Tastes a bit bland by itself (low sodium) but add some pepper, a bit of salt and a dollop of sour cream and yogurt and it is elevated to a far tastier soup.<br /><br />3. Great to have on hand for emergencies or when you're rushed for time and need a quick meal. Perhaps hearty eaters would want more but I find a can to be totally satisfying and hearty enough to keep me full till dinner or eve as a dinner entree.<br /><br />4. My whole family likes it but they do prefer salt. So take a chance on this and see if your family likes it. If they do, having this on hand could be a major time saver and you'll know they aren't getting trans fats.<br /><br />5. Relatively high vitamin content compared to other commercial soups.<br /><br />Nutritional content (daily values): Vitamin A- 45 percent, Vitamin C - 20 percent, Calcium - 6%, Iron - 15%, Fat - only 4 grams (no trans fat and only .5% of saturated fat), no cholesterol, 340 mg sodium, 24 grams of carbs, dietary fiber 32%, protein - 7 grams, sugars - 5 grams.<br /><br />We find that if we have this soup before a larger meal we don't feel inclined to eat as much. If you are trying to lose weight, this is a plus. Each can is around 360 calories unless you want to stretch this to 2 servings. I don't prefer to do that but if you have toddlers or very young children, half a can should be plenty. I'm sold on this wonderful soup!
