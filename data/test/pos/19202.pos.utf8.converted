I love these pinto beans. Prior to soaking them I always put them in a strainer but unlike most pinto beans bought in bulk, there's never any foreign objects that need to be discarded. I appreciate the package size. To prepare. I cover them with water (about 3 inches over the top) in a pot, cover it and let it soak overnight. In the morning, discard the water (it can be used for watering your plants) and, if making a whole box, add 6 cups (3 cups of liquid for every 8 ounces of beans) of water, or broth, bring to a boil, then simmer covered for 90 minutes.<br /><br />They are delicious and highly nutritious (you probably already knew that). Of course, that they are organic, also makes them even more appealing, in my mind.<br /><br />I've purchased this product twice (total of 12 boxes). I've used ten of the twelve boxes and the quality is consistent.<br /><br />Buy and enjoy with confidence.
