Initially, I purchased Muir Glen diced tomatoes after reading taste tests results on the Cook's Illustrated site.  However, I currently only order the Muir Glen Organic Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes which are delicious.  I use them in every recipe that calls for diced tomatoes.  The flavor is rich and full of flavor.
