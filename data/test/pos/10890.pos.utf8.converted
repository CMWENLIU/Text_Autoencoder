My main concern with ordering this from Australia was that it might be stopped at customs by someone who couldn't distinguish that there is a difference between coca and cocaine. I've heard stories about these products not making it to some customers in the UK, which is about as ridiculous as seizing a bread roll because of the poppyseeds on top. But I digress...<br /><br />Anyway, the tea arrived quicker than any of the other random stuff I ordered, in the same package as is pictured, and even included a sample of Anise tea, and Clove and Cinnamon. The taste? Well, it's not unpleasant. The aroma is like grass clippings, but don't let that put you off. And I can't vouch for migraine recovery or any of the other wonders this product is supposed to achieve (probably because I don't suffer migraines). But all in all, a positive experience ordering from Andina store.
