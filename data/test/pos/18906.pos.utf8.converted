Sometimes health discoveries, (wonders), are simply amazing.  Hemp seeds are helping me turn my health around because I'm nurturing my cells.  How I know is because I don't crave or binge on junk food and sugars like before, as well as "diet" products, and I no longer feel like I'm starving. This became forefront to looking for real food, other nutrition<br />"secrets" and, basically, gave me motivation to come out of a slump I was<br />in while not looking after my health like I should have been.  A good friend threw me this life-line which I gladly pass on.  Amazon.com had the best price with the free shipping so I'm sticking with good people, and powerful nutrition.  My overall health is only getting better day by day, and a good outlook itself becomes good medicine.  Do the research, you'll be amazed.  Lucky you for discovering hemp seeds.  A. prouty
