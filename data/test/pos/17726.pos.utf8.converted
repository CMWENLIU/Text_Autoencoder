This fly trap works. Period. Yes, it can stink; however, when I look at how many hundreds of flies are in it and how many thousands have been therefore prevented from reproducing I have no problem holding my breath when walking by the traps.  I dislike our throw away society and do force myself to add water and dump the dead into a bag, tie it up and toss it in the dump then just re-bait and hang.  We have a herd of horses and the difference with these traps around is happily noticeable.  Get these and you won't be disappointed.
