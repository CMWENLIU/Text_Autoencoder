I really am glad that I stumbled on the $10 off promo and tried these chocolate milk cartons.  The kids like them better than juice, and I do too!  Even putting 100% juice in the lunches is not as good as these.  With the school lunch periods getting shorter & shorter, I want to be sure that the kids get nutritionally dense foods - not just a short term sugar rush.  These help immensely.  I really recommend the product, and will continue to purchase it.
