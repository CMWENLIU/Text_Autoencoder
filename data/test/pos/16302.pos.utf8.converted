This is a really good, really cheap gluten free corn flour.  You can't use it to make polenta--that's corn meal, not corn flour.  However, you can make skillet corn bread with this (put masa harina corn bread into Google, and it will pull up a couple of recipes--they also call for wheat flour, so substitute northern bean or white rice flour and a tsp of guar gum per cup of flour.)<br /><br />If you're new to cooking gluten-free, watch out for cross-contaminated brands.  This one is safe, because corn is the only thing they mill.  It also says, "Gluten free" on the package.  And, best of all, it's about a dollar a pound.  (Brown rice flour costs twice that much.)
