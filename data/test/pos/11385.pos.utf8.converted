This almond butter is nothing like the ones you usually find at the store. It is made from blanched almonds, so it has a creamier texture, sweeter flavor (no bitterness from the skins), and is easier to digest.<br /><br />I love it mixed with a bit of honey or blended with medjool dates for a rich treat or topping.<br /><br />It also makes a delicious almond milk. Just blend with water.<br /><br />Of course, I can blend my own blanched almond butter, but it is nice to have a pre-made version, too--especially since good quality blanched almonds are hard to find and quite expensive (maybe a little cheaper than the price of this jar, not sure). Blanching them on your own takes considerable time, and time is at a premium.
