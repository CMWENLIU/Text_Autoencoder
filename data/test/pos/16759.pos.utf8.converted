A friend of mine developed an infection on her arm (probably due to a cat scratch) and the usual triple antibiotic ointment wasn't doing a thing. The infection was spreading up her arm. So I told her to apply the Wedderspoon Manuka Honey once a day with a band aid to cover. Two weeks later, the infection was healed. This is my first experience using the honey after reading studies about its effective use on staph infections.<br /><br />This product on Amazon had the best price by far.
