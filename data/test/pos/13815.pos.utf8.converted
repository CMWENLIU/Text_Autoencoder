This price is no deal!<br /><br />These Brownies are absolutely delicious...the problem is, they are so hard to find!!! I have gone to seven grocery store chains, Walmart, and Sam's Club, and none of them carry these. My co-worker told me they are sold at Costco, but I don't have a Costco Membership. So, I told her I found them on Amazon for $20+ per box, and she told me not to buy them. She went to Costco and got the same 38 count box for me for $10.99. I love Amazon, and usually I get great deals here. However, this time around I have to say that this is not a deal!!!
