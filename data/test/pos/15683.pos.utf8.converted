I used to love the chocolate & chocolate pb, when they had the older calorie stats.  They don't taste as good now:-(  Last week, I bought the chocolate, mint, coffee, strawberry & cookies & cream.  Not a huge fan of any, but coffee is delicious - by far, my favorite!!  I am buying more today!! I don't think its super strong.  I like regular coffee, but not pitch black, & I thought this was great.  Highly recommend trying this flavor!
