I've always given my dog grain-free dry food, tried many brands but I've gotta say I'm very pleased with Hi-Tek Naturals. My lab enjoys eating it, doesn't have any negative reaction to it, and her poop is nice and firm. The 30lbs bag is very affordable considering it's grain-free. It also contains a good amount of proteins and vitamins; and it's received many good reviews (and starts) from other dog food websites. I recommend it to those seeking another grain-free choice or wanting to try grain-free for the first time.
