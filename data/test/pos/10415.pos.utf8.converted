I just discovered Dinty Moore's Meatball Stew this month and I love it - it's the most delicious new canned food I've tasted in some time. I have no idea how long this product has been around - it's never been available in my area before the local Big Lots began carrying it.  I find it far better tasting than Dinty Moore's more famous and easily available Beef Stew.<br /><br />I'm happy to see the meatballs here are beef and hope they stay that way as so many canned and frozen foods have recently changed the meat in their products from beef to pork or a beef-pork mix. I now always check what's in the product if it does say right out in the title or front label even if it's something I've bought for years. It would be great if Amazon would post the ingredients to this product in their listing as I'm sure many would like to know just exactly what is in the food product they are buying.
