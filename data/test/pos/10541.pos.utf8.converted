A rabbit hunting we will go!  A rabbit hunting we will go!<br />You do not know the thrill my children get from these rabbits!  I attach them to strings, attach the strings to my feet and run like the wind around the yard!  Then my children can come running after them with the shotguns!  The only downside to this method is that I have gotten shot a few times, but no sweat about that...  My great Aunt Sherma is a doctor.
