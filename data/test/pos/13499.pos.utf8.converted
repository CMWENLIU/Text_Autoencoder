Our family was diagnosed as celiac 3 years ago - and immediately had to stop eating so many simple, familiar foods and begin carefully baking everything from scratch - a HUGE burden. When I found Namaste mixes, it was as if we got back a bit of convenience again: great tasting, easy to make muffins, brownies, cookie bars and cake mixes. We mix all sorts of different things into the muffins: berries, nuts, chocolate chips, spices or pumpkin, depending on our mood. In a very short time we have a great batch of fresh muffins that TASTE GREAT!!!<br /><br />Hey Amazon, how about stocking the brownie and blondie mixes, too?
