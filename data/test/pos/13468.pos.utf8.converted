These are the sturdiest cake papers I have come across in a long time, yet they aren't so hard that you can't pull them off easily. Having a nice neutral color is refreshing as adults, but when I want to decorate them, they go with anything I want!! My only regret is that the size is the TOP of the cup, not the bottom, they fit in the standard 12-cup pans wonderfully. (I was looking for the larger ones.) These are so economical and you don't have to grease which is nice for calorie/fat counting. Also, the product stays fresher and you have great portion control.
