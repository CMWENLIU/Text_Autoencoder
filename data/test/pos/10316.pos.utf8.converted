This was my dad's absolute favorite candy. He loved orange and bittersweet chocolate best of any flavors and this was, for him a match made in heaven. I adore it as well. After my dad passed away, I found a stash of them in his cupboard. They aren't easy to find, but they make a most welcome after-dinner sweet with coffee for guests.
