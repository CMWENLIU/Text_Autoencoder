I bought this cheesecloth to make whey and cream cheese from raw milk (recipe found in Sally Fallon's Nourishing Traditions) and never had any problem with it whatsoever.  I don't expect to use any cheesecloth with just one layer so I believe I folded twice when in use, but it won't hurt to fold it a third or even fourth time.  The best part: it comes in a pack of six so you save money.<br /><br />I had no problems with it whatsoever.
