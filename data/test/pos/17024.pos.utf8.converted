Goat milk is closer to human milk that is cow milk.  But go to the grocery store and try to purchase goat milk.  It is super expensive, or it is simply not in stock.  We looked for powdered milk in its stead and found that it too was expensive.  HOWEVER, we bought in bulk from amazon and after the discounts, we were paying half price from the grocery store, including shipping!
