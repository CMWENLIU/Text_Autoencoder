I brought these cookies as a "dish to pass" at my family Christmas get together. they were a hit. The cookies were fresh, and unbroken. packaging was well done, and delivery was prompt. my sisters had fun with the fortunes, by adding the phrase, "while in bed" after reading each fortune.<br /><br />I will use the Amazon vendor, "House of Rice" again.
