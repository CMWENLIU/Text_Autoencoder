Premium chocolates (such as Black Panther) have much character and subtlety in their flavor, with aromas that are fruity and spicy. Besides being a fine taste, you can feel good about eating this because it is rich in healthful antioxidants, is grown so as to protect the environment, and is "fair-traded" to give the farmers a break. In addition, 10% of net profits go to help endangered species or indigenous peoples.<br /><br />This chocolate is barely sweet, but more sweetness would detract from the intense flavor, as well as raise the glycemic index that we're better off without. It's even easier on your teeth.<br /><br />Although I'm giving BP 5 stars, it's really about 4.6 so as to leave room for the indescribable chocolate dream varietal Ocumare.
