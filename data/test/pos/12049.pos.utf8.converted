I mostly drink regular non flavored coffees....but since buying the Keurig I have grown fond of flavored coffees as a dessert or afternoon pick me up. This Island Coconut is by far one of my favorite coffees to indulge in. The coconut taste is very realistic and fresh, and it makes a wonderful iced coffee treat.The only thing I wish was a little different is that it is a mild coffee and I believe the coconut could stand up to a bolder blend.
