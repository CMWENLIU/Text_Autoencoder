Steel Cut Oatmeal is a great way to start the morning. Not only do the steel cut oats taste better than instant but they also are slower to digest. You don't get the rush of blood sugar followed quickly by a return of your appetite like you do with the instant oatmeal. One caveat, all 4 of the cans I received were bent fairly badly. This was not a big deal to me because I figure one of the advantages of the cans is that it helps protect the product during shipment.
