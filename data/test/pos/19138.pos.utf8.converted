Great coffee, I've been hooked ever since the worlds fair in New Orleans back in the 80's when I sat down at the French Quarter and had a cup of this wonderful brew with a serving of Benyeys ( a sweet dough that is fried ) truly heavenly! Be warned this is no Girlie-man coffee, it is strong, but the secret is to drink it the way they serve it in New Orleans, that is, half a cup of this freshly brewed coffee, and the other half fill with fresh cream ... take a walk on the wild side my friends, this is the real thing, you will not be dissapointed! Enjoy!
