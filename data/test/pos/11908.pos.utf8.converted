I am going to go out and say that Flossies are the BEST dog treat. There is not one treat that could ever compare to this one. My puppy loves them and it is quite cute watching him eat it. The treat is a spiral and he puts his little paw at one end to hold the treat down and eats the whole thing. I used Flossies to train my puppy. They work! The only CON is that they are expensive. The more you buy, the more you save. Trust me, your dog will LOVE this treat!
