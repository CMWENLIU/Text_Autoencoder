I first found these chocolates in a store back in 1983 while visiting Vienna, Austria.  At that time, they were hard to come by in the U.S.  These have got to be the best chocolate candies I've ever tasted.  Especially if you like hazelnut and marzipan!  Buy these and enjoy for yourself and don't forget to treat your friends.  Mmmmmm.
