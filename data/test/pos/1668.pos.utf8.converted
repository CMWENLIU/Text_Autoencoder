After reading about Shirataki noodles I knew I had to try it. Turns out this is just like the noodles I ate in sukiyaki while growing up. Throw these noodles in any stir-fry or soups, really great. I see some people don't like the taste but it really has no taste. It takes on the flavors of whatever is surrounding it. It can be used as a substitute for rice noodle or soba for those of you are into Asian cooking. Great service from this vendor.
