This stuff is great. I'm on a diet that includes superhydration - meaning I drink 5-6 liters of water a day - and anything to make that easier is worth it! Aspartame is a migraine trigger for me so I am always on the lookout for alternative low calorie water flavorings and this truly fits the bill. As for the chemical haters, if you don't want it in your body, don't put it there! I don't believe this is any more dangerous than the preservatives and additives you'd find in a bag of chips. Most things are OK in moderation and if that thing helps you drink more healthy water without a bunch of sugar and caffeine, consider it a blessing. And if you do find out that you have a negative reaction to any of the ingredients, like me to aspartame, just stop using it.<br /><br />Now, on to the review. I've tried this (strawberry watermelon) and the berry pomegranate flavor. This one gets 5 stars on flavor; berry gets 4. Both have a little aftertaste that's kind of sticky sweet and noticeable but not unpleasant. The berry flavor tastes a little grapey to me and it's just a personal preference that I don't like it as much. I bought mine on sale at Target for less than they are listed here, but even for the Amazon price I think they are worth it even if you add more than 1/24th of the bottle to your drink. Consider the powdered drink flavorings that come in single-serve packs and are priced comparably. Less servings, more waste packaging, no customization of flavor intensity. MIO is the clear winner. Five stars on value!<br /><br />My only improvement would be to have less or different dye in the product. I don't care if my drink is hot pink or purple but the first time I used it, I got a couple of drops on my countertop and it left a stain that was a pain in the you-know-what to get out. I'm guessing that it wouldn't come out of clothes, either. Just keep that in mind and be careful.<br /><br />If you're curious about MIO, I would suggest you go to your grocery store, buy one, and try it. If you love it, come here and get a case! It's a neat, novel idea and I hope it sticks around because I'm a big fan.
