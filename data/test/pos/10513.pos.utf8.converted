In my humble opinion these are the best cookies EVER. Although I suppose since half of it is marshmallow, "cookie" is a bit of a misnomer. What they are is a chocolate cake-like cookie topped with a ring of marshmallow and covered in chocolate. Pricey little buggers, but very worth it. If you are either overly attached to the traditional concept of a "cookie" (how boring...) or have a particular aversion to marshmallow (how do you not like marshmallows?????), perhaps Pinwheels are not for you. (Yay, more for the rest of us.) Word of warning: Nabisco only sells the real thing during the winter months when the chocolate won't melt during shipping. During the summer they replace Pinwheels with some nasty confection referred to as Twirls. They look just like Pinwheels but they are coated with brown, waxy, imitation chocolate and are best avoided.
