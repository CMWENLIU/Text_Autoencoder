I ordered the Manuka Honey after a lot of research to find if it actually can help with stomach problems.  After reading a few news articles etc... it seems this stuff can really work, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I've tried all the doctor's ideas, and it was time for my own.<br />I'm a tad disappointed that it is a plastic container, as we try to avoid plastic packaging.  Unlike others stated, our top was closed and everything was all sealed up tight!<br />As stated by a few others, this honey is not for the light hearted! it won't be like the honey you get in the squeezy bottle with the cute picture of a bee on it.  I'd assume if you are purchasing this, you are for the same reasons as most (medical reasons).  So, no, it is not the best tasting honey I've ever had.  In fact, it is hard for me to get down. It is VERY strong, sweet and THICK!  I've bought regular organic, raw honey before and this is WAY stronger! I don't think taste should be a deciding factor if you are buying it for medical reasons.<br />So far, I am noticing a few changes in my stomach problems for the better!  I am very hopeful these will continue to get better as I increase the intake.  This is how I am taking it. I did not find any directions ON the bottle. I hope this is helpful:<br />How is Active Manuka Honey taken for acid reflux, heart burn, up-set stomach stomach ulcer, gastritis, duodenal ulcer, IBS (irritable bowel syndrome)? Active Manuka Honey is especially useful for an upset GI Tract, because a 5% concentration of this honey has shown to destroy helicobacter pylori, the bacteria that causes most stomach ulcers. Active Manuka Honey also seems to destroy a range of bacteria associated with gastroenteritis and diarrhea. Take one teaspoon of Active Manuka Honey and put it on a square inch size bread, or toast, bagel, cracker or a slice of banana, and take it 20 min. before meals to coat out the gastro intestinal tract. Do not drink anything right after Manuka Honey intake, in order to keep the honey as concentrated as possible. You can take a 4th teaspoon before retiring for the day and still brush your teeth after that.
