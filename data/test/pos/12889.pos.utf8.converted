I purchased these as an alternative to tuna for a quick source of protein and source of omega fatty acids. They were delicious and quite sizable compared to the sardines I have purchased from local grocers or convenient stores. They did not taste salty or metallic like some of the other brand I have tired. The biggest selling points for me were the fact that they were wild caught and had a relatively low sodium content. I have added these to my automatic shipments. I would highly recommend these to anyone who likes sardines and cares for the environment.
