This is the best stevia I've tried, it tastes good, with minimal aftertaste, and the liquid dropper is much easier to measure and mix than the powder versions.  Just 4 or 5 drops sweetens a glass of iced tea. Most artificial sweeteners give me a headache (nutrasweet, splenda), but this doesn't.  It's my favorite!
