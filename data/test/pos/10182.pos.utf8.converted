We went to St. Thomas USVI and this was the only brand of english muffin that was sold in grocery stores.  Thinking they would taste just so-so, we were very surprised.  Just delicious and unique tasting.  There wasn't a sour dough taste to them which most expect from english muffins but when toasted and buttered...they melted in your mouth.
