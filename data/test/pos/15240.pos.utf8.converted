I am surprised to see people ordering the UNUSUAL product and expecting to use USUAL ways to prepare it.  Also expecting the USUAL taste, texture, smell, etc.,<br /><br />First - if one just follows directions and rinses WELL, then dries the product (rice, or pasta, I've used both) - the smell is gone and texture is not bad at all.<br /><br />When drying - I don't mean paper towel drying - throw it on the non-stick pan and dry on low heat until most of the moisture is gone.<br /><br />After that - use with either "dessert" type of concoction ( I often use it with Almond Milk and a few drops of stevia, or Coconut Kefir and a few drops of stevia) OR with the "main dish" type of foods like ground turkey and/or stir-fried veggies.<br /><br />It then works as a filler, much like Tofu - tasteless and blends with the food you prepare it with.  And just like Tofu - does not taste good on it's own.<br /><br />Another good thing is that Glucomannan (that what those products are made out of) is good for one's digestion - being a soluble fiber that we all need and don't get enough in our regular diets.  Keeps you regular :-)
