The chai mate has too much caffeine for me, as it is as much as a cup of coffee - although they claim it doesn't give you any jitters, for me it does. I blend this with one of their herbal (non-caffeine) chai's - the roobios is great - using a half-half ratio. The resultant mix is delicious with milk and a bit of honey - and is a great pick-me-up in mid morning. Teavana's teas also always make me feel better - each of their teas has a special "healing" power to it - I am not sure if it is true or not, but I do feel like I'm doing something better for my body by drinking their teas.
