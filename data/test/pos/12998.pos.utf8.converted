I just brewed my first batch and this is by far the best green tea I've tried.  My family will have to live with less this batch because my first sample cup quickly turned into 3 big cups!  Yummmmmmmm.<br /><br />Don't know what some of the other folks here are talking about when they say it smells/tastes bad.  Smells just like some of the better-quality green tea in teabags, but stronger, sweeter and much richer.  Taste is smoother, no bitterness, much fuller, and surprisingly long-lasting.  I'm no tea connoisseur, I just know what I like and this one is awesome.<br /><br />A little research on the web helped.  The general consensus seems to be that 160-180 degree water is the best, brewed about 2 minutes.  I don't have a thermometer or anything fancy so I brought the water just to boiling and waited 5 minutes before using.  Brewed 2 minutes then poured through a strainer into a pitcher.<br /><br />If you're willing to go through a bit of extra trouble, you can use the same leaves up to 3 times.  A little goes a long way.  I used about 2 rounded tablespoons, brewed 3 times, and got more than a full pitcher of nice strong tea.  I like my tea strong, and it looks like 2 level tablespoons would still do the job nicely.  Use less for something milder.
