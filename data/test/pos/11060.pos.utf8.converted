I haven't drank milk for over 20 years, but I do enjoy cereal in the morning.  This powder is great because I can only make what I need.  I put the powder and water in a covered container, shake it, put in the frig overnight, then shake again before putting on my cereal. Yes, it does take a lot of shaking to mix it together, but I think the original mixes better than the vanilla.  I've also used this as a milk substitute in bread machines.  This is a subscribe and save item for me.
