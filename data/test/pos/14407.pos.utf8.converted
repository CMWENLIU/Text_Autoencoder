I purchased these as a gift for some nurses who took great care of me.<br />They were overwhelmed by the gift. A great choice. Although, I will say that it took over a week to get to them. Took 2 or 3 days to ship it from wherever it came from and then, of course, UPS just took their sweet time to get it there. I just despise UPS!! USPS Priority is by far the better choice..for less money!
