We tried to substitute a like product because we couldn't find the Mega brand when we ran out.  Big, big, big mistake.  We are literally throwing it away.  We were so disappointed in it (bland, cardboard like, low pop rate).<br /><br />We again found the Mega brand and the clouds parted, angels sang and we all snuggled in for a good movie and the best movie popcorn you can make at home.  We will NEVER try to save a buck again when it comes to popcorn.<br /><br />The taste and freshness are great.  Some in the family find it too salty, so we hold back some of the seasoning mixture.  It even reheats well the next day or two.
