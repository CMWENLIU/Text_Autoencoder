I too am a big licorice fan and these are really great.  I am glad I took the other reviewer's advice and froze it in small bags.  Otherwise, it would have been eaten too quickly as it is highly addictive.  I just ordered another batch because I don't want to be without it when the cravings hit!  If you are a licorice fan, you will not be disappointed.  Definitely a cut above what you can find in stores.
