Over the years, I have tried various brands of unsweetened cocoa powder to use in baking and for mixing in my morning coffee.  Ghirardelli's "Natural Unsweetened Cocoa" has become my number one cocoa of choice. It has a very rich flavor and is finely ground so it mixes readily.<br /><br />I purchase approximately one cannister each month from my local Whole Foods market, where the price has been $4.99 per 10-ounce/283-gram container for some time now.  The price for the very same item on Amazon's website (actually one of their resellers) is currently way too much for the product.  Hopefully Amazon (or their reseller) will price the product more reasonably, as have other grocery retailers.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Ghirardelli's "Natural Unsweetened Cocoa" is an excellent product.
