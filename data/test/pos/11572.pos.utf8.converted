I've used several different brands of liquid smoke for my pressure cooked baby back ribs recipe in my cafe and I find this smoke to be just right.  Not overpowering or bitter.  It adds just the right amount of hickory smoke flavor.  I finish my ribs over a hickory smoke charcoal grill and I have customers lined up to buy my ribs on rib night!
