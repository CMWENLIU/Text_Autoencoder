Okay, this is a different cocoa from anything I've ever had before. The first taste is a bit surprising, so it's better just to think of it as its own thing and not expect it to taste like all the other cocoas you've had.  I loved to use it in cakes (I had to increase the flour a little in mine or drop the sugar because it made the already moist cake just too gooey otherwise).  I use the Cooks Illustrated recipe (6 chocolate cakes, sour cream), and with the special dark, it's a family and neighborhood favorite. I also love that it turns icing nearly black.  I've gotten several commetns about how beautiful the cakes are made with this cocoa.<br /><br />Our favorite use though is in hot cocoa.  I use 2tbsp cocoa powder with 1-2 tbsp sugar and add 8 oz of boiling water.  We love it just to drink, it looks like the darkest cocoa ever, and is more like a coffee drink, grown up hot chocolate...  Our skeptical friends even love it, you should definitely give it a try!!  We used to make the cocoa twice as strong, but found 2tbsp is enough for us because it's a very strong cocoa.<br /><br />Here's the kicker.  It's better for you... in one cup of the cocoa above (with 1bsp sugar) compared to a cup of cocoa with the same recipe and regular "natural" hershey's cocoa powder (note, it includes 2tbs of each and sugar, not the 1 tbsp on box)<br /><br />________________special dark_______________regular<br /><br />calories............95.......................95<br /><br />g fat................1........................1<br /><br />g fiber..............4........................2<br /><br />g protein............2........................2<br /><br />Iron................30%.......................8%<br /><br />with the twice as strong recipe, we were getting 60% of our iron from each cup, which is amazing to me. Because of the fiber, my Mom can have this as a weight watcher's drink too, I think she said it was 1 point.
