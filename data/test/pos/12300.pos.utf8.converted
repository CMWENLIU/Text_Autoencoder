I just ordered this after seeing it in my specialty pet food store.  It's a tad expensive but I can understand why.  I can totally read and understand all the ingredients!  And my picky dogs both LOVE it.  I also like that they tell you the calories per treat (8.8 if you're wondering) so I can better keep track of my dogs daily caloric intake.<br /><br />The fact that it comes in small pouches also is great so you don't open an big pouch and let it go stale.<br /><br />Both my dogs (including my 5lb Maltese) LOVE it!!<br /><br />My only criticism of this product would be how much the label recommends for small dogs.  I would never give my dog 16 treats per day!!!  That's almost half of one of my dog's entire day's needs and almost 2/3 of my smaller Maltese's needs!!!<br /><br />Oh, and a 2nd criticism: although it's called the "pumpkin and blueberries" treat, if you look at the ingredient list, blueberries are second to last on the list...which means very little blueberries.  Slightly misleading in my opinion.  It would be more correct to say "pumpkin and oatmeal" or "pumpkin and molasses" or anything else besides blueberries.<br /><br />But overall, I will be using these instead of baking my own.
