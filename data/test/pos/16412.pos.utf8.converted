Living in the west this product has been very hard to find at times.<br />Now I order it from Amazon and keep over 100 boxes on hand in the basement.<br />We eat it every Sunday along with a salad and home made garlic bread.<br />Its the best. We never get tired of it. It tastes good with or without meat and can also be made with mushrooms added. We have eaten boxes that were over<br />4 years old and it still tasted great. Great item for your emergency food storage.
