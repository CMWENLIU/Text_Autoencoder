I haven't purchased this from Amazon, but I was able to try Sempio Youndoo earlier this year, before it was available here. When I first got it, I really thought the packaging was aesthetically pleasing, and the cap/spout is well-designed (which seems like a stupid thing to note, but I have spilled more than my fair share of soy sauce from badly-designed spouts).<br /><br />I'm not much of a cook, nor do I have a distinguished palate, so this tastes to me like a more complex soy sauce, with a nuanced, savory flavor that makes dishes stand out. I originally thought "liquid seasoning" meant that it was a sauce to be generously used, but it's really concentrated so a little goes a long way. I guess it's meant to be used in place of MSG (which I've never used), but I honestly use it in place of soy sauce.<br /><br />I've recommended it to my friends and family, if they can find it. I don't cook often enough to justify buying a pack of 8 for myself, but I think it'd probably be a worthy investment to share with fellow cooks.<br /><br />As for any declared conflicts of interest: I did win this in a drawing for a sponsored event, but I certainly wasn't paid to write this review or anything.
