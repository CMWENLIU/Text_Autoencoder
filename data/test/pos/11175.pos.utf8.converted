I have a 15 year old American Short Hair who a few years ago spent 3 days at the vet b/c he could not stop vomiting. Every test was run and he was sent home - but still throwing up!  I decided to hit the internet and realized his diet was probably making him sick.  All those years, I thought I was feeding him a healthy diet.  I really think as he aged he could no longer tolerate the grain in his kibble.  I switched him to Wellness Core, and I noticed an immediate improvement in his stomach sensitivity.  Recently, I decided to try Blue Buffalo Grain Free mainly for my convenience (I had to drive across town to find Wellness Core) not really expecting to find something my cat liked better just something comparable.  Wow!  He loves the BB Wilderness!  He doesn't have any stomach sensitivity and he looks leaner and spryer!  I hear him crunching on it right now!  Another plus - it doesn't stink to high heaven like the Wellness Core - the fish smell was enough to knock you over.  I am grateful to have found the Wellness Core and it definitely improved my cat's health, but Blue Buffalo is a great product as well.  If your kitty is vomiting a lot, try changing him to a grain free high quality food.  It made a world of difference in my ol' kitty's life.  Why isn't diet the first thing vets tell you to try?  In hindsight, I feel bad it never occurred to me b/c really why are we feeding our animals food made out of corn?
