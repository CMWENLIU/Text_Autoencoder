Madhava Agave Nectar is a low calorie natural (and kosher) sweetener, that can be used by everyone, not just diabetics. It is made from the Agave cactus plant. Tequila is also made from this plant. You need only 1/4 as much Agave as you would sugar. Its very low glycemic load is something every dieter and type II diabetic can love.<br /><br />What I like about Madhava Agave Nectar is that it is processed naturally, without the use of chemicals. We use it in soups, glazes, and for baking. We found the pricing on Amazon very attractive in comparison with local health food stores.
