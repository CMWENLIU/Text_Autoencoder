First found this brand in a grocery store.  Was suprised to see this large of a bottle for the price for real vanilla.  Bought it and have not used another brand since.  It's very good real pure vanilla flavor.  Very strong as it is only vanilla in alcohol, comparable to a pure Mexican vanilla, with no sugars added.  Glad to see it on Amazon.
