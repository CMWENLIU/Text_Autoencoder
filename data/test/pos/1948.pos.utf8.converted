This tea provides a luscious and refreshing break from your daily grind and helps you relax as well. It's got a great cherry taste to it that is not overpowering with just a hint of berry flavor thrown in for good measure. Let it steep about three minutes and you're bound to enjoy it as much as I do!<br /><br />Each bag contains all-natural ingredients; and there are no artificial ingredients. The stringless tea bags can easily be removed from your cup whenever you want just by using a spoon or anything similar to get them out of the cup. Stir the tea bag around and up and down a bit while it's in your cup before you drink it.<br /><br />The tea is also caffeine free, which is a plus for those of us who don't want caffeine in our diets. That is something I always prefer.<br /><br />If you like a cherry flavored tea with a slight berry twist to it, I highly recommend this tea! Enjoy!
