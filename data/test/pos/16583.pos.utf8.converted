I originally started taking Calm for the magnesium to help with my Chronic Idiopathic Constipation. I put a couple of teaspoons in hot water and drink a mugful before bed every night and I have been very regular ever since. The taste is almost too sweet but that's probably a perk for some people. It tastes like hot lemonade, nothing chalky about it which is nice. It can be drunk cold but I find that 1) it works better when used with hot water and 2) it tastes better in hot water (cold water doesn't dissolve it well enough and you end up swallowing chunks of the magnesium). Within the first day or two of taking the Calm I realized that not only was I regular but I was sleeping much better. After one mugful, I fall asleep within the hour and also the cramping I was getting in my legs at night has diminished. I started taking this for one reason but realized there are a lot of benefits to it. I will warn you, on the directions it says "add 1oz of water, watch it fizz...", and it FIZZES. I made the mistake of filling my cup with water first and then added the Calm and made an enormous mess! It fizzes up at the slightest splash of water and also when you stir so just do it little by little and you'll be fine :)
