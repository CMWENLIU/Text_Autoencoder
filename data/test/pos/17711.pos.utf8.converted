Because of our cat's digestive problems, and due to multiple unsuccessful trials of other "top" brands of canned cat food, led us to try the WELLNESS brands. Our feline-centric veterinarian concurred, and I am happy to report that after 2 weeks, our cat is responding wonderfully!<br /><br />He is a "new" cat! He LOVES THIS FOOD! A great, all-natural product.
