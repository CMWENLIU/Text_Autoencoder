I got this when I unexpectedly broke out with a cold sore on my upper lip and was researching the internet for a good way to treat. By the time i got this my cold sore had cracked between the wet and dry part of my upper lip and was very unpleasant. However with the honey not only did it disinfect, it moisturized, and made the healing process so much faster. Instead of waiting for a week or two to heal, it was healed after 3 days of applying it throughout the day and before sleeping. I am very pleased by this honey and is also considering buying the lip balm they have...although a 10 pack seems quite a lot to buy at once.
