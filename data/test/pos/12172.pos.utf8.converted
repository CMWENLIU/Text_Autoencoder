Previously we purchased another brand of curly chews which Mattie would chew for a short period and then didn't want anything more to do with them.  Recently we purchased the HDP curly chews and Mattie LOVES them and enjoys chewing the same one over a number of days (she is a small dog) until they are completely gone.  As advertised, they do not have the odor the other chews had either.
