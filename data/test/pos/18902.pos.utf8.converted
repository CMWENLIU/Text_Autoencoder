I have a 7 year old Australian Shepherd who thrives on this food. She never has health problems and eats this food with gusto, especially when compared to kibble (wouldn't you?) I typically make enough food for 3 or 4 days and store it in a lock and lock container in the fridge. I've always had an interest in feeding raw (and do occasionally give a turkey or chicken neck) but I also travel a lot and needed something I could bring along easily.<br />She had previously been eating a super premium kibble, but I like the idea of real unprocessed food so much more. The benefits are undeniable.<br />I am shocked to hear that several reviewers are supplementing with rice. This is a grain FREE food, as dogs are not really meant to eat/digest grains. It being grain free is what makes it so costly. The Honest Kitchen makes similar canine diets with grains for what I consider to be significantly less cost. If I wanted my Sojos to go a little farther I'd probably add egg or some raw ground meat.<br />The 8lb bag lasts her around 6 weeks, which is about how long the 28.6lb bag of super premium kibble she was previously eating lasted (and for around the same price).<br />Thanks to Amazon for the always-perfect service. I love being able to order this food with expedited shipping to my door for less than the price of buying it in store.
