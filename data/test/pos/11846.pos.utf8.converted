I think this bread is wonderful. I make it by hand (not in a bread machine), and I don't even have a mixer. I just put the ingredients in a bowl and stir it together until combined and pour it in my bread pan, and it turns out perfectly delicate, moist, and tasty. When I proof the yeast, I have found that it works better if I add a pinch of sugar to the water, and I also give the yeast 10 minutes to foam; 5 minutes didn't seem to be enough. Because of this bread and the whole grain mix, I see the GF diet as much more feasible. It's great bread even compared to gluten breads. And I find the bread sweet enough just as it is. I've found it's best to let the bread cool completely, slice it, and then freeze it, otherwise it will get hard and/or mold more quickly since it's not full of preservatives. It toasts up well.
