I'm so glad that you can finally buy fresh whole rabbits, ready to go, right from Amazon!  You might think that with the shipping charge, that this is a pricey item, but compared to with what I've been paying at Petco, this is a steal, especially when you consider the prep work that this saves me!  If you value your time and your money, you'll order your bunnies online from now on.  Delicious and plump, and none of that irksome pre-butchering hopping!
