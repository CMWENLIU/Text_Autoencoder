Unlike Europe where instant coffee is a huge and diverse marketplace, with Nescafe, Krona, Douwe Egberts, Maxwell House and more having umpteen products available, here in the USA there is very little choice. I'm not going to get into the instant vs. real coffee debate here, and this is an instant, so don't expect a Starbucks red eye latte. For convenience and taste however, there is no comparison to Mount Hagen (which is made in Germany incidentally) - Nescafe Gourmet series probably comes in a close second, but flavor and aroma wise this is head and shoulders above Folgers and Community brands of instant coffee, or any others for that matter. More and more people are drinking less and less coffee (we're all trying to be healthy remember?) so if you don't want to have the coffee pot on the hot plate all day, and can't afford a one cup at a time Keurig, give this a try. My only complaint is it's a little pricey, but until we have some others available in the USA to compete, I'll pay it. 5 Stars.
