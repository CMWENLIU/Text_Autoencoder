I have a hard time finding good Kimchi. Taking time out of my busy day to find Asian Groceries that carry it and find out if their product is decent is a hassle. I discovered Mama Eun's kimchi on Amazon. com and love it. It's not cheap but it's excellent Kimchi. They ship it FEDEX next day on cold packs so it gets to your door safe and sound and refrigerated. Someone from the company called right after I received the delivery to make sure it had arrived safe and was still cold! I'm going to try their Bulgogi next! If you don't mind paying for it, their product is excellent.
