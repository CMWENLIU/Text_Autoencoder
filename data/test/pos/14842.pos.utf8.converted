I am a BIG fan of Numi and have been searching for an affordable and tasteful (pun intended) holiday gift for my neighbors, friends, gardener, stylist - you name it...and, I have finally found it!  I ordered one of Numi's Tea Portfolio for myself to see if it lived up to it's description on Amazon.com.  As usual, Numi has delievered a beautiful package and the teas are a nice selection to choose from.  I like that the box can be reused to store more tea or it may even make a good crafts storage box for buttons, beads, etc.  I will be ordering plenty more for the Holidays!  Thank you Numi and Amazon.com for making my holiday shopping a breeze this season!
