Okay, I just discovered Da Vinci syrups last month, and I like them a lot. I love this cherry one. For low-carbers, this can go in so much: yogurt, seltzer water for diet cherry soda, in Coke Zero to make it cherry coke zero on a whim,and my current fave way--over grated ice to make a sno-cone. I love cherry sno-cones, and here's a way to have it without sugar and calories.<br /><br />I use the Egg Nog flavor in almond milk or milk and it's a nice holiday-flavor. And the Toffee one in WonderSlim toffee pudding to enhance the flavor. The coconut one I use in hot cocoa to amake it German Chocolate cocoa, and it's also nice for sno-cones (though the cherry is better).<br /><br />I get mine at Netrition (where I've shopped low-carb items for years). It's a couple bucks cheaper in price and the shipping is much more reasonable (at less than five bucks per order).<br /><br />I'd recommend the product for dieters, especially low-carbers, but not this seller's pricing/shipping. No way.<br /><br />Enjoy...
