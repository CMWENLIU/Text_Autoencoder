This is one of those gifts you send to yourself!  And, maybe, of course, EVERYONE else you know!  They really are that good. They use clear sanding sugar on the sugar cookies and boy, well, there just aren't enough cows in the world to get all the milk you need to dunk those things!  Think I'll have to order another tin!  The best part, however, is that they seem to last forever, even though it seems like you've been eating them forever, they take forever to disappear.  A good thing too because you never tire of their melt-in-your-mouth taste.  Been buying them for years.  Highly recommend!
