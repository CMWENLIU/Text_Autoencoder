I have to agree with the other reviewers.  These walnuts, besides being organic, are fresh, largely whole, and contained no shell chips in any of our first three bags (although I know this happens), suggesting to me that care has gone into the preparation and packaging of this product, beyond the grower's skill in the field.  Why not support an American grower who cares and at the same time do something good for yourself?  We are now regular customers.
