Warning, they DO NOT taste like hot dogs. They are merely shaped like hot dogs. I grew up with these and hear they are a bit of an acquired taste. (One of my friends didn't like them at first but I stubbornly kept feeding them to her. Finally she admitted, "They grow on you...like mold." And now she wants Big Franks whenever we see each other.) Wonderful cut up, fried, and added to omelets, diced potatoes, or macaroni. Shred them, mix with mayo, and have a tuna sandwich substitute. Or just eat them like hot dogs.<br /><br />I just about had a happygasm when I found Loma Linda products on Amazon. I live overseas with the military and, as you can guess, it's difficult to find my childhood foods here.
