My girlfriend has been eating Special K and I decided to start the Special K diet too.  We recently both tried the Fruit & Yogurt variation and it's definately my favorite of the variations.  On a side note - I seem to be pooping less and feeling less full.  Which is great. I spend way too much time in there reading books anyways. Im happy, my girlfriend is happy and everything is fine and dandy. Life is great but Special K is better.
