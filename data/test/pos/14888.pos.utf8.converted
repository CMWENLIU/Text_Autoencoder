the picture shows a 2 pack which I am used to getting at the local pet store for 9.99<br />or 5 dollars a piece!  My last order I ordered 2 packages and got 2 packages with one each in the package, not 2! in one package with the anticipation of the second package.<br />I will await my last order still hoping i get 6 packages of 2...not one.  After this<br />experience I will search elsewhere.  It was way to expensive to spend @11 on one! and not two.  Order carefully, the photo is deceiving
