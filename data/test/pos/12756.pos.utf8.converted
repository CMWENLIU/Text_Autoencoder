...and I did.  My cat was diagnosed with asthma and it was then that it became necessary to pill him daily.  He was feral his first year of life so pilling has always been impossible, especially since I have no one to help me with the whole process.  Thanks to pill pockets, I have kept him alive and his asthma under control by myself, without adding to his condition due to stress (a common asthma trigger) from forced pilling.  I've heard that some cats don't go for these treats, but my two boys gobble them up, pill and all.  I'm not sure what I would have tried next if these hadn't worked.  If you've had trouble pilling and you've run out of ideas, they are definitely worth a shot.  Of course, if your cat is super smart and knows how to spit out pills, the treats, in and of themselves, are still great snacks!
