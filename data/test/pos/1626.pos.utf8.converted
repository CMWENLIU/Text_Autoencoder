Ok so the first few times I tried this product I had mixed feelings. After a few additional tries I figured out the best way to make the crust. First instead of the 2 tablespoons of oil you will use about 1/4 cup. Don't add it all at once. Instead use your fork to mix the crust and after it is ready to knead you will slowly add the oil till you get a gum like texture. Whatever you are using to cook it on (I use a pizza stone) oil it. When you put the dough on the spread (I do mine by hand) fold it over itself a few times to start it. Then you will move it to the edges. You will have extra dough a the edges but make sure that you get the inner areas as thin as possible. If you do not this will result in the dough not cooking all the way through. You can either remove some of the extra dough around the edges or leave it (I leave mine and I love it). If you leave it, it will rise and it will look like a 14 inch soup bowl or a giant hat. You can season the edges before you cook it for dipping in butter or save the crust for crutons. Im not gonna lie, it took me a few times to figure this out but this is the best result that I have gotten from it and it is GREAT.
