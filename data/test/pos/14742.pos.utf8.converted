Ever since my curiosity was piqued at the tender age of two, when I, while pretending to nap, witnessed my (very pregnant) mother wolfing down milk chocolate Hershey Bars, I have been obsessed with chocolate. By the time I started school, I knew that every single member of my family --- siblings, parents, grandparents, and cousins --- was afflicted with chocoholicism. As an adult, I realized that this trait must be genetically dominant, since all of my children, and each of my nieces and nephews, has no willpower when confronted by the presence of "C". Thank heavens that modern medicine has made us aware that this is not a disease, but merely an ultra-healthy yearning to keep antioxidants flowing into our bodies at a rate adequate to maintain our physical well-being, psychological balance, and generally off-beat sense of humor!<br /><br />Since I am the premier baker of this extended family (Look, I see no reason to affect false modesty here! Each of my closest relatives will readily admit to having been born with serious kitchen-utensil-and-cookbook-direction-reading impairment.), my kitchen must be stocked at all times with multiple cans of Ghiradelli unsweetened cocoa and several bags of Ghiradelli chocolate chips, both semi-sweet and double-chocolate. These items provide the essence of my chocolate cakes; frostings, fillings, ganaches, glazes, and fudge; brownies; cookies; puddings; and Mexican "mole" sauces. No other brand of chocolate, at any price, comes close to the taste and finish of Ghiradelli.<br /><br />Hint: for cakes, brownies, and buttercreams, instead of just baking chocolate or just cocoa, try using equivalent parts cocoa (dissolved in hot coffee, milk, or cream) and melted double-chocolate chips. I consider 1/4 cup packed and then sifted cocoa to provide taste equivalent to about 2/3 cup double-chocolate chips.<br /><br />ENJOY! ------  Beth Baker
