This stuff is amazing. It's tart, like the label says, but very sweet! This bottle makes 6 Quarts. It can be a little thin if you follow the 2Tbsp per 6-8oz of water, so I just mix it will 4oz instead. Or I put it in OJ or carrot juice. It is totally fine to just down the Tbsp like cough syrup, but that packs a very cherry punch! Highly recommended for folks fighting gout/arthritis!
