I have tried different brands of grits and find this one to be the very best. Even though they are quick cooking grits, you can cook them as long as you need to. Their flavor is also better. I would buy again. My favorite recipe is: Creamy Grits-2tbs salted butter or 2tbs unsalted butter +1/4 tsp salt. 2 cups water,1/2 c stone ground grits. 1-2 c milk, half n half or stock.Drop the butter into water,bring to boil.Stir in grits, return to boil & reduce heat. cook 10 min. or until thick,stirring to prevent sticking.Add about 1/2 cup milk or cream, simmer 10 min. As the liquid evaporates add more milk until its the consistency you want. Can cook up to an hour. Wonderful. recipe from hoppin' John's low country cooking.
