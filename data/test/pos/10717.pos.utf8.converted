I purchased these bags at my local grocers and I love them.  After doing some research on earth friendly/biodegradable bags, these bags makes the cut.  (Here is the link for the product site which give you the facts on these bags:  [...])  I purchased the regular bags and the bags are a nice size.  I am sure you could even pick up a large dogs feces in these bags.  They come in a recyclable box and the bags are lumped together with a perforated top.  I read another person's review and they had mentioned that these bags are difficult to open, but it is not true.  You separate the bag from the perforated top and they are opened.  Also, I love how there are holes on the top of the bag, so instead of tying a knot, you just stick one side through the hole and seal it that way.  Pretty neat, in my opinion.  Overall, these are great bags and they are great for the environment.  The only thing I wish is that Amazon would offer the Subscribe & Save feature for this product.
