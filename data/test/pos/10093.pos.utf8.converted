The pita chips themselves are very, very good - flavorful, but lightly salted with sea salt and crunchy.  Almost addictive.<br /><br />However, when I received my packages, they were mostly croutons.  Very, very, poorly packed and were smashed in transit.  There was no packing in the box with the chip, therefore, they just sloshed around until they were small pieces of chips.<br /><br />I would hope that next time someone orders them you'd pack them better.<br /><br />I know that I won't get an answer to this as no one there really cares as long as you get your money, and that this review is just a formality.  I did contact Stacy's about the issue and got a lot of nonsense about being fragile, hard to ship (they get shipped to stores without a problem), blah, blah, blah, ad nauseam.<br /><br />Someone, somewhere, needs to do a quality check on packing.
