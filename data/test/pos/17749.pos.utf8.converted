A friend of mine prepared this oatmeal in chicken broth instead of plain water saying you could then eat it plain w/o milk or sugar. I was skeptical, but it was incredibly delicious!!! It reminded me of coucous and I thought if I added some spices and pine nuts it could easily become a dinner side dish. Crazy, I know, but try it and you'll be amazed. Also, a local health food store sells this for $10/can, so this is a great deal.
