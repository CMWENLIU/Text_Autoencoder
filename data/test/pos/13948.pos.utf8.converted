I like a dark roast and a good strong cup of coffee.  Big Easy Bold delivers.<br /><br />After finding so many of the K-cup varieties to be too weak, I went the My K-cup route for a while.  Part of the joy of owning a Keurig, though, is not having to deal with the mess and clean-up of loose coffee grounds.<br /><br />Diedrich's French Roast and Newman's Own are also excellent, but this one is just one tick darker that makes all the difference for me.
