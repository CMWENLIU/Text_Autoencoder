As with any of the K-Cups, if you want it 'strong' always select the smallest cup size (5 oz I believe) if you have that option on your machine. A really decent cup of coffee, that most people wouldn't expect from a single cup machine. I love these for work, they hold up to half and half well. None of these compare to a good strong americano or cafe creme on the ol' espresso machine at home, but at work... I never buy coffee anymore. (Not sure how it is with sugar - never drink coffee/espresso with flavors or sugars, just cream.)
