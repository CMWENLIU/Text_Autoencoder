I only recently tried papadums aka papads! Except I paid $3.49 a box in Atlantic Canada for only 10 in box! Buying Lijjat is not only inexpensive (I'm paying more like 60 cents for 10) but convenient online, and it supports a great cause. I need to watch my carbs as a diabetic and this is the greatest way to do it. Only 15 carbs for 3 of them. You can pop them in the micro with or without oil on them, you can fry them in oil if you want. They are lentil flour, a protein. They can be used as a light crisp chip. I have used them with tuna fish, made a mini pizza with them by microwaving three of them, then put on topping, cheese and scant sauce and put back in micro for 25 sec or less. I also scooped up my scambled eggs with them. I like the spice of the garlic and green chile. They are very light but can be used with a dip if you spoon it on. Unreal how good these things are! I'm shocked Atkins or South Beach hasn't been promoting these as low carbs, protein healthy choices!! They are truly a find... and a VERY healthy carb.
