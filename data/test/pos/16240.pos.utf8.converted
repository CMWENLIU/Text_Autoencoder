In one overnight application, this product saved my car's interior.<br /><br />Almost a year ago, my car lease ended and I bought a new car. The old car was a luxury sedan with full leather seats. The new car is a compact hatchback with cloth seats. (I can't afford luxury anymore.) Both cars had a carpeted trunk.<br /><br />Whether because of the difference in the cars' interior materials and/or because of a change in my use patterns, a few months ago the new car's interior developed an unpleasant, sharp chemical odor. I could not remember the old car ever having this problem. It got so bad that my girlfriend commented that the odor was affecting some of my outwear. Though I think that certain materials were more affected than others, the problem was undeniable.<br /><br />I looked for a livable solution: something inexpensive, Earth-friendly, and easy to use. Baking soda is the classic natural odor remover, so yesterday I checked the supermarket and found that "Fridge-N-Freezer" seemed to be my best bet. On sale at 99 cents a box, I gave it a try.<br /><br />Last evening, I activated two 16 oz. boxes of "Fridge-N-Freezer" (peeled off the perforated sections on their outer cardboard case, front and back, to reveal the inner spill-proof, breathable cloth panels.) Then I placed one box in my car's trunk and one in its cabin. I closed the car's windows, doors and trunk, then waited.<br /><br />This afternoon, I checked the car's interior. The air in there was sweet and clear. There was no trace of the chemical odor. Amazing.<br /><br />Anyone would have noticed the chemical odor in my car. But I am very sensitive to scents (I collect perfume; I like coffee, wine and distillates for their aromas; etc.), so the problem was making me nuts.<br /><br />At two dollars a month, and since it is so easy to use and is ecological, Arm & Hammer "Fridge-N-Freezer" is a perfect solution for me. I give it my highest recommendation.
