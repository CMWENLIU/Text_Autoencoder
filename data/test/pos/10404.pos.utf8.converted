My wife and I both love white rice. But as we enter middle age and seek a healthier and more nutritious diet, we are aware of the pitfalls of processed/refined carbohydrates and their effects on blood sugar levels and post-meal hunger pangs. We've tried several brands of brown rice, but never found one that was a satisfying replacement for our white rice and potato cravings.<br /><br />I stumbled upon Bob's Red Mill Grain Countrywild rice at Amazon.com and decided to give it a try. The results exceeded our expectations. It's much more flavorful than brown rice, with a nice nutty body and texture from the mixed brown and wild rices. Although it takes a bit longer to cook than white rice (55 vs 35 minutes), the wait is worth it, and the almost "popcorn" smell emanating from the kitchen whets the appetite.
