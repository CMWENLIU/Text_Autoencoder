It's worth a visit to their web site to see all of the recipes available for this baking mix but there's plenty right on the bag.  It's extremely versatile and I've been able to recreate GF equivalents of old family favorites like buttermilk biscuits.<br /><br />The size of the bag is convenient and if you sign up for subscribe and save, you can't beat the price (although it's a good price before the discount).  The fruit muffins are so good, my office asks me to make them for special occasions and I'm the only Celiac!
