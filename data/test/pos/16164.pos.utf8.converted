Cheerios are the first breakfast cereal I can remember eating.  Other than Grapenuts, it is the only one I still eat.  As my memory of these go back to just after the war (WWII) that is a lot of Cheerios over the years.  This is one of the few products that I know of that they have not messed around with and as far as I can tell, they taste the same to day as they did when I had my first bowl.<br /><br />These things are cholesterol free with no saturated fats.  There are no added colorings or flavor.  They are just about perfect as such things go.  In addition to being a breakfast staple, they are also almost always my "going to bed snack"...a habit I have had for years.<br /><br />These are also one of my favorite munching foods.  When reading I normally have a box next to my reading chair which to be honest, beats the heck out of pork rinds, potato chips or Moon Pies. The dogs seem to enjoy them as much as I do.  I also do a lot of traveling via automobile and I always have a box or two of these with me to eat right out of the box.  They tend to keep me from turning into every fast food place I encounter and they are great for keeping you awake during long trips, in particular at night.<br /><br />These are a wonderful and traditional cereal and I do hope they stay around for a long, long time.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks
