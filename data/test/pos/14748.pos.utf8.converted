Amazing.  I used to make my own pasta sauce from fresh tomatoes constantly, and I hate to admit to being lazy, but this stuff is so good that it makes it unnecessary to go to the trouble.  The company is also very nice.  They have several other incredible flavors, but Amazon is unfortunately unreliable about offering them consistently.  I probably order about four boxes of their sauces per month, including this flavor.  They are quite good for use as sauce bases, even though they are very tasty on their own - "eat right of the jar" tasty.  If you start eating out of the jar, be careful because you may not be able to stop yourself.<br /><br />The little jars the sauces come packed in are very useful for storage - I bring my lunch to work in them, as they are exactly the right size for a healthy meal.<br /><br />Warning - some people have reported receiving broken jars when ordering these and having them shipped via ground.  I have Amazon Prime, so they come two-day, and the box is always in flawless condition.
