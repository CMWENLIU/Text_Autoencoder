I live up in the Great Northwest,and it gets cold, damp and dark here.  There is nothing finer than coming home, and putting up a spot of Tazo Chai to take away the chills, give comfort and relax  at the end of the day.<br />  It is also good for curling up near the fire and reading a good book, or while watching the whales, on a cold windy March day.  Actually any old time is a good time to stop, relax and enjoy a good cup of chai, with Tazo!
