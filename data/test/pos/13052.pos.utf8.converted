Strawberries never tasted so good! I've never eaten fresh strawberries before because FRESH ones were always hard to find! These freeze dried berries seem to have come from flawless berries because they - just - taste - so - darn - good. They almost look fake because they're so perfect, they're BIG, have a deep red color and emit a delightfully strong strawberry aroma. I couldn't stop digging into the tub and eating hand-fulls of them. If you love Strawberry N Cream flavored instant Oatmeal then you should definitely try making your own with these strawberries and steel cut oats! (I haven't found the perfect cream, any suggestions?) Also, it is VERY important that you use an airtight or vacuum sealable storage container for these, just after about five days the berries will begin to become soft and lose their crunch and some flavor.
