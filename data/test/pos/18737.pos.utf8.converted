I used these to cook Roland snails<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HQRKYQ">Roland Giant Snails (12 Count), 7.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a><br />These shells were large enough to perform the task at hand for those snails which I thought were large. If they were much larger it might have not produced a good enough seal around the snail to keep the butter in. I call them "just right"
