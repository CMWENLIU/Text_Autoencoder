I tried this cereal with coconut milk and it taste wonderful. It adds just enough sweetness without ruining the whole idea of being healthy. If you add strawberries, a banana or some blueberries it makes it even greater.  You'll get a protein serving along with a fruit serving!  Definitely worth the nearly $5/box.  Its expensive to be healthy....Pay the farmer or pay the doctor....
