Purchased these during a fantastic Grocery Deals promotion. I am in my car a lot for work and find that I don't eat properly.  One of my NY Resolutions was to at least find healthier ways of eating poorly :) .  The best thing about this mix is NO RAISINS. I am one of those people that dislike raisins and it has always been an issue with trail mix.  The mix is a perfect balance of nuts, granola, and dried fruit.  The dried fruit doesn't have that overly sweet taste and the granola chunks are nice.<br />These will be something that I will throw in the saddlebags on long motorcycle trips as well.
