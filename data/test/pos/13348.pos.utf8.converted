I am trying to kick my caffeine habit and cut calories at the same time. I stumbled on the Roastaroma tea and I am now absolutely convinced that this is my solution. The flavor is sweet and mild, yet close enough to actual coffee that it stands in nicely for the java I know and love. This is an excellent product and I highly recommend it!
