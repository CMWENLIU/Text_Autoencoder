I own a small wine shop on the North Fork of Long Island and I pair this dark chocolate with wine for in shop tastings.  It pairs well with deep ruby reds like Cabernet Sauvignon and with Syrahs, Pinots and Zins.  My customers love to take a bit and then a sip.  They also know that the dark chocolate has healthful properties.  The chocolate is smooth and full of flavor.  I enjoy it it at home as well.
