I buy this product often but as a single option at 10oz for $12.99 this is totally overpriced. If they bundle into a package and get this down to roughly $5.99/can then it rivals the Ghiradelli shop online site. We use this to make homemade mocha coffees with our Cuisinart burr grinder. That combo plus a few syrups has saved us a fortune - but avoid this overpriced option from Amazon.
