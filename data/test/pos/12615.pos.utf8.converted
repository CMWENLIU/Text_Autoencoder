Dentyne Ice Peppermint chewing gum has saved the day for me many, many times. I always keep a pack in the glove compartment of my car. I also carry the gum in my pocket so I can pop a piece in my mouth to freshen my breath just before social occasions--and even just before a dental visit!<br /><br />The gum is sweetened with sorbitol and aspartame instead of sugar; the absence of sugar is better for your teeth. The sorbitol and aspartame substitutes for sugar may make this a good chewing gum for diabetics; but please double check that with your doctor if you have any concerns about that. A piece of gum has a "whopping" five calories so it won't interfere with any diet; and it has no sodium. It is very low in carbohydrates. It even comes with a freshness expiration date stamped onto the reverse of the package! Great! It does contain phenylalanine; if that is a concern for you then I would not recommend this product. It does not appear to be kosher, either, just in case that is important to you.<br /><br />In addition, the 12 piece of gum pack is very slender; and this makes it very easy to carry it with you in a pocket or a ladies pocketbook.<br /><br />Overall, I can't tell you how many times this gum has served as a really great breath freshener--I can't count that high! It also makes for a tasty, pleasant chewing gum. Thank you, Dentyne, for making this wonderful chewing gum! I am one loyal customer!  SMILES<br /><br />Enjoy!
