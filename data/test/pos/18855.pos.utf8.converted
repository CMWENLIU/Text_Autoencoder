The other reviewer is right--this tea is wonderful. I tried cheaper brands of ginger lemon tea and they were kind of awful after tasting Numi's version. Very mild, very nice, and decaf so I can drink it all day. I really love the Numi teas. My favorite is Gunpowder Green Tea. Their teas never upset my stomach and no matter how long I leave the bag in I think the tea still tastes wonderful (I do like mine a little strong without sugar, though.) I just wish I could find the Ginger Sun in more places.
