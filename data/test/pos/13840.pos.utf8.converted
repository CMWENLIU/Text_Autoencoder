Great cereal, Honey Bunches of Oats is a household favorite and the Almonds one definitely adds that flavor. Good amount of almonds mixed in and the same great taste.<br /><br />Packaging was pretty good, with all 4 boxes wrapped together in plastic. Easily breakable plastic so that you can get each box out individually, but still maintains grip on the remaining boxes.
