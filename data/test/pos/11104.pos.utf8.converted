I recently purchased Cafix at my local natural food store and I love it.  I must say that I was a little hesitant about buying a whole can without having tried it (or even heard of at the time).  This is the only coffee-substitute that I've tried, but I'll probably stick with it.  When I first tried it, I think my tongue was expecting coffee and my body was expecting caffeine, so the taste was different and unexpected... but in a good way.  It's a great hot drink (especially post-dinner) and I don't think it's an acquired taste as long as you don't expect coffee and just treat it as its own category of drink.  My conclusion:  whether you're trying to kick the caffeine habit or just trying to find a healthy-natural alternative, give it a shot.<br />  I'm not much of a milk or sugar person, so I usually enjoy it with vanilla almond drink as a creamer or following the latte direction on the can.  The manufacturer's web site also has an iced Cafix recipe that I've yet to try.
