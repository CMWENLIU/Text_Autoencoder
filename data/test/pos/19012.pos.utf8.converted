I initially bought this for my dog.  She has sensitive, dry skin, and will get rashes on her legs.  I just rub this in and wah-lah!  No more itchy skin.  Not to mention, unlike so many other products, it is completely fine if she decides to go to lick-town on it.  It also smells amazing, so it isn't a big deal if she gets it on something.  I also have dry skin, so I will rub it on my elbows and massage it into my scalp.  After that, you can put it in recipes in place of butter in order to replace some bad fat with good fat.  I am all for a product that is multipurpose and very ecofriendly.  Anytime you can go natural, you definitely should.  Maybe it's just the glue-eating kid in me, but I think it's pretty awesome that I can eat my conditioner/lotion.
