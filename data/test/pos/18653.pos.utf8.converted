Belly loves her Texas Toothpicks! It is the one treat she never ever gets tired of. I owe it to these cow tails for keeping her teeth pearly white; the inside of the cow-tail is sort of a spongy texture and helps clean her teeth while she chews. The smell is mild and is not something I notice while she is chewing like I do with other treats. They are not oily or greasy in any way and do not soil anything if she decides she wants to chew her treat on the carpet. They are hard to find locally but I have had great luck getting them (very quickly) from this vendor.
