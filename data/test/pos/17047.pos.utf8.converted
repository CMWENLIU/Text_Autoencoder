I recently started using methi seeds after doing Web research. I cook with the seeds, make tea with the product, and use methi paste on my hair and skin. My hair is very tightly curled, but using methi paste on my hair once or twice a week makes my hair look as if it's been flat ironed (and I never use heat on my hair). If there is a concern about the smell, I simply use strongly fragranced shampoos and conditioners such as Pantene or Suave to neutralize the smell. For me this product works better than any straightening serum I've tried, and I don't anticipate returning to chemical straighteners. Thanks, Mother Nature, for methi!
