I've been addicted to this hot and spicy mustard for about five years now.  It's great for sandwiches, or in a dish when serving ham or other cold meats that need a good hot mustard.  Neither the heat, nor the sweetness are overplayed for a novelty factor, Beaver Sweet Hot has a balanced flavour that won't dominate your sandwich.
