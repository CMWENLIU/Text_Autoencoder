I can't tell you that I've tried all of Chef Paul's Magic Seasonings, however, I have used the blackened seasoning and I can tell you firsthand that everyone who has tried my blackened fish say they love it and want to know what my secret is. The first time I tried it was after a fishing trip in the Gulf of Mexico. I caught so much snapper that when I got back I started running out of ways to cook it. I was in my local grocery store one day looking at spices for something else when Chef Paul's blackened seasoning caught my eye. I figured I'd give it a shot and man am I glad I did. I've cooked a lot of fish in my days and nothing has ever come out tasting better than my blackened fish.
