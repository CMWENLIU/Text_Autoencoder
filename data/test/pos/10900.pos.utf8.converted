Do you know that feeling you get when something makes you really, really happy, so happy you can't stop smiling? I get this happiness overload when I smell honeysuckle, run through the grass barefoot or eat juicy peaches or chill crunchy apples - and while drinking Davidson's Herbal Christmas tea. The smell of this tea is lovely, but it does have a slightly overpowering cinnamon smell. When brewed, the mint in the tea balances out the cinnamon to create a hot/icy sensation in one's mouth. I brewed 1.5 tsp in a little over a cup of not-quite boiling water, and the flavor is beautifully subtle, not overpowering. This tea is surprisingly sweet, perfect by itself. I'm used to buying tea of this quality for about $12 for 2 oz, not 1lb. The double-layer bag was bigger than I expected, with a ziplock like closure at the top to keep the tea fresh. Over all, I think this was one of the best purchases I've ever made.
