I just received my 12 pack of Acai Pomegranate Vita Coco Coconut Water from Amazon.<br /><br />Wow!! I love the new twist off cap!! I have been waiting for Vita Coco to come out with a more user friendly packaging (to work out with). Now I can go to yoga and open and close my drink, that way I can have some throughout my practice. Unlike water, Vita Coco keeps me hydrated and gives me the potassium and electrolytes I need while working out. The incorporation of acai with coconut water is delicious! The combination of nutrients, amino acids, antioxidants, vitamins and other properties make acai one of the wonders of the natural food kingdom!<br /><br />Now the yoga studios I go to, even carry Vita Coco (for the times I do not have one on hand!) I will definitely spread the word of this amazing hydration drink!
