These are the yummiest flour tortillas I have ever tasted. They taste like they are freshly made at your favorite Mexican restaurant. However the price listed here is ridiculous. After shipping you are looking at $23. Are they worth it? Yes, if you have money to burn and you want fresh tasting tortillas without having to make them yourself. However, I picked these same guys up at Costco for $6.99 or so a package. I bought two packages and stuck one in the freezer. Unless you are desperate skip these guys and find a warehouse store that carries them.
