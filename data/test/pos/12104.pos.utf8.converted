I received this for Father's Day last year.  I was skeptical - but it actually works.  I can put some tri-tip in the smoker and hang in the pool or chat with guests while keeping an eye on the large LCD display. The range is very good, I can sit in the pool with the display next to me on the deck (at least 20-30 feet away) or go back inside the house. It beeps and talks to you a few minutes before your food is at the desired temperature.  I use it primarily for beef, and the settings (rare, medium, etc.) are pretty accurate. This is especially good for large cuts of beef since it is often difficult to gauge whether the meat is pink inside or not.  I would highly recommend this.  Easy to set-up, then all you do is select the type of meat and the desired cooking level.  Pork and seafood default to only one setting choice (well-done) but you can just use the temperature readout to cook to the desired temp.
