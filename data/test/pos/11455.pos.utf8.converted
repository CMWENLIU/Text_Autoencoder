This past Christmas, I was determined not to set foot in a retail store. When I decided to purchase a bamboo plant for my boyfriend, I thought for sure I was going to have to venture to the dreaded mall. But Amazon came through and contected me with this seller! I was a bit skeptical about how one could possibly safely ship a plant, but it arrived from California in two days. It was packaged perfectly and the plant was in great shape. Two months later, it's going strong.
