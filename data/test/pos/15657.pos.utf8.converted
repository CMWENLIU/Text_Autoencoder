I love my keurig coffee maker, don't get me wrong, but I don't love adding all those little plastic cups to the land fill. The Solofill allows me to end the conflict between convenience and my concern for the environment.  I can use any coffee I like, or as I frequently do, I can use a pod.  One of the things about the Keurig I love is the ability to choose daily between varieties of coffee.  Buying a pound of one kind of coffee is boring to me. So I buy locally 1/4 bags and store them in a vented airproof (airscape) container. And I buy pods (frequently on sale so the price is the same as ground beans per cup) and dump the grounds into the Solofill. I use 10 gram pods, more is too much, less is not enough. With pods, the coffee remains fresh because it's nitrogen packed. I don't have to drink all the same kind at once to use it up =)  So i balance between my locally purchased fresh ground and the pods. The Solofill brews a much better cup than the K cups provide. Much richer mouth feel, and slightly stronger than an extra bold k cup.<br />I drink mostly dark roasts (k cups: dark magic, double black diamond) and I'm very satisfied with the cups from a Solofill with 10 grams ground coffee, either from a pod or fresh.  The device self-tamps when you close it so the water flows evenly throughout the grounds. No dry spots. I pop the Keurig open after I brew and come back to dump the grounds after I drink; that gives the solofill time to cool off.  The only caveat is to make sure you flick off any grounds on the rim before you close the solofill so it makes a solid seal. I bought two so I can always have one ready to go......
