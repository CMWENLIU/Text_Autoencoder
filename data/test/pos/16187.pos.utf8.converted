Flaxseed is healthy, good tasting and a good substitute for butter or margarine in a recipe. I use it in cereal, smoothies, a glass of water, veggie dishes and any recipe I wish to 'edit-out' butter, magarine or oil. (Use 3 parts flaxseed to 1 part 'other'). As far as Bob's Mills? I order other products, which arrive intact and are of gr8 quality (buckwheat flour, apple spice muffin mix, 10 grain hot cereal mix and herbs'n'spices. They also make an awesome bag clip to keep their product fresh (I cheat and use it on non-Bob's products!). I should have ordered at least 5 more bag clips. Oh well, I'm sure there will be a next time! Happy Harping!
