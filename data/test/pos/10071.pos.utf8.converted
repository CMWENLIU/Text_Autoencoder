My family has been on a low sugar lifestyle for 20 years.  Finding foods, especially treats that are low sugar is a challenge.  This product, may I say, is a little bit of Heaven in a box.  Real Brownie taste, moist, and for anyone who has a brownie habit.  What I like also, is that if you bake the brownies longer, you have more of a cake-brownie.  Wonderful product and I give it a 5+.
