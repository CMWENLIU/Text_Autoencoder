I am admittedly a big fan of Barry Farm products.  They make just about any food, veggie, dairy product, or spice in either a freeze dried or powdered form.  As an outdoor enthusiast that enjoys carrying along a little taste of home into the savage wilderness, this is a company that I am well familiar with.  Not everything they make is delicious, or worth it. My experience with them however is that most of their products are just about the finest, and many times the only ones around.  This cheddar cheese powder is definitely one of their best.  Many reviewers here mention making macaroni and cheese, and popcorn with it.  Although I have used it for those purposes like everyone else, I have also used this powder as an addition to many soups that call for cheese, or grated cheese. (It makes a very flavorful substitute for grated cheese in many recipes.) Hamburger and sausage soups are a good example.  Many times I have concocted delicious one pot meals using this powder while out in the wilds on a hike, or camping. They are remembered as some of the best meals I have ever had. It is also very good when sprinkled on home made pizza, and I have an excellent recipe that includes this powder, butter, flour, and salt, that makes a delicious cheese spread for crackers and super bowl parties. Barry Farms cheddar powder is strong and flavorful, and a little goes a long ways.  A one pound bag will get you through many a recipe and outdoor adventure.  However since the shipping on this is a little high, (and the powder so reasonable) I suggest buying two pounds or more at once and storing it in a good air tight container.  You will save a lot on the shipping, and this powder will last for months if stored correctly.  I highly recommend this cheddar powder for those that enjoy the simple pleasures of popcorn and mac and cheese, as well as the more adventurous among us in the kitchen, and over an open fire...
