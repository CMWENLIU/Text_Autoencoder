I had doubts about this when I first saw it. I've tried other brands of tomato soup, from the can 'o condensed soup just about everyone grew up with to several brands that claim to be healthy. I find them all to be too salty, bland, or both. That is not the case here. This soup is wonderful. It's not too salty and anything but bland. It had just the right amount of spice and even though it's light on the salt it doesn't affect the flavor. This is the only tomato soup I'll buy from now on.
