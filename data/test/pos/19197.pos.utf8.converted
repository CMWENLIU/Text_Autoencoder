Our toy couldn't manage the kernel size for the WolfKing, so we swapped him to Just A Wee Bit - now he has no more problems. We have all our show dogs on Solid Gold bison/salmon, but we add supplements of kelp and salmon oil. The dogs are healthy and their coats are wonderful. One vendor for ProPlan (at a local store) told us "you obviously don't feed them proPlan - their coats are too good". She was right - we use Solid Gold.<br /><br />Suggest you buy direct from petfooddirect dot com. You can get 5 to 20% discount compared to Amazon prices
