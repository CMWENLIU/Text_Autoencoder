I am a cake decorator who has been struggling to create vibrant icing and fondant colors without using a ton of coloring. The Americolor soft gel colors are amazing!! Just a few drops of color produce vibrant, brilliant colors that get stronger with time. There is no bitter taste to the icing and they blend well. Definitely a must for any baker!!
