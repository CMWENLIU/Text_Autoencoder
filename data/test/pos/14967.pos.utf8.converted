I have acid reflux and was looking for something to replace my Rx. I read the reviews and ordered the honey. After a week I was feeling so much relief, I felt great. I ordered some of the honey for my mother, she fights stomach discomfort at night. She started to feel better in 3 days. I tell everyone that tells me of their stomach problems about this product. I was pleasantly surprised and now living with comfort.
