This is so much better than canned stock or boullion cubes that it's unbelievable. It's really like making your own stock. I never use anything else for making French onion soup or vegetable soup. It can be a little salty, and you have to dissolve it in a little hot water before you add it to the soup, but this is one of the things I keep in the house at all times. The lobster stock is great for gumbo, too.
