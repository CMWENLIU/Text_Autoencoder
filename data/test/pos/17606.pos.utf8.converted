I'm also a grind-your-own bean type, and I adore this coffee.<br /><br />In addition to the other praises heaped above, I would also point out that it dissolves REALLY well, and is therefore excellent for iced - I put a couple of heaping table spoons in a quart jar (I like it strong), add about a half-cup of hot water, and then top off with cold water, milk, and agave nectar. Minimal fuss, and no energy wasted to heat water just to cool it down again.<br /><br />For a while I was religiously consuming a (12-ounce/three dollar!) bottle of organic flavored iced coffee every morning. When I realized I could recreate the same beverage for about thirty cents using my own organic spices, sweetener, and milk the cost for a jar of this stuff suddenly didn't seem so unreasonable.
