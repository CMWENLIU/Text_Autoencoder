We've tried so many different brands of gluten-free pasta since my husband was diagnosed with celiac disease last year. Mrs. Leeper's is the best tasting thus far. It has the same al dente bite and taste of regular pasta. I can finally make dinner and not have my husband wear that disappointed look on his face like he's missing out. He loved his Barilla, but this tastes just as good!
