Unless you are buying your peanut butter fresh ground in the little plastic tubs or some smaller brand, you probably get one of the Smucker's/Laura Scudder's jar from your super market. This fits those perfectly and greatly simplifies/enhances the mixing experience. It does a much better job than I had with a butter knife or a plastic chopstick, not to mention the mess it avoids. I would even say it made the peanut butter taste better since the consistency throughout the jar was more even from the mixing. To store and protect the device, I just saved one of the empty jars and keep it on there in the cupboard. That way, too, my wife will remember what it's for and not toss it in the next garage sale. ;-)
