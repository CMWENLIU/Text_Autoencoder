First tried this tea from a specialty store in Buffalo, NY where it sold for close to $60/lb.  Love it, even though it was only 2 oz.  Search the net for this tea and found it Amazon.<br /><br />It's a light delicate flavorful tea that can be brewed 2 to 3 times by refreshing it with more hot water.  It is non-acidic like some other teas.  It need no addition of cream or sweetner.  I'm currently drinking 5 to 6 cups per day as it is so delicious and light.  It's not exactly a green tea when brewed but a light amber color, with the hint of a flora or fruity taste. The added plus at Amazon is the price and very quick shipping.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend getting this tea for any tea lover and I'm sure they would be pleased if they enjoy a good quality chinese tea.
