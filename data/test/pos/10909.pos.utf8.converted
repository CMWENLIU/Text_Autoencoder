I frequently make dashi and miso soup, so this product was a good addition to my pantry. I also read recently that I could add it to beans to reduce the "gasiness". I was somewhat skeptical, having heard that about other products in the past that did not work. I was pleasantly surprised, though, to discover that when serving a large pot of beans to extended family no one had gas the following day!<br /><br />I like to use my herb scissors to quickly shred the konbu into Japanese-style soups and noodles. Delicious!
