If you make bread and have a machine to grind the wheat berries yourself, this is a great deal!  You get totally fresh flour (after you grind it) and if you make bread once a week, 50 pounds of wheat berries will last a year.  If this is more wheat berries than you'd like to buy, get the 25 lb. bag instead of this size.  (Just be sure you have some secure plastic containers to keep the wheat berries in.)  At this price (and with this quality) it's an unbeatable deal!<br /><br />If you don't yet own a flour grinder, I recommend the KoMo machine made in Germany.  It's costly but it comes in a beautiful wood cabinet.  And if you eat granola, you can grind your oat groats (the whole grain product) on a daily basis - giving you something both cheaper and tastier than rolled oats (which are very processed).<br /><br />Great River is an excellent company!  They sell already-ground flour too - in addition to the "raw materials" on this page.  (But there's nothing like fresh-ground for flavor and nutrition!)  I first tried their whole wheat flour and now I just stick with the wheat berries and grind my own.<br /><br />Thank you, Amazon, for free shipping too!  :-)
