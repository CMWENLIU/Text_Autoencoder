If you love chocolate and fruits, this is the product for you. I have just finished my first bag, and I still can't get over the taste. The candies are bite-size, and (even though I hate using cliches) you simply can't get enough of them. The chocolate doesn't taste bitter, but it's not too sweet either, and the pomegranate enhances the flavor with a slightly sour touch. Overall, just like those commercials say, your mouth will thank you.
