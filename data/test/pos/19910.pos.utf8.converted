if you love hot and spicy and a bit of a noodle fan then this is a highly recommended brand to try.  The noodles and flavoring sachet are a lot higher quality than the 'ramen' you find in the local non-asian grocery stores.  Compared to prices in asian stores - this is a bargain and no lugging it all the way home.  Fabulous value.
