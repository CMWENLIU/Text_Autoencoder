These are really good with cheese, or jam, honey or perhaps best of all, with homemade lemon curd!  Yes, they are crisp, very dry and rather crumbly but that is exactly how they should be.  I have never been able to find proper Scottish oatcakes in my part of the USA so it was a thrill to be able to get these through Amazon.  I was impressed by how fresh they tasted and that they arrived intact.  I now have them on my Subscribe and Save list.<br /><br />I just wish we could also get the thicker style oatcake bannocks (about 1/4 inch thick and generally shaped in farls (a farl is a quarter round) from Amazon!
