It was a Friday; much like Kid Cudi, I can no longer distinguish between day and night.  Me and my boys hit our local grocery store, but they were all out of Honey Bunches of Oats.  I was like, "What kind of cruel joke is this?  I demand to speak to your manager," but the manager just said, "No speak English.  Out of cereal today."  I was devastated, until my boy Fred - he's the straight-A wizkid in our crew who gets so relaxed that he can headshot noobs on CoD while sipping earl grey tea and staying classy - suggested that we order from Amazon.  I was like, "Fred!  This is why you're the straight-A wizkid in our crew who gets so relaxed that he can headshoot noobs on CoD while sipping earl grey tea and staying classy!"  He was like, "Holla, brotha," while doing some calculus in his head and sipping some Aquafina.  Because of the commercials, Aquafina always reminds me of the number, "I Feel Pretty" from "West Side Story."  Although "West Side Story" is a classic, I prefer "Wicked" on Broadway because it reminds me of my own adventures in the Emerald City, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />But I digress.  The order took awhile, but our appetites had not subsided.  After admiring the fantastic, emotionally overwhelming art on all six sides of the box for a couple of hours (we all hugged and cried because we could really feel the artist's passion), we attacked all four packs of cereal simultaneously.  The four-pack combines convenience and quality - two product characteristics that are rarely seen today.  When we finished, we cut up the box and framed each side in sleek, contemporary, thin maroon frames that really made the colors on the box snap, crackle, and pop.<br /><br />Honey Bunches of Oats are great.  Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds are fantastic.  Four packs of Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds are divine.
