After trying every brand on the market, I can say without hesitation Taste Nirvana is the best tasting CW available. And I'm so excited it's now available via Amazon, in a can, and discounted with subscribe and save! I've been purchasing the 9.5 oz glass bottles for many months at $2 ea and found it helped me stay hydrated during the winter (heaters always dry my skin out and make me itchy). If unaware of the benefits, short version: contains electrolytes, potassium, small amounts of many essential amino acids, plus it doesn't contain any artificial colors or preservatives, it's fat-free, cholesterol-free AND low in calories! Google has a bunch of articles :)<br /><br />Info from my 9.5 oz label:<br />75 cals<br />42mg sodium<br />600mg potassium<br />16g carbs<br />2g fiber (i drink w/pulp)<br />9g sugar<br />1g protein<br />9% magnesium<br />4% calcium<br />6% vitamin c<br />4% iron<br /><br />I had been drinking pulp free and accidentally purchased bottles with pulp, but one sip and I was a fan. Can't express enough how much I enjoy NV CW. If you've been turned off by other brands of CW, want a sugar free yet sweet variety, give NV a try. You won't be disappointed.
