I really only got this because I wanted to get to the $25 free shipping cutoff so by spending another $8, I saved $6 on shipping so why not.  I have had this before and knew I liked it...starts out very firm, but softens easily and does not really stick to your teeth like some other taffy.  I brought it to work and everyone loves it. (There are jokes on every wrapper, but they are fairly lame...maybe because they are designed for kids...)
