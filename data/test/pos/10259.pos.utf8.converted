Good Day, extremely happy I was able to find a company that produces a particular cheese called Liederkranz. Limited selection of two or three types with various packaging sizes. The only disappointing aspect of this purchase was I expected this purchase to arrive in time for our 500+ mile drive to deliver it my father prior to Thanksgiving. The company who rec'd this order chose not to send this order out till the 29th of November thus missing out on the personal delivery by my family and instead having to be mailed again by Federal Express.<br />I will order again from this company however I will communicate my concerns prior to ordering this time. Thanks again for the cheese. Excellent product.
