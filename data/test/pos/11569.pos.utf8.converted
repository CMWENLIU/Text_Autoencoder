This is definately one of the best Hickory Liquid smoke brands on the market. Right from the moment you open the cap on the bottle you will immediately appreciate the finest, true hickory smoke flavorings ever developed. The liquid smoke is very concentrated so start with a small amount diluted with water according to your taste.  Add a little more for future marinades if the first attempt is not enough hickory smoke flavor to statisfy your taste buds. Great for adding hickory smoke flavor to marinades. According to the company web page, item has a hint of mesquite flavor . I could not ascertain by smelling that it was there. It was not on the advertisement.
