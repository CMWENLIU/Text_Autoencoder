RIGHT ON MANDY!  Since WHEN is a chemical product BETTER for you then the real deal?  Bottom line...they are NOT better for you.  This product was purchased for coffee creamer.  I purchased the Nido (pack of 3 whole milk) powder from Amazon and mixed a can of that along with this powder and let me tell you....it has liquid half and half beat by a country mile and don't even get me going on how much better it is that that FAKEY powder creamer crap.  SO....I am givin' this review up to Mandy because I read hers and totally agreed and the FIRST person to review this product convinced ME to purchase it.  WHEN this is back in stock I will get more.  Any doubts still?  Read up on artificial creamers and SEE what the "long term" effects from ingesting that can be....it's scary!  By the way I vacuumed packed my "mix" and got 3 nice size bags of product.
