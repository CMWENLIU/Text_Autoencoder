I bought the four-pack of this cereal from Amazon, and absolutely love it! Being a single guy, it is really simple and fast to make (just pop a large bowl in the microwave!) and very hearty. As with any plain-old grain cereal, the base is pretty bland (though, it can be eaten that way ... it's not as flavorless as some!), but is easy to work with ... add a small touch of blueberry syrup and a few fresh blueberries, or a touch of brown sugar and some maple syrup, and it's truly delightful! I will definitely buy another box when this one runs out.
