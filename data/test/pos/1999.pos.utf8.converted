The product is great, the shipping is quick, and most importantly....<br /><br />The Key Lime Pie is delicious!<br /><br />I was taught how to make this simple, exotic dessert years ago when visting family living in Marathon...they had a resident lime tree in the front yard.<br /><br />Living up north, a little bit of Keys sunshine would arrive with a box of limes, and these are just as perfect... if only they had the fresh grouper fingers and lobster tails that would arrive with them.<br /><br />But that's another story, and in the meantime...the limes from Melissa's are first rate.<br /><br />P.S. with all respect, key lime juice is just not the same...fresh makes the difference
