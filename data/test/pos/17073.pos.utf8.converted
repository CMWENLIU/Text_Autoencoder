This is great tabouli.  I have been having great difficulty finding tabouli in recent months, in any retail grocers.  We have always used the Near East brand, and I looked for it at Amazon. I found this Casbah brand and it was slightly cheaper and had great reviews, so decided to try it.  I used a recipe from the other brand that I had always made, for a Greek salad. I added about a half cup lemon juice, 1 cucumber(diced), and a package of feta cheese.  WOW.  The flavor with the Casbah brand tabouli just exploded.  It's wonderful. And the price is definitely right, not to mention that it is organic.
