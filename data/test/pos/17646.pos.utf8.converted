When my husband and I decided to start making our own lattes, and cappacinos at home, I began trying different espresso coffees.  Allessi, by far, is a smooth strong flavored coffee that I use to buy at our local grocery store for $8.00. So not only does it taste good, this is a very reasonable price. The finer the grind, the more flavorful the coffee and I haven't seen a coffee ground quite as well as Alessi.  I also like the fact that it is vacumn sealed in a tin, not plastic. I highly recommend it. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDLB9Q">Alessi Espresso, 8.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)</a>
