It was about 4 years ago when my wife left me. I've been searching for a mate since, but to no avail. I gave up about 3 months ago and decided that I will remain single for the rest of my mortal life. I was looking for hello kitty back packs and teapots on amazon when somehow I came across this amazing object. A Fresh Whole Rabbit. I knew I had to get one. I have never been happier since. The reason?? Lets just say this rabbit carcass can please me 20 times more than ....my hand.
