Living in the UK, my husband and I enjoyed Nando's frequently. However, now in The States, there seem to be no Nando's restaurants! I am trying to understand how this could be when there are a million other mediocre restaurants here. KFC's nasty and fatty tasting chicken and sides could be well replaced with Nando's flame grilled peri-peri chicken dishes and their sides are better too... corn on the cob, chips(fries) with peri-peri spice which also taste great dipped in the Nando's peri-peri sauce, garlic bread, and my favourite spicy rice!<br /><br />Seriously, if you haven't tried Nando's sauces you need to because it's the best I've ever tasted. If you live in The States it will be unlike anything you've ever had before and you'll love it. The Medium Peri-Peri is hot enough for my tastes, but if you can it's good to try to consume the Hot Nando's Peri-Peri as well as it contains more chillis. The more hot chillis one can consume the better for their metabolism and health. So, Nando's is not only a tasty choice, it is also a healthy one.
