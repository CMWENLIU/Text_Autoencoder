My brother had told me about these bars so I went on to Amazon to order them,  I totally love the flavor but when my sister told me they were made in China I about died.  I called my brother to tell him and he said "well that is it for Mrs. Mays"  I totally agree.  Can't believe we can't get almonds, blueberries etc. here in the good USA.  Will not buy again.
