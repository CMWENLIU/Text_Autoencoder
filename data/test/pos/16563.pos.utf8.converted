One.  Single.  Solitary.  Singular.  One is the loneliest number that you'll ever use.  Uno.  Einz.<br /><br />The marketing folks at Lay's got it right.  No one can eat just one.  Nor should they.  LAY'S POTATO CHIPS, the consummate snack of Americana, are not designed for solitary servings; they are here to be consumed prodigiously--by handful after greasy handful.  Crisp, fresh, salty spud nirvana, these are chips to munch not in solitary discipline, nor one per serving (egads), but in numbers too high to count.  Wherever there are hamburgers or hot dogs being grilled, wherever there are tailgating parties, wherever there are social gatherings of casual consequence, bags of LAY'S POTATO CHIPS make their tasty presence known.  We munch, we crunch, we scarf a bunch in a hunch.  And--always--we come back for more.<br /><br />So banish the thought of eeking out an existential existence of snack food discipline; treat yourself to wholesome goodness that transcends generations of hearty crunchers.  Become, like moi, a master magician.  See how fast you can make one of these bags of spud nuggets disappear.  Chow, er, ciao!<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
