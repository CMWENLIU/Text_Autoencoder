"This one caught us by surprise! We don't know of any other pod maker that has this flavor and it's really good! We love the way it smells - the way it tastes - and the fact it is just plain different. Most pod people are ignoring the flavored sector to this extent - and it's nice to have a cup of really flavored coffee - meaning - a rich chocolate and raspberry flavored cup of coffee is hard to come by and this one is very good." singleservecoffee.com
