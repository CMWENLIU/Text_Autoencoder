I really like xylitol, it doesn't have a bad after taste like other sugar substitutes. I've tried just about all of them, even Stevia - can't stand the taste of it. The only drawback with zylitol is it doesn't mix in cold drinks - but I found a way around that. Put the zylitol in water, heat it up till it dissolves, and then put it in your drink - tried it in tea this way and it worked perfectly. It can give you gas and diarreah if you use too much - just use a small amount till you see how you react to it. This brand seems to be really good - never have had problems with it. As an added benefit it is good for your teeth.
