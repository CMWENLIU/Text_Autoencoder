I am not sure what they fed these guys but it is absolutely the best hare I ever eaten. I stuffed it with escargots and a creamy champagne cream sauce with truffles from Luxembourg and and eatable Thai Lilly flowers. Delightful. I added the leftovers to a Flan recipe that went over very well with the children. They all wanted more and skipped the ice cream. I'm ordering more. PS keep dental floss handy.
