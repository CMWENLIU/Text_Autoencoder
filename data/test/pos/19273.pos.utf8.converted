Bob's Red Mill dried Date Pieces or Date Crumbles are so tasty and a great find! I enjoy these in cereal, oatmeal, ice cream, muffins, cookies, salads, or as a snack! Soft and chewy and a great flavor. I like how they are 'nugget' style versus buying dried dates that are usually whole and large. I also love Bob's Fig Nuggets for the same uses. Yum!
