I love this coffee from Wolfgang Puck, it is always fresh, tasty and provides a consistent cup of java, one cup at a time.<br /><br />Best of all, you can taste the flavors that make Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee so famous. Of course, it is not 100% Blue Mountain, but a respectable blend of arabica beans that includes enough of that treasured bean to justify its name. And it is neither under nor over roasted, just done to the point where the flavors are best.
