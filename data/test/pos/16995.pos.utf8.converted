I have been using this for the past 6 months or more in my Kamut and spelt breads.  I forgot to throw it in the other day and wondered what was wrong with my bread....the texture was a little less moist and the volume was almost a whole loaf less.  I realized this stuff must be doing something good so I'm ordering more again!  I think it improves the moistness, texture, and overall quality of breads low in wheat gluten such as spelt and kamut.
