I love Middle Eastern spices and foods, so I look for fresh spices all the time. I stumbled on this and used it the other day in  Black-eyed peas with green peppers, garlic, and onions...oh my goodness AMAZING!  I have used it with extra Lean ground beef to make meatballs and gravy YUM!  The combination is amazingly well blended.  IF you have ever eaten at a real Moroccan restaurant and loved it...you'll love this.  If you like Eastern Indian food, Dahl etc, you'll love this spice in your lentils and stews!!
