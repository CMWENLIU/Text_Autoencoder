Most kids in the UK grow up with Ribena, a delicious sweet blackcurrant drink that you dilute with water. Thirst-quenching with a wonderful flavor & packed with lots of Vitamin C. I still love it & I'm in my 40s living thousands of miles away from a UK supermarket. Fortunately Ribena is available online :) I highly recommend Ribena!
