This is supposed to be real cinnamon, which is totally unlike the plant we usually use in the US for cinnamon, which is closely related taste wise, but is not cinnamon.  It has a more earthly smell and taste, and isn't as strong as Vietnam "cinnamon", which really isn't cinnamon.<br /><br />I actually prefer the taste of what we usally call cinnamon but isn't and will be going back to that, but with that said, having never tasted Ceylon Cinnamon before, I'm not really qualified to judge it. The way it was packaged, it looked like it was very high quality, and I have no reason to dobut that, even if I'm not a great fan of it's flavor.
