Tried this as an energy booster. Getting older and would just run out of gas after an hour or so of physical effort. Was absolutely amazed at the difference in my energy level after taking this the first couple of weeks. My workouts were better so there was a cumulative effect. Then the dramatic difference started to fade. I began to notice more subtle differences. As I've gotten older, I've noticed that my body doesn't do some things as well. I get dehydrated easily which can cause other problems. I sweat when I am working hard, but not easily and it takes longer to turn it off after cool down. The Green Superfood has turned back the clock. My recover period after hard physical activity is much shorter. In general, everything is just working a little better. That is Amazing.
