I listened to the reviews and bought a pack of these, which is not a bad price for 4 tin cans! The taste is much better than those nestle cocoa packets and it contains NO partially hydrogenated oils which is bad for ur body.<br /><br />I use 2-3 tbsp per 8 oz milk rather than 4 tbsp like the instruction say because 4 tbsp makes it way too sweet for me.
