I have fed my 4 cats Natural Balance Venison & Green Peas 6 oz. wet food for abt. 2 years or so.  They are all abt. 9 years old. I split one can 4 ways in am and pm.  I started because one cat seemed to be allergic to chicken by-products.  She licked her stomach raw.  The vet recommended food like duck or venison. When I started feeding them the Venison she stopped licking as much.  Her stomach hair grew back.  They all seem to like it.  I give them a duck dry food to supplement.  They have no health problems.  I think higher quality food helps prevent illness and they have glossy coats.  I would recommend it.
