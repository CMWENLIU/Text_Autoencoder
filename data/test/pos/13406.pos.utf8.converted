When I learned about the many benefits and uses of coconut oil I had to try it, so I ordered 2 jars -one for my pantry for cooking/smoothies etc. and one for my bathroom to use as a body cream. Since I didn't know what brand to choose and didn't have any prior experience with coconut oil I decided to get one jar of the NUTIVA brand and one jar of the NATURE'S WAY brand.<br /><br />Here's my initial opinion of both: With my Nutiva jar there's a sticker indicating the expiration date and package/creation date of the actual oil, whereas with my Nature's Way jar there's nothing like that. When I opened both of them up to try and to just generally check them out I tasted a tiny amount of both and it was very clear that the Nutiva jar's coconut oil tasted much better. I'm not sure exactly why, but to me the Nature's Way coconut oil didn't taste as good, it was kind of toasty in a bad way.<br /><br />It was very easy for me to decide to use the Nutiva brand coconut oil for my cooking and in my smoothies and the Nature's Way coconut oil for my skin. I've since read that this difference in taste could be because the Nutiva brand coconut oil was fresher and the Nature's Way older. Or it could be quality, I'm really not sure. But I am sure that from now on I'm going to just be buying the Nutiva brand Coconut Oil (just ordered 2 more big jars of it). :)<br /><br />To say that the Nature's Way coconut oil was toasty still isn't exactly the right word -toasty sounds like something good... when it's so not, but I really can't think of a better word to describe the difference.<br /><br />I've found a lot of uses for coconut oil and have used it for many things with great results so far. It's hard to believe one little oil can do so much! Weird actually, but everything I've tried it with so far has had positive results.<br /><br />So here's a list of weird, random, but completely amazing things I've found coconut oil to do:<br /><br />-Works better than any make-up remover: seriously, just use a nickle size amount or less on your eyes to get all eye make-up off in a flash.<br /><br />-Helps clear up acne: One night after using it to take off my eye make-up I decided to use it as an all over face make-up remover... then decided my face felt so good I didn't want to use anything else (hint: leave the coconut oil on your face for a minute and then get your water and washcloth really really hot to wipe it all away). I googled to see if this was okay to do and it turns out coconut oil can help get rid of acne! You can use it as a facewash. Strange but true. BUT I also found out that Castor Oil works even better for this (and like coconut oil still moisturizes your face and keeps it from drying out), so I've ordered a small bottle of that to use instead in the future... but still, coconut oil has worked really well for me and apparently others. When you have skin like mine (I'm 25) that occassionally breaks out but still is a little dry sometimes it's hard finding the right balance and exactly the right thing to use -I feel like now I've figured out some great secret to getting it right.<br /><br />-You can use it as a deoderant: This one I read online and decided to try on a day where I wasn't really doing anything or working out. It felt weird -like I was putting some kind of lotion or body creme under my arms instead of my normal Secret deoderant. But guess what? It worked! I have since been trying it on days where I actually do work out and it STILL is working. Craziness! It keeps me dry and smelling good the same as my old deoderant did. AND there's no aluminum zirconium (have no idea how to spell that correctly) which I know is now supposedly bad for you (most deoderants still use it though) because it's connected/correlated with Alzheimers. So... an all natural, organic, one ingredient deoderant that feels like a body creme -doesn't get much better than that! Plus my underarms are looking softer/nicer. :)<br /><br />-You can use it on your scalp and hair: Now I've tried this several times and although I DO like the way it moisturizes my hair, I don't like the way my hair looks after I wash it out... it's just kind of lanky/heavy. Not in an extreme way or anything, but I like my hair to have lots of body. So while I do recommend coconut oil to help heal frazzled hair and stimulate hair growth I don't recommend doing it right before any big event in your life... maybe like a few days before so you get the benefit of the moisturized, healthy hair, without any worries about styling it. This is another one where I've looked it up and found that Castor Oil when massaged in the scalp can stimulate hair growth/fast hair growth even better -so now that I've got that bottle on the way to me from amazon I'll probably be using that instead, at least on my scalp.<br /><br />-You can use it as a body creme and even a BODY WASH. Yepp. A body WASH. Sounds crazy, but it makes my skin look SO good. Better than it's ever looked actually. Coconut oil has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties (and of course is moisturizing) and will clean your skin while hydrating it. So no harsh chemicals or detergents touch your skin -and if you have sensitive skin like I do, well this stuff might just be your new best friend, must-have, can't live without it ever, stuff! I used to have a minor skin problem on my arms that I absolutely hated. Just general redness, sensitivity, and tiny little red dots on the tops of my arms (that I've had since childhood). Now I absolutely don't -and it's literally all because of coconut oil. Maybe it's because I'm not putting soaps/bodywash on my skin anymore or maybe it's because coconut oil is really that awesome, but it has basically cured my arms and has made the skin all over my body look amazing! I seriously can't believe how good it makes my skin look! The best thing to do is to literally use it like a body wash all over -rinse off and then either just towel dry and go or towel dry and then reapply again if your skin is dry or it's winter or you live in a dry climate. When you reapply you're going to have to have some kind of small towel to wipe off excess with before you put on clothes. Either way it makes your skin look great. :) You can also use it to shave with apparently but I haven't tried that. I'm using it to make my own homemade body scrubs and of course using it as a body creme and loving it!<br /><br />-You can feed it to your dogs (one tablespoon a day) to make their coats shiny. (I've been giving it to both my dogs, although not every single day and they love it.<br /><br />-It can help you lose weight. Apparently it has a lot of really GOOD for you fats that your body doesn't treat like other fats and it actually helps you lose weight (learned this from Dr. Oz). Plus it tastes good when you cook with it and put it in smoothies. Actually I LOVE it in smoothies, it just adds an extra tropical coconut flavor. :-)<br /><br />-You can use it for Oil Pulling.<br /><br />-You can use it as a lip balm.<br /><br />Plus I know there's so much more but that's all I can think of right now! Basically it's really good stuff that I am now believing everyone should have in their home! :-)
