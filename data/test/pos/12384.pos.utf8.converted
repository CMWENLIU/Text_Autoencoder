I can't believe this product has been around for so long and we've only just discovered it now! I opened my first can of Diced Chik last month with a little trepidation after buying it at a local Kosher grocery store for a whopping $5.99 a can. I opened the can, turned to the fridge to get some mayo, and turned around to discover my three kids chowiing it down right out of the can! The taste and texture really are so good that you truly can eat it right out of the can, no sauce, no cooking, nothing! There aren't too many meat substitute products out there that can boast that!<br /><br />In the past month I've used Diced Chik in chili, soup, tacos, omlettes, a pot pie...it's great for kids who may not like the flavor of beef substitute products. I have yet to find anything you can't use it in. For my family of five, we definitely need two cans for dinner. Our brownie troop has several vegetarian girls and we are definitely going to be taking Diced Chik camping with us.
