I bought a pound of this candy along with another pound of old-fashioned hard filled candy from the same company.  Both selections arrived fast, fresh, whole and unbroken.  These chocolate filled candy straws are just delicious. The hard candy shell comes in different flavors  such as lime, strawberry, lemon, orange, etc.  I would definitely buy again.
