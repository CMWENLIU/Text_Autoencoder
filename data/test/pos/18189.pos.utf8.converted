I really love these hunts diced tomatoes with green peppers, celery and onion. Hunts and Amazon did a good job packaging the cans so that my four cases arrived safely without any severe dents to any of the cans. I'm stocking up on canned tomatoes because Amazon has a marvelous price of $10.53 a case or around $0.88 per can, which is $0.33 cheaper per can than my local grocery store and I receive the added convenience of having them delivered right to my home.  I've read news reports that the prices of tomatoes will be going up from 15% to 20% in the coming months because of inflation and supply shortages so I want to make sure to have a nice supply.<br /><br />  I've had other brands of diced tomatoes and they are usually overly filled with juice or contain harmful ingredients like "high fructose corn syrup" Hunts quality can't be beat,these cans are filled with tasty healthy tomatoes with very small amounts of liquid to drain. I use them mostly with black beans for mixing my own low cost salsa ^_^<br /><br />  I do wish they made their cans like Libbys which are made to stack on top of each other, Hunts cans are difficult to stack.<br /><br /> Enjoy!
