I got a box of these and they were great.  A nice chocolate covered biscuit.  They are perfect for eating a few at a time.<br /><br />Definately don't order in the summer like I did.  The chocolate melted and when it hardened again the stack of cookies was stuck together and had to pry them apart.  Still, I'll order these again.
