I bought Kicking Horse 454 Horsepower coffee for my mother after reading the reviews on Amazon, and I'm glad I did.  She's a hard woman to shop for, with few hobbies but an endless capacity for drinking coffee, not quite mechanically-advanced enough to roast her own, but a coffee snob for sure.  When my mom opened up the gift bag with these tins of coffee, she popped the lid on one and stuck her nose in, inhaled deeply and immediately left the room to brew a pot.  This was a Christmas morning gift; she literally brought our gift-opening to a complete halt because she wanted a cup of the Kicking Horse coffee instead of what had already been brewed.  It was a well-received gift, to say the least.<br /><br />Dark, oily, velvety and rich beans produce a cup with the same quality.  My mother was in whole bean coffee heaven and the whole house filled with the intense aroma.  I'm a coffee drinker too, though compared with my mother that's sort of like looking at the Titanic, flipping your kayak, and saying you've had a boating accident too.  Nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised to find the brew palatable to me.  Many of her dark roasts either taste too bitter in my mouth, or wind up upsetting my stomach; I didn't have either problem with Kicking Horse.<br /><br />I highly recommend Kicking Horse Coffee.  With my mother's birthday on the horizon, at least I now know to give her the coffee at the very end of the party!
