Today is May 6, 2011.  I just got my box of Columbia Via, and the expiration is March 2012.  That's almost a year.  Fine with me!!  Oh, and it's exactly what I expected.  Just as if I bought it in the store, but A LOT cheaper.  To do the math for you, it's 70 cents a packet.  That's cheaper than a small cup of 7-11 coffee, but WAY better.  What more can you ask?
