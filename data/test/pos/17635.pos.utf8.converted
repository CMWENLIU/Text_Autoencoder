Two months ago, my 11-year-old kitty began to vomit after every meal. She had been on a prescription food for FUS (feline urinary syndrome) for seven years and had never had any trouble with this food.<br /><br />I tried sensitive stomach food, which didn't work, then another recommended food, which also didnt work. I tried diluting the foods with water. She lost a lot of weight (and couldn't keep anything down! I went through three bottles of spot cleaner!) but she still seemed to have some energy and was getting water,  After almost three weeks I was ready to submit to vet bills, which I couln't afford. (Thought it might be hairballs but could have been food allergies or something worse.)<br /><br />I read somewhere about Dick van Patten's Natural Balance, and tried the Ultimate formula, canned. It's been eight weeks, and my kitty hasn't thrown up since the first time I gave her this food. She has lots of energy now and has gained back a good portion of the weight she lost. No exaggeration, this has been for me like a miracle.<br /><br />I don't know what the reviewer who said there was a smell was talking about, because there is no smell! (Maybe he was trying the fish formula, which should smell like fish?)<br /><br />In fact, this food contains only human grade meat and veggies. Again, my cat loves the food. I have also used the Hairball Mgement formula, and that first week she liked that, too... now, she doesn't eat that alone, so I mix a smaller amount with the Ultimate formula and that seems to be fine.<br /><br />I am very grateful to find this food and, having read some about cat nutrition, I feel confident that it is nutritionally very good.
