I went to a coffee convention in Las Vegas. I was just along for the ride as a guest. However, I have been on the hunt for a perfect cup of coffee for a long time. First I will tell you what I want in my morning cup. I want a latte without alot of drama. I don't want to go through a complicated process with alot of noise or big expense. I have found my solution. This coffee press allowed me to put my own coffee (PEETS) in the adaptor, pour the water in and press. NO noise no whirring steaming hiss. I microwave milk and pour the "espresso" in. I use a very small amount of water and get a smooth delicious concentration of coffee. If you want a regular cup of coffee just add more water. I have just placed my order with Cafejo. I put a review here because I am an Amazon shopper and think it should be sold here. Order with confidence in a good product.
