I purchased this gigantic box of Eden Organic Soba noodles on December 7, 2008 and am very pleased with the quality of the product.  I hesitated in purchasing it for a few days because I was unsure what to expect in quality and packaging and no one had posted a review for me to consider.  The product arrived packaged in the box you see depicted in the picture which has a large plastic bag holding the pasta.  After examining it and finding no problems with it, I placed the entire box in my freezer for long-term storage and will definitely be purchasing it again in the distant future.  This was definitely a great deal on an Excellent product!
