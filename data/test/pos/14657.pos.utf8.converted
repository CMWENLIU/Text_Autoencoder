I saw this and thought it would be worth trying, primarily to have a nice box to keep tea in.  The box is great, but I was astonished at how much I like the teas.  Whatever their source for tea (100% Ceylon) has a very smooth and distinctive flavor.  Their English Breakfast is easily the best black tea I've tried (and I love tea), at least when taken without milk.  It's fine with milk, but isn't as good as some UK teas.  The flavored teas are all very well balanced as well.  I'd strongly recommend this (or a related smaller size) if you're looking for some very great tea as well as a good place to keep it.
