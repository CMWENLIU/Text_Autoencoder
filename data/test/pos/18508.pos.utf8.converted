When I found out my son had a peanut allergy I thought, hmm, but I love peanut butter so much.  First we tried Almond Butter.  It was ok, but nothing like peanut butter.  It was thick and gritty and tasted ok.  Then one day I saw SunButter.  I though, sunflower seed butter, are they kidding?  But I had to try it anyways.  I tried it right away once home.  WOW!  This stuff smells good, tastes good, is creamy like peanut butter.  I actually like it MORE than peanut butter.  I've not only dipped apples and used it on bread, but also baked with it as a peanut butter replacement.  Sooooo tasty.  I first bought the kind you have to stir, but am loving this non stir kind so much more!  It bakes like peanut butter, it's creamy like peanut butter, it's tastier than peanut butter.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  I just wish it was priced like peanut butter.  They want $6.99 a jar at Albertson's so I was very happy to find it here on Amazon.
