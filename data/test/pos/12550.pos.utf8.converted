I wonder if the first reviewer oversteeped his tea, as the second reviewer implied. After switching from coffee to tea as my primary hot morning beverage, I found there is a certain art to making the perfect cup of tea (using loose tea leaves), and part of the art is proper steeping. The recommendation is three to five minutes, and even as a fan of strong things in general (coffee, beer, hot sauce, :)), I lean toward three minutes for a good cup of Earl Grey. It's easy to be overzealous, especially if you're accustomed to drinking bagged teas.<br /><br />In any case, I haven't found a Twinings tea where the flavors were not deep and distinctive. And by the way, as the previous reviewer noted, Twinings really is an old British company, unlike some outfits that attach "of London" to their names.
