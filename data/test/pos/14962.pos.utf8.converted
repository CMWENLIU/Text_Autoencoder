I have had stomach issues for as long as I can remember.  I have acid reflux and IBS.  The doctors I have seen give me acid reflux medication and say to use an elimination diet.  Well, the medication would not work, and they would say, take double the amount.  I have eliminated foods down to about 10 things I eat to avoid stomach problems.  This is  no way to live.  After being told about this honey, I read reviews and researched it online. I decided to give it a try.  BUY THIS PRODUCT!  I have been taking it for about one week, and I feel better.  My digestion is improved, and I know my acid reflux is better.  It seems to sooth my stomach and digestion, and it helps with IBS.  I have been very happy with this product, and I hope you are too.
