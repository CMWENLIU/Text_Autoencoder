I purchased the matcha powder in hopes to replicate the green tea lattes at starbucks. Starbucks matcha powder contains more sugar than matcha, so i thought Id try creating my own. This product is amazing and tastes exactly like the green tea lattes. I chose not to add a syrup, but it would work very nicely. To have a similar green tea latte like starbucks i use this recipe:<br /><br />1 cup of hot milk separated (I use skim)<br />1 teaspoon of matcha powder<br />3 tablespoons of hot water.<br />Sugar/Splenda (optional)<br />Choice of Flavored Syrup (Optional)<br /><br />First disolve and mix the hot water with the matcha powder. Get all the clumps out before continuing. Then add about 3/4 cup of the milk to the matcha water mixture and mix to completely blend. Using a frother, froth the remaining milk until it resembles a foam. (I also purchased a small travel frother from Amazon) Add it to the top of the latte.<br /><br />Add sugar/spenda if desired.<br />Add syrup if desired.
