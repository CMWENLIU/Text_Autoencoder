Apparently, many groats are steamed to preserve them, thus making them no longer a raw food.  I got these because I understood them to be raw and sproutable--well they won't sprout, however, they are still considered raw.  For my purposes, I soaked them, dehydrated them, then ground them into a flour for raw cowboy cookies.  They were the right groats for this purpose, but I was confused when they didn't actually sprout after being soaked.  I emailed the company, and they got back to me immediately and were very friendly and patient in helping me out--couldn't have been nicer or more helpful.  The cookies turned out great, by the way.
