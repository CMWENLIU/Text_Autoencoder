The product was packaged very well and arrived quickly. Being that I live in an area where there aren't any local stores that carry preserved lemons, I was happy to find these on Amazon. The quality was really good, but not the best I've ever seen, and being a chef, I've seen several different preserved lemon products. Overall I was happy with the purchase and I would buy these again.
