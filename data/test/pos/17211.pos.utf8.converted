I worked in a coffee shop and I drank this stuff non-stop.  It is so good.  I would make it with soymilk - its great hot or cold.  I didn't really like it with water - almost all our customers got it with milk or soymilk.  It doesn't taste sugar-free at all.  It's delicious, not artificial sweetner taste.  Right now, Amazon is listing this for $36 but plenty of websites offer it for less than $30.
