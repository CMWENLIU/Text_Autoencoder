I have the EZ Green Sprouter.  When I bought mine, I bought the seeds from the same company too.  The cost was a bit pricey so I checked Amazon's.  I went ahead and placed an order for one 5lb.  Granted, I'm not new to growing Wheatgrass, I followed the SAME simple steps but with these new seeds.  I am AMAZED!  Not only do these seeds produce green blades of lush grass, but there is NO mold!  Whereas in the seeds from the EZ Green Sprouter, their seeds grow skinny, light green and moldy wheatgrass.  I love my EZ Green Sprouter, but their seeds cannot even compare to this merchant's!  Normally once my wheatgrass starts to mold, I would have to start cutting them, separate the mold and then extract the juice.  With these seeds?  The grass is still growing even higher than my EZ Green Sprouter and with NO MOLD!  I am so thrilled to have found a product that is a great value and delivers excellent quality.  I am yours for life~!  Thank you!
