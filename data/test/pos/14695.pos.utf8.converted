AFTER trying the Chocolate Bundt cake , we had to try the other mixes a well.  These took very little time to make and my 15 year old did the making!  As a family we are so tired of things that taste nasty, mushy pasta , cookies that taste  like grit, so we were hoping that this would be as good. WE were not disappointed. They have been out of the oven for 10 minutes, and they are gone! These are really quite good, moist not grainy or beanie, they are really a hit. The people at 123 get it, in my opinion, for many of us this is our new life , and we want to eat things that really taste good.
