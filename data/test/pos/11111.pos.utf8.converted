I was a caffeine addict until it started to affect my health.  By the doctor's orders, I backed off the caffeine.  I went onto Amazon looking for decaf coffee, and I found Pero.  WHAT A GREAT FIND!!!  I now have several cups per day, but I don't feel guilty about it.  It has 3 ingredients--barley, malted barley, and chicory.  Maybe I am hooked on the chicory.  Is that possible?  I doubt it.  Anyway, I swear this stuff tastes more like coffee every time I drink it.  I have been tempted to play a practical joke with people at work by asking them to try my new "coffee".  I'll bet I could fool many of them.  I love Pero so much that I actually gave some to my Mom along with her chocolates for Mother's Day.  Love live Pero!
