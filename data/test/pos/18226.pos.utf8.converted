I was introduced to quinoa (pronounced keen-wah)while on a trip to Peru and Ecuador. It's a fantastic food, especially the red version which is my favorite. It is a perfect protein, which means it has all the amino acids. Quinoa has more fiber and grams of protein than any known grain/rice PLUS it is gluten free. Use it where you might use a starch or find unusual places to use quinoa. I cook up a batch on the weekend and store it in the frig. I then add cooked quinoa to my morning yogurt or to warmed applesauce to make a breakfast or lunch dish. I especially like cooked quinoa added to vegetable soup or any cream soup in order to increase the protein and fiber values of the soups. Try it, you'll like it!
