My baby absolutely loves this food! He's been eating Earth's best and Gerber purees regularly, and he will eat those just fine, but when I've given him the Baby Gourmet food, he practically wolfs it down. I've tasted it and it actually tastes pretty good! Now, my only issue with this food is how ridiculously expensive it is. We received about 10 packets for free at an event, and that's pretty much the only reason we tried them. I wish we could buy more but the price point is just a little too much.
