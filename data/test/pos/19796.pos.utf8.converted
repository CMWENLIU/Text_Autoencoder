Great product from an independent (and responsive) company.  The cans are dated (package day; ddd/yy) and were very convenient, because they are cans.  The malt extract was great for use as malt extract on brew day.  It's also good mixed in oatmeal, if you like the intensely sweet bready flavor, though 3.3 pounds might be excessive for most people's oatmeal consumption.
