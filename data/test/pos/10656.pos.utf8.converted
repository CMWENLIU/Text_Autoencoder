I am very happy to report that this case of "No Salt Added-Natural Value Yellowfin Chunk Tuna {in Spring Water}" is exactly what the sellers say it is!  The tuna itself is much pinker in color than the usual store bought brands, and as firm and chunky as the standard albacore tuna that I have been used to buying at my local markets. It's a true 6 oz. can of tuna {no shrinking portions here} and this brand is Wild Caught and Dolphin-Safe.  So, let's see now:  No added salt, beautiful pink color, firm and chunky-size pieces, and best of all, a really excellent price delivered right to my door, compliments of Amazon.com!  What's not to like?  I'm permanently sold on the Natural Value's brand of Yellowfin Tuna.  Thanks, Amazon!
