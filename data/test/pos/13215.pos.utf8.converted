it works great. just follow the instructions on the jug. it is shipped wrapped up tightly in a layer of tough plastic to make sure it arrives safely and it is placed in a box for safe shipping. i use it regularly around the base of my buildings. it takes care of the fire ants and other bugs that want to try to get inside. i use it around all areas that i don't want fire ants and other bugs to do damage to... such as the power pole and the well pump. the fire ants actually try to eat into the electrical parts. it works great and i am very happy with this purchase from amazon.com.
