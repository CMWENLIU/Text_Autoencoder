Have tried several brand White teas and this one is without a doubt the best.  Extremely smooth, no bitter after taste, no foul smell.  Simply delicious.  Hubby uses it w/o any sweetener DAILY.  I put a lil honey or sugar in mine, but it's excellent.  Can't beat the price, very economical for white tea (most white teas are too expensive and taste bad).
