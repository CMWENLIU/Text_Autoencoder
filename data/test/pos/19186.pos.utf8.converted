As I have written before, my family absolutely LOVES all of this line of noodles (and they CAN be prepared with just boiling water if you're stuck somewhere without a microwave, it does take a bit longer, but they are just as good in a pinch!) BUT, this one is number ONE with us all! Is it an exact dupe for homemade Alfredo, well...no, but it's pretty darn tasty and we were all pleasantly surprised. GREAT STUFF!!
