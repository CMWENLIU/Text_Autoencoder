This is a good item for a light meal, but you do need to like the flavor.  There are many varieties of smoked salmon.  This one does not have an overpowering smoke flavor (which some people do not like).  It tends to be a best buy compared to similar products, and is sometimes available in the seafood section in supermarkets.  It is a good source of Omega 3.  It comes in an easy to tear open package, but be forewarned that packages contain some amount of oil, and it is necessary to use care in opening the package.  I have some difficulty in finding this product in local supermarkets, including ones that used to carry it.<br /><br />A somewhat better product for general use is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NRMHFI">Tyson Chunk Chicken Breast, 7-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> which can be used for a variety of purposes such as sandwiches, stuffed tomatos, and salads.
