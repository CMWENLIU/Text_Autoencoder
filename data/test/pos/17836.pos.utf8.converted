Some of the other reviewers who have given lower stars don't say if they require gluten free...if they don't I can sort of see where they're coming from.  Gluten free food tastes different from non-gluten free food, AND it's significantly more expensive in almost all cases ($1.50 to $2.00 per bar is typical to what I've seen in stores).  I have been gluten free (Celiac) for over 7 years, and these bars are absolutely one of the best GF bars I've ever had.  I'm not a huge fan of the fruit flavors, but I don't really like fruit flavored bars in general, so I think it's just me.  I have a freind who loves the chocolate covered strawberry flavor.  I adore the peanut butter and all of their chocolate flavors (brownie, fudge, mudslide) are good, too. I don't think that Think Thin can MAKE a bad GF product, at least I haven't found one yet.  They are high in protein and make a fantastic breakfast that fills me up - add that to low in sugar and fat, and you just can't lose.  My only comment is that I would order from [...] directly during the summer - their packaging has insulation and ice packs and it's free if you order over $75 in product.  I ordered through Amazon in the middle of July, and all my bars melted in transit.
