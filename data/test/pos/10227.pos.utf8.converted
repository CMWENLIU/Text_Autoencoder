I was pretty amazed. We had been trying multiple GF bread mixes in our bread machine, including homemade varieties. Bob's was the only brand that actually resembled wheat bread. It didn't cave in like the others or end up with a flat top. I couldn't believe it. The flavor was good as well, and it made a fabulous grilled cheese sandwich.
