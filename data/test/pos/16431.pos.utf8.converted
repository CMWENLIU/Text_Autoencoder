This is my favorite multiple use hot sauce, hands down. Don't be fooled into thinking this is low brow either, they use this on Iron Chef and they know how to make a meal!<br /><br />A few foods I recommend trying this on:<br /><br />Chicken Shawarma<br />Gyros<br />Sushi (mix some in with your wasabi and soy sauce)<br />Cheese Quesadilla<br />Macaroni & Cheese<br />Eggs on toast<br /><br />An few extra notes: It is very hard to distinguish Sriracha from ketchup just by looking; it is similar thickness, color and consistency. I would give it a 3/5 on the hot scale, with 2/5 being a med-hot buffalo wing, 4/5 = 1st degree chemical burn on the lips, 5/5 = strait additive only sauces. If you can take the hottest of store purchased salsas and buffalo wings this will be similar and have no long term discomfort/burning.<br /><br />Usage may vary, void where prohibited
