I have to admit I was a little hesitant in sending this to my mom for Mother's Day.  There were so many mixed reviews from most of the Wine Country Gift Baskets.  My mom got it a few dasy before Mother's Day (which is better than after I guess.  She absolutly loved it.  Everyone said how lucky she was to have such a thoguhtful daughter.  So Yay!! I am thrilled and I will order from WCGB again!
