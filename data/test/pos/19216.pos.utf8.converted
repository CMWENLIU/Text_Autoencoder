I have bought a lot of Xylitol gum, usually needing 2 pieces to make 1 gram. This is big gum, 1 piece = 1 gram. Plus it tastes great!<br /><br />My grandson HAD ECC [Early Childhood Caries] all through his baby teeth, $3400 worth of dental work; his mom and I started him on Xylitol a year ago, now he has $300 worth. All of his little cavities have re-mineralized . Unfortunately, he does not "walk;" he bounces, he skips, he runs, jumps, AND TRIPS! He fell and broke his 4 upper front teeth, broke the roots - so they're being extracted!<br /><br />But the Xylitol cleaned up the rest of his teeth, and Xylitol Burst IS GREAT! And GREAT TASTE!
