I used to get this same soy butter under the Great Value label at Walmart. However, Walmart seems to think that it is a regional product or something (since when are peanut allergies regional?), and doesn't carry it in any of their stores within a 100 miles of me. At first I had my local Walmart order it for me, but the last time I did so it was such a long, drawn out, frustrating experience I gave up on them. Guess they don't really want my business. Hurray for Amazon for making it available!! This same product is also carried under another label by Amazon as well: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026BQKT6">"Tastes Just like Peanut Butter" SchoolSafe Omega 3 SoyButter(NOT SoyNUT Butter) Kids Love It--6 jars/case Economy Size 17.6 oz. $4.49 ea.--100% Nut Free , Peanut Free --2 year shelf life</a>
