I purchase the Zuke's Z-Bones for my dog Cody and he loves them. The reason I get these particular bones is because Cody has Lymphoma and is on what is called a 'cancer diet', which one of the main problems in finding a treat that is compatible for this diet is finding one that is grain free and thankfully Zuke's supplies a no grain treat for my pet that also helps his teeth, wonderful product, and most of all he LOVES them. He gets one per night and come close to ten every night he sits in front of the shelf they sit on until he gets his Zukes!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BV1MP0">Z-BONE LARGE APPLE</a>
