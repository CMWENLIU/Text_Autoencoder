My Mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's two or three years ago and didn't even seem much like my Mother anymore.  I started giving her the coconut oil slowly--just a teaspoon a couple of times a day at first, but graduated that upward to at least three tablespoons per day--and my Mother gradually appeared again.  If you have a loved one with Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia, you should do some research on that.  It is worth the bother!  The product smells and tastes really great!<br /><br />The service has also been great!  I have it scheduled to deliver a certain amount of the product at a certain time interval.  I don't have to bother to remember to reorder it.  It comes like clock-work!
