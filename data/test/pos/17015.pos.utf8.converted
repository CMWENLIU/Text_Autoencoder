The shipping for all Perfect Puree items shows as $70 because if you order less than three, there's a $40 dollar service charge. It costs as much for them to ship three (since it has to be expedited) as it does to ship one. Buy 3 containers (of the same flavor or different flavors) and the shipping is $30. Which is perfectly reasonable for expedited shipping.<br /><br />Kim
