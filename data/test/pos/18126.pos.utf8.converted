I started putting these in my puppy's Puppy Kong, and she LOVES them.  I stick them in as far as they go, and she has to squash the KONG while she pulls it out, or it gets stuck and she has to nibble on the end and slowly pull it out.  Sometimes these get stuck and you have to use something to poke it back out so the dog can get to it again.<br /><br />I highly recommend these, as they are a great variation from the little KONG-shaped biscuits, and from dog kibble.  Also, it seems like they must taste great, because when I put these in her KONG, my puppy will keep working on eating this treat (putting other things inside only catches her attention for a little while).
