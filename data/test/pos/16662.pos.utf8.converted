I had never had this stuff before. It stinks, so I keep it double bagged and it's fine. When you cook it in a pan with oil, it smells much better and tastes delicious. It's really easy to use, I think it adds a lot to dishes like rice or vegetables, but it could be used with anything. It has sort of an onion-like flavor, but way better. I'll never go without this spice again.
