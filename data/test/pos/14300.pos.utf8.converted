If you are a vegetarian in a household of semi-vegetarians, this product might be able to satisfy everyone.  It's texture and taste reminds me of Salisbury steak, but not as salty.<br />The product is in a thin "gravy," which also has a great flavor, and can be stretched into more with a little water and corn starch.<br />We've served it over rice, on a sandwich, and with potatoes--all worthy!<br />Even non-vegetarians won't think twice about enjoying this, and may not know until later that it was all veggies!
