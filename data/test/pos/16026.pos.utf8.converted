A can't miss choice for a tea lover and a perfect tea to brew for any newcomer.  Unlike many black teas, the Prince of Wales does not have any bitterness or acrid aftertaste.  Also difficult to over-steep due to the overriding mildness of the blend.  Bagged versions of Prince of Wales are out there; the taste tends to be flat and nowhere near as satisfying as the loose tea.
