If you're tired of the same old tomato-based taco sauces, give Fiesta Seasoning a try.  Your tacos will have a much more distinctive and authentic flavor; it's not hot, just fresher tasting.  Not only is it light and tasty, but you won't be seeing the evidence of your meal on your shirt!  We must like it.....I just bought a case of 24 packets, and there are only 2 of us!  My family has used it for years, but since the Chi-Chi's restaurants closed, I haven't been able to find it in grocery stores where I live and travel, so it was good old Amazon to the rescue.
