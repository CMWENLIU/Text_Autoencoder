Besides enjoying it straight out of the jar, I also applied the honey to my face after shower, and then washed it off after a few hours. My skin became glowy and smooth, and I also noticed less breakouts, it's like it instantly heals everything. I am amazed. I wonder how it is going to be after a week or so? I probably won't have to apply foundation anymore to cover the unwanted spots, the skin will become perfect naturally.
