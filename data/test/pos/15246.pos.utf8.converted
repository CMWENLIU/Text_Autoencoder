I would not recommend eating this alone.  But be creative.  To me it tasted like rice.  Here's what I did.  I am on the HCG diet and the way I prepare it did not interfere with my weight loss.  But see for yourself.  Everyone's body is different.  But it should work like a charm on any other weight loss program. I made miracle rice in a way that it really tastes good once you put out of your mind how it is packaged and smells before rinsing. I rinsed two packages and put it in a container with one can of 99% fat free chicken broth (that's what I had). Then I sauteed and lightly seasoned onions (in PAM and later added water to make tender since I was not using oil) and put it in the broth-"rice" mixture. Seasoned the mixture just a little with a non salt seasoning. I am really enjoying it. It isn't salty and tastes just like chicken soup with rice. It would be funny if someone else thought of this already. It's so simple I am sure someone did. But my hunger and curiosity kind of brought out some culinary creativity. I think half of this is was only 10-15 calories with the broth and the onions.
