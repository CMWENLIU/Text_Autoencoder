This coffee does not disappoint.  I primarily drink flavored coffees, either vanilla or hazelnut, and this coffee is one of the best ones I've tried.  It has a great aroma while brewing, in the cup, and then it follows through in the taste.  Through February Amazon is offering a coupon on this item, which then gets the price down to around $5.25 a pound; this is a great deal and a terrific way to get your morning started.
