I am trying to follow a organic and gluten free diet. I also like to buy from reputable companies. So it is hard to find to come across products that meet my criteria. But these crackers do it. And they also taste great and are very nutritious. They are very sturdy to use for dips, spreads, etc. I have tried several of their flavors and they all taste good. The one with black pepper is one of my favorites, but it is spicy, so be aware. Nevertheless, I try to buy products that contain as little ingredients as possible, so of all the flavors they offer I prefer the Original flavor for that reason.
