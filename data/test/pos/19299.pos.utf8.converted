We ordered the five pound tin--which is lovely, by the way--and it arrived quickly.  The cookies were intact, each layer in the tin wrapped in its own protective sealed cellophane, and the tin arrived undamaged.  Super seller.  Would purchase from this seller again.  I agree with the previous comment in that these shortbreads are not too sweet, exactly the way these cookies should be, made by the people who make them the best.
