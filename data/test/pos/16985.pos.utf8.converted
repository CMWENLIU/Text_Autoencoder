This delightful molasses is very smooth, of a rich golden brown.  I purchased it to use as an ingredient in making homemade whole-wheat bread.  It is perfect!<br /><br />The molasses is unsulphered.  The only ingredient is:  Molasses.  There are no preservatives added.  It needs to be refrigerated after opening.<br /><br />The company that makes it has been in business since 1934 (based in Lancaster County, PA).  They even produce a shoo-fly pie mix which I intend to try next.<br /><br />And a few perks even come along with it:  several samples of other gourmet items (all terrific) from Chili Fiesta Gourmet as a thank you.<br /><br />This is a high quality product.
