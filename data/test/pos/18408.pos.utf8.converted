I must say I was skeptical to order caviar of fish that I don't know, I did a little bit of research and decided to give it a try.<br />Caviar came in good condition to TX, we ordered by mistake chocolate candies once and they came melted. Ha!<br />Ok, I sliced a bread, put some butter on it and this caviar, first I was surprised by some dark(navy-black) liquid on the butter that came with a caviar, "that's artificial caviar" first what I thought.<br />But, the taste was pretty nice, it's not a salmon caviar, of course...but for that nice price it was very good and tasty!<br />I had read the nutrition label on the box carefully, it has some color added, but nothing dangerous!<br />I think this product is good for those who love to have caviar around all the time, but don't want to spend every time $20 and up!
