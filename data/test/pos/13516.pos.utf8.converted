I would say Theo Chocolate produces a much higher quality product than most mass producers (i.e. Godiva/Ghirardelli) however their chocolate has a very high amount of cocoa in it as opposed to some other typical products, so the taste may be more strong/bitter/crumbly than you are accustomed to. People who usually like creamy milk chocolate would probably not like this bar for a number of reasons:<br />1) It's 70% dark chocolate, which means the cocoa butter/fat content is much lower, and therefore the texture will be not as fatty/creamy<br />2) It's extremely pure with very few additives which lends itself to a more cocoa-based flavor (if you've never eaten raw cacao nibs or you have and you hated them, again, not for you).<br /><br />I'm not trying to be a snob, but I do think that to work up to a product like this takes some time and development of one's palette and taste. Theo produces fantastic quality confections and bars and should definitely be supported especially since they are the nation's only bean-to-bar 100% organic chocolatier.
