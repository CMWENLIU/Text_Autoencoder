In the Carolinas, people have all sorts of ideas about how to cook up and serve bar-b-que...mostly bad.<br />If you like vinegar soaked cat food, come to North Carolina and we'll hook you up.<br /><br />However, this runny red mildly-hot vinegar-based concoction by Scott's makes about the best marinade for<br />ribs you'll find anywhere, that is if you don't have a bottle of Chiavetta's laying around somewhere. Just<br />soak your ribs in this juicy juice for about 3-4 hours before you throw them on the grill, baste with your<br />favorite brand of bar-b-que sauce and voo-ah-lah! Makes a great marinade for chicken too. 5 Bones
