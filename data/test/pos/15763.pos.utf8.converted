This is the best oatmeal that I've ever had.  I now have my family eating it and they love it as well.  It has twice the nutritional value of rolled oats, it's organic, and has an oatier, nuttier, grainer flavor.  Yes I said oatier.<br /><br />You'll love it if you are an avid oatmeal hot cereal eater.
