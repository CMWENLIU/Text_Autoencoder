Rich, bold, full-bodied flavor that goes perfect with a tablespoon of Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate Syrup and a dash or two of milk.  I think the flakes are the secret to a great tasting instant coffee.  Some may think the sticks are pricey, I don't.  Convenient to use, flavorful, non-acidic, and helps wake me up in the morning.  There's no reason to stop at McDonalds now for one of their McCafe's.
