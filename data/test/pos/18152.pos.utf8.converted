This is an all-time favorite tea of mine. I spend hundreds of dollars a year on tea - and this tea really hits the spot in my favorite top ten list of teas. The only downfall about this tea is that it is not made with strings. I like to have strings on my bags of tea. But no matter what this is the best peppermint tea i've ever drank!<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings is a great brand.<br /><br />This tea will smell up your kitchen with a lovely invigorating scent. Perfect for the mornings.<br /><br />I also use this tea when my stomach is upset, if my joints are sore, to help with cramps, and to help with gas! Peppermint is a natural reliever for IBS, especially if you have the flu or a bad cold peppermint tea really seems to bring up your spirits and relieve stomach irritations.
