I was thrilled when Amazon started carrying these aseptic milk cartons; they are great to keep around the house. Normally I buy either 2 percent milk or skim, but occasionally we will run out of milk and my toddler always wants milk first thing in the morning - we just pull one of these out of the fridge and no problem. Also great to keep around for those recipes that call for whole milk, when you don't want to buy a whole gallon. We've also used these to take with us on trips for cereal, coffee, drinks, etc. and it's great because you don't have to refrigerate the carton until you open it. We've saved a lot of money on restaurant breakfasts on vacation by taking milk and cereal with us, using the hotel fridge to keep the milk cold, and eating breakfast in the room every morning. Great for general household use, travel, cooking, or whatever you can think up!
