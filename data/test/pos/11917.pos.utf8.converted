Mmmmmm.  Recently tried the deluxe bar after trying all the other flavors and so far it is my favorite.  Thus far, the deluxe bars have been delicate and crumbly like halvah "ought to be".  Though I've only had a few bars, there is a possibility that I may come across one with that unpleasant cardboard texture (I've had this experience with the chocolate flavored bar).  I did squeeze several of the unopened deluxe bars and they felt soft and crumbly (Mmmmm).  I have high hopes for this bar and have a feeling that I may have hit the jackpot on this flavor.  Wish me luck!<br /><br />It would be nice if all the ingredients were listed here on amazon.  Although, had I known what the other ingredients are, I might not have ordered this flavor.  Besides sesame seeds, sweetener etc., there are raisins, pumpkin seeds, almonds, sunflower seeds, cashews and pistachios, but I have, to date, only noticed almonds. Most of the other ingredients may be very well ground into the mixture or maybe I have not eaten a bar with noticeable pieces of the other ingredients.<br /><br />After placing my order, I read the ingredients on the Camel's web site and my mind thought "Oh no, big chunks of raisins, nuts and seeds will ruin my halvah eating rapture."  Not So.  I'm delighted!
