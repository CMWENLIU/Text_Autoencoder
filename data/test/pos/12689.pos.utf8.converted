I lived in Leuven, Belgium for 8 years and tried many a chocolate.  Leonidas is the creme de creme, that is, the best of the best.  Especially their Framboise Praline is an Epicurean delight if you are a dark chocolate lover.  Also, their plain dark chocolate medallion is outstanding as an addition to a freshly brewed Tully's espresso.  Amazon, you provide a number one global service by bringing the best of Belgium to the US.  Thanx,<br /><br />Heironymus de Medina (aka Jerome)
