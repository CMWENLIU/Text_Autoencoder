This unprocessed sea salt has much more than just sodium chloride in it. There are dozens of trace minerals in it making it much healthier for you. It is coarse, so just a little pinch sprinkled into your cooking or table food will do it. The taste is strong and goes a long way, but is SSOOO much better than normal table salt. If you want it fine, you can grind it in peppercorn grinder or buy the fine ground for a little more money.
