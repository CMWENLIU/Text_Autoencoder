After doing a lot of research on coconut oil, I knew I had to give it a try. The product arrived quickly and as a liquid (I live in FL and it is summer- i expected this), and the smell is just sooooo delicious!!I have not used it in cooking yet, as I started using it topically and want to order a separate batch to cook with, but I have to say I am completely BLOWN away by the effects it has had on my skin already. I am a fair skinned female and have always been a target for mosquitoes. For most of my life I have been embarrassed by the multiple and never ending itchy, ugly bug bites and rashes these annoying little things have left on my skin. (mostly my ankles and legs) and am sometimes reluctant to wear shorts, dresses, and things that don't cover my legs (Which can be very difficult, considering just how HOT it is in FL)because it makes me feel self conscious and less confident about myself.<br /><br />Naturally, when I received the product the first place I started lathering it onto was my feet and legs, and I continued to do this several times a day. I WISH I had taken a before and after photo, as I did NOT expect the results to turn out as they did. Within 2 days, many of the little red spots had COMPLETELY disappeared. Furthermore, the scars and marks that were left from previous encounters have started to fade and are becoming less noticeable each day. Mind you, I have only been using the stuff for about 2 weeks. But like I said, I am completely blown away by the effects thus far. Additionally, I have started to apply the oil to a few moles that I have, and am very excited to see if there are any results in a few weeks (I will follow up with this post as needed)<br /><br />I order items frequently from amazon.com, and do not have the time to review many of the things I purchase. However, the effects from the coconut oil literally seemed to good to be true and now I know why many others have felt the need to 5 star review this product as well. I am a pharmacy student who is turning more and more to alternative treatments and natural remedies every day. I can not wait to be able to educate the public in regards to products such as this. And did I mention? I wore shorts to work for the first time the other day; no more self esteem issues, and my confidence is skyrocketing :)
