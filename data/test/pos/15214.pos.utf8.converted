Mestermacher whole grain rye bread is tasty and healthy. Lots of fiber to keep the stomach in order. 12 packages may scare away a smaller household, but not to worry. Put some of them in your freezer. Freezing and thawing does not deminish the quality, nor the taste.<br /><br />I would also like to compliment the service. When my original order was received I discovered that it had incorrectly been filled with Pumpernickel. I called customer service to find out what could be done. The nice lady said: "Keep it, donate to a food bank, whatever you choose. Meanwhile we shall send you a new box with the bread you ordered." It arrived a couple of days later. Bravo!
