I USED LAVAZZA COFFEE BLACK CAN,IT WAS 5 STAR NOW ALLESSI, JUST IS BETTER 6 STARS,NEVER BITTER, SMOOTH TASTE, GREAT CAPICCCINO.i also mix the two brands together also great tasting.. I USE MY 59 DOLLAR PUMP DELONGI ESSPRESSO MAKER BOUGHT  AT MY LOCAL WAREHOUSE, JUST A NOTE I VE TRIED ALL THE EXPENSIVE MODELS AND FOUND THIS ONE THE BEST FOR ME. JUST HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT..SAVE MONEY ,IN THIS CASE MONEY DOES NOT BRING HOME A BETTER TASTING COFFEE AND MACHINE. STEVEN
