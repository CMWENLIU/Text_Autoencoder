I had never tried Honeybush tea before purchasing this batch from Davidson's, and I couldn't be happier with it. In appearance and consistency, the ground tea is very similar to Rooibos, except it is a slightly darker red. The aroma of the tea is just heavenly. I should also mention that it makes a truly AWESOME iced tea. I normally don't type in caps, but I wanted to emphasize how good this is as a summer refresher. Heat water until close to boiling, then turn off the heat and steep the tea grounds until you attain the desired strength and color. Let the water cool down and then refrigerate it and you have iced tea that far surpasses any bottled brand. Lastly, you will want to store this tea in an airtight plastic container or canister, as it comes in a paper bag that is not really meant for permanent storage.
