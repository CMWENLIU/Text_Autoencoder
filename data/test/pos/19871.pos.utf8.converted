This is quite a bargain when you compare the price to the small cannisters of Accent in the stores. It seems perfectly comparable with Accent. I use it, however, on my dogs' food. It keeps them from eating each other's droppings by making them untasty (as if those weren't untasty to begin with, but not to a dog). Since I sprinkle MSG on their food daily, this product is quite a savings for me (and the vet is the one who endorses use of MSG for this purpose).
