I'm incredibly pleased with the flavor and quality of this pure vanilla extract oil from Kirland Signature Brand.  The price is great, comparable or better than any pure vanilla extract I can find in local grocery stores.  We used it in cupcakes and banana bread with a little pure almond oil and the flavor was warm and delicious.  We tried some imitation the time before it and we knew we had to make an investment in some quality extract.  It turns out, this is actually more affordable than the imitation brand we were buying!  We plan on always keeping an extra bottle of this in stock before it gets halfway used!
