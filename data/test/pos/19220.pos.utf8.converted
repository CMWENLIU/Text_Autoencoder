My cat Crystal has to be the finickiest cat on the planet.  After trying several brands and varieties of feline food, I decided to give this variety pack a go.  Well, to my surprise Crystal lit into the flavor like it was "manna from heaven."  Thinking that this might be a fluke, I changed flavors for her next meal and she "attacked" this one with the same fervor.  I knew then that this was the brand for her.<br /><br />And based on her MEOW-valous reaction, I can recommend the variety pack.
