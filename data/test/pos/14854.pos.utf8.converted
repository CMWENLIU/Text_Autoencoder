I recieved these prayer plants 3 days before i was supposed to, and a few of the leaves were broke, but other then that they were in great condition. I ordered these plants because my husband said that they were beautiful plants. I just did not know how pretty they would be till I recieved these plants. I would deffinatly order from them again, if there ever was another plant that i could not find in my area. The pictures just do not do them justice. They are just beautiful. I can't wait to see how big they actually get.
