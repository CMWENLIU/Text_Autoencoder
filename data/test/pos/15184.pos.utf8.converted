On acreage in California that has been untouched for close to a century,<br />this is the only product that abates the poison oak and non-native brooms.<br /><br />I use the tank sprayer and only spray the offenders.  It works and the other native plants are lush and hardy, now.  (The non-native brooms can actually choke a forest.)
