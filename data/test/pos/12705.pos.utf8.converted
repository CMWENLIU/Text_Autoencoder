BB's shredded jerky is a great way to introduce vegans to the joys of dried beef.  "But wait!" You say. "I'm a vegan and I don't eat meat."  That's okay, because this is high quality beef.  The Ulinov household keeps a strict vegan diet while working in beef, chicken or pork (sometimes fish) in order to have a well-rounded, diverse diet.<br /><br />Consuming organic beef jerky is just like keeping vegan since it is organic.  While BB's is not organic, it is a good starting place since you don't want to jump into organic beef right away -- work slowly into it.  Invite your favorite vegetarian neighor over, put this in a casserole and tell them that it is seaweed.  Then later on inform them that they ate a cute little cow and watch their reaction.  They will be pleasantly surprised.
