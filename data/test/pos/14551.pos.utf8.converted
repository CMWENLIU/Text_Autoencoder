I started using this product at the recommendation of the HCG Diet. The liquid form is better than the packets on the market because those use a chemical to freeze dry it to powder.  This product has no chemicals at all. I have given up all other artificial sweetners and have been using liquid Stevia for a few months now and absolutely love it.  I order these larger bottles because it's the best deal out there.  I pour a little bit in a smaller glass dispencer and take it with me where ever I go. The first time I ordered this I received it in a few days, but the 2nd time it took a little over a week so next time I'll order earlier if I'm running low. I convinced my mother, who is diabetic, to start using Stevia and she loves it.
