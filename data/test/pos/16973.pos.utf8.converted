I bought Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein Powder and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E23VXW">Living Harvest Organic Hemp Protein Powder, Original Flavor, 16-Ounce Plastic Container</a> to compare the two. The latter is slightly more expensive, but doesn't seem to be worth the price.<br /><br />As others have said, the Nutiva powder mixes very easily and compared to Living Harvest's, it's far less grainy and bitter. I mix it with warmed soy milk and sugar and find it very delicious w/out added fruits or juices, despite other comments that say the taste isn't all that great. I've noticed, though, that if I mix it and drink it hours later, or make a batch for the following day, it tastes slightly bitter, so it's better when it's made fresh.<br /><br />I finished my 16 oz. container in a week because I couldn't stop drinking it. I'm working on the Living Harvest powder just for comparison, but I'm pretty sure I'll be sticking with Nutiva. It's cheaper, more finely ground, and less bitter. Once I'm done with Living Harvest, I'll be buying the 3 lbs bag.
