A little while back, no one had ever heard of chipotle, other than the people who make them.  Then suddenly the dam burst and chipotle came flooding into our land like a spicy tide.  We all love those smokey peppers, and at this point there really isn't anything you can't get with chipotle in it.  Chipotle peanut butter, chipotle caramel corn, chipotle coffee beans... we have been inundated by chipotle.<br /><br />So you might think that this is just another chipotle hot sauce.  How quaint, you think, a chipotle product that actually seems like it should have chipotle in it.  You look at your friends and you all say "Hey, let's be retro and buy some chipotle hot sauce."  You buy a bottle, take it home, and put some on your microwave burrito while watching Championship Poker on ESPN.<br /><br />Suddenly your eyes widen, your burrito slips from your hands, and you rise, zombie-like, all thoughts of televised card games forgotten.  For you see, this stuff is much better than "just another chipotle" hot sauce.  If that's what you're looking for, there are plenty out there, usually overpriced and drab.  This stuff is totally different.<br /><br />The taste sensation is difficult to describe.  It's spicy, very spicy, but the burn is coated with a sweet smokey flavor that makes you eat far too much of it before you realize your throat has burst into flames.  And I say sweet because I mean it.  It's sweet, like chipotle honey, not bitter as many hot sauces based in vinegar (which is great too, just different) are.<br /><br />And by gum, it's good on microwave burritos.  You don't have to live in shame.  Pour it on.  If you can find it in a store, it's cheap too.  What more can you ask for?  Buy it now!  Do it!
