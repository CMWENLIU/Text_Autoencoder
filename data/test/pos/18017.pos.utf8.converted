These organic wheat berries are of excellent quality. They come in a plastic pouch that is resealable (not with a zip-lock, but rather a piece of resealable tape. You have to fold the top folds of the bag down, but it works). I cook mine in vegetable broth with some curry and turmeric for added flavor, color and anti-inflammation benefits. I usually add them to my salads for some extra texture and fiber. I'm very pleased with this stuff.
