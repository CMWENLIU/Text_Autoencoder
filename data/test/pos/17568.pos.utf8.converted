This is my favorite tea.  I love it.  It has a hint of honey to it and it's quite tasty.  I love the fact that's completely herbal (no caffeine) and doesn't taste like herbs or flowers, etc.  It tastes like tea and that's one thing I was missing from herbal tea.  I missed the taste of tea and I get it with this product without the caffeine.  I can't ask for more than that from a tea.
