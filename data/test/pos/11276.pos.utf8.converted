This is a review of the pomegranate/mango infusion version.<br /><br />The product ingredients are much better than what appears in Amazon's product blurb.  The blurb makes it sound like it's sugar (cane juice) with pomegranate and mango added.<br /><br />In fact the ingredients are:<br />(1- proteins) Organic rice protein, organic hemp protein: 15,000mg<br />(2- greens) Organic wheat grass, organic kale, organic barley grass, organic alfalfa: 3,100mg<br />(3-antioxidants) Organic acai, organic carrot, organic blueberry, organic goji, Organic rose hips, organic maca, organic banana: 2,800mg<br />(4-other healthy stuff) Organic flax seed powder: 500mg, plus a small amount of probiotics<br />(5-other not-necessarily-healthy stuff) Organic cane juice, organic guar gum, natural flavors<br /><br />This is a good product to try if you want to get some of the benefits of wheat grass, kale, barley grass, etc. but tend to gag on the grass powders.  You won't gag on this.<br /><br />If you want to work up to the wheat grass, just add a little bit of that to a big scoop of this pomegranate/mango infusion and then work your way up.<br /><br />I add this to my dogs' food as a supplement.  They all love this pomegranate/mango taste.  This one lingers on their breath and makes them smell really good for a couple of hours after eating.
