My three year old daughter and her friends love Veggie Booty.  While it's not my personal favorite (the powdered spinach, kale, and carrot are a little weird for my palate, though my husband likes it pretty well), a bowl of it brings toddlers running like pigs to the trough.  A bag will feed about six hungry snackers, and you can feel pretty good about it, since it is made with natural ingredients, and is a good source of green stuff.
