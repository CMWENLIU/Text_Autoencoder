Having spent most of my life in the Southwest I am very picky about my Mexican food.  For a canned sauce I would rate this the best of the no-transfat sauces.  It has a full flavor that isn't overbearing.  The can says to use it for four enchiladas but I get 8 - 10 out of a 10 oz can.  If you want a great salsa to go with it definitely try La Victoria's Salsa Suprema.
