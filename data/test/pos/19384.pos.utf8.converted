I was a little worried about this one because of a bad (weak coffee) experience w/ the My K-Cup, but this product worked remarkably well!  I didn't think it was difficult to clean using the spray nozzle on the faucet.  Also, be careful not to use super fine grounds (as suggested on the package).  They will plug up the mesh and result in a half brew of coffee so strong it can not be consumed!  Kirkland 100% Columbian-fine ground works well, however.
