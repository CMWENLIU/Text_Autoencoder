I tried a sample of this in Starbucks a few days ago.  I was surprised when they said exactly what it was.  I bought a package of it and drink it occasionally.  I love that I don't have to add milk or creamer.  I can drink it black and it's just the right sweetness.  It dissolves instantly in cold water with no grinds left behind.  I think any coffee drinker should try it at least once.  It's very good!
