This isn't your ordinary, boring, Lipton black tea.  It has a very unique flavor and aroma--what some call campfire, but to me is more leathery.  It's smooth and intense, without being overpowering, and is probably one of my top favorite teas.<br /><br />In short, you'll either love it or hate it.<br /><br />Be prepared to store this tea in a airtight container (a zip lock seems to work fine) if storing with other teas.  If not, your stash will take on the flavor and smell of the Lapsang.  I ruined a whole box of Lady Grey that way.
