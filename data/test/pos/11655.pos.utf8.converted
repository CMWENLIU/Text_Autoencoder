Normally, I don't like peanut butter but I LOVE Peter Pan peanut butter. I bought some Peter Pan peanut butter on sale at the grocery store as I figured my kids would love eating it. I tried a taste and thought WOW this is good stuff. And it is. I'd consider Peter Pan the Cadillac of peanut butter as it's so smooth and peanutty tasting. Tastes like eating peanuts out-of-hand except it's smooth, creamy thick and delicious. Oh, this is good!<br /><br />Highly recommend.
