We've been feeding our dogs BLUE products since they were puppies. We have two Boston Terriers; Boston's have notoriously sensitive digestive systems and are very prone to gas.  A diet without corn, wheat and soy (as well as no by-products) is best for them. (FYI- chicken by-products include head, feet, beaks, lungs, spleen, kidneys, brain, liver, stomach, bones, blood, intestines, and any other part of the carcass not fit for human consumption)  Our dogs LOVE it and I feel good feeding it to them.  I know that they are getting human grade foods; quality chicken, anti-oxidant rich fruits (blueberries,cranberries), healthy veggies (tomato,whole potatoes,sweet potatoes,peas,whole carrots) as well as high quality grains (brown rice,barley,oatmeal,rye,flaxseed).  BLUE also has glucosamine for healthy joints; sunflower & fish oils for a natural source of Omega 3 & 6 fatty acids. Essential amino acids (L-carnitine and L-lysine) for fat metabolism, calcium absorption and the building of muscle. The BLUE-exclusive Life Source Bits have vitamins, minerals and holistic supplements like rosemary, garlic, kelp, dried parsley, alfalfa meal, yucca, turmeric and chicory root. BLUE also adds healthy digestion-promoting cultures - lactobacillus, acidophilus, Bacilus subtilis and enterococcus faecium. Dogs love it and it's good for them - what else could you ask for?  (It's also available in an economical 30 lb. bag, too.)
