This Sharp Provolone cheese is soooooo good. I have always been partial to the provolone cheese when I buy it at the deli in the grocery store, but that is Mild Provolone. When I saw that 'For The Gourmet' had Sharp Provolone on their list of available purchases, I was intrigued. I tried it, and boy, am I glad I did. I think it is much better than Parmesan in the tangy-ness and strong-ness you can get from just about any cheese. I think I even like it better than an extra sharp, or seriously sharp cheddar cheese. Although, those are really good, too. It ads so much flavor and you don't have to use much of it. That is why I like Parmesan, but Pramesan is so much harder and dryer. This will melt much better. Don't hesitate to try it. It is really delicious.
