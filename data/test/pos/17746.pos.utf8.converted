They're for eating, of course (ok, maybe if you're an oat farmer, you have a different persepctive.)  At any rate, rather than argue the relative virtues of rolled vs. steel cut oat cereals, I sing the praises of both.  Maybe it's a seasonal thing, the somewhat coarser, nuttier, rougher steel cuts somehow more fitting to cold winters than are the mellower and softer rolled oats.  It's like black coffee to an au lait, dark beer to light, hard bebop to cool jazz...you get the picture.<br /><br />You'll also feel virtuous spending some old-fashioned time over the stove (albeit not that much, or that arduous).  The warming experience is itself sufficient, you'll feel like mending a fence somewhere (or tearing it down if in a RObert Frost frame of mind), but it's common to top this<br /><br />with contrasting fruit, or perhaps nuts, syrups, flax seed oil, brown sugar, yoghurt, raisins, prunes, lat night's stew?--it's HEARTY enough to stand up to almost anything you can throw at it.  Your doctor will probably extol the nutritional benefits: Fiber, protein, certain vitamins, etc.  McCann's is the best of the bunch, and yes, that is a can that belongs in the Smithsonian--or its Irish equivalent. Hebridean soul food.
