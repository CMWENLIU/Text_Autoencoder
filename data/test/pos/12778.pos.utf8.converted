Upon the initial pet food recall news, I immediately began my investigation into the healthiest food choices for my pets.  Although I am already diligent as a pet parent of eight, and none of the foods we use were recalled, I still felt I wanted to go even MORE natural.  In doing this research, I found out that not only does Newman's company make salad dressing, as we all know, but ALSO a VAST variety of human and pet treats as well! :)<br /><br />I got a great deal through Amazon on this pack of six bags, so I got two flavors and sizes for my dogs.  They are ALL natural, and when you touch them yourself and feel the texture, and see the actual oats and cheese or whatnot for yourself, you will be so happy you are feeding them to your pet instead of crap food.  People have no idea just how awful most name brand pet food is and that it is really like the equivalent of feeding junk food to their kids for every meal.  But it's not our faults when pet food companies are abusing our trust.<br /><br />Get these treats.  You and your pets will be healthier for it . . . physically, mentally, spiritually.
