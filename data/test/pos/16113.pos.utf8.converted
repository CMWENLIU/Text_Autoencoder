I am still trying to figure out what kind of licorice the one bad reviewer is looking for, as I have been eating black licorice for 60 years and this is by far<br />the best to date.  My love of Molasses started from the days we used to hang around the milk farms and dip into the cow licks.  It is not the standard twisted type which stopped being good many years ago when they started bringing in the red and chocolate (of all things), and did away with the Molasses in the black.<br />This is black licorice, for the connoisseur that will only accept to best.<br />The bars are solid and I personally can only handle a couple at a time; no finishing<br />half a bag of twists like we used to.<br />This is not a light snack, but a full mouth experience.<br />It took me a few years to find this product. After being disappointed with hard twist licorice in the stores, I just stopped eating it for many years.
