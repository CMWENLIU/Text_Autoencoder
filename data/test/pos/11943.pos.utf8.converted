I'm giving this 5 stars but only if you're experienced in handling a really slack, soft dough and because it's so complete, authentic and VERY good tasting.  It really should only give it 4 stars because the yeast was dead - so proof it before you rely on it!  I put it in my bread machine on the 'dough' cycle and when it got all done and ready to form, it was flat as a flitter.  It was late at night so I just got out a teaspoon of my own SAF yeast and started it over - other brands would need 2 teaspoons.  I let it run long enough to get really mixed in, stopped the machine, dumped the really sticky dough from the pan into a quart sized (un-oiled) zip top bag and tossed it in the fridge until the following evening.  I would recommend that everyone give it an overnight rest in the fridge.  The dough wasn't nearly as sticky and was a 'piece of cake' to handle, albeit, I don't recommend making it in a hot kitchen.  The dough is easier to work with in a cool environment.  Keep just a light dusting of flour on your surface being careful not to work in too much extra flour...when you're rolling it out and it keeps shrinking back, just let it rest there on your dough board for 10 minutes and roll it out some more, rest again, until you get it rolled out.  I didn't get it to measurements - I stopped at about 12"X18" and it still ended up being a lot longer as I rolled it up.<br /><br />I suggest to definitely use the cream cheese and lightly toasted chopped pecans then dust with the praline sugar that's included in the package.  It could use more than an 8oz. pkg. of cream cheese, I think.  As you roll it up, sorta pull it toward you as you roll so you can roll it up fairly tight and get lots of swirls in it when you cut it.  It's real easy to make it into a circle and put the two ends together...kinda push one end up into the other one and just stretch the other end dough over it and you can hardly find the seam!<br /><br />I baked it on a parchment lined 13" pizza pan.  Form it on your work surface and move it to the pan, get it as round and even as you can - brush with egg wash - 1 egg and whisk in a tablespoon of water. Put a cup of water in your microwave and let it boil.  Quickly but carefully take the cup out of the oven and put your cake in there and close the door and you've got a perfect environment for it to raise - don't open the door until it's raised big and puffy.  It gets a lot bigger than you'd think!  It completely filled the 13" pan to the edges.  Watch it as it bakes and if it gets brown on top, make a circle out of foil and just set it lightly over the top and it'll continue to brown the sides without overdoing the top.<br /><br />It says to use 1 1/2 tablespoons of vanilla or water to make the glaze.  Unless you have white vanilla, use water.  Regular vanilla turned it yucky tan and I tossed it and made my own with just water.  The cake is blooming with flavor so you don't really need the vanilla essence in the glaze.<br /><br />I had never seen, eaten, made nor even heard of a King Cake before.  I have dear friends that met in New Orleans and wanted to surprise them out here in Arizona in the middle of September with a king cake for their birthdays...and a surprise it was!  He asked me if I was surprised that he knew that it was a king cake and I said no because you lived in New Orleans, were YOU surprised that I knew what one was!  They were flabbergasted to say the least - and blown away when I told them there was a baby Jesus in it (under it), too!  I will order more mixes and make them for the holidays and during Mardi Gras - and any other time I want to impress!<br /><br />When you look at your huge, beautiful, unique cake, you'll definitely see that it's totally worth the $7-$8 you have in it!  My brother in Georgia sends me pecans fresh off his tree so I don't have to buy pecans.  He even takes them somewhere and gets them shelled and sorted!  Lots of rain in the south this year so there should be an abundance of pecans!<br /><br />So, try it, you'll be really glad that you have to buy 2 when you order from Amazon!
