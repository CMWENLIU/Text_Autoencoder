Most of the K-Cup strong brews really aren't very strong when you compare them to Starbucks, and some of them are even rather weak. The Lake & Lodge brew is actually quite good for a  bold K-Cup coffee. I've tried the Timothy's brand but I think this is better. I'm basing this on a 6 ounce serving since some of the Keurig coffee makers can make different sized cups of coffee. Enjoy!
