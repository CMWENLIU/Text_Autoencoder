Like most people, I was skeptical about trying Frooties.  I read a lot of articles about the product and watched many You Tube videos.  Curiosity finally got the best of me and I placed my order.  My order arrived today.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that they included a free Frootie in with my invoice as a thank you.<br /><br />I started by lining up a host of items: Lime wedges, Lemon Wedges, Star Fruit slices, Pure Vitamin C powder (incredibly sour), Plain Greek Yogurt, Sour Cream, Brussels Sprouts, Red Wine Vinegar, Tabasco Sauce & Vodka.<br /><br />I popped my Frootie in my mouth and swished it around for about 3 minutes.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to swallow my saliva so I just held it in my mouth the whole time then spit when I was done.<br /><br />First, the lemon wedge.  I took a bite and my eyes lit up.  It tasted like a lemon that someone had rolled in powdered sugar.  It was sublime.<br /><br />Next I tried the Lime wedge.  Again, you taste the lime but it tastes like a lime candy.  I started laughing.<br /><br />The Star Fruit tasted almost like a soft apple.  It was sweet and had a mild crunch.  I ended up eating about 4 slices of that.<br /><br />I mixed the vitamin c powder into a glass of water.  When I took a mouthful, I naturally expected a very sour taste.  Instead, it tasted like a light lemonade.  I was so curious that I actually stuck my finger directly into the Vitamin C powder and tasted it.  It tasted like a Pixi Stick.<br /><br />The Greek yogurt tasted tart still, but had a very pleasant sweet taste.<br /><br />What surprised me the most was the sour cream.  It tasted like a really creamy frosting...hard to explain but I had 3 teaspoons of it!<br /><br />The Brussels sprouts tasted like chestnuts.  I really enjoyed their flavor.<br /><br />The Tabasco sauce almost tasted like a V8 juice EXCEPT the tip of your tongue can still sense the heat.  So it was sweet, but the tip of my tongue told me otherwise.  I now realize why people shake it onto their tongue in the videos.<br /><br />The red wine vinegar still smelled very much like vinegar as I brought it to my mouth.  I had a hard time with that one.  But when it hit my tongue, it tasted like a port.  It is nothing I would drink, but I had to take a sip out of curiosity.<br /><br />At this point I was starting to worry that my stomach was going to pay me back, but it felt completely fine.  I journeyed on and tried a small sip of vodka, which simply tasted like water.  There wasn't much of a taste.  I imagine if you squeezed lemon juice into it, you would probably have a fantastic "lemon-drop".<br /><br />After my tasting spree I cleaned everything up, got a glass of water and went into the other room.  About 1 hour later I found myself going back to see what a Brussels sprout tastes like without the frootie.  I bit into one and it still tasted like a roasted chestnut.  To check myself I bit a small wedge of lime and it too still tasted like lime candy.  The effect was still working after more than one hour.<br /><br />I got online to order another package because I have organized a "Flavor Tripping Party" which is what these parties are called when you pop a frootie and serve all these bizarre foods.<br /><br />If you've got an adventurous spirit, give them a try.<br /><br />I hope my ramblings have helped answer someone's questions and motivated someone else to give them a try.
