I buy organic when possible and have been a fan of McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal for years, but saw the reviews for Country Choice here by Amazon customers and noticed it was a winner in Cooking Illustrated ratings, and I decided to try it.  I found no discerning difference in the flavor....oats are oats....but the price point on the Country Choice makes it the clear winner IMO.
