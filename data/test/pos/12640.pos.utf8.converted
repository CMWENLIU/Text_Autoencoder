I bought this for my wife on our nineteenth anniversary (please don't tell her I told you that). It arrived well ahead of schedule giving me time to unbox it, hide it and prepare it for the big day. When she opened the box, she spend a good while reliving the summmer days from her youth enjoying these authentic treats.<br /><br />The candy is authentic, brand name, quality goods. The quantity is great. No cheap imitations or ridiculous knock-off as I've seen on other candy basket websites. This gift is a winner. It'll make you a hero and your gift comes later.
