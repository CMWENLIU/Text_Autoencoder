Best of all, it can be used by those taking cholesterol medications and, if you don't want to use the meds (or can't), this might provide some help. They are tasty and full of plant statins, not medications.<br /><br />  I used them as directed but I don't think they'd work if you aren't also watching your diet and getting a minimum level of exercise - but perhaps they would. I work out 3 times a week (but not too intensely), watch my diet (but I'm not rigid, just common sense) and found these boosted the results I got.
