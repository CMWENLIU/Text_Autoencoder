I'll get back to you in thirty or forty years with an update  on the long term  health benefits. As for the more immediate claims, I give it five stars!<br />It has a wonderful taste, it's worth the price for that alone.<br />The vanilla is just right, delicate, but not overpowering.<br />As for being energizing,  after three cups I found it to be subtle. There was no noticeable, jumpy effect, but I didn't get a case of the mid-afternoon drowsies, either.<br />It made my work day go more smoothly, without calling attention to the fact that it was doing so.<br />This is a good tea to take to the office, for afternoon breaks, and it's much cheaper than the expensive cafeteria teas at work.
