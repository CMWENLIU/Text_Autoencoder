I have been to Thailand and this is the same rice that is available there. This is a great all purpose rice with a wonderful taste and cooks up easy and has a fantastic fragrance. I would highly recommend this rice and plan on buying more when this bag runs out.<br />One other thing, this is a big bag, but rice is good for you and not fattening. Try substituting rice for mashed potatoes or bread or other starches and eat and live healthier.
