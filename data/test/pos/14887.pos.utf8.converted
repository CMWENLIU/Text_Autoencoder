I enjoy corn-nuts from time to time, one day (while eating cornuts) i decided to see if i can buy them in bulk to save a couple of Dollars. Fortunately amazon.com had most of the flavors online in a convenient 12 pack, and these are the 4oz bags which are almost a meal alone. The packaging was in a corn-nuts box with a cutout for easy access. Plus you can use the subscribe and save feature of amazon.com and save even more money.  Great product great service.
