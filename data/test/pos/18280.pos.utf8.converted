Since my elderly cat has started eating a wet food diet, she's become extremely finicky. She used to eat anything I'd put in front of her, until about a year ago when she decided nothing was good enough.  I'd been through every brand in the store...she doesn't like fish, plain chicken or lamb so my choices were limited.  When I found this, I gave it a try since she primarily likes beef. The ingredients were excellent and I read great reviews from Vets about it online.  She has been scarfing this food down from day 1 and still loves it. There are peas and carrots in it and the  consistency of it is very mushy. She likes it that way, so she doesn't have to chew much. I also noticed it doesn't dry out if there's any left in her bowl for several hours, like other brands have.  I definitely plan to continue giving this to her. I've been ordering on Amazon since it's been difficult to find it in my local pet stores lately.
