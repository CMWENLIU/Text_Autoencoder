Ok, let me start this review by stating that NO DOG FOOD WILL WORK FOR EVERY DOG.<br /><br />We have been bouncing around from food to food since Canidae sold their product to Diamond Dog Food.  We have tried everything from Eukanaba to Merrick to Innova, and Orijen has given us the best results.  Orijen has an excellent breeders program, in which if you are accepted you receive your 7th bag of food free.  This is a huge savings and brings the cost of Orijen down to near what most foods sold at PetCo or similar companies cost.  Also, we were hesitant to try Orijen or any grain free food for that matter because of all the claims of kidney issues.  Do your research, don't take my word for it, but protein is broken down in the liver, not the kidney -- claims that it causes kidney failure are grossly inaccurate.  Dogs with existing kidney issues may have a harder time excreting broken down protein, but that would affect all dog foods.  Remember, if your dog is sick, your vet puts the dog on chicken and rice or boiled hamburger and rice (these foods are rich in protein).<br /><br />Another interesting point is, we have bulldogs that we show.  These dogs are particularly, let's say, "beefy".  We were worried that this food would slim them down too much and make them not look like a show standard, but it did not.  2 cups/day is perfect for them.  Remember calories are not an exact science and your dog will not absorb every calorie from any dog food (thus why they poop), so don't be worried if you have to feed more or less of any particular food.<br /><br />Do your research, you won't find a better food, made with better ingredients than Orijen for anywhere close to this price.  EVO is much more massively produced, and its meat ingredients are purchased, not raised by the company like Orijens.  Never preserved, never frozen, fresh meat is what Orijen is about.
