If you use a large amount of sundried tomatoes (for pesto, salads, pastas, whatever), you cannot beat this price.<br /><br />When shopping for sun-dried tomatoes there are generally the kind that are moist-dry (as these are). They are plump, slightly juicy, but have a concentrated tomato flavor.<br />Others are leather-dry and more shelf stable, but have to be slightly rehydrated before using them.<br /><br />These are milder tasting than some, but still have excellent flavor.  If you need "strips" for a recipe you can easily cut these with kitchen shears or add to pesto to make a fabulous pizza or pasta sauce.<br /><br />They are not the kind that are soaked in oil, which is favorable in my opinion. It makes them easily to work with and lower in fat for healthy cooking. It is rare to find a "dried" tomato this juicy without being soaked in oil.<br /><br />They do require refrigeration after you open them, so you may want to consider sharing a bag with a cooking friend because of the sheer volume.
