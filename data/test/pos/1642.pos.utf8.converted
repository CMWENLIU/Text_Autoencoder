I have a neighbor who insists that, evolutionally speaking, dogs were "meant to eat meat," and that this dry dog food just can't be good for our Golden.  I suppose by meat, be means "red meat," because Newman's Own Organics has Chicken, Chicken Meal, and Chicken Fat, to go along with all those vegetables and grains that he disdains.  Our vet recommends this kind of dog food (although not specifically Newman's), because of its reduced fat.  Golden Retrievers, and many other breeders, can gain weight pretty easily if you don't watch it, and dog food that reduces fat and calories is preferred by many ("California Naturals" is another good one).<br /><br />OK, so the dog doesn't approach this with nearly the enthusiasm as the beef jerky, steak strips, and who-knows-what-else the neighbor feeds her when we're away (and I do think some treats are nice sometimes), but our dog no longer has a weight problem.  It also helps if you believe in the benefits of organic (pesticide-free) food, both for health and nutritional reasons, and if you like to support the Newman's Own brand, which donates its profits--millions of dollars over the years form their growing line of foods.  Above all, don't believe the dog food commercials, ask your vet what he or she recommends for your beloved dog.<br /><br />Complete List of Ingredients, and Nutritional Information (from newmansownorganic.com, click on pet food).<br /><br />Organic Barley, Organic Rice, Organic Milo, Organic Oats, Chicken, Organic Ground Flax Seed , Chicken Meal, Organic Brown Rice, Chicken Fat (Naturally Stabilized with Mixed Tocopherols, Citric Acid and Rosemary), Organic Carrots, Organic Potatoes, Calcium Phosphate, Sea Salt, Potassium Chloride, Kelp, Parsley, Dehydrated Lactobacillus Acidophilus Fermentation Product, Dehydrated Bacillus Subtilis Fermentation Product, Dehydrated Bifidobacterium Thermophilum Fermentation Product, Dehydrated Bifidobacterium Longum Fermentation Product, Dehydrated Enterococcus Faecium Fermentation Product, Zinc Amino Acid Complex (Source of Chelated Zinc), Choline Chloride, Iron Amino Acid Complex (Source of Chelated Iron), Vitamin E Supplement, Manganese Amino Acid Complex (Source of Chelated Manganese), Copper Amino Acid Complex (Source of Chelated Copper), Vitamin B12 Supplement, Vitamin A Acetate, Calcium Ascorbate, Niacin, Calcium Pantothenate, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Riboflavin, Folic Acid, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Hydrochloride, Biotin, Cobalt Proteinate (Source of Chelated Cobalt), Potassium Iodide, Menadione Dimethylpyrimidinol Bisulfite (Source of Vitamin K Activity), Sodium Selenite.<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein................18.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat........................8.0% (min)<br />Crude Fiber.....................5.5% (max)<br />Moisture........................10.0% (max)
