Well, the title says it all. I grew up eating this kind of tuna and since I've been in the US (2003) I've had to bring it from home.  The tuna found in grocery stores here in the US tastes very different; it almost has no taste. My wife (an American) could not understand why I insisted on home tuna until she had it. Now, there is no going back for her either. The flavor is rich and the meat is not just shreds. Enjoy...
