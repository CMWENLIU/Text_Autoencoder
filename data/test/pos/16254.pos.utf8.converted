This spice blend means we give you the best we got.  Zamouri is one of the most reliable and expert of shops on the web.  I usually try to make my own blends, but for tagine, I let these folks do the work.  My job is not letting it get stale.  Four ounces is plenty.  But I am a somewhat heavy user.  Go with two ounces.  The shelf life is about six months in the cool and dark before the power starts to fall off.<br /><br />They have cute little spice tagines like the one pictured, and many more in a variety of colors and styles.  But I am not good at presentation and I am happy with the jar it comes in.  Fish, chicken, cauliflower, turnip -- all good!  And you can go to the red side as well.  But I could not resist their large tagine, charcoal burner and bellows to do some outdoors.  High quality, tasty and fragrant.  I cannot find or produce the equal. Surrender.
