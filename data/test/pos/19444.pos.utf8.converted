When I lived in England I used to buy this brand of Blackcurrant juice and enjoyed it very much. I have tried other brands, which were ok, but this was the one I liked best.  I came back to North America and have had a hard time finding ANY black currant juice, let alone Ribena brand.  This juice is a good value too because it is concentrated, so you only use a little to mix with whatever you are drinking - water, cider, etc - or cooking with it.  Value from this shop is great, actually a little less expensive than the other store I found it at in Canada.  I was pleased with the shipping too, it was fast and well packaged.
