I just tried this mix for the first time today, as it took awhile for me to remember to buy buttermilk. It's quite tasty, but you can really taste the salt! I made it on my Villaware Belgian wafflemaker on setting 6, using 1/8 cup butter and 1/8 cup oil (recipe calls for 1/4 oil), and it came out dark-brown and crispy on outside and very moist on the inside - just delicious. Using two cups of the mix, I got about 5 waffles.<br /><br />I've also purchased the Carbon's Golden Malted waffle mix, which I've like, but I prefer Robby's because it's so much more flavorful - perhaps I should try buttermilk with the Golden Malted as well. The downside is Robby's calls for 1/4 cup of oil, while Golden Malted requires 2 tbs of butter - so if you're looking for something lower fat, you may want to look at the Golden Malted. By the way, I was surprised to see that the folks who make Carbon's Golden Malted make the Robby's mix as well.<br /><br />Tip: You can freeze buttermilk (just measure the correct amount and put in ziplock bags for the next go-around) to avoid wasting the leftover buttermilk....
