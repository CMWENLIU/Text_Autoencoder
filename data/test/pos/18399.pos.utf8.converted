I spent a lot of time researching premium puppy foods and settled on Wellness. I wanted a food that didn't contain corn or wheat and other non specific meat products. My 14 week old puppy had no trouble switching to Wellness, in fact she is no longer picking around her dry food like she was on the previous brand I bought. She hasn't been on it long enough for me to have noticed a change in condition or coat, but i'm confident it will. My only complaint is that the so called 're-sealable' bag doesn't actually reseal.
