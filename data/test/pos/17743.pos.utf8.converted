If you dislike oatmeal made from rolled oats, try this product. You will like it. If you like oatmeal made from rolled oats, try this product. You will LOVE it. You must cook this oatmeal for half an hour, so put it on before your shower. You can eat it plain if you make it thin, or you can add cream, half-and-half, whole milk, or 2% milk to thin it a bit. I also like it with a dollop of plain yogurt. Sweeten it with brown sugar or raw sugar, or just add dried fruit (dates and figs are my favorites - dried cherries are good also). Goes well also with a sprinkle of walnut pieces. But here is the best way to eat it -- better than dessert:<br /><br />Sweeten cooked oatmeal slightly with a modest amount of brown sugar, add just enough half-and-half to wet it thoroughly, and then add a healthy serving of fresh blueberries. Now THAT is some breakfast.
