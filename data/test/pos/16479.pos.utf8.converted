I was worried that 70% dark chocolate meant very bitter. I was totally wrong. What I found was smooth and sophisticated. A "grown-up" chocolate. The sweetness is very light but just right. Nibble it or just place it on your tongue and let it melt- either way is great.  I sometimes have just one small square and that satisfies my sweet craving. I refuse to spend my money on other brands now.
