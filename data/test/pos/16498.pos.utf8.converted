Best Peanut Butter EVER.  Natural, no hydrog. oils, taste like WC REESE cup! The stats are the same, 180 cals, per Tbsp, as reg peanut butter, but it is blended with some flavorings that make it OH SO delicious!!!  It is all natural, just crushed peanuts, really, with some flavoring, and homogenized so it doesn't really need to be stirred, which is often a turn off when buying the natural stuff.  I got a case of 6 for like 24 bucks on amazon, but now it is out of stock.  Wish they would get it back in, as I will go through about a case a month of this stuff.  Like to eat on a piece of toast after a hard workout.
