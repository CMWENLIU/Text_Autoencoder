I grew up with Brooks Tangy Ketchup in my home and anything else always seemed sub par. My preference for Brooks carried over into adulthood. When the local WalMart quit carrying Brooks Tangy Ketchup, I was able to get it at a local grocery. Although more expensive overall than WalMart, I would go to the local grocery explicitly to get Brooks Tangy Ketchup. Today I stopped in, and there was none on the shelf. I inquired and sadly, they no longer carry it. Upon returning home I immediately went to the internet and found it is still available. That's a good thing. But it is interesting to note that there is obviously a very loyal fan base for the product so why did it disappear from the grocery shelves?<br /><br />I hope it comes back to the grocery, but at least it is now available online.
