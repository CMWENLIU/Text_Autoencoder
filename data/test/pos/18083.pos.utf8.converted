I've been wanting to stop using sweetener in my coffee, but haven't been able to make the plunge back to sugar.  I was watching Dr Oz and he recommended coconut sap sugar and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BCD2GO">Madhava Organic Agave Nectar - Light, 46-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)</a> so I tried both.  I actually like both of them!  I can't decide which is better.  My husband uses half sugar and half coffee - so I was hoping this would be good for him since the Agave nectar makes his coffee taste like honey with the amount he feels he has to use...this container is pretty small to keep up with his coffee habit!  It would be great if we could purchase this in larger quantities! I will purchase again.
