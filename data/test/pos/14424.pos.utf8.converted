I've used these for hiking and kayaking camp cooking. Lighter in weight than a can and easier to pack, the resealable foil pouch makes it easy to use a portion and save the rest for later, or a handy place to put leftovers. I've also snacked on the uncooked chips right out of the bag, although they are a bit salty. I've cooked a whole bag in a Jetboil PCS, but I recommend going with smaller portions, unless you're REALLY hungry, or have several people to feed. One bag makes a heap of refried beans.
