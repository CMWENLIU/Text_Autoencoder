I've been a soft peppermint fan for years. I couldn't find my ususal peppermint choice and someone told me to try Red Bird. I can't thank them enough. This is by far superior to any other soft peppermint I've tried. The bulk packaging and individual wrapping (with its colorful red birds and USA flag on each wrapper) is top QUALITY. The candy is almost suspended inside the wrapper. When eating, the candy starts to disolve rapidly, then slows somewhat for the lingering peppermint effect. This candy also seems to have more peppermint flavor than other soft peppermints. My praise and thanks go to the Piedmont Candy Company in Lexington, NC for a job still well done.(Made in the USA since 1890)
