Manuka Honey 16+ is a "health" staple in our house. I began having digestive problems, and after taking medication for just a short period of time, decided I didn't want to just cover up a problem with drugs but to get to the root and heal the discomfort. While researching the internet, I came across manuka honey. And, after reading the many benefits of this honey, I decided to test its effectiveness...Within two weeks, I began to feel much better. When I first began taking it, I took one teaspoon a few times a day. Now that I'm feeling much better, I take one-half teaspoon of manuka honey a day. I now have no digestive problems. Manuka honey is a potent and healthy alternative for healthly living...
