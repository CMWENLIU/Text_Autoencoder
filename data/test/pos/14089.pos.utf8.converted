When I bought these online I was hoping they would be delicious. I got them in and immediatly made hot dogs for the family. With these buns I found they needed to be microwaved to really get a hot dog bun taste to them. However, what I found to be even better is that with the size they looked more like hoagies to me, so of course I had to make hoagies and steak and cheese sandwiches with these!!! I made the steak and cheese, then I put the sandwich together and into the oven. OMG!!! I will never buy anything else again!! I know some people just want hot dog buns, but I found a better use for them. My kids still love to have their hot dogs on these buns, but I prefer them for steak and cheese. I am happy and the kids are happy. Some people complain because these are not precut, ummm, so what!?! if you have a knife you can split them the way you want:) these are also great for making pizza. I know these are  hot dog buns, but I really dont like hot dogs so found other uses. again my kids love them with hot dogs!!
