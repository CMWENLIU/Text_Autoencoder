I am always looking for delicious ways to incorporate whole foods into my family's diet.<br />Since we began eating this rice, we finish the pot.  Everyone likes it.<br />We use a rice pot/warmer to cook it.<br />If you use this method, DO NOT follow the stove top instructions on the package.<br />The ratio that works best for a soft, drier rice is 1:1.5 rice to water.<br /><br />We have just finished our 6th bag and will continue with the Subscribe & Save subscription.<br />This rice is lovely in every way, and consistently so.<br />Perfect flavor, texture and no bits of unsifted matter.<br /><br />Village Harvest Organic Brown Jasmine is the best rice of it's kind.<br /><br />{{* *}}
