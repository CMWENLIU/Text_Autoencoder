I have the trap and am on the second sticky pad (the unit that I<br />bought came with two sticky pads).<br /><br />So, I bought the refill pack (which comes with three sticky pads).<br />I use my trap in the room that the dog sleeps in.  In the daytime,<br />the dog is not in the room, the room is made dark, blinds closed,<br />door closed, from morning till night.  The trap gets about 3-4<br />fleas per day and after a month that sticky pad looks disgusting<br />and coated with fleas.  The key for me is to keep the room dark<br />during the day and keep the dog out of the room. The trap is the<br />only source of warmth and light in the room and attracts the fleas.<br /><br />This is a terrible flea season where I live, and nothing in the<br />yard, or frontline on the dog seems to help.  I walk my dog every<br />day so he will always pick fleas up.  In addition to the trap<br />I've tried nemotodes in the yard and wet down the dog and flea<br />comb them off my dog and drown those fleas in soapy water about<br />two to three times per week. I've also got diatomaceous earth<br />rubbed into his bedding.  I vacuum frequently.<br /><br />This trap thing is great because its<br />no work compared to all the other things I do to fight fleas.<br />So I recommend buying these refills
