I've been using bonita as a treat for our cats for years. This brand of organic bonita looks to be human consumption quality. Be sure you know how much 2.5 ounces is...it is a lot! Bellyrubs' quality is high and most of the tuna is large flakes, not dusty crumbs. I expect to buy this once or twice a year for our cats. A few flakes and they are happy :)
