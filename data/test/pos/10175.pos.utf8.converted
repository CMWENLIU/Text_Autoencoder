I first discovered "golden syrup" in the beautiful green & gold tins. While not nearly as lovely on the shelf, the transparent plastic bottles are MUCH superior in measuring, pouring and storage. I found the tin imparted a nasty metallic taste to the syrup, if stored after opening.  So, I started substituting dark corn syrup whenever possible :(<br />Squeezing the syrup into a measuring spoon or cup is easier, tidier and more accurate than pouring or dipping.  No bitter off-taste and better unit price?  GREAT! I'm stocking up!
