My 9-year-old daughter has Type 1 diabetes and we could not find a bedtime snack that stabilized her overnight blood sugar - until her diabetes educator recommended the Extend Bar. It REALLY does what it claims to do - stops blood sugar from going too low overnight. Now my daughter does not have to eat a glucose tablet in the middle of the night to keep from going too low. Her morning headaches and shakiness are gone! If her bedtime blood sugar is 120, her fasting blood sugar is usually around 100. The bars do not cause a sharp spike in blood sugar, just as advertized. Although they don't taste like real granola bars (not as sweet or moist), all the peanut and chocolate varieties are tasty enough to satisfy a picky 9-year-old. Thank you, Extend Bar!<br /><br />UPDATE 12/2/2010:<br /><br />We tried all varieties of Extend Bar except the Mixed Berry. The "Delight" varieties work the best at stabilizing the blood sugar of a Type 1 diabetic, since they contain only 20-21 carbs, no sugar, and 4-6 grams of sugar alcohol:<br /><br />Chocolate Delight<br />Chocolate Peanut Delight<br />Peanut Delight<br /><br />The "Crunch" varieties contain 30 carbs, 10 grams sugar (!), and 5 grams of sugar alcohol - and they caused my diabetic daughter's blood sugar to spike overnight. I don't understand why the manufacturer included so much sugar! These are not a good choice for a Type 1 diabetic, although they might work for a mild Type II diabetic who still manufactures insulin:<br /><br />Chocolate Crunch<br />Peanut Butter Crunch<br /><br />No one liked the taste of the Apple Cinnamon variety.
