My adult cat has battled with IBS for years now. We've tried every variety of food from veterinarian prescribed to homemade to expensive brands. Nothing had helped him with his vomiting, diarrhea and even recent weight loss. I tried Natural Balance after reading some reviews and it has virtually solved his problems! I am so happy to have finally found a food that will keep him regular and healthy. Thank You!
