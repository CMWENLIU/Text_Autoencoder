Granted, this honey is on the pricey side, but I have to say it's more than worth it. My husband had been trying all kinds of ways to tame his ulcerative colitis for months, but the only thing that worked was this raw organic manuka honey. The only other things he used with it were a product call Sera Vera and some probiotics. He still needs to watch his diet somewhat, but he has not had loose stools or blood in his stools since he went on this raw organic Manuka honey and Sera Vera routine. Now, if he eats something that does not agree with him completely, he will get gas but no blood or diarrhea. This is a very big relief for both of us. We really wanted to avoid having him go on meds. That is just a vicious circle and we were aiming at curing rather than just controlling symptoms. We seem to be headed in the right direction as we are adding more and more foods back into his diet slowly and he is starting to gain his weight back. He loves the taste of the honey and not only eats it on its own, but also on toast several times a day. It has helped heal his gut, it stimulates his appetite, and it satisfies his cravings for sweets, which is great, because he is not eating any sugar at all right now, because sugar depresses the immune system.<br /><br />I have tasted the honey too and I love the taste. I am so glad we found this wonderful resource.
