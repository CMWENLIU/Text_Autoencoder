This is my first Amazon review and I had to do it for this AMAZING product. I was a little skeptical buying halal beef jerky from the internet. Wow was I in for a treat.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />Quickly Shipped<br /><br />Incredible Taste<br /><br />100% Halal<br /><br />Great texture and overall flavor of the meat<br /><br />Crushed red peppers add a lot of good spice<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Could offer larger quantities instead of just 3 oz.<br /><br />This product is great and you wont regret it, you'll know you've made the right decision when you first<br />put it into your mouth. YUM!
