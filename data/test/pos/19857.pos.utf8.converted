I have read about Fiber Gourmet, and specifically the Mac-mm-Cheese and I was very curious to try it out.  I mean, how good can this possibly be considering it is loaded with fiber and lower in calories.  Well, the answer to that question is pretty darn good.  In fact I just finished box number two in 3 days. The pasta has a nice al dente texture, and really tastes like pasta.  Infact, you could easily make this and not tell that picky eater that they are actually eating healthy, with all that fiber and low calories.<br />  Some people have said that they like to add cheese to this.  The first box I cooked I added a little to much milk and it made the cheese stick to the pot and not the pasta. Tonight, I did less milk,put a little smart balance, added half the cheese packet then mixed and put into two bowls. (one for me, one for the boyfriend who likes it too).  Then I split up the remainder of the cheese between the too, added a few more drops of milk, mixed, and then perfection.  No extra cheese needed because it was all on the pasta and almsot none in the pan.<br />  The price to buy direct is a little steep, because shipping is 5.99, so total cost for 6 boxes is 26.99 or 4.49 a box.  Amazon had the mac-mmm-Cheese for 6 boxes for 16.72 shipped,or 2.78 a box, so I jumped.  As soon as Amazon gets it back in stock, I am ordering.  I think I may be hooked. So if you are on the fence, just order it, you'll be glad you did.
