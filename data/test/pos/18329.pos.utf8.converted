Being an American, I think it is easy to not notice the treasure in your own backyard.<br /><br />I like coffee from Nordstroms and I didn't know what kind of coffee that was, except that it comes from Seattle.  I also like Carribou and can not stomach Starbucks.  I found that the Nabob Columbian from Canada rivals the Nordstrom cup extremely well. I was also suprised that the Maxwell House House Blend does the same thing.  You get 14 Nabob pods in a single pack and 16 Maxwell House.  I give this coffee 5 stars for the pleasant suprise in taste, convenience, and for the economics (Maxwell House brews a slightly larger cup than Nabob and is sold on Amazon with Holiday discounts).  Nabob is a richer, possibly more elegant brew, but for convenience I would grab the Maxwell House.  This leads me to believe, the Maxwell house espresso may also be good for my taste.<br /><br />My uncle retired from Maxwell House and they swear by the coffee.  So, if Canada believes in Nabob, I think Americans can support Maxwell House with the same pride.<br /><br />Gevalia makes a great Latte - golden, rich and creamy.  I prefer their latte over cappuccino because the cap has a stronger espresso brew and seems more skim than the latte - more froth in the cap though.  The cap is more chocolaty with a bite than creamy like the latte.  Gevalia Signature Blend coffee is too bitter for my palette.  Whatever your taste in coffee, I do think that it will be brewed to accuracy with Tassimo.  Just find your niche'.  If you like rich and aromatic, with little to no aftertaste, go for Maxhouse.  It you like it a little more rich and pleasantly aromatic with less in your cup, go to Tassimo Direct and get Nabob.<br /><br />This review is meant to support Maxwell House, Nabob, and the Gevalia Latte.  It should appeal to lightweight drinkers like me who prefer creamy, rich, and pleasant coffee that does not need to keep you awake to be considered good.  Although, the Gevalia Cap kept me up to 3:00am the first time I drank it.  I also scored over 1300 points on my daughters DS Lite/Big Brain Academy after drinking that thing.<br /><br />P.S.  I tried Seattle's Best, and no...not for my style.  But, none of the coffees are bad and they all brew perfectly.  I have tried the Gevalia espresso, I thought it was too bitter with no crema.  I am not an espresso drinker, so I didn't know what to look for.  I want to sample the 3 other espressos from Tassimo to see if others are more pleasant.  I am doing this only to see if I could recommend this machine to a true espresso drinker.
