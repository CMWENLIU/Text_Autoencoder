For those who, like myself, were thinking that pepper was pepper was pepper, well let me tell you, it's not true. Being something of an amateur gourmet I tried every marinade,spice, and rub under the sun for ribeyes, New York strips, filet mignon, etc., and I even tried your average salt and pepper, and it was all okay, but not a knockout. Then I tried Tellicherry Pepper and Sea Salt, all freshly-ground in my handy-dandy Graviti battery-powered peppermill (also something "you gotta love"!) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OLNC46">Trudeau Graviti Black Pepper Mill</a> Suddenly salt and pepper were once again the best things ever on a piece of meat. So simple, and this Tellicherry Pepper is what did it. TRY IT!!!!!!
