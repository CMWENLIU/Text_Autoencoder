This has got to be the most unappetizing picture of any "food product" I've ever seen on the 'net. For those die-hard veggies who think that this is cruelty at its worst, look at the bright side. This graphic image of a fluffy happy bunny being stripped of its fur, its head and its bowels, could be enough to push me to the veggie side of life and then forever abandon my occasional meat-eating tendencies.<br /><br />What will Amazon sell next? Uranium in a jar? Oh, never mind. They're already selling a handy one-use size jar of Uranium Ore 238 on this site for people who might choose to cook their bunnies in a conveniently sized mini-nuclear reactor. Hey, it's a swell idea for those fun folks who live off the grid in those isolated cabins high up in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest. You can have your well-cooked bunny and have it glow in the dark, too.<br /><br />God bless the internet.
