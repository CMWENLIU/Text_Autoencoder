I LOVE this product. It is reasonably priced when one considers each packet can be reconstituted to equal one cup of broth. The broth is organic with a rich flavor of chicken( I also use the beef broth & it is delicious as well) but my favorite feature is one may store the equivalent of 6 cans of broth in less space than one can takes up. A definite 5 stars from me. "Savory Choice" broth concentrates are the best!!!!
