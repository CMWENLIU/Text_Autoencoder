This was bought as a gift for my husband, who grew up in S.Africa. It is one of his favorite treats and it keeps him happy and quiet for hours! So, I do recommend this, even though I personally have never even tried it! That's because my husband loves it so much, he refuses to even let me taste any for fear I might love it and then eat it all myself!!!
