I've been taking this for a while.  I finished off my 4 pack of 28 ounces of Bob's Red Mill Soy Protein Powder and ordered a new batch just so I can take a bag with me on vacation.<br /><br />To me, there is no aftertaste involved with soy or this product.  That is coming from a vegan who loves tofu by the way.  I take this twice a day.  A scoop in the morning and a scoop at night.  I exercise regularly, am 5'9", 163lbs (target weight to go, 155), and don't use this as a meal replacement but as a dietary addition.<br /><br />In the morning, it's just a scoop, with a tablespoon of flax meal, and a teaspoon of sucralose.  At night, after my workouts, I take a scoop, tablespoon of flax meal, banana, strawberries, lemon juice, sucralose, ice....blend for one frickin awesome smoothie.<br /><br />Word of advice, don't try to mix soy protein powders with just a spoon.  You can pick up a mixer cup which has some type of aerator in it that mixes up the soy powder perfectly well and smooth, no lumps and no machines needed.  If you mix this with a fiber source like flax or psyllium, it adds a nice thickness or body to your shake.<br /><br />Natural, pure with no additives...it's the way to go.  Add whatever you like to it.  This is a protein powder and not a "replacement meal".  However, you can easily turn it into one if you know what you're doing. ;)
