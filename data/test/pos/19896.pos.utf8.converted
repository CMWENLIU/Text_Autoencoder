I am always looking to improve my family's diet and we are all chocolate lovers. We try to stay away from processed food and sugar as much as possible and incorporate more raw food into our everyday life. I love to put the nibs into our nut-milk shakes and today dessert was made by my kids (age 3 and 5) with little help using almonds with the nibs processed into powder. We added pitted dates, agave nectar, coconut oil, coconut flakes, some water and processed it until it bacame a thick paste. Made little bite size balls out of the paste and rolled them into coconut flakes. Yum! The kids loved it!Me too:)
