It cracks me up hearing people crying on here that the product "doesn't taste like hot chocolate".  Well duh, that's because it's hot WHITE chocolate which isn't actual chocolate, it is the cocoa butter that is produced when cocoa is made, then it is sweetened and made into whatever. The result is a creamier, sweeter and smoother taste which is NOTHING like actual chocolate, so unless you are a fan of white chocolate and are expecting this to taste like real chocolate you ARE going to be disappointed.  I am a a fan and love it and my K-cups, I have the platinum B-70 coffee maker so I can make a 6 ounce cup if I want it to be extra tasty or 8 ounce if I want it more mild.  I would suggest giving it a quick stir as all the flavor can somtimes settle.  It's delicious and for those of you who are giving this a bad review because it "doesn't taste like hot chocolate", it's not supposed to, stick to that gross Green Mountain Cocoa that tastes like choco-chalk water!
