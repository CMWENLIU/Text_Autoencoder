I will never eat a regular US kit kat bar again.  This is the best tasting candy bar I've had in a while...<br />Why is it the US's chocolate bars, usually made by Hershey's, tastes like it has wax in it???  I quit eating our chocolate YEARS ago.. it's just not the same.  :-(<br />This particular one from the UK, has a smooth texture, where you could almost swear you made the chocolate yourself.  Sooo Smooth and soooo much sweeter then the ones we have here in the US!<br />The other ones I would LOVE to try are from Japan. Something like 60 flavors.. Gotta get me some of those!!!<br />Anyway, give it a whirl, I know you'll love it too.<br />Cheers!!!
