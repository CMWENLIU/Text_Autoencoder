My wife says that I can cook two things - omelettes and popcorn...with popcorn being my best. We have always used popcorn from the grocery store but the Amish Country Lady Finger Popcorn is so far superior to the store bought. The flavor was so good you did not have to use butter and it was a delight to eat, both in taste and texture. The husk of the corn seemed to disappear and left almost nothing that you had to dig out from between you teeth. I give this product FIVE STARS. I look forward to trying the other style of popcorn they offer.
