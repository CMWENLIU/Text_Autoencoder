I just made my first dish with Miracle Noodles and I love them!  By themselves, they truly taste like nothing.  But, all I did was add a touch of butter, a bit of garlic powder, and few chunks of chicken breast and I had a pasta meal fit for queen!  YUM! I can only imagine the possibilities.<br /><br />I gave some to my hubby to eat, and he wanted more. He loves angel hair pasta and didn't even notice that these were a "different" kind of noodle.  It is filling, warm, and takes on the taste of what ever it is served with.  It has that satisfying toothiness of pasta that is cooked just barely beyond al dente.<br /><br />There are NO calories according to the nutritional informational.  So, for me, this is all the taste with none of the guilt.  We can have our pasta and eat it too.... just like that in that Meryl Streep movie, Defending Your Life.<br /><br />Cons:  The fishy smell before it is rinsed and cooked<br />  Preparation is a bit more intensive than regular pasta, but not bad<br />  Small packages (two very small pasta servings per package<br /><br />Pros:  Taste<br />  Texture<br />  no calories<br />  versatile<br />  can easily be passed off as "normal" pasta<br />  filling<br /><br />Overall.... this is a BIG FIVE!  I will buy it again.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CLCEDE">Miracle Noodle Shirataki Angel Hair Pasta, 7-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a>
