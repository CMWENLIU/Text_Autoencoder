Great quality food. I feed it to my 9 month old English Mastiff. This is one of the best dog foods on the market for large breeds. There aren't any nasty fillers in this food. All natural stuff, lots of healthy proteins and probiotics. I was using Nuturo and paying the same price at PetXX, and Nuturo doesn't hold a candle to TOTW. This is a premium dog food for a very reasonable price.
