My 14 year old toothless Siamese loves this stuff. She's pretty finicky but goes insane for chicken - this natural balance chicken & liver pate gets gummed right down. nomnomnom She gets a 6oz can per day and as much dry food as she cares to gum down.  She's been eating this since she was sick, and shes gained weight and her fur looks so much better.  My other cats get the dry version of this same Natures Balance - since they both have teeth.<br />Cat boxes will always stink but this stuff - compared to Friskies, etc., makes a huge difference in what comes out.
