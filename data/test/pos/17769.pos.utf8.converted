Homemakers on a tight budget, take note.<br />My little secrets for super, tasty and very economical breakfasts.<br />Take one egg, beat it well in a simple stainless bowl, thoroughly coat a portion (1 cup) of oatmeal. Using a large fry pan, with a little dab of earl, on medium to high heat, CONTINUOUSLY stir fry kernels until they are separate. Three to ten minutes, depending on the heat output of your stove.<br />To make it toothy, I add only a  tad over 3 cups of water. Ten minutes on the lowest heat (covered) and let it sit a few hours left to cool down. No point enriching the utility company and/or spoiling good food by making your fridge work past its capacity.<br />Important. Do not stir at all, period, basta, etc.<br />Having done so, creates a bit of a nice toothy textured meal.<br />Overnight in the icebox. Formula can be safely doubled for larger broods.<br />Garnish with maple syrup, honey, fruit etc. Use your imagination.<br />I generally stopped using white sugar almost 40 years ago. Although I am not an academic, and ain't gotten any degrees, empirically, it appears to me that white sugar avoidance does NOT kill you, it may even possibly be good for you. Use your good judgement and lead by example.<br />An exotic and excellent treat for children of all ages.<br />Heads and tails better than anything "Quaker".<br />BTW: This is the same way I prepare another of my favorite breakfast treats which should appeal to any good cook, namely , buckwheat (kasha).<br />A final comment, using Amazon auto reorder, this has to be one of the best and cheapest ways to provide a proper breakfast.<br />Enjoy and prosper.
