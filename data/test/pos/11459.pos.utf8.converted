These chips are simply heaven.<br /><br />If all the people - black, purple, orange, brown, white - if they all just sat around the table and ate these,  I swear my friend that peace will prevail. Prejudice will crumble. Tears will flow. Smiles will abound. And the world will be good-ish for at least a few days. Until these chips are replenished, then peace upon peace.
