When I went to Mardi gras 2008 I discovered this amazing drink concoction at Pat O'Brien's on Bourbon St. We drank these every day we were there (5 days) & couldn't get enough of them. If you like fruity drinks you will love these. When I was talking to the bartender I asked him what liquor I should put in this mix. He suggested either Bacardi 151 or Myers dark rum or a little mix of both. I highly suggest this mix it truly is the best & brings me back to bourbon st every time I drink one!
