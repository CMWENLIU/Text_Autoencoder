I am really thrilled with this product.  I wanted to be able to make oatmeal in my slow cooker so that it was warm and ready in the morning with no hassles. I have done so in the past with old fashioned rolled oats and the outcome was always less than satisfactory no matter what adjustments I made to the water/oats ratio.  This attempt turned out perfectly the very first time, which most likely has to do with the 'cut' of the grain.  The ratio is 1 cup oats to 4 cups water on low for 8 hours (and 1 cup of dried fruit).  I added about 1/4 cup of quinoa and a total of 1 1/4 cups dried fruit (craisins, tart cherries, and goji berries) and 1 good sized diced Braeburn apple...no sugars.  I didn't use the spray 'Pam' product it tells you to put in the crock, but coated it with organic coconut oil which is solid at room temperature.  It was amazing...no sweetening needed to enhance the flavors.  My husband eats oatmeal every day and he really liked it too.
