I've been purchasing loose tea from the local shops, but they never carried any breakfast varieties. So I began checking out decaf teas while browsing Amazon.com, and came across this fabulous breakfast tea! Even as writing this review, I'm enjoying a steaming cup of T of H's breakfast tea(with milk and sugar). As someone mentioned in this forum, it really does stand up to milk and sugsr!. I wish T of H had the decaf Irish and Scottish breakfast teas; I would be first in line to buy a case each! Thanks, T of H!!!!
