I have purchased this from the star place many times and here.  It is the same stuff.  The amount you use depends on how strong you like your chai.  I mix mine 1/2 and 1/2 with soy milk for a rich creamy warm wintery beverage.  Works great mixing in a blender as well for a cool creamy beverage (does seperate if you don't drink it fast enough, but a few swirls or shakes fixes that right up).  Add a little extra chai for stronger flavor.  Highly recommend!  One container makes anywhere from 3-8 glasses of chai for me.
