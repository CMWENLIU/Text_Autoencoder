This is wonderful Spelt, that I can mill into flour at home. There a a few other granaries  that offer Spelt that can be ground into flour at home. But they charge as much or more for the shipping and handling as they do the Spelt. This is not the case with Great River Organic Milling. The Spelt I received from Great River is wonderful, fresh, Grade AAA Spelt. I have been able to make wonderful bread, pie crusts and pasta with this Spelt. Thank you so very much Great River, for offering this product.
