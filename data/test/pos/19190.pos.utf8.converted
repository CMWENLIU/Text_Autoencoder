In my opinion, this is the best gluten-free flour in the market!  I've tried pretty much every type and I have never had a recipe fail using this flour cup per cup.  I take a regular recipe and use this flour, and the only change I make is to add more spices or more vanilla and baking soda or powder than a regular recipe calls for.  I've been buying this for a couple of years, and am so happy Amazon carries it now!!<br /><br />Donna Spencer
