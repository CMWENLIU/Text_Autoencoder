Great service in sending out the package...But this is the last time I will order from this Company and I will inform Amazon also. Like I said Great product, but why would you include my Home Tel # my address and what name I used to ship it????  These are things I do not share with the world...so now my private address, my phone and my wife's name are known. You really violated my personal sharing of information.  I would assume the personal note should have been enough information.  Thank you for the great selection of gifts but not for the issues you have cost me .I can see if the package was coming back to me but if it was undeliverable it would be returned to you????<br />Sorry I won't be a customer again.
