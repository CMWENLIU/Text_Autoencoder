I have been buying this tea for over 8 months now and I absolutely prefer it over any other beverage in the morning.  I started by making tea with it and now I simply put two teaspoons in my espresso machine and that's it!  The energy from this drink is nothing like caffeine, no sour stomach, no jitters, no anxiety, no racing heart, none of the bad stuff.  To top it off the nutritional value of coca tea is amazing as it contains many vitamins and minerals.  After drinking it for so long I appreciate the flavor and I add nothing to it.  Of course the BEST part of it all is how amazing it is at elevating mood.  All around this is one of the best products I've found this year and I hope Mr Avila is in business for as long as I'm around. :)  TRY IT YOU WILL LOVE IT!
