I use this stuff whenever I want to add a nice flavor profile to a meal. I add it to the skillet when I make omelets, hamburgers or saute veggies. A little goes a long way so I add canola oil to the skillet first and then add the garlic and parsley oil.  I also add it to my potato salad and it was lovely. Even a baked potato was improved with a little splash. Plus olive oil is good for your heart and skin. And garlic is good for you,too.
