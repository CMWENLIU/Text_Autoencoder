It's not always easy to find decaffeinated Constant Comment tea in the grocery store, and even if you do, it's a fairly pricy item. Finding this tea on Amazon has been a blessing. The price is a huge savings, and I no longer have to carefully ration my use of the teabags in fear that I'll run out and not be able to get more. If you're trying to avoid caffeine and think that means settling for less robust taste in your favorite hot beverages, try decaf Constant Comment. The blend of clove, orange, etc., in real tea (not herbal tea) tastes as good as it smells (which is very aromatherapeutic!).
