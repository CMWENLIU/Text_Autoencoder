I ordered this product after reading reviews from several hair boards.  I use it as a treatment along with other oils before I wash my hair.  I read reviews where people said that they could not handle the smell.  It's not that bad.  It reminds me of hair grease if that makes sense.  I've been using it consistently on each hair wash day and my hair is softer and a little more manageable.
