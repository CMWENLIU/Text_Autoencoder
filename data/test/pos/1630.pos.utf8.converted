The cookie part of these isn't sweet;  tastes just like an animal cracker.  The filling tastes just like Nutella,  I think it's a great flavor combination.  There are 25 packs of a dozen cookies each in the box.  Some nutritional info from the label:  serving size- 2 cookies,  calories-140,  trans fat-0,  saturated fat- 6g.<br /><br />OK, OK,  so these are not the most nutritious snack,  but come on!  They're cookies!  An occasional indulgence isn't going to hurt anyone.<br /><br />If you think you'll like the taste combination of animal crackers and Nutella,  then buy these.  If you are worried about saturated fat,  buy some fruit instead.
