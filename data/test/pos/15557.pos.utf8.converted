We have used Lipton tea bags for our tea just about as long as we've been married and that's a really long time!<br /><br />I discussed with my wife a reviewers comment about the strength of the tea and she said she had not noticed any change in tea strength. I'll admit we may let our tea steep a little longer than average but we've always done that and haven't noticed any changes in the tea.<br /><br />When we make ice tea, which is often seeing as how we live in the South, we use Lipton's Ice Tea blend in the larger bags instead of the smaller bags used here. My wife likes to compensate in advance for ice melting so she does make it strong.<br /><br />We have one opened box in our pantry and one unopened box in reserve. In addition to the regular black tea we also use Lipton's Green Tea and the Orange Spice for variety.<br /><br />All told we are happy with the Lipton products and have no plans to change.
