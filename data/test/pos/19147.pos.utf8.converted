Made in the USA, no by-products, no wheat gluten, no artificial flavors or colors.  The company is based in Albany, Oregon, a couple hours drive from where I live, and a portion of their proceeds goes to help pets in need.<br /><br />Obviously, my sheltie, Zoey, loves these treats.  They smell and look just like beef jerky made for humans... even I thought they smelled mouth-watering.  These Bit-O-Luv beef treats are a far better treat for your dog than most of the dog treat offerings in the grocery store.<br /><br />The only downside is in the ingredient list - my dog would've loved them just as much if they didn't have added sugar (dextrose and corn syrup).  She's fed a half kibble, half raw food diet, so she gets a lot of broccoli, cauliflower, green beans... low sugar, low calorie veggies, as a way to help her lose/maintain weight.  Even with exercise, it's easy for her to gain weight and hard for her to lose weight, so I'm lucky she looks at these veggies as yummy treats.  She's picky, and she will snub treats/foods.  I don't want her to get conditioned to sweet 'n' salty snacks (like I am!!) and start to look at her veggies as bland (like I do!!).<br /><br />So, these will be given sparingly to Zoey, couple times a week.  I think the salt is low enough on the ingredient list, but the dextrose and corn syrup seem to come too closely behind the beef and chicken.  My go-to treat for Zoey, given daily for all the little good things she does, will continue to be Zuke's Mini Naturals.  She loves the Zuke's Minis in all flavors, and there's no sweeteners.<br /><br />As a yummy treat only given once in a while, it's fine enough that I wouldn't knock a star off my rating.  Also, people with healthy, lean dogs who never gain an ounce won't mind if there's sweeteners.  In any case, in terms of quality, these Bit-O-Luv treats are still amongst the best, in my opinion.<br /><br />**From the package**<br /><br />"Ingredients:  Beef, chicken, dextrose, water, corn syrup, soy protein isolate, natural smoke flavor, salt, potassium sorbate (preservative), paprika oleoresin, and sodium nitrite (preservative).<br /><br />A percentage of our proceeds go to help four legged friends at local charities."
