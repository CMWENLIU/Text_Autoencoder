I recently began baking Red Velvet cakes and was surprised at the cost and difficulty of locating and buying single bottles of red food coloring for the cakes.  These cakes take two TABLESPOONS of food coloring per batch and when the batch is doubled, as I frequently do in order to make a four layer cake, the food coloring was becoming very costly.  I was only able to find single small (I think 2 oz bottles) of McCormick in the stores.  Maybe there are other places to purchase larger bottles but I am not aware of them.  I also purchased a couple boxes of multi-color food coloring from the Grocery Outlet and just used the red.  This no name brand imparted a slightly unpleasant flavor to the cake.  I was hesitant place an order for such a large quantity of Durkee without first testing it in the cake.  My concerns, however, were unwarranted!  I've made several cakes and they have been great.  This is the BEST deal I have found for purchasing red food coloring and now I don't have to pay $3.00 for a small bottle from which I can only bake one cake.
