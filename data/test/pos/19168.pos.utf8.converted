What I really love about this product is that it's compact yet holds 36 k-cups. Because of limited counter space I was able to stack one on top of the other and still slide them under my kitchen cabinets.Also,they were very sturdy one on top of the other.Looks  great next to the coffee maker.Would definitely recommend.
