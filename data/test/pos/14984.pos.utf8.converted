I like the medicinal taste of this honey as does my daughter.  My son won't touch it with a 10 foot pole.  A cold made the rounds through the family and the two honey users also caught the cold, but recovered more quickly.  Fluke?  Could be.  In any case, I like to have a bit of honey every day and this brand suits my fancy.  If it actually does some good, even better!
