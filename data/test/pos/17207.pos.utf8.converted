This was a cool basket of goodies. I wasn't sure what to expect honestly. There were two little packets of specialty flavor coffee, two different kinds of cheese sticks & cheese biscuits, a packet of cheese & spice dip, a box of spaghetti, chocolates, box of garlic crackers, and a can of cheese stuffed olives from Spain. Most everything seemed to be from Italy or Spain. The basket is a standard little woven job with cute leather handles. (It'll make a fine container for the trick or treat candies)<br /><br />The chocolate covered cherries were very rich and indulgent. The hazelnut mousse chocolates were extremely rich, everyone agreed though that the cherries were the best of the two items. The cheese straws were cheesy and not overly crunchy - tasted fresh. My father is an olive nut - he can tell the difference in types of olives under all circumstances and there is always some type of olive on his table. The can of cheese stuffed olives was good - he liked them, I find olives a tad salty normally, but these were quite nice. We haven't had a chance to make the coffee yet or cook the pasta, but if the other items are any indication, there won't be anything yucky in this basket. I would feel good sending one of these as a gift to family or friends.
