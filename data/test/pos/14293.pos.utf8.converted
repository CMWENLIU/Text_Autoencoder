I'm from Holland and have never gotten used to drinking the watered down, light coffees. So was happy to find the Senseo machine and was used to drinking the Senseo Hazelnut pods until they stopped smelling and tasting like hazelnut. I used to subscribe to get the lower price so either I received several bad batches (several boxes of 6 packages) or the Senseo coffee just isn't what it used to be. So, tried the Baronet and I'm hooked. The aroma that comes from the bag as soon as I open it: wonderfully hazel-nutty and the taste is excellent. Changed my subscription to Baronet.
