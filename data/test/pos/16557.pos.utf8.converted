I have been extremely happy with this Columela oil!  I use a tremendous amount of olive oil in my cooking and I do cook a lot for a lot of people.  For the price, you simply cannot beat this product.  Now I will be the first to admit that you can spend quite a lot of money and buy oil that is far superior to this particular product, but let's face it, in these days and times, cost is a factor!<br /><br />I would strongly suggest that you purchase a couple bottles of this oil and then a few various brands at your local supermarket and make a taste test.  You will be absolutely shocked at the difference.  There simply is no comparison.  This oil has a full taste and the fragrance is wonderful.  Unlike many of the supermarket varieties, you will find this Columela does not leave that particular yucky after taste you so often get.<br />I have shopped and shopped and have been unable to find this product in any store in our area (gulf coast) and have also checked several story in a few larger cities on the west coast...no luck!  Amazon is indeed doing us a big favor in offering this brand.
