I drink this Bigalow Cinnamon Stick Tea more than any other flavor and brand.  It is probably 4 out of every 5 tea bags that I use.  I have been a tea drinker for many years, and this is, by far, my favorite.  Very few of the major brands offer a cinnamon flavored tea in tea bags.  Whenever I have found them, I have tried them.  None are equal to Bigalow Cinnamon Stick.<br /><br />  These tea bags do not overwhelm you with a spicy flavor, as some others do.  The cinnamon is subtle, and adds to the smoothness of the quality black tea that is the basis of this brand.  I usually drink this tea hot and black.  But in the summer I add ice and sugar for a very refreshing and different iced tea.<br /><br />  Thank you Amazon for offering this hard to find tea in a six pack of boxes, at a discount price.
