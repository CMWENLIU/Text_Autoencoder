Love this stuff.  Saves plastic, a lot cheaper, can store a ton of it without taking up much pantry space.  If mixed properly/completely, it tastes just like what you get at the grocery store.  I can't see a downside to using the powdered Gatorade.  Just wish I could buy it locally to eliminate the negative environmental impact of shipping.
