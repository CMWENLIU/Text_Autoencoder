This is one of my favorite chai teas!  Since I hadn't seen preparation instructions either here or on Numi's website, I thought I would leave mine as a guide for first time chai preparers.<br /><br />Makes 1 cup in less than 10 minutes:<br /><br />1. Add 1 tsp of this tea to 4/5 of a cup of water.  Slowly bring to a boil (medium-high heat, should take a few minutes).<br />2. Add 2 Tbsp of sugar which should lower the temperature a bit, allow tea to come back to a boil for another minute or so.<br />3. Add 2/5 cup of milk (I use 2%, but whole is the best), allow tea to return to a boil (should take several more minutes).  NOTE: Keep an eye on this part, if the temperature is too high, the tea will easily rise up out of the container and make a giant mess when it returns to boiling :-).<br />4. Turn off the heat just as the tea starts to rise, and allow the contents to simmer for another minute or so.<br />5. Using the finest strainer you can find (there are some excellent stainless steel ones here on amazon), strain the loose tea from the drink and serve.<br /><br />There are all kinds of tricks to getting chai tea to taste the way you want ranging from adding fresh grated ginger during preparation to a little honey just prior to serving.  It's awfully hard to go wrong when you start with this tea but if it doesn't turn out exactly like you want, just tweak the ratios until it suits your tastes.
