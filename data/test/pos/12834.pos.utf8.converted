I've tried a lot of natural peanut butters, and I've tried a few commercial peanut butters as well, but Krema beats all of them for both taste and texture.  When I can't find it locally, I buy it on Amazon, and when it's not available on Amazon, I buy it from Krema directly.<br /><br />Commercial peanut butters are jam-packed with sugar, salt, and hydrogenated oil; but the peanut butters you find at most health-food stores tell you exactly why these additions seem necessary.  They're thick, dull, and tasteless, as though somone had tossed a pound of peanuts into a food processor and stuffed the result into a jar.  Krema peanut butter is the vibrant exception.  It always tastes fresh, and it stays spreadable whether you refrigerate it or keep it on a kitchen shelf.<br /><br />When you first open the jar, the oil has worked its way to the top, and it takes a few minutes to stir it in, but you only have to do that once.  And it's worth every second of the time and effort.  I prefer the crunchy variety, but the smooth version is just as good, and, with the addition of soy sauce, cayenne, lemon, and brown sugar, makes the best sauce for Anglo-Indian dishes I've ever found.<br /><br />Be careful, however.  Another company named Krema also makes peanut butter, and their product isn't nearly as good.  The Krema company you want has its plant in Ohio and has been operating since 1898; their peanut butter is also sold under the name Crazy Richard's, which is exactly the same product, but was branded differently for markets on the west coast.
