Good nutrition is very important to me, so feeding our 3 dogs a quality diet is a must. I've tried several different kinds of food, all supposedly high quality. None of them were organic, and it always bothered me. I eat an organic, raw food diet and am well aware of the important role good nutrition plays in one's health. I had looked at organic foods before and they were all too expensive. I came across Natural Balance one day when I was searching for an affordable organic food for my dogs. I researched it and decided to give it a try. My dogs loved it!! Within the first couple of weeks, I noticed their coats started to glisten and they seemed to be more energetic. Our lab mix has always had a sensitive digestive system...anytime I ever changed her food I had to very slowly mix in the new food to keep her from getting diarrhea and digestive upset. I am happy to say that with this food, she did not have any issues during the transition...I was able to get her switched over in record time. Now I realize it was never her digestive system that was causing the problem--it was the sub-par food we were buying for her :( We are now on our third bag of Natural Balance and have never been happier with a food choice. Their coats are shinier than ever! And...it's $10 cheaper than the "quality" food that came from the vet.
