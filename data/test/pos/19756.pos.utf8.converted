This coconut oil is perfect for soapmaking.  Anyone who has used coconut oil should know that it remains in a solid form if the temperature is under 76 degrees so I am not sure why that would be a negative.  I am also not concerned about the bottle;  it is perfectly sufficient.  I have also bought food grade lye from essential depot and the bottle does not have a problem holding that in so I'm not worried about the coconut oil leaking.  Overall it is a great product and fairly cheap for a large quantity of coconut oil.
