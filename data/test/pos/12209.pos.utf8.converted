I've been eating cookies for over 60 years (among other things) and these are the best I've ever tasted!<br /><br />Edit: I have bought these several times since and have found they aren't always the best I've ever tasted.  Maybe the first time was a particularly fresh batch.  But even the worst of them were still near the top of my list right up there with the New York Times version of the Toll House chocolate chip recipe.
