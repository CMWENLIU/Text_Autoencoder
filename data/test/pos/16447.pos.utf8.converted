I love Honeyville Blanched Almond Meal Flour!  Love it! If you haven't tried almond meal, then consider purshasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/158761345X">The Gluten-Free Almond Flour Cookbook</a>.  That should be sufficient inspiration.  Elana has the best recipes and it was via this book that I discovered almond meal.  Though not a true celiac, I do limit my gluten intake for various reasons.  However, I'm not inclined to purchase or injest many of the flour varieties that are advertised for gluten free cooking.  I like simple and easy and delicious.  Honeyville is a high quality product and the company is excellent with customer service.  Consdering price:  Unless you have a very large family, this flour goes a very long way.  I'm a single person who creates food "presents" for friends.  I keep some of the flour in the fridge, and the rest in the freezer, removing it just prior to use.  I find the cost to be extremely reasonable since it seems to go further than white flour would.  Also, this flour is all protein.  So healthy.  White flour is not all protein.  Not so healthy for many reasons. Try the recipes in Elana's book. Definitely try the Honeyville Blanched Almond Meal Flour.
