I have eaten these sausages for years.  The Armour brand, unlike Libby and Hormel, tastes good and doesn't give me an upset stomach.  For some reason, the supermarkets in this area, particularly Walmart in Klamath Falls, don't carry Armour any more.  I'm happy I found a source of supply, since I live in a remote, rural area.  The largest "city" in this area is less than 2,000 population.
