Just wanted to embellish my earlier endorsement of this product and the seller --<br /><br />As I write this, smacking my lips over a scrumptious Sunday brunch [Sept. 4, 2011] of these kippers, I wanted, again, to endorse the product. These are old-fashioned British [sorry you Scottish nationalists] kippers which at least in these parts one cannot find. Broiled with a little butter, Hungarian paprika and very thinly sliced onions, served right out of the oven with our own home-made Dark Russian Ryebread with a big glob of Philadelphia cream cheese, it is to die for!<br /><br />They are the real thing and at a reasonable price.<br /><br />Thanks, Dan. We will be back.
