VERY impressive aroma (fresh & a bit wild), impressive taste, impressive ingredients.  This food is way far above the rest of other premium foods.<br /><br />I very carefully read the ingredients of cat foods.  Some premium cat foods have blueberries listed as one of their ingredients, but only have the pumace--what's left after processing and it contains much pesticide residue.  This food has triple cranberries as antioxidents and urinary tract protection.  It has salmon, turkey and so many other holistic ingredients.  It is so gourmet blended that the aroma is heads above the other premium foods--I tried them all I think.  You don't get this aroma from other very premium foods--you don't get the total combination of aroma, taste and ingredients from any other cat food.  Please try it!  It even has an acidophilus culture blend--just awesome!!  Awesome!!<br /><br />Trust me on this cat food.  It is supreme in ALL WAYS!
