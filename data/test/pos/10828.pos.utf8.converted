I specifically chose this tea due to the fact that the price per ounce beat any tea blend or otherwise in my area.  Ounce per ounce of loose tea you simply couldn't beat the price... plus free shipping? I blend my herbals in my own concoctions and brew them in my infuser.  This is a finer grind than I am accustomed, but I solved that problem by shoving a coffee filter into my infuser before adding the tea.  It is not heavy, dark or woody at all.  It is light, fresh and almost sweet.  I love it with my chai blends as well as with the greys.<br /><br />As another reviewer stated, it is superb as an iced tea and I've begun blending for the purpose of brewing to ice.  I highly recommend not only this particular tea... but also the company.  Well packaged, though I do suggest repackaging for long term.  I would and will buy again!<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />PS - It's decaffienated!
