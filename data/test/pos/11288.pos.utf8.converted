I found this at Trader Joe's on the peanut butter aisle and after talking to a clerk who described it as being kind of like a light ginger bread wafer type of taste I thought, "Eh, I'll give it a go...."  He suggested putting it on a crumpet and so I got those too....(Ever hear them say don't shop hungry?).  Well, I am glad I tried it.  It is for sure junk food, it is made up of ground cookies and the taste is not too heavy on the ginger and spices, just a bit, in fact perfect if you ask me.  I like it on the crumpets but found they are to die for spread on an apple....I was afraid this was seasonal, but I understand from TJ's it is coming back, they are temporarily out of stock due to demand.  HURRY UP ALREADY!  Oh, also made Rice Krispie treats and put in approx. 1/4 c. in while the butter and marshmallows were melting and then sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top.  Too good!<br />The only thing I can think of as a drawback is if you can't stand a cookie crumb texture.  It is smooth like peanut butter but you do get little spots of cookie crumbs now and then, so some may say that gives the spread a gritty feel.  I myself love it and will buy a couple jars to have on hand.  Oh, and don't refrigerate!
