I am constantly on the lookout for "hydrogenated" (partially or otherwise) oils in my foods, and when I started making holiday candies for family last winter, finding baking chocolate was no different.<br /><br />I searched cheap brands like Nestle (whom I have humanitarian rights issues with anyhow) to the nicer brands like Ghiradelli, as well as the large blocks of chocolate bark in grocers' shelves.  Every single product except for this brand had hydrogenated oils, particularly in their white chocolate.<br /><br />So in addition to the reviewer who takes consideration to peanut processing, I like that this is hydrogenation-free.  It's the choice I make come the holidays.<br /><br />Best of luck in whatever chocolate you choose!
