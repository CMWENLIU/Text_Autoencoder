I am a college student and instant noodles are like the life line for everyone. I normally eat the small cup noodles (shrimp flavor) but I bought a pack of these because I felt that the normal cup noodles were too little and repetitive. At first I was not a big fan of the spicy flavor, but when I ate my second cup I realized how much more filling and better it was compared to the cup noodles. I mean sure they are like 2-3 times more expensive, but they are like 1.5-2 servings. Just be warned though, they are like a day's worth of sodium in each one. I never have these as a meal replacement, but just a midnight snack when I'm up studying. The spice also helps keep my awake which is a plus. I cant wait to try out some of the other flavors they have to offer. Definitely a must to have a pack of these in the house sitting around.
