I bought this product after my sister gave me a sample of the coconut oil she uses, and it left my skin looking much improved after 2 1/2 years of full-time work and full-time school (plus a husband and kids) left my face broken out from stress.  Coconut oil in general is amazing!  It has cleared up about 90% of my hormonal acne and after I wash my face and use the coconut oil, my face looks so healthy, glowing, and clean.  It seems to go against all sound advice to slather oil on your face, but it really works!  My husband even uses it each night after washing, and I've really noticed a change in his skin.  I have recently been using it on my entire body and have such soft skin (elbows and knees included).<br /><br />For this particular brand of coconut oil, it doesn't seem to be much different than the sample my sister gave me (which was a different brand).  There is a good bit in the jar.  It's pretty firm, so it's a little hard to dig out at first; but once your hands warm it up a little, it softens.  I dig out a small chunk and rub it between my palms.  It melts almost instantly and is ready to rub in.  This just seems to be the right way to take care of your skin as opposed to layering chemical after chemical in hopes that something, anything will work.
