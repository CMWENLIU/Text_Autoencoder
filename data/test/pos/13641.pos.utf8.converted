I'm excited to find these for sale on Amazon, and at a very reasonable price!  I just tried them for the first time a few days ago, and was wishing there was a nearby store that carried them.  Everyone I've given them to has liked them, even those who are not normally healthy eaters.  These crisps are reminiscent of puffy corn snacks (like cheetos), but with a different light flavor.  The calorie content is similar to other chip-type snacks (150 per serving), but these have the nutrition benefits of peas--protein (5g per serving), calcium (6% DV per serving), and iron (4% DV per serving).  I haven't tried the Ceasar flavor yet, but intend to do so in the near future. :)
