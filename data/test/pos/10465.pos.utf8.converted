I have been trying to replace my former supplier of single-origin coffee (which raised its shipping prices five fold!) here on Amazon, without too much luck up until now.  Can't say I didn't try.  I have 20 lbs of coffee; sinlge origin beans I love, BUT the roaster has maybe gone to roasting more than they can handle?  The beans taste burnt, leave a bitter after taste.<br />I had some qualms about ordering from coffee masters given the number of flavored coffees they carry, which generally indicates either inferior beans, or that they are producing for a clientele which does not know coffee.  Because of this I was wary of ordering and got this sampler, *hoping*, as noone had yet described the contents, that it would not contain any flavored coffee.  and, I am happy to report, it does not.<br />For those of you as baffled as I as to what is in the box, here it is:<br />Brazilian Santos<br />Columbian Huila<br />Costa rican Terrazu<br />Ethiopian (Mocha) Harrar<br />"euro Espresso" blend<br />French roast blend<br />Guatamalan "Amatitlan"<br />Hawaiian blend<br />Kenya AA<br />Louisiana blend<br />Mexican "Coatepec"<br />Sumatra Mandheeling<br /><br />Thus far i have only tried 2; the Ethiopian and thr Brazillian Santos, and, overall i am impressed,  It is beyond the shadow of a doubt the best of what I have purchased on Amazon, and I have read dozens and dozens of reviews to avoid getting another 5,10, 15 pound of mediocre burned coffee.<br />While the Ethiopian was not the very best I have had, it is right up there.<br />The Brazilian really surprised me.  I basically never buy light roast, do not like "weak" coffee, but this was most excellent; not weak but smooth, full, well rounded.  I am off to change my subscriptions.  I think I have found myself a roaster here at last!<br />and, now that I know what they can do will be ordering the whole bean., which I expect to be better still. (if it is the same, I will still be very happy)
