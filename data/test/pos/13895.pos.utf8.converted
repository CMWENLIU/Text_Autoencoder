This is the only kind of "cheese food" (as it used to be advertised) that I will eat.  But the price is now insanely too expensive (over $3/bottle after shipping as of 07/2009).  Since they moved to plastic bottles a couple years ago, I have empties coming out my ears.<br /><br />I have not been able to find this cheese, anywhere but Amazon since February 2009 (when I paid $2/bottle).  But, after seeing the current price I decided to refill my old bottles using the packages from Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Dinner boxes.  It takes 3 packages to refill, and you get about 20% more.  I've been able to buy the boxes on sale for 50 cents, so the refill only costs $1.50.  The price is 61 cents/box at my local warehouse store (still only $1.83/refill).<br /><br />Great product being priced out of existence.  Now what to do with all this excess macaroni???
