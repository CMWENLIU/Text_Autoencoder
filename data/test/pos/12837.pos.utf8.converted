I found this very large bag (4 pounds) of Kirkland Signature California Pistachios at my local warehouse store and I couldn't resist. Mmmmmm. Pistachios are one of my favorite nuts. And they have some health benefits too, or at least that's what I tell myself as they go into the shopping cart. These pistachios are excellent. Lightly salted. Nice and fresh. Good roasted flavor. What more could you ask for in a healthy snack? This huge bag won't last long.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
