<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044QYG2E">Haribo TropiFrutti, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />I just got these and read that there was Carnauba wax in them, so I was afraid that meant gluten, however a seach of Google told me otherwise and I decided to brave them.  After all I had just bought 12 bags.<br /><br />I gengerly bit ito a banana (banana flavor) and it almost  immediately melted in my mouth.  Then I braved a palm (watermelon flavor) and then I moved on to the pineapple (white pineapple).  I had to force myself to stop -- I am diabetic, after all, and had to be more reasonable than I felt, but OMG!!! (To quote a cliche my kids use.)  These are more than yummy; they are SPECTACULAR!  Treat yourself!  From what I could tell, no dairy, no gluten, no soy, just a YUMMY, YUMMY treat for my after dinner apertif!  YAY!<br />That and a great AMZ S & S price - - can't beat that!
