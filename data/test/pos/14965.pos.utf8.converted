I have dealt w reflux for most of my adult life (I'm 41) I've had problems w swallowing food due to esophageal erosion and narrowing from stomach acid irritation. I've tried a lot of different products and have used PPI's on and off before. They all have negative side effects most doctors wont bother warning you about. I haven't found any side effects from this product and it works. I almost never have any reflux anymore. I take a small amount 20 min or so before breakfast and I'm heartburn free for the day. I just take it straight without bread or a cracker. Not sure if it would prevent reflux if I ate a super spicy meal or pepperoni or not, but I usually avoid that stuff anyhow. If you have chronic reflux due to constant stress and anxiety I'm not sure if this stuff will help you, but for controlling mild reflux it does work very well. I've been taking it for a few months now
