A few years ago Friskies produced a similar "meat & gravy" product which I quickly bought.  My five cats refused to eat it, just licked the gravy.  When I spotted this new product, I decided to try it once more.  It was A HUGE SUCCESS!!!!  My five cats loved it from the first bite and actually licked their dishes clean, all varieties.  I highly recommend it to anyone who might have had a similar experience with the original product.  I will continue to buy it as long as it is available.  Thank you, Friskies!
