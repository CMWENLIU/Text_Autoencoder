I used Postum for years and when Kellogg stopped production I found Cafix to fill the gap. It has a smooth taste, very similar to coffee and postum. I purchase it by the case from Amazon and a case of 6 - 7.05 ounce containers lasts about 6 months. I still prefer Postum but it isn't available and Cafix fills the gap.
