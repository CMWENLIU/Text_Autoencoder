The first package of Kasilof smoked salmon I bought was several years ago and it was not good at all, the fish fell apart in chunks when the sealed foil bag was opened. I contacted the company and during our discussion, realized the foil package had been unsealed in it's cellophane wrapped cardboard box. They could have sent me back to the store, but instead replaced the product and shipped it in two days. This package contained delicious smoked salmon in a nice solid filet which was savored with great gusto. Because we had spent a week on the Kenai peninsula a few years back fishing for salmon in a fishing hole in Homer, this fish reminded us of those days. Since this first filet, we have enjoyed the salmon on many occasions, also sharing it as gifts. I personally do not care if it arrives in a box or the sturdy cardboard which I purchased this week. The fish inside is the same -- flavorful, moist, not bad nutritionally, and perfect for more than one meal if you can find the 24 ounce filet which is our favorite. Wild salmon, salt and brown sugar are the only ingredients in this product and I'm all in favor of wild fish with no colorings or preservatives added. It's great plain and simple, in hot pasta, as a fish spread or a cold salad. Must buy more when it's on sale!
