While you could buy these beans separately and mix them together yourself, I think Bob's Red Mill got the mix spot on. This soup is downright tasty, especially with the Bean Soup Seasoning Mix that Bob's also makes. In addition to the Seasoning mix I also add some diced tomato, onion, and whatever other veggies I have on hand (potato, carrot, celery). I also add about a tsp of ground fancy mustard when I make 1/4 package. This soup is very versatile - you could add whatever seasonings and veggies you like and get a good fit.<br /><br />Having the beans pre-mixed is also easier. I measure out 1/4 package in the evening and let them soak overnight. In the morning I toss the beans, veggies, seasoning, and some water in my small crock pot and dinner is ready when I get home! I would say it takes about 20 minutes of prep and clean up time and I get enough soup for 4 meals out of it. You should definitely try this soup!
