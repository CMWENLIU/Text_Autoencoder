We served this juicy but very sassy bunny at a party for friends including Sir Elmer Fudd, Wile E. Coyote from the Arizona Coyote family, Pete Puma, a gentleman from Tasmanian, Samuel from Yosemite CA, and a man named Marvin who likes to dress as an ancient Roman. Unfortunately a Doctor friend and his very long red-haired assistant with tennis shoes could not attend. Neither could a gentleman from Africa who is taking care of a newborn bundle of joy the stork just delivered. In any case, everyone at attendance was extremely satisfied. The meal was a big success compared to the duck we had last year.  Everyone agreed it was gamy and daffy.  Next year we are going to try something Southwestern. I hear form Mr. Coyote that there's a bird hard to catch but very tasty. I'll keep you all informed.
