This pizza crust is delicious!  Our whole family loves it!!  We put cheese and toppings on them.  My child who is allergic to everything just has toppings on his (no cheese), and he eats it all.  We made personal pizzas out of the dough so everyone in our family could make their own special pizza to enjoy.  Whenever we want to have pizza night...this is pizza crust mix we will use every time.  We are thrilled to be able to eat pizza again in our house!  Thank you Namaste!!  I agree with the previous reviewer...I, also, make many small personal-size pizza crusts and store them in the freezer.  When I need to make a quick lunch or dinner, I just pull them out, thaw them a bit, warm up the oven, add toppings, and cook for 10 min. or so in the oven.  Nice.
