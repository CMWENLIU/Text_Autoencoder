This mix saved my life.  After being diagnosed with celiac disease, I tried all the "great" gluten-free bread machine recipes I could find (I am awful at baking bread by hand).  They were all uniformly and unequivocally TERRIBLE.  They were dense, didn't rise properly, caved in at the top or sides, etc etc etc.  They also all tasted very gluten-free.<br /><br />This mix, though is wonderful.  It rises, sticks together very well for a fluffy gluten-free bread (it still has the tendancy to fall apart if not toasted), makes wonderful croutons and stuffing, browns properly and only occasionally caves in a little bit.<br /><br />Things I have learned with this mix that help it a great deal:<br /><br />1. Let the loaf sit in the bread machine for at least 20 minutes after it stops baking. (I have the standard Oster bread machine that was popular when the bread machine rose to popularity.)<br /><br />2. Make it with rice milk.  To me, cow's milk and almond milk taste funny with this recipe.<br /><br />3. Let it cool for a good long while, it is very moist and will fall apart if you try to slice it immediately.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this bread as much as I do!
