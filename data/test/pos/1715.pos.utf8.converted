Since I drink between eight and ten cups of green tea a day, I am very fussy about the taste.  It must be pure green tea, I don't care for added flavors.  I LOVE this tea. Recently, I ordered green tea in a restaurant and was served Bigelow, which is a good brand.  I put the Bigelow tea bag in the cup of hot water and then took a Stash green tea bag out of my purse and put it into the glass decanter of hot water.  This was a good comparison...the Bigelow tea was brownish in color, the Stash tea a beautiful, clear GREEN.  My husband commented, "that is why it is called green tea!"
