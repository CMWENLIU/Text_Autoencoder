I've been drinking jasmine green teas for several years and recently discovered the joys of jasmine pearl teas. Normally I buy the Rishi brand since I can find it locally (for a very hefty price), but when I saw the Numi Jasmine Pearls on Amazon I had to try it, especially with the substantial price difference ($21 for 6oz Rishi, $28 for 16oz Numi).<br /><br />This tea is wonderful. It's aroma both pre-and post-steeping is delightful, the flavor is very nice and smooth.<br /><br />I don't think this is the best jasmine pearl tea available, but for the price, it's one that I will buy again.
