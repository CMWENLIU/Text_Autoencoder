I bought this for a European friend who likes to take the traditional "coffee and cake" break in the late afternoon. The contents included:<br />1 coffee mug<br />10 creamer packs<br />6 raw sugar packs<br />1 Kauai Blend coffee pack<br />1 Breakfast blend coffee pack<br />1 Columbian blend coffee pack<br />1 small canister of Irish Creme-flavored coffee<br />Jila mints<br />A pack of coffee stirrers<br />5 Galette biscuits (thin cookies that are waffled)<br />4 Biscotte (biscoffee)<br />1 double-pack of biscoff (biscotte)<br /><br />It really was a nice selection for a single person--I say this because of the pack having 1 mug, although there was certainly enough for two to enjoy coffee for about 3 days. As such, it does make an excellent gift for people who don't know what to get a single friend or coworker who enjoys the European tradition of coffee in the afternoon.<br /><br />I don't know if this is true for all baskets, but I was intrigued that they repurposed boxes with new labels, such as Jello boxes, to contain the goodies. I liked this, since I like to recycle things, myself and I found it interesting.<br /><br />THe goodies are not "premium" but they were good and I liked the addition of the raw sugar instead of the refined white. It is a good, solid selection.<br /><br />The basket was nice and had leather loops for hands. I've repurposed that to hold the bits and pieces that collect around my desk at work. And that's something else I wanted to mention, this is PERFECT for work. Everything is packaged in a way that makes it very, very convenient for work or travel. In fact, if you have a friend who travels a lot, this may be a great gift bcause of the individual packaging. It would be very easy to pack and the individual biscotte would be great for flying since you rarely get anything to eat on planes anymore.<br /><br />So, I'd recommend this as a gift for any single friend or coworker. I'm sure he or she will enjoy it!
