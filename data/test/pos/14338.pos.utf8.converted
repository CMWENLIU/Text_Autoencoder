This cereal meets three major criteria:<br /><br />1.  It is low in sugar - no longer a kid and hate cereal that is too sweet.<br /><br />2.  Stays crunchy - the best flaked cereal I have found for staying crunchy in milk, maybe because the flakes seem a little heartier/thicker than standard flakes.<br /><br />3.  Taste - last but not least, too many of the healthier flakes taste like cardboard, but this cereal is so good I can eat it right out of the bag like a snack.<br /><br />This cereal is one item in my ultimate breakfast cereal mix.  The other ingredients are Kashi's 7 Whole Grain Puffs, dried cranberries, pecans, and flax seed. With Heritage & Kashi combined you get all the following grains in one breakfast:<br /><br />1.  Spelt<br /><br />2.  Quinoa<br /><br />3.  Kamut<br /><br />4.  Millet<br /><br />5.  Buckwheat<br /><br />6.  Triticale<br /><br />7.  Rye<br /><br />8.  Red Winter Wheat<br /><br />9.  Barley<br /><br />10. Oats<br /><br />11. Brown Rice<br /><br />12. Sesame Seeds<br /><br />Then I add the following to the bowl:<br /><br />13. Flax Seeds - about a tablespoon<br /><br />14. Pecans - about 2 tablespoons<br /><br />15. Dried Cranberries - about 2 tablespoons<br /><br />Then if you really want to go full-on healthy try Better Than Milk Original Flavor Vegan Soy Beverage, the best soy milk out there...see my review of it.
