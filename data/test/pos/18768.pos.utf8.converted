This is a brand-new pasta variety from Tinkyada, and it's wonderful!  We have pasta, always Tinkyada, at least once a week, so I have the cooking method down, and it's dependably al dente.  This pasta is much whiter in color than their brown-rice pastas, a little too white to look like glutenous pastas (which may be good).  As for the taste and all-important texture...A+!  My hubby was very complimentary and he and the kids ate evey scrap of the spaghetti.  Tinkyada is very good with gluten-free pastas, and this one is their best yet.  One thing I will say is that you REALLY need to rinse this pasta before serving, because it does make the water it's cooked in very gluey and sticky.  I don't usually rinse the other Tinkyada pastas, but I know some people rinse all of them.
