I had to stop myself from devouring the entire bag in one sitting. Yes, they are very sweet and taste of banana. I suppose that helps to mask the 'green' flavor.<br />At the time of this writing they are not in stock on Amazon, but when they become available here again, I will order the 6-pack because it sure beats the price at Whole Foods.<br />It's great to have a treat that feels like cheating, but is really healthy.
