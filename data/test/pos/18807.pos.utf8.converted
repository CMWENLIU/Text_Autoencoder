First of all, this is not espresso. I'm picky about espresso and this ain't it. It also doesn't taste much like traditional drip coffees.<br /><br />That said, Cafe Bustelo Instant is an excellent drink. I was looking for an alternative to Starbucks Via that was convenient but not so expensive, and decided to try a few on Amazon. This is among the best, possibly *the* best. It's an interesting, distinct flavor. Very substantial, but not bitter. I need to put cream in most drip coffees to offset the bitterness, but I drank this black and enjoyed it thoroughly.<br /><br />At the price, you really can't go wrong. Tired of noxious office coffee? I know I am. I'm taking a bottle of this into the office. I'll still hit a local shop for quality espresso but I'll gladly replace drip coffees with Cafe Bustelo.
