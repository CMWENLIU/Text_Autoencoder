I've used this product for quite a few years, after trying MANY other brands and forms, and still find this to be the absolute best stevia product--hands down!  I don't know what we would do without this product.  We use it every day, all day, for coffee, tea, sweetening yogurt fruit, etc.  All our family members like it, too.  One bottle lasts for over two months, usually three.  It has no aftertaste, a few drops is all it takes and finally, we've been able to almost eliminate sugars from our diet without "suffering".  There are 2,880 drops in a 4 oz or 120ml bottle, according to the manufacturer.  We love it!<br />UPDATE:  Received new shipment and bottle label has changed.  Now states there are approx. 600 servings per bottle at 5-8 drops per serving or to taste.  Last few bottles seemed slightly weaker, but still the best of all the other brands, by far.  We still love it!
