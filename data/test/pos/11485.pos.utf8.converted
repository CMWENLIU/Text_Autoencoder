These true to taste pieces (about 1/2" square) are a very satisfying sweet snack. When rehydrated, they are very good pureed for a drink (w/tonic, club soda or a juice you like-- or maybe a 'smoothie'. Good dessert topping. I used it in a marinade on chicken. The 2-pack on sale is a good price. Hope they'll be back in stock during the sale.
