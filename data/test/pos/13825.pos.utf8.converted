I just got back from being in Paris for a delicious month and was turned on to Fleur de Sel de Camargue by Ina Garten in her book "Barefoot in Paris", which I took with me, and it changed the way I cook and how I experience the process and the end result. I found this product abundant at La Grande Epicerie de Paris at 38 rue de Sevres, where every thing can be found in abundance!! I brought back a dozen containers! Who knew I would be able to get it on Amazon!! Thank you Ina and thank you Amazon!!!
