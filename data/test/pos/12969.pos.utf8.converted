I ordered the new Mannheim Steamroller Christmas CD for the holidays.  There was a recommendation to order the "No Sugar Added Cinnamon Hot Chocolate" to drink while listening to the music.  I had not had hot chocolate in ages and not only was it delicious, it did greatly add to my enjoyment of the new CD.
