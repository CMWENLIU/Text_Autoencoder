Hi, I have a son with Candida (severe yeast problem) so we have run the gamut as far as trying alternative NATURAL sweetners that are ULTRA LOW on the glycemic index. Erytritol while containing NO calories is more like 1/2 the sweetness of Xylitol, I know they say it is 1/3 less but you really, REALLY need two times as much in our experience. While it does NOT have any funny aftertaste as some stevia brands do & we LOve the fact that it is ZERO calories, we find that a home made blend of all 3 works the best. Stevia also has no calories & xylitol has 2/3 of table sugar. So if you are dieting or have blood sugar issues this is a good viable alternative with no negative effects like the UNnatural products like sucralose AKA Splenda & Nutrasweet have.., howbeit a PRICEY one!
