My 6 year old kitty was losing weight, vomiting constantly, and had loose stools.  The vet could not find anything wrong with her.  She lost more and more weight, had poor fur and low energy.  I was resigned to losing this very sweet cat.  She was eating one of the most expensive cat foods. One day in the grocery store I noticed a display of all the Purina One products.  I bought a bag of Sensitive Systems cat food.  When I put some in her bowl, she meowed while eating it!  Within days I saw an improvement in her energy level.  She is now doing great, correct weight, good fur.  For some reason, the store quit carrying this, so now I order it for her.
