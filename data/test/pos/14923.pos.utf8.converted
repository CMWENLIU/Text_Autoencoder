My dad had a very large pressure sore (bed sore) on his buttocks after spending over 2  months in the hospital. His home-nurse suggested using honey. After researching, I came across Manuka Honey and decided the $28 price tag would be worth it IF it helped.<br /><br />My dad's sore was HUGE and DEEP. Unfortunately, I never photographed it or measured it but it was BIG and infected and very serious.<br /><br />It has been 3 weeks (THREE WEEKS) that my dad has been applying the Manuka Honey on his sore. Every time the sore gets dirty from a bowel movement, the Aide reapplys the honey and dressing. I'm guessing his dressing gets changed 2 to 3 times per day.<br /><br />I see my Dad weekly and at the 3rd week, I was SHOCKED to see the dramatic improvement. The sore is only about an inch in length and not very deep at all when it was about 6 inches long and very deep (I'm guessing at the size since I never measured it.But it was Huge!!).<br /><br />I am a believer. They say, seeing is believing. Well, I have seen, I continue to see, and I truly believe in Manuka Honey. I can't say enough about this product.<br /><br />It is a shame that doctors and pharmacies make consumers pay for medicines when there are alternatives.<br /><br />I hope this review helps some of you who are doubtful. It has and continues to help but dad. Try it!!!! It's a miracle indeed!!
