I've loved MTR food ever since I was a small boy. Now MTR has forayed into packaged food of various varieties. Luckily for us the taste and quality have made the jump from restaurant servings to the box.<br /><br />These ready-to-eat range are a boon to me. I'm a vegetarian and these boxes travel with me wherever I go on my travels. All I need is a microwave.
