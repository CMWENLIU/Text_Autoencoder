Wow!!!  These dates are fantastic!!!  Medjool dates are my favorites and these<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NWIQWW">United With Earth Organic Medjool Dates, 16-Ounce Containers (Pack of 4)</a> are the very best...even better than those I buy fresh at my local health food store! And less expensive by far.<br /><br />These dates are not only organic, they are soft, moist and juicey and will melt in your mouth.<br /><br />Incredible value here at Amazon...  I am going to stock up!
