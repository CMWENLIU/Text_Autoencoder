Wow, this is a lot of popcorn, but it tastes so good you will go through it quickly.  My whole family was impressed with the fresh taste of this popcorn and after years of eating microwave popcorn I could not believe what we were missing.  Get an "oil mister" from Amazon and spray a little olive oil on this corn for the perfect "butter-free" snack.  These are the big meaty kernals that don't break apart in the bowl like some other varieties.  Highly recommended!
