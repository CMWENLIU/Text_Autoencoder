NOTE:  SORRY FOR AN SPELLING/GRAMMER ERRORS, THERE'S NO SPELL-CHECK ON AMAZON!!!<br /><br />This is my second buy from Joel, and I can officially say this is the BEST service I have seen on the internet in while.  I did a lot of research (as always...) before buying, and I found out somethings that I think you might want to know.  For starters, this is sundew that is almost impossible to kill, because once well established, it is just generally more difficult to kill than other sundews.  Another, it will arrive green in color, but it will turn a vibrant maroon when exposed to the correct amount of light.  You actually recive THREE plants, not one, but mine arrived in a clump, growing together.  DO NOT TRY TO PRY THEM APART!!! they are supposed to come like this.<br /><br />Also, if you want a pot FULL of these plants, you just have to let them flower and produce seeds, and they flower so often and produce so many seeds that some growers consider this species as a weed as the baby plants colinize any pot they can grow in, and like i said before, they are pretty hard to perminately kill by carnivourous plant standards.<br /><br />I will update when major events happen (i.e.: The sundew changes color, ect)<br /><br />12/29/2011---'Stickly' is getting a "tan"(green turning red), and new dew drops are forming on his little tenticles, and I fed each sundew (they are growing in a clump) a ant.
