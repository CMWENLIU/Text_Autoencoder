Every time I make this for guests, it gets rave reviews.  I use chicken breast tenderloins and cook that with sauteed onions.  Boil up some bok choy till tender and throw that in when you add the seasoning (I use the whole packet for one pound of chicken) and coconut milk.  Serve with white rice for a sure winner every time.<br />A Taste of Thai products consistently has the best and freshest tasting seasoning mixes.  Also recommended:  Spicy Peanut Bake.
