This large-size box suits my needs perfectly. I go through quite a lot of tea for my yoga business, both making it to serve and to sell, so I had been looking for a while for a larger size container of loose-cut black tea that still had a straight-forward, plain black tea taste to complement the chai-type spices I use. I was a bit suprised that the tea is of the "rolled leaves" variety of loose tea, that is, it looks like little nuggets rather than sifted and cut leaves. I've quite grown to appreciate this though, because it makes for easier pouring into my tea strainer and even easier clean-up. I'd love to find an organic version of this, though overall, great find and a good price, too.
