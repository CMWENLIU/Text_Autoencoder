I love this tea! Who ever thinks of it as cheap should really consider the complexity and the harmony of the flavors that come through with each cup. It may not be the prized white tea, but the nutty taste keeps you wanting more. It's a great part of my tea alternation. I go from something fruity to nutty interchangably. For my nutty trips I consider a cup of Genmai cha and Oolong and for the fruity I recommend a cup of Orange Blossom White Tea. Also try Japanese charry green. Enjoy!
