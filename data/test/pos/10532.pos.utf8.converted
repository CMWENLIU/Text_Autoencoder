This is one of the finest rabbits I've ever had the pleasure to sink my teeth into. Tender, juicey...almost seemed like I caught it myself. I bought one right at Easter and put him on the back porch with a basket of old broken eggs to scare my daughter..one thing kids like is to be tricked. Afterwards, she was still crying..but we ate the "fried chicken" for lunch anyways...it was awesome!
