I bought this to try as a replacement for a combination of whole wheat flour and multi-grain hot cereal in my bread recipe to make hearty multi-grain loaves of bread. This works great! It's easier and cheaper and all organic (instead of just the flour like before). My recipe is 6 cups of this flour, 1/2 cup vital wheat gluten, 2 tsp salt, 2 tsp instant yeast (bread machine yeast), 2 Tablespoons sugar, 2 Tablespoons olive oil and water to the right consistency (between 2 and 3 cups). Mix. Form ball and place in large oiled bowl. Let rise. Fold a few times and form two loaves, let rise again and bake at 375 F for 45 min. It's delicious!
