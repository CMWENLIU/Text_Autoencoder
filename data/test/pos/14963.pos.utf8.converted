This is my first review of any Amazon product to help other customers. This product really worked for me. My blood test revealed positive H-pylori infection after my trip outside the country. But I believe that was due to my prolonged (more than 3 years - Started with Omeprazole 20mg and last I was on dexilant 60 mg) use of acid blockers for my acid reflux. My stomach pain did not go away even after 2 rounds of antibiotics. After reading other customer reviews, I ordered this product. I took a teaspoon twice a day (once before breakfast and once before dinner). I finished 2 jars of Manuka honey now. My stomach pain is gone and also my recent breath test revealed negative. I am also taking align probiatic and mastic gum 500mg before my breakfast daily. I am almost off of all the acid blockers.
