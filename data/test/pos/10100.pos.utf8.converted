if your tired of the same old butter and salt fare for your popcorn, then you gotta try this stuff out. the Jalapeno flavor is my favorite, even though it doesn't taste much like jalapeno. Kernel Seasons makes other flavors too. you can even find them at Walmart and Target, but for some reason they never have the Jalapeno flavor. Great stuff!
