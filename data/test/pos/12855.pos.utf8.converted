I'm a repeat customer for this item many times over.  My 4 dogs love them.<br /><br />So do I since they're one of the "chews" that actually last awhile.<br /><br />For a real treat I sometimes smear peanut butter or cheese on them and send 'em all out into the fenced yard for the afternoon.<br />(smear the chews, not the dogs)<br /><br />Get these...be creative or not, as you choose.  But your dogs will probably appreciate them no matter what.
