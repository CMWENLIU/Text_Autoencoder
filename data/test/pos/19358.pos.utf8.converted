My kids know I have a sweet-tooth and that my favorite flavors are caramel and vanilla, so what better gift than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001W3QTQI">GoLightly Sugar Free Vanilla Caramels, 2.75-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> for Mother's Day!<br /><br />They also know I'm not supposed to have too much sugar and that of all the sweeteners, I prefer Splenda (the one in the yellow packet).  I know Mindy considered those points when she sent me a basket containing this product, along with other goodies...including a thrilling James Patterson book. (She also knows my book fetish. Grin!)<br /><br />Now you all know what I'm going to be doing while James keeps me up all night: munching! Woo-hoo!<br /><br />For more information about this product read the description at top of the page, then get your own supply. I'm stashing these in my bedroom and no one gets any but me! (That includes Mindy and the grandkids. Just call me selfish... LOL)<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, May 2009<br />Author of "1106  Grand Boulevard"
