This Tangerine Orange Zinger herbal tea provides a luscious and refreshing break from your daily grind and helps you relax as well. It's got a great taste to it that is not overpowering and if you let it steep about three and one-half minutes you're bound to enjoy it as much as I do! As another reviewer notes, the main effect is a distinctly citrus scent and taste tweaked just a bit for a really full bodied flavor and aroma.<br /><br />Each bag contains the natural ingredients of red hibiscus tea with orange peel and natural tangerine flavor. There are no artificial ingredients! Celestial Seasonings even added some vitamin C to make this even better for you!<br /><br />The stringless tea bags can easily be removed from your cup whenever you want just by using a spoon or anything similar to get them out of the cup. Stir the tea bag around and up and down a bit while it's in your cup before you drink it.<br /><br />The tea is also caffeine free, which is a plus for those of us who don't want caffeine in our diets. That is something I always prefer.<br /><br />If you like a special type of citrus flavor to your tea, this is highly recommended! Enjoy!
