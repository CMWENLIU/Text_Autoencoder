I grew up with green tea (I'm from Japan)- I was always searching for good alternative to the loose green tea (wanted something quick, single serving, easy to clean, and yet tastes good).  Well, my search is over, finally!<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />-Tastes very fresh, the color is very green,<br /> not that yellow-ish green<br /><br />-Added Maccha to enhance the flavor<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />-The naming is bit confusing.  I can see why some people order this product, thinking that they are getting the Maccha powder (the one for the tea ceremony).  This is NOT a 100% Maccha poder.  It is a delicious, fresh green tea blended with maccha powder.<br /><br />Quick Tip<br /><br />If your green tea tastes too bitter, the water might be too hot.  The best temperature is around 80C (176F- NOT boiling hot). After pouring the hot water, steep about 30-45 sec, then take the bag out.  You never want to "cook" the green tea.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)
