So you've been paying how much for sushi at those fancy Asian fusion bars? Stop it this minute...start making your own with this nori. It's incredibly cheap, good, and even includes the sushi mat. (Line the mat with plastic wrap...keeps the mat clean and each roll will be wrapped up for refrigerator storage as you roll it.) Use chicken or cooked seafood if you are wary of raw fish (or make vegetarian ones) and don't cut out the slices until ready to serve. There are a number of good internet sites on making sushi...just Google it. Oh, and you'll need <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001DMT1E">Nishiki Premium Sushi Rice (5#)</a> and Nishiki 100% Natural Sushi Vinegar, 10 Fluid Ounces (or their equivalents - lots of competing products), too.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
