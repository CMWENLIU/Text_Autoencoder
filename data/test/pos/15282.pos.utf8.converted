I've tried them all, Tinkyada, Mrs. Leepers, Le Venezienne, etc. Most were good to passable, but this pasta is the greatest and closest yet to real pasta.<br /><br />Still retains a decent al-dente bite and even reheats fairly well as well, but you will need to a teaspoon of water in your container before nuking.<br /><br />I wish though that GF pasta would cost less.. imported pasta from italy typically is on sale for .50 to .75 a lb, but corn pasta from italy costs roughly $4.50 or more a pound.. someday there will be enough demand or competition to drive down these costs.<br /><br />Till then Schar rules and is worth the extra money when stacked against it's competition in the GF pasta market.
