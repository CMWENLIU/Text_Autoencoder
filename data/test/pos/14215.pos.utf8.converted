2012 and still as taple in our home. Great organic chocolate milk imitation. Not creamy like milk, but a light  chocolate drink like yahoo or chocolate soldier but not as sweet.  Sons want it everyday.  My whole family loves it.  So good  ordered 3 cases of 24 on subscribe and save.<br /><br />Makes great snack by itself, or quick refreshing addition to any snack or meal. fits perfect in lunch box.  Part of any healthy lifestyle even great for vegans. **allergy alert made from almonds / nuts
