With Bacon Spam the answer is yes.  As far as I'm concerned they can simply discontinue all over spam varities. Bacon spam has a much more meaty and slightly smokey flavor that brings Spam up several notches in my opinion.<br /><br />You can of course use it in any way you normally use regular spam but perhaps one of my favorite ways to have it is to cube it up and cook it in with navy beans or in split pea soup.<br />I am not a fan of the hot spam or the hickory spam that tastes a bit odd to me. If I were to describe the flavor for you it would be.  Bacon spam doesn't taste exactly like bacon.  It is more like they mixed 20% bacon in with regular spam.  It is hard to find this variety in stores.  I have only seen it a the Mega-Walmarts and here on Amazon.  Enjoy!
