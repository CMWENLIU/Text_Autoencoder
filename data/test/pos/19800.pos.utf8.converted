Since my dogs transitioned to a mostly Vegan/Vegetarian diet, their health has really improved. They used to eat Wellness Lamb & Rice (dry and canned) - I was told the meat that Wellness used was "human grade" -- as opposed to the usual slaughterhouse slop/floor waste and euthanized shelter animals rendered for dog food. I never quite believed it ... and, being a long-time Vegetarian and now Vegan, it didn't sit well with me to feed this to my dogs.<br /><br />Anyway, I decided to change their diet, as well. I initially mixed in their old food (Wellness) with the V-Dog and the Natural Balance Vegetarian dog food.  This took about 2 weeks.  Since then (about 6 months ago), I would say they are definitely reaping the health benefits.  They no longer have runny stool or diarrhea, nor do they have gas. Also, some skin issues have cleared up. In addition to the health improvements, my dogs really LOVE the taste of this stuff. The kibbles are a good size, too.<br /><br />I understand that V-Dog is coming up w/a new formula at the end of January 2012.  According to their website, the "new formula is wheat, corn, soy and gluten-free, and slightly higher in protein at 24%."  I can't imagine how they can improve upon what they have right now, but I'm looking forward to (my dogs) trying it.  I would recommend ordering directly from the V-Dog website (www.v-dogfood.com) - the shipping is free and it arrives w/in a couple of days (as opposed to "business days" or a week or two like some "free shipping" deals).<br /><br />Try this dog V-Dog Food - your dogs will love it and you will feel good knowing that you are not feeding unhealthy and unethical slaughterhouse waste to your best friends.
