My mommy got me this new food and I just LOVE it! She used to make my food special, cooking me turkey, beef and veggies. I have allergies and my skin gets very itchy and mommy worries about me. So, she took me to the vet and that's where we heard about Orijen. It's super tasty! I can't wait for mealtime! My skin feels better and I have more pep in my step! Plus, mommy says that it's cheaper and easier on her than making me special food, and by feeding me Orijen, she knows I'm getting all the vitamins I need to grow up a strong happy doggie! I give Orijen four paws up- I'd give it five but I only have four (LOL)!
