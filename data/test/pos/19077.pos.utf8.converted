We've used Starbucks French Roast coffee beans for years, and it's our favorite.  Normally I get the whole beans and grind them in the blender a pound at a time, but this product came already ground.  It's fresh and aromatic, and tastes wonderful, never bitter.  The metallic bags are vacuum sealed to keep the product fresh until opened.  The free shipping through Amazon made this a wonderful deal!
