I use this oil for cosmetic purposes, mostly as a catalyst carrier oil for Ormus and essential oils, and it is of very high quality and fineness and absorbs quickly into the skin. It has no off smell or color, is a top shelf oil and no doubt would be a primo cooking oil if any were left over for me to use it. The deal with people having issues with dents in the containers is not an issue for me, there was a small indentation on one of the cans but I could have made it myself prying the cans out of the shrink wrap. As long as the oil is in the cans I am good. Again, these are not decorative items for me, but utilitarian containers. Love the oil. You will, too.
