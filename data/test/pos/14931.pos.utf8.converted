I stumbled onto Manuka Honey last year and I was really blown away by all of the claims that were being made about this honey. My family eats a lot of honey and we have really made serious changes to our diets in recent years. We no longer eat processed food, get all of our meats & produce from organic CSA farms and we are constantly on the look out for ways to further improve our diets. After reading about Manuka Honey, I simply had to give it a try. The brand I ordered was Wedderspoon Active 16+.<br /><br />To say that I was impressed is an understatement as the flavor is absolutely to die for. It has a very unique taste. To be honest, its the best honey I have ever had. I am a yogurt junkie and started making homemade yogurt a couple years back. Sprinkling some Manuka Honey over homemade yogurt is simple amazing. Its hands down the best yogurt topping I have ever tried and I have tried almost everything. The unique taste of Manuka honey blends perfectly with yogurt. Throw some granola in there and again its absolutely to die for. One of the other things I use it for regularly is on toast. We buy fresh bread every other day from our local bakery and Manuka Honey on fresh toasted bread is just as amazing as the yogurt.<br /><br />As for its antibacterial claims, its absolutely 100% true. My wife has a very mild case of eczema but a couple times a year it acts up and can get pretty bad. The episodes usually last a week or two. She literally has like 10+ different kinds of hand lotion specifically aimed at treating Eczema. When I first told her about Manuka Honey she was extremely skeptical, in regards to what it could do for her skin, but since we already had some she said she would give it a try. Sure enough like 6 weeks later her Eczema stated acting up, mostly on her hands. Before she went to bed She applied a very light coating over the affected areas and then put on a pair of my Light Impressions cotton gloves. I use the gloves when matting or handling my photography prints. They are extremely light and are made of 100% cotton. It only took 2 nights of this and her hands were back to normal. She was absolutely BLOWN AWAY. To give you an idea of just how impressed she was, she wound up ordered 6 more bottles that same week. Since then she has had multiple outbreaks and each and every time she uses the Manuka Honey. Her collection of hand lotions are doing nothing but collecting dust.<br /><br />Bottom line - Manuka Honey is good for you, tastes great and it has anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-viral properties. Its like liquid gold. It now has a permanent spot on our shelves. Yes, it is more expensive than regular honey but this is one of the cases where you get what you pay for. Its absolutely worth every last penny. This is one train you want to get on.<br /><br />5 Stars and then some!!
