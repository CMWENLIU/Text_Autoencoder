This was a splurge purchase.  My wife knows that I occasionally will go on a health kick and eat oatmeal for breakfast.  She got me this almost as a gag.  I was very happily surprised by the quality.<br /><br />First, I like the retro packaging.  It looks like I'm going to have something "old school" for breakfast, from an era when my dad says that Grape-Nuts would "almost break your teeth".  It's silly, but the esthetics of food do play a big role in how much we enjoy it.<br /><br />Still, packaging wouldn't mean anything if the taste wasn't there.  Happily, these oats have more texture and flavor than any others I have eaten.  Will the taste blow you away?  Well, truthfully, no.  You could argue that "tastiest oatmeal" is kind of like being "tallest dwarf" or "smartest stooge".  This is also not a product to consider if you are feeding three teenagers on a budget.  What I would say is that if you like oatmeal and don't mind spending a bit more for quality, at least consider treating yourself to a can.
