PROS :<br />  1.  Individually wrapped: great for fooling yourself into thinking your eating less fat because your have smaller portions, even though you end up eating the smaller portions ALL DAY LONG<br />  2.  Its chocolate, so of course 6 bags are better than one.<br />  3.  I like the color blue, so naturally the wrappers laying all over my house all somewhat attractive to me.<br />  4.  By having candy shipped directly to my house, I don't even have to get up and go to the store. So I can solidify myself as a true lazy sack, and not have to even leave the couch to get any fatter.<br /><br />CONS:<br />  1.  How could there be any Cons, its chocolate mailed to my house for cheap, what more could anyone ask for.
