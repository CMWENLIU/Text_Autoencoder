This is the best pizza crust mix we've tried for a corn-, wheat-, soy-free diet. I modify the mix, though, so I can make multiple individual crusts, fresh, over a period of time. I've been using this ratio for over a year:<br />3/4c. dry mix<br />5/8c. water (1/2c+2T., but I just eyeball it in a 2c Pyrex glass measuring cup)<br />1/2t. oil<br />I do follow the mixing instructions -- about 15-30 seconds on low to get it all wet, quickly scrape the bowl with a spatula, then on a med/med-high speed for 3min. It looks rather like cake batter when you're done mixing. Then I pour it out on a silicone baking mat that's placed on a cookie sheet (or you can just use foil on a cookie sheet and spray the foil with oil), spreading it around in a circle of even thickness, about 10" in diameter (the spatula works great for spreading). Bake in a preheated oven at 450 (yes, 450) for 15-20m, remove and add sauce and other desired toppings, then bake another 8-10m. Depending on one's appetite, this makes enough for 1-2 meals for 1 person. Super yummy! Each bag makes maybe 4-5 crusts of this size, if I recall correctly. You may have to slightly modify the water or time based on your preferences, but I've made at least 1 a week like this for over a year and it works great for us! Once you get the hang of the routine and spreading out the "batter" the prep time is mostly the 3m of mixing.<br /><br />We've also tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTKRZQ">Bob's Red Mill Pizza Crust Mix, 16-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> -- a good tasting crust, but this one is faster (no rising time for the yeast), and super easy to scale down to individual size as there is no yeast packet. Plus, I prefer the seasoning in this Namaste crust.
