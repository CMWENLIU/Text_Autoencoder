I picked these up because I was tired of having my insatiable sweet tooth destroy a full day of healthy eating. So far so good! They are quite crunchy but very chocolately and, although I prefer milk chocolate over dark, these really hit the spot.<br />I'm not sure about the prebiotic/probiotic thing yet, but as these claim to be prebiotic and the Leclerc website recommends eating them with probiotics (prebiotics are food for probiotics), I paired them with my DanActive. I'm not sure how much benefit I'll see over time but the combination tasted great! I hope the probiotic thing does work because supposedly they are helpful to people with gastrointestinal issues (that roughage that is so important to a healthy diet wreaks havoc on my stomach). I haven't had any bad reactions to the combo, and it actually seemed to calm my stomach on one occasion. So, all things considered, I'm very happy with my new dessert.<br />They sell these at my Costco here in Houston, but I haven't seen them elsewhere.
