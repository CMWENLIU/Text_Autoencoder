I have personally been to the Emerald Forest plant in Broomfield, Colorado and watched how they produce, handle and package xylitol. It is absolutely clean! The staff love their work and are warm and friendly. Doug Stauffer started Emerald Forest with the goal to help make this wonderful product affordable to the common person. Their products are the best and shipping is very, very fast! I love their gum!<br /><br />Dr. Dan Doyle
