I started buying these as a more nutritious snack option for the kids than regular chips. They thought they were pretty tasty, and a decent substitute for regular chips. I myself got hooked on them! Our local store stopped carrying the exclusively sweet potato chips, and only has the mix, which I don't like as much. I highly recommend them if you enjoy the taste of sweet potatoes and can live without a salty snack. These don't need extra salt--they are delicious on their own.
