RiceSelect Texmati Brown Rice is absolutely delicious.  It is so easy to make.  Just boil water, add a little salt, the rice, and you're good to go.  And, the flavor is just unbelievable.  It has a nice nutty texture to it, in fact, while cooking, it smells like popcorn.  It is a dense, satifying and filling rice, and the bonus is that it is very nutritious.
