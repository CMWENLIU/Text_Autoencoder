Bought from vitamindiscountexpress. Fast(2days)  and FREE shipping on the lowest price. Been taking this for a couple years. Best green tea supplement I have seen.725mg green tea,  98% poly phenols (710.5), 45% EGCG by HPLC(326.25mg) ,and its decaffeinated.<br />(have no idea about the comment talking about nausea, never had problems like that). My comment is now attached to different sellers with uncompetitive prices.
