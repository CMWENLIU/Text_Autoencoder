This is the ONLY hot chocolate my wife will drink. When we changed supermarket for other reasons, she would still return there in order to stock up on this stuff. When our old supermarket stopped carrying it, she stopped going back.<br /><br />Our new supermarket couldn't get it through their suppliers when we asked about it. My wife was not a happy camper: no more Ghiradhelli hot chocolate!<br /><br />Thankfully, I discovered it here on Amazon and my marriage was saved! :) (Well, my wife's morning mood was, at least). If ever Amazon stops carrying it, I suspect my wife will be coming to Amazon HQ to express her displeasure ;) She's a vet: she knows how to neuter things. Fair warning ;)
