I have been eating this pasta for a year now and I have never found one that's better (and I lived in Italy for years). It is lighter and much less sticky than regular refined flour pasta and also adds beneficial bacteria to your intestinal system (or so they say).  I wish I had known about it before trying every gooey whole wheat or regular pasta on the market.
