I bought this olive oil for the first time on October 24th and have used it as often as possible on salads, pasta and in cooking -- so often, in fact, that I am down to my last bottle and will order more. Well, now it is February of 2008 and it is time to order another case -- we've never tired of it.  Amazon has even gotten better in packaging it.  Once each bottled came bubble wrapped in its own box within the larger shipping box.  Definitely worth the price.
