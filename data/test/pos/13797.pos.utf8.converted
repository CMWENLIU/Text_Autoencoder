I am now on my second round of herb kits and for this batch, I purchased three kits and mixed the pods to make my fall/winter mix:  cilantro, basil, parsely, thyme, savory, sage and oregano.  The basil, thyme, savory and oregano are from the new Italian Herb kit.<br /><br />Everything I've planted either sprouted a day early or right on time.  The savory appears to be the most delicate of the bunch, but it has grown the tallest in the three weeks since I started.  The basil is the first to sprout. The parsely seems to be slow but steady.<br /><br />Your herbs will be good for at least six months.  With proper care, I'm sure you could extend their life.  These are very easy to care for and it's great to always have fresh herbs at your disposal.<br /><br />I recommed this product to anyone who loves fresh herbs and/or anyone who has had problems growing herbs in the past.
