These are wonderful! The flavor of the frosting and filling is perfect, rich and sweet, but not too sweet. It's perfect for a light snack. I used to pull off the crust of poptarts because I hated the stale taste, but the crust on these is DELICIOUS. It tastes so moist and fresh, reminding me a little of what a real pastry tastes like. I don't get a stomach ache from these like I did after eating poptarts... and these are organic! I am definitely buying these from now on!<br /><br />If you are wondering about the ingredients, they are:<br /><br />Organic wheat flour, organic evaporated cane juice invert, organic palm oil, organic evaporated cane juice, organic brown sugar, organic whole wheat flour, organic corn starch, organic vital wheat gluten, organic dextrose, organic molasses, organic rice starch, sea salt, leavening (baking soda, cream of tartar), natural brown sugar flavor, organic maple flavor, organic cinnamon, organic honey, organic rice bran extract, organic cocoa, organic caramel flavor, organic vanilla flavor, organic caramel color, algin sodium citrate, monocalcium phosphate, whey protein isolate (milk).<br /><br />The Frosted Strawberry ones are really good, too.
