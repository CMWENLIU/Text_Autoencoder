I was raised up on these animals. As a child I used to go down to the farmers market and buy them by the pound. Now they come conveniently delivered in just the right size package.<br /><br />The neat thing about Sunflower Seeds in the shell is that they are like buying three different products or tastes; you can eat them in the shell, out of the shell. Or just suck on the salty shells after consuming the seed.<br /><br />Opening the shells is a skill in its self. Some people pry it open with their finger nails. Others bite down on it sideways making a cracking sound.<br /><br />Another gross fun thing to do is spit the shells all over the place.<br /><br />Any way you look at it there is lots of fun from this little package.
