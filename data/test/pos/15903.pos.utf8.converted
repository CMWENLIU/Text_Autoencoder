I have tasted many salamis before, having traveled to Italy on many ocasions.<br />I was at north italy ans south. Been then and there. Tasted and purchased salamis from many a master in the trade.<br />And when this salami arrived I was really ansious to see if it could be matched to their italian cousins.<br />Well I am very satified to say they not only can be matched to many other salamis, but they came ahead of a great many.<br /><br />So the review:<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br />A  very well packed product, it came in a box, with a good protection from heat dureing the transport.<br />Was sent in a very fast manner, and arrived fresh from manufacture.<br />After opening one ( the very first was my favorite, the milano one ), I could see it was very godd to all senses.<br />The smell was wonderful, the texture both in hand and in mouth was VERY impressive.<br />The after taste leaving this desire to one more slice. The mix of meat and spices in right balance.<br />What I a can say, simply very good.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />The milano variant came in small size, until this moment it is the only drawback.<br />As I stated it is so good you want more, and very fast you came to the end of the salami.<br /><br />THE UGLY:<br />To this moment nothing bad about.<br /><br />VEREDICT:<br />A very full 5 stars!!!! If everyone had the same care with theyr food products we would be in dire need of bigger stomachs!!!<br />Keep the good work!!!
