I discovered Amber Lyn chocolate about 9 months ago and was floored by just how good this sugar free dark chocolate was.  Some people find the maltitol objectionable and its true that some folks have a harder time with its digestion, however, other sweeteners have their own issues as well, not the least of which is how it affects the taste of the product.  I'm not diabetic but I have friends who are, I am however, a life long struggler with weight and avoidance of sugar goes a long way to making that battle more productive.  But being a chocolate lover, that was always a trade off till I found this product, the taste is downright sublime and satisfies far more so than even other gourmet chocolates made with sugar.  I experimented with various brands of sugar free chocolates, but at the risk of sounding like a chocolate snob, IMO those should've come labled "taste compromised".  Amber Lyn's is a taste that is pure satisfaction, a single bar is so satisfying in its taste and mouth-feel that often, it will last me 3 days as I nibble on it for a desert rather than devour it (though that temptation is definitely there).  My diabetic friends have all upon exposure to its taste, promptly placed orders themselves and not one has had anything even remotely negative to say about it.<br /><br />Finally, a note regarding their customer service.  I live in Las Vegas where the general rule is if you're ordering food online, either avoid ordering heat sensitive goods from March to September or make sure you can get extra care in shipping.  A craving overcame my normal precaution about this and I placed a order just as temps were hitting 100 degrees and carrier trucks are often 10 degrees hotter inside.  I was fully expecting a molten mess to arrive at my door as I had spaced off my normal precautions regarding such a order, yet the package arrived in a sytrofoam lined box with cold gel packs wrapped in paper between the chocolate containers.  My order was literally in pristine condition and totally without any say so on my end, they just knew to take that extra step for their customer.  That is a very rare level of service these days and Amber Lyn cemented my loyalty for life with that move.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're looking for quality, taste, and satisfaction not just for your taste buds but for your presence as a customer, I cannot recommend these people enough.  If all corporations were this dedicated to customer satisfaction, a lot of lawyers would be out of a job.
