I'm not the type who buys a lot of stuff like this, but I read an article in a magazine extolling its benefits and I thought I'd give it a try.  Now I'm a believer.  I'm back to buy my second jar.  I add a spoonful to my tea every morning, and I just feel good all day.  I have lots more energy, and this from a mom with a large farmhouse to take care of, a part-time job, active volunteer jobs and a new puppy (I'm really busy).  Plus I did not get sick at all this winter, which is amazing to me.  My husband and daughter caught colds, plus I volunteer at the school library so I'm exposed to lots of germs, but if I felt like something was coming on I doubled my dose and it never turned into anything.  I also put it on my finger where a splinter turned into an infection, and one day later it was all better - more effective than neosporin. I also have had less adult acne than before - despite a lot of stress (my trigger).<br />The taste is so-so, better than medicine but not as tasty as regular honey.  I wouldn't buy it as a sweetener, I consider it a useful supplement that doesn't taste offensive.  But bottom-line, I'm back for more.
