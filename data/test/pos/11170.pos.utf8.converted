This is a great rub for chicken and beef or any meat. Bought this because started a diet plan and was omitting sauces and gravies. You will never miss them with this sweet smoky perfection. Just saute meat in a little olive oil and use this with salt and garlic. Like a 4 star restaurant!! Love it in my homemade veggie soup brings it to life.
