All 3 of my cats love this food.  They were previously on Wellness Turkey and when the cans were recalled I tried this on the suggestion of a family friend since their one cat has the same crystal issues our oldest does.  He eats his prescription dry in the morning and this at night.  Normally he's content to let the other two cats get to their food first and hold back with patience for his own, but with this it is the first time I have seen him muscle away the other two cats to eat.  I'll be sticking with this and the turkey flavor.<br /><br />Also there is no fish in this or the turkey flavor wet or dry foods which is excellent!  My cats don't tend to enjoy food that has fish in it and this is one of the few foods I can find that is both good for them and has no fish.  One of them does not like the peas in the food, he will eat around them, but one of the others eats them when he's done.  So if your cat hates bits of veggies they may not really enjoy it as much.<br /><br />Oh and one more point, it doesn't have that funky wet food smell a lot of other foods (even good ones) have.  I really can't smell it once I stand up after putting it in the bowl.
