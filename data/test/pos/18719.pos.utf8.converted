I've tried a dozen crepe recipes over the years. Few taste better and none are easier than what comes in this box. It's the only store-bought mix I've seen that requires six eggs. Probably not the healthiest thing in the world, but it tastes fabulous. I make these every other weekend. The only trick is to add the dry ingredients slowly, using a whisk to blend them with the liquids. Then, let it stand for five minutes and give one final, vigorous stir before cooking. The resulting crepes are light and delicious. If you make too much you can only store them in the fridge for about a day, two at the outside. Even though they separate a bit, vigorous stirring will reblend them to the point that they will cook just fine even if they don't look as good as they did straight out the box.<br /><br />Suggested fillings:<br /><br />My favorite is a warm banana filling. Make 2 1/2 cups of simple syrup (water and sugar) in a non-stick pan. Add six thinly sliced bananas, a tablespoon of bourbon vanilla, and three teaspoons of pumpkin spice mix (blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice). Cook over medium heat for around four or five minutes until the liquid reduces and the bananas barely begin to get mushy. Splash in a little cr&egrave;me de banana liquor to finish, stir once, and serve. The easiest way to fill the crepe is to place it on a plate, spoon the filling into the center, and fold in both sides. Dust with powdered sugar for an elegant touch.<br /><br />If you want something easier and sweeter, simply lather some Nutella chocolate/hazelnut spread onto the crepe after the first flip while it's still in the pan, layer in fresh bananas, fold and slide onto a plate to serve. It's quick, easy, and kids love it. Dust with powdered sugar for an elegant touch.<br /><br />Enjoy!
