I'm from Georgia, so I was a little bit of a skeptic when my room mate in college (who was from Texas), could not stop raving about Wolf Brand.  In fact, when he received a care package from his Mom with 6 cans of the stuff, I think I saw tears in his eyes.  I must say, I am now a believer.  Those of us who grew up on Hormel and Armour have no idea how good canned chili can taste.  The meat is firm and substantial, and the spices let you know that someone used a real recipe for this.  Definitely worth the cost.  Try it and and become a believer!
