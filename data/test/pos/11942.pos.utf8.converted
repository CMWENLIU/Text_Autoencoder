I have personally tried several different mixes for "homemade" Italian dressings in my years of cooking. This one takes the cake.  Most I have tried were too sour, or had too much added sugar.  Several just had a lot of oil flavor and very little seasoning.  Some packaged mixes from the grocery store tasted stale as soon as I mixed them.  Some I tried were very inexpensive, off-the-shelf varieties, others custom ordered from specialty food companies.  This was, by far, the best of them all.<br />The flavor is strong and well-seasoned, like a pub salad with a strong house Italian dressing. Tangy, but not sour. Very dominant flavors, not at all timid like a bottled Italian dressing, and certainly not heavy on the salt, as all bottled varieties seem to be.  The bits of vegetable in the mix were so fresh and pungent that you could taste the celery, red pepper and other flavors in the dressing, even after letting it stand for less than an hour at room temperature.  The directions are easy.  Mix 2 T seasoning with said amount of vinegar. Let stand for 20 minutes and add oil.  If you don't let it stand, the flavor is milder, but still very good.  Everyone in my family who tried it enjoyed the flavor. We tried it on a green salad, first, then made it for a picnic pasta salad which received rave reviews from everyone present.  If you don't like the dressing itself, it works nicely as a salad sprinkle for potato, pasta and vegetable salads with other kinds of dressing.  I also tried using it to add kick to a bottled dressing I was eager to free myself of, and it gave it a much-needed flavor boost.  Overall, I highly recommend this product and plan to buy it again in the future.
