I first tried quality English tea when we spent a month in Oxford visiting a friend and I've been trying to find good tea ever since.  This is VERY much better than any other tea that I've tried. If you really like a STRONG cup of tea that isn't totally bitter then this is the one for you.  FYI: I like this better than PG Tips, another popular English tea.
