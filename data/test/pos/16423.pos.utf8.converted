I have a lab mix who gets bored really easily. She's fussy with treats and wont touch rawhide. Someone introduced me to these a few years ago and they are great. There are other brands of bully stick I've tried, but she goes through a single one in minutes. None have the staying power of Red Barn. She just loves them and will sit and gnaw on it for what feels like hours..takes a break and then goes back to it. Its great if I need to get something done and want to keep her out of trouble and occupied. I don't even bother with steer sticks anymore because they too have no staying power.<br /><br />I only buy this product if I can find a deal online. At the  local pet store one can easily pay $5-6 or more for a single 12 inch Red Barn stick. I never thought Id say this but I might even go down a size to the 9 inch ones.. then maybe the next time I'm barefoot I'll be spared the pleasure of stepping on a half inch saliva soaked stump!
