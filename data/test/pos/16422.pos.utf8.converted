These instant potato flakes taste great and do not contain sulfites like many commercial brands.  I do wish they included some simple instructions on the bag.  We used the instructions from Bob's Red Mill potato flakes (now discontinued).  For 2 servings:  heat 3/4C of water to boiling, add 1T butter or margarine and 1/4tsp of salt.  Remove from heat and add 1/4C cold milk or soymilk.  Add approximately 2/3C of potato flakes (more or less depending on how stiff you like them).  Stir gently and fluff with a fork.  Do not whip.
