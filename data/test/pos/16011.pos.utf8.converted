I'm making myself tell what I would prefer to keep secret:  Truly this is the best-quality,genuine article,cold-pressed (in small quantities)olive oil, made right here in the U.S.A. (California).  People (including, in the past, myself)don't actually understand that even the olive oils imported from Italy now are sub-standard.  Bariani, by contrast, is the nearest to what was consumed by the Greeks and Romans of long ago:  simply cold-pressed in small batches, no heat is used, no other oils are used, no other additives are used.<br /><br />I'm not a gourmet, instead I am a fat 51-year-old that tends to veer towards the boxed hamburger meals when desperate!  This is not "snooty gourmets" liking their incidental odd-tasting items, Bariani Olive Oil is truly and simply a great product and I agree with all the other reviewers: EXCELLENT.<br /><br />By the way, I do know the first clue that you are not buying a true olive oil is when the container is clear:  true olive oil cannot be exposed to direct sunlight. Bariani uses a proper, imported, dark-green bottle for their very special product.<br /><br />Even Olive Oil can get complicated:  the majority of olive oils, imported and domestic, are heated, not 100% olive oil and taste terrible after tasting Bariani.<br /><br />I also buy through the company website and by phone and these people are so kind and upstanding -- it's family owned and they intend to keep it that way.<br /><br />The only concern I have is the day will come when Bariani may have to increase their prices due to the law of supply and demand...and I would still buy it!<br /><br />YES IT IS AS GOOD AS EVERYONE IS SAYING IN THEIR REVIEWS.
