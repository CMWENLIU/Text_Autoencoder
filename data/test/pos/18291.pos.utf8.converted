Whether it is Toast Chee or Toasty, there simply isn't a better sandwich cracker.  Quality ingredients for sure (they make their own peanut butter), but always fresh, unlike some of their competitors products which taste stale.  Been eating them for 50 years--started when I delivered morning newspapers--breakfast was Lance and a Coke.
