Our small dog has been eating Dingos for 8 years and absolutely loves them compared to any other rawhide.  In fact, she won't finish eating any other brand of rawhide treats we've bought her.  I guess it's that Dingo "meat in the middle" that does the trick.<br /><br />However, as of writing this review Amazon is selling them for eleven bucks when you can purchase the same 21 count bag for seven bucks at petguys dot com.  They charge shipping, but if you stock up and buy 8 bags as an example, the shipping is only nine bucks.  Also, online coupons are frequently available for their website.
