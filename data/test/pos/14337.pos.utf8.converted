Sweet Sunrise Chocolate Fudge Brownie Coffee is just what the doctor ordered for those of us who like a cup of coffee in the morning - but who also love chocolate!  I first found this at one of the big box stores during the 2008 Christmas season.  I was so disappointed when the big box store did not stock it during the 2009 Christmas season.  However, I have managed to to find this coffee sporadically at some of the off-price retailers.  That is a hit or miss proposition, so I was delighted to find that I could purchase this through an Amazon partner.<br /><br />This is a rich, full-flavored coffee with just the right amount of chocolate; it tastes as if it really is a brownie disguised as a beverage.  The smell that emanates from your coffee pot while this is brewing is simply heavenly - at least for chocoholics.  If you add half and half or cream and some sweetner, the result is a decadent morning beverage.  Unlike many of the flavored coffees on the market, Chocolate Fudge Brownie Coffee does not have that artificial smell or aftertaste.  You will not be disappointed if you choose to purchase this flavored coffee - but, please leave some for me!
