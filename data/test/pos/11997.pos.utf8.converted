I don't know how ANYONE can be critical of this stuff, especially @ this price.  Even in comparison to the highest quality of Matcha (which I've never tried).  If you drink that stuff stick with it if you want, but don't leave a bad review on here...  I'm not a big tea drinker but in comparison to most green tea in bag form or otherwise, this stuff blows it out of the water by far.  I've bought matcha before and this stuff is of similar quality to regular stuff that I bought at the store for 10 dollars an ounce.  Although I've never bought any of the more higher quality brand name products so I have no idea what they taste like.  What else can I say?  You get more of this stuff at a cheaper price than the bland tasting regular green tea, therefore no one can complain, EXCELLENT PRODUCT!
