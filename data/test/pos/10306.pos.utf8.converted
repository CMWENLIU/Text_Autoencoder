For the price, this kit was excellent!!  The wine tastes great and very easy to make.  The kit was very affordable and we did not know how it would turn out, but it surpassed our every expectations.  "WINE MAN" we don't exactly what you were thought you were going to get for a "28 day wine kit for $40.00" American, but we think you can't go wrong.  We are definately going to order another flavor since fresh fruit is off season.<br /><br />Michael & Nancy
