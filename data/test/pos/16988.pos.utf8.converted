A friend of mine turned me on this product - usually bought from WMart.  Amazon's price is very competitive and you probably don't have tax and no shipping.  I usually eat this snack each day or every other day - so I'm glad Amazon offers this 6-pack.<br /><br />This product has a wide array of nuts...just enough raisins and chocolate chips.  Some products will put too many raisins to fill the container - but not this product.<br /><br />The individual nuts can come from various countries - and it is listed on the back of the package in case you are interested.<br /><br />The pouch is a resealable 7 oz pouch that you can tuck in to your computer bag or purse.<br /><br />I have not tried any other "organic" trail mix to compare against, but compared against non-organic - I love this stuff!<br /><br />Update:  I have found that the Sunflower seeds tend to end up at the bottom of the bag if you don't mix it up real good or dig down when grabbing a handful.  I don't "think" they put too many in there, I just think its the way the bag shakes out.
