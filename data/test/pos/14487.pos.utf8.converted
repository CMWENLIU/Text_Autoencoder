as soon as i start feeling bloated and depressed every month i start drinking a cup or two of this a day and start feeling better.  i normally drink very strong, usually bitter teas and the taste of this one isn't the best. but if i use one bag of this and one bag of peach (i'm sure peppermint or some other fruity type) and the taste isn't an issue. i had gone to the store to look for midol and found that it contains an antihistime.  i didn't even bother finding out why but just looked for alternatives.  i already take allergy medicine i don't need more antihistime in my body.  i don't believe this is a placebo effect but if it is it helps so either way you win.
