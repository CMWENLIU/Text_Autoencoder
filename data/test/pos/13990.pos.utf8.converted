I've reviewed the peppermint truffle cremes before.  They're deliciously decadent.  I recently ordered this 24oz tub.  It didn't last a month.  What did you have for breakfast? truffle creme.  What did you have for lunch?  truffle creme.  What did you have for dinner? 2 truffle cremes. Can you say addictive?  My advice?  Have a family member who doesn't like mint, chocolate, or both, if such a person exists, hide the tub from you.  It's your only hope. ;D
