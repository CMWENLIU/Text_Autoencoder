I'm what you may call a cream soda buff.  I love it, it's always been my favorite flavor... and no soda will taste quite as good as the cane sugar varieties, but I'm sort of on a caloric budget, and cannot afford to go drinking all my calories.<br /><br />I love this stuff.  It's great, perhaps it's an aquired taste, but I've been drinking naturally diet sodas for over a year, and I was so excited to try the cream soda version.  I prefer it over all the other flavors (I haven't tried grape yet, that's my next priority).<br /><br />I tried a few other brands of stevia and xylitol flavored cream sodas and none of them match up to this one.  I say it's definitely worth a try.<br /><br />****UPDATE (8/8/2011)***  I'm irritated.  I'm not mad at the product, it's still delicious; but when I got the package I ordered from Amazon.com, it had been through a lot.  It was smashed on one side, and sure enough, 3 of the sodas were ruined, had exploded all over the other sodas, and many had been deformed due to some horrific accident.  Amazon... I have never had such a horrible problem from you before, but this is my first food purchase.  It makes me very unlikely to order another food ESPECIALLY beverage package again, and I'm a pretty frequent customer.  I wish you would make it right.  I realize it may have been the mail carrier, but perhaps Amazon needs to package the beverages better or put a Fragile sign on it or something.  Just a suggestion.  Sad day for my delicious cream sodas.
