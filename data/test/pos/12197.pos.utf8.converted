The perfect size and taste for my gum-ball machine.  While the original gum-balls I had for my machine were large, these are a bit smaller than I expected.. but I have found that I enjoy the size and taste of these MUCH more than any other gum-balls I have purchased.<br /><br />And it isn't just me, my friends literally twist and twist and TWIST the dial on my machine trying like mad to get as many into their mouths as they can... yes, they are that delicious.
