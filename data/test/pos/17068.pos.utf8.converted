I started using powder milk only recently with great satisfaction.  Store bought milk just stayed in the refrigerator until it was time to be tossed.  I think this was because when I opened the cap, the scent was overwhelming and the taste was just milk. Dry milk in the stores looked unsightly with cheap packaging.  You could see several bags already torn and powder leaking from the bag and onto the shelf. The stores are not pushing powder milk sales.<br /><br />Since I started using dry milk, I found out that I was in control of the amount of water and powder I wanted to use.  I have used more milk in the last few months that I have used in the last 40 years.  My husband and I love it.  No waste and always fresh looking and smelling. Best of all, it is a good source of protein.<br /><br />The Now Foods Non Fat Dry milk powder is easy to use: one cup powder and 4 cups water to make a quart.  I use a four quart cooking pot, pour 2 cups water then 1/2 cup powder and let it settle.  Then 2 cups water and the rest of the powder.  I use a whisk because I don't like using a mixer. I check the whisk frequently for milk clumps.  When done, I let the solution stand for a couple of minutes to let the bubbles settle and then pour the solution into a BPA free container and place it in the refrig.  Don't worry about extra air bubbles as they will disappear when the milk container is cold. Easy and fast cleanup.<br /><br />With gas prices clinbing up, milk prices will rise too.  Don't worry about shortages as you have a supply of milk powder and fresh water to make great tasting milk.  I will never go back to fresh milk.
