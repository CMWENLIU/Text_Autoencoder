I ordered these for my wife for Valentines Day and she loved them.  We have a hard time finding just Brazil Nuts in a package and if you do find them, they are normally way to expensive.  These were great tasting Brazil Nuts at a reasonable price.  They shipped quickly and were very fresh when we opened them.<br /><br />I would definitely order these again!!!!!
