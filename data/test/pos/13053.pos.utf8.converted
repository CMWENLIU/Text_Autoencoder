I've been ordering these direct for a couple of years and am glad to find they're now sold by Amazon (so I can use Amazon gift certificates!). They are intensely flavored freeze-dried strawberries and they will make even the most boring cereal (say, Shredded Wheat & Bran) tasty enough to eat every day. Just try not to eat them straight from the container or they'll be gone in no time. I agree with another reviewer who advised putting them into an airtight container; otherwise, if you live in a humid area you can end up with a sticky, stale mess.<br /><br />Unfortunately they are really expensive but hey, they have definitely upped my fruit intake. I recommend the blueberries too.
