During a period in my life, when my health was poor, I was introduced to the Macrobiotic Way of Life. One of the healing drinks includes the use of Umeboshi Plums. Salty and different from anything I'd ever tasted, I was almost afraid to try them. The drink includes, 1/2 of an Umeboshi plum, (there is a pit which you use the following day along with the other half of the plum), 1/2 teaspoon of Kuzu Root, in 10 oz. of water. Chop the plum into small pieces, add a few drops of Shoyu Soy Sauce and bring it to a slow simmer. Keep it on low, stirring constantly until the water turns from a milky white to opaque. Pour into a coffee cup and drink like a tea. This drink balances the body and strengthens the entire digestive system. It cleanses the blood. It is to be drunk only once a day, in the morning on an empty stomach. This, along with a vegan diet helps to heal many blood disorders. I would suggest also reading, The Macrobiotic Way, by Michio Kushi to understand the principles of the diet.<br /><br />As a diabetic, this drink became extremely important to me. It lowers my blood sugars dramatically. I have reduced my need for insulin to less than half of what I was using. Consider using them if you want to reduce blood sugar readings, or simply cleanse the blood. They are somewhat expensive. However, there are enough plums to last more than a month.
