When I first started using this product yes, the grain was coarser but around 6 months ago, they improved that. The price initially enticed me to this product (currently about 80 cents cheaper/lb. than BRM) , but the *no sulfites* keep me coming back. Two major factors that attracted me to coconut flour were high fiber and low oxalate. I believe it's also lower in sugar on the GI/GL tables. It's also nice that there are 6 bags per carton - don't have to order it that often (vs. 4 bag cartons).<br /><br />There was a learning curve when I first switched (hint: bump your leavening up) in spite of buying Fife's coconut cookbook; don't waste your money unless you have no concerns over cholesterol and eating exorbitant amounts of eggs. I substitute flax "goop" from ground flax seed (and water) and knock the egg requirements down by at least 1/2 or 2/3! Initially, I used only coconut flour for all my baking and pancakes; I even put a Tlb. in my rice farina. Recently though, I have branched out to adding rice and/or tapioca flours to make my own gluten-free flour blend. Tip: Go to an Asian supermarket for the rice flour (non-glutenous type has less starch) and tapioca flour if you're on a budget. Also, sift your flours 3x before using/baking.<br /><br />Yes, it's more work and more money than wheat flour, but my quality of life has improved drastically and that's worth it!!!
