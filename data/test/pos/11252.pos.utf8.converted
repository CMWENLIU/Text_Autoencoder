This is the real deal people.  This is real Jamaican Coffee.  There are a few brands that claim to be from Blue Mountain, but they do not have that authentic taste.  My wife is Jamaican and we have been to Jamaica a few  times, but I never seem to bring back enough coffee so  I set out to find a brand here in the states that would be atleast close to what you get in Jamiaca and this is it.  Wow what flavor!
