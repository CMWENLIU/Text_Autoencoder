Brilliant. An amazing deal if you plan on actually using it instead of just collecting it on the shelf because it takes so very little each time. A single drop diluted in maybe 1/2 cup of some other fluid takes it below so-insane-you-will-regret-tasting-it hot. As a reference point, since people's heat tolerance differs, I use about 2/3 tsp of the regular Dave's Insanity on a burger with no ill effect. So if you're in the same region, dilute less at your own peril. Also it stains like nobody's business so watch your clothing/kitchen table.
