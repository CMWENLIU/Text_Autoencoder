I first bought a Java teeccino at my local health co-op.  I liked it a lot, but was curious about the other flavors.  So I got the sampler pack from teeccino online so I could try all the flavors.<br /><br />Vanilla nut is a nice flavor.  Truthfully some of the flavors do not seem to be differentiated from each other, but this one definitely has it's own flavor profile.  I keep coming up with "vanilla coconut" when I taste it.  If you are looking for something to taste as close as possible to Coffee - this isn't the flavor.  I would suggest Maya Caffe for the closest flavor to coffee.  But this vanilla nut is very enjoyable in its own right.<br /><br />This beverage is a nice alternative to coffee.  No it does not taste like coffee exactly.  It has it's own taste and feel.  But I'm finding that I REALLY enjoy drinking it for the flavor it does have.  The only negative aspect is that it does contain more calories than coffee or tea.  However, the way I feel after I drink it (in comparison to coffee) far outweighs the small calorie content.<br /><br />I use 1 TB in my french press and about 12oz of water boiled in my tea kettle.  Such a quick, easy, inexpensive and enjoyable method of brewing.<br /><br />I would reccommend the sampler pack (free shipping) from the teeccino website and then order your favorite flavors through subscribe and save on amazon.  That will give you the best price.
