This is a geat seasoning. Use it sparingly at first. I find that the simplest pasta recipe involving Colatura may well be the best (3 parts excellent olive oil with garlic sauteed lightly, 1 part colatura, pinch of red pepper flakes, touch of parsley, salt & pepper to taste, toss pasta in this sauce). Distinctly different from (and better than) using the best available bottled anchovies.
