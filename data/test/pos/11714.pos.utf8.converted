Great product. No sugar added which is a real plus. This way I can sweeten if I choose to using the sweetener of MY choice. Great to add to mac n' cheese sauce or other sauces which gives kids (and adults) added protein to their food without altering taste. Makes great fruit smoothies too. Some of my grandchildren don't like to eat meat, so this is a great way to get protein into their meal. My family has no clue all the things that I have added this to. Now I don't worry if they are getting enough protein in their diet.
