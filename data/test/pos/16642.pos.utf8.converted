This is a lot of coffee for the price. Very nice flavor. It's a darker bean but not a full on dark roast to me. Coffee oils present on the beans when you open the bag. Adds taste. Not bitter at all and a real good buy that I'm happy with and will buy again.<br /><br />Update:<br />On second thought I would call a this a true dark roast. What confused me was this is a good one. Darks usually are bitter to me. I always thought many producers put in additives for the dark flavor. Not one I find too pleasant usually. I've been avoiding dark roasts for a while and now found a good one. Good quality at a price that is hard to beat. Oils on the beans really flavor it up! Good smoother dark roast. 5 lbs of Quality.<br /><br />So two years later I'm still buying this coffee. I have ordered for other people because I have Prime and every time the comment is "That is a giant bag." and then "I told you it was five pounds when I ordered."  Five pounds in person is a lot. This really is a bargain. All have liked it. The other flavors are good too.
