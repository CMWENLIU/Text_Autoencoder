This is a wonderful product for those who do not like/tolerate real milk and/or soy milk.  Since I was little, I have disliked the consistency and taste of milk.  While there are a variety of soy milks in various flavors, I find most to be of a thin consistency and overly flavored.  When So Delicious came out with their unsweetened and original coconut milk flavors, I was ecstatic. The consistency was like real milk but had a flavor I actually enjoyed.<br /><br />These little So Delicious shelf stable containers are perfect for work or an outing.  I love the convenience of a grab and go container.<br /><br />Until 2010, it had been years since I had cereal with a bowl of milk.  Now, I regularly pair cereal with So Delicious.  Whether consumed on its own or with cereal, this product is just awesome. I regularly use it in recipes in place of milk and have even made a pudding with it.<br /><br />So Delicious Unsweetened has 50 calories per cup and the Original flavor has 80 calories per cup.  While So Delicious has a significant amount of saturated fat, it is a good form of saturated fat that can actually help a person maintain a healthy weight.  The saturated fat in So Delicious are medium-chain-fatty-acids and your body uses these MCFAs as energy.<br /><br />So Delicious has three various flavors of coconut milk and while I started with the So Delicious Vanilla and Original Flavors, I now prefer the 50 calorie unsweetened option.<br /><br />So Delicious is vegan, soy free and lactose free.
