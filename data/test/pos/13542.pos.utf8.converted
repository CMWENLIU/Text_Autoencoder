I had never heard of preserved lemons before when I decided to try what I later found out was a Moroccan recipes called Chicken with Lemon and Olives. I think I now have a new addiction as I almost finished all of them. The lemon flavor is mellower than a fresh lemon (and I like fresh lemons) but in combination with the salt still gives it a nice lip puckering sour taste that is good with chicken, couscous, and just as a very salty snack.
