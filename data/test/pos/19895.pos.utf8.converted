This is a very high quality product, which can be used in many things, from smoothies, to Raw desserts, or even as a very nutritious satisfying snack. I noticed that people had noted the horrible taste, etc... You have to be prepared for the fact that real Cacao is not sweetened, and can be rather bitter. However, if you want to get the full benefit from Cacao then this is the best form to get it in. As processed Cacao, loses much of its nutritional benefits. I would suggest mixing the Cacao nibs with a natural sweetener such as Raw Agave, to make more palatable, etc... Although, I think they are very good by themselves. To your health, and well being. Enjoy!
