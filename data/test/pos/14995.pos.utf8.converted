This is definitely different than any other raw honey I've tried, and its fantastic, with three small kids i can't afford to be sick and a few spoonfuls of this stuff a day helps soothe a sore throat when I'm dealing with an innless or scratchy throat from allergies, and i could swear it also boosts my mood and energy. It also seems to help digestive problems, i started taking a tablespoon a day preventatively and was pleasantly surprised to be the only member of my family not laid low by a heinous stomach bug that swept through our home. I also love that this stuff doesn't have to be chiseled out of the jar like some raw honey. totally with the money, and this is the cheapest place to get it that i have found. My local whole foods charges almost double for the stuff!
