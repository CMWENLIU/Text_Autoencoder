I have been battling cat vomit for the last couple of years.  I have tried many foods (Iams, Newman's Own, HALO Spot, etc.).  My cats would either not eat it or would vomit several times a week.<br /><br />This stuff is amazing.  My cats are not only NOT vomiting, but they are eating less, drinking less and are much happier and more energetic.<br /><br />Before this food, one of my cats had chronic diarrhea.  Since they started eating this (3 weeks ago), his stool has firmed up to some extent (not where I'd like it, but better).
