The "Hobnob" is a Johnny-come-lately member of the upper echelons of the British biscuit market. Introduced only in 1984, this young upstart has nevertheless firmly established itself in the hearts (and mouths!) of the British biscuit-buying public, alongside the more traditional classics like the 300-odd-year old "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VJLARC">Rich Tea</a>" and the 130-year old "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZYB4W">Digestive</a>".  It is sweeter and chewier than many other British biscuits, made from a mix of rolled and jumbo oats, in many ways presenting itself as something of a hybrid between a digestive biscuit and a flapjack. It may seem very dry to anyone brought up with cookies (rather than biscuits) and -- like most British biscuits -- "Hobnobs" are best eaten with a cup of tea.  Needless to say, they make excellent dunking biscuits (although being quite flaky, they have a rather messy tendency to shed oat crumbs into the drink).<br /><br />"Hobnobs" are decidedly more addictive than traditional British biscuits (no doubt due to their sweetness) and there is nothing truer than McVitie's original advertising line for this product: "one nibble and you're nobbled". A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5GL2">multipack</a> may therefore be worth considering, unless, of course, you're dieting, in which case you would do well to avoid them entirely!
