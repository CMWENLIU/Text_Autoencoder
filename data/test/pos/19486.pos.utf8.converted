Ingredient list: Rice Flour, Almonds, Potato Starch, Expeller Pressed Safflower, Sea Salt, Natural Almond Flavor, and Butter Flavor.<br /><br />I got hooked on Mr. Krispers toasted almond chips, but when they got discontinued, I had to find a new, wheat and gluten-free snack. Voila - Blue Diamond Almond Nut Thins! Blue Diamond has improved on an already great snack with a "Hint of Sea Salt" version that is still plenty salty for me. With only 80 mg. of salt per serving (less if you consider the amount left over at the bottom of the bag), it makes a very delicious treat that sometimes I find myself consuming the entire box instead of limiting myself to 17 crackers! I'm positively addicted. I've also tried the Hazelnut Thins, which are also quite delicious, but the Almond Nut Thins are my favorite.
