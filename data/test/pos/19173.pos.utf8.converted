First, for all of you who have been looking for this product, Nestle's had a problem with their production.  It will not be available until they get their act together.<br /><br />Second, I have tried many instant, non-fat powdered milk brands and this is still my favorite.  I bought the Saco brand at Christmas, and while it was good, it is a bit different than the Carnation brand.<br /><br />Third, I don't think it's over-priced.  Dairy has risen and will continue to rise because they are using corn for fuel instead of feeding it to the cows.  I live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and I don't believe I have ever seen a box this big even offered in any of the stores I frequent.  This size combined with free shipping--I think it's a great bargain.<br /><br />If you keep it in your freezer and take it out as you need it, it will have a better flavor than leaving it on the shelf.  This goes for all powdered milks.  I even keep my homemade hot chocolate mix in the freezer for the same reason.<br /><br />I hope it becomes available soon!  Amazon, thanks for offering it for sale!
