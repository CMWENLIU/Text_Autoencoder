I am writing this review after four weeks of using this multiple times daily. We love it.<br /><br />Yes, it makes a bit of noise when taking water from the reservoir, but it's only for a tiny bit of time and to be honest, I don't even notice it anymore, even if my husband is using it in the middle of the night while I'm sleeping in the next room with open doors between us.<br /><br />Although I'm American, I don't currently live in the US and so the variety of available K-cups is dismal (or at least the ones that can be shipped to me without paying a fortune in extra costs, that is). And so we use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW">ekobrew Cup, refillable filter for Keurig Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a> and it works perfectly. Now we can have any coffee grounds we want and can buy it locally but still have it work in our Keurig.<br /><br />My big concern when getting a Keurig is that I thought the main selling point was that it was instant brewing, but I didn't want a machine that had to constantly be plugged in and on and drawing on electricity. We have switches above every outlet in our house so that we can turn them on or off at our convenience without unplugging each appliance. As such, I always have all currently unused electronics plugged in but not receiving electricity until we need to use it. I thought that doing this with the Keurig would negate the instant brewing purpose, and if we didn't have that then why not just get a regular coffee maker? I gave into my husband anyway and we set this one up immediately and I soon realized that even from a totally turned off position, the time from setting up to a steaming cup of coffee is still extremely minimal. In fact, I turn it on, prep the ekobrew cup, grab a mug, and by then the water is heated and ready. I don't even notice a wait time.<br /><br />Even though this model doesn't have an iced coffee setting, it is one of my favorite things to make and easy. To defeat the watered down taste from the ice cubes, I just bought really strong coffee to mix with the vanilla grounds I like the best for iced coffees. If I'm making 6oz, then I put just a little bit of strong grounds, and if I'm making 10oz then I usually mix the grounds half and half. Works every time.<br /><br />The only bad thing that has come with this Keurig is the fact that my coffee consumption has skyrocketed since I work from home. It's just TOO easy to make so I can't even use the excuse that I don't have time during my work to step away and make a cup because it's even faster than my bathroom breaks :)
