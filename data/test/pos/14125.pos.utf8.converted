Bought these because they had the extra promotion and since i was going back to school, i needed something for the mornings when i'm on the run. These cookies are great. They taste great, i haven't had any problems with them crumbling ( i heat them to 18secs in the microwave) and for someone who eats every 3hours because of a high metabolism, these do fill me up till lunch time. I prefer these to cereal. I tend to eat them when i'm driving and they pair up great with milk. So instead of running to class because i'm late, i pop this into the microwave and unwrap it in the car. These double chocolate chunk ones and and the apple cinnamon ones are my favorite. i'll be ordering more of these.
