My wife discovered the Danielle Sweet Mango Chips at a Cost Plus World Market.  I hate to think of the fuel we burned going to every one of their markets in the Seattle area looking for more.<br /><br />The Mango chips are outstanding - intense flavor, good crunch - with the added bonus of being sugar,gluten and preservative free.<br /><br />Having owned a restaurant in Mexico which had a huge mango tree in the patio. I learned how great the naturally ripened fruit really tastes. Most of the mangos we find in markets here are still green and lack the mature, well-developed flavor of tree-ripened fruit. The Danielle Sweet Mango Chips capture the pure essence of ripe mango flavor!<br /><br />We'll be setting up a recurring order with Amazon so that we'll never have to be without our favorite snack.
