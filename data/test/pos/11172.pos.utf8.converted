I did a lot of reading on cat food after my picky Siamese mix started losing weight slowly since she refused to eat anything my local grocery stores offered, including the more expensive brands.  No matter how much I seemed to spend on what passes for "regular" cat foods she looked terrible.<br /><br />It is definitely a dense food, but that just means I fill up the bowl less often - usually once a day, down from two or more when my younger cat was eating constantly because the food I gave them had so little real food in it!  From the way my cats' condition has improved, it appears to be a very healthy food as well.  I saw the difference in my Siamese mix's coat less than a week after switching from what was basically fish flavored corn cereal to this - her coat is shiny again and she has definitely gained back some weight on Blue Wilderness.  My cats will push each other out of the way to have the first bite after their bowl is empty.  My picky eater even eats Blue Wilderness kibble straight from the floor if it's given as a treat.<br /><br />I have tried several other "holistic" and "real food" cat foods, but this one is definitely the most preferred by me (Amazon.com makes it very affordable compared to my local pet stores) and my two cats.  I am happy to have found a somewhat reasonably priced, nutritious cat food - most cat foods belong in the cereal aisle or are so expensive that I would probably have to sell my car to afford them.  Blue Wilderness strikes a nice balance.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />When I got my new kitten recently (that makes three cats total now), I noticed that Blue Wilderness is now making a kitten formula of this food (not yet available on Amazon.)  I picked some up at a local Petsmart for the new arrival.  This food must have a good reputation outside of my own opinion, because when I told my vet what I was feeding my kitten, he put away a free sample of a lesser quality "vet recommended" food he had offered me without another word.<br /><br />I have tried many other grain free foods over the last year or so and Blue Wilderness is still my go-to food.  I've never had any issues and my cats enjoy both the bagged and canned varieties.  It's nice that it has a lot of flavors to rotate through so that they don't get bored.
