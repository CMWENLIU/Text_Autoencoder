I recently bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VX7VJO">Breville BKC600XL Gourmet Single-Cup Coffee Brewer</a>, which I love, and found a wide variety of 5 pack K-Cup samplers at Keurig.com.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J4IDP6">Gloria Jean's Coffee, Mudslide, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> was in the Flavored Coffee sampler and there's one word that says how I feel about it - YUM! I used the 9 oz setting, which worked well, and the smell coming out of the brewer was heavenly. It has a very rich chocolate taste that reminded me of brownies and fudge. I added a little Coffee Mate Vanilla creamer and a shot of DeKuyper Butterscotch Schnapps - wow! It was so good I could have drank three of them. Unfortunately there was only one, but there will be more in a few days when the two boxes I ordered arrive!
