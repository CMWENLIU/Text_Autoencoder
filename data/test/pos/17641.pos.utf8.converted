Both of the reviews on this product so far unfairly give one star as both contain incorrect information.  I enjoy these peaches, so I investigated.  I wrote to the Edward & Sons company and they verified that 1) Their cans do NOT contain BPA, and 2) Their organic certification for peaches grown in China comes from familar bodies.  They state: "Our organics out of China are certified by 3 groups, all following the EU/USDA standards: IMO (Institute for Marketecology), Ecocert, and BCS (a German certifying body)"<br /><br />These peaches are really delicious, highly recommended.
