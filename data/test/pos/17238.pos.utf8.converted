After my experience with the Amedei Limited Edition Chuao bar, also available on Amazon, I had to expand my horizons with Amedei and will endeavor to write reviews on all of their products. For those of you who have tried Amedei products before, you'll recognize this as blatant self-serving, but for the rest of you let me assure you that I only have the most noble of motives - to provide an honest review based upon personal experience.<br /><br />That being said, I must admit that I have become a fan of this company. Everything I've tried so far from this company has been of extraordinarily high quality, and these continue that trend.<br /><br />As noted, I first tried the Chuao bar, and had accordingly high expectations of the Amedei Limited Edition Porcelana Bar.  I was not going to be disappointed.  The difference between the Chuao bar and the Porcelana bar is like that of day and night.  While the Chuao bar is like a day in an exotic tropical wilderness, the Porcelana bar is relatively dark, quiet and seductive, reminiscent of the femme fatale in a noir film.  There is a bitterness to the chocolate that all dark chocolates have, but with this bar you must be paying attention to it to really notice the subtle presence that seems to have been there all along; by then you're so in love with the chocolate you could care less.  The chocolate melts evenly, wrapping itself around your tongue and mouth, sweetly imparting fine flavors to the palate.  It would be difficult to explain the amazing differences between this chocolate and those fine chocolates available in, say, a nice department store.  The best way I can put it is this:  Imagine that you're in a fine, upscale bar chatting with a local beauty, when from behind you a supermodel sneaks up to you, gently places her arm across your shoulders, and purrs softly in your ear, "Would you mind doing me a favor...?"  For those who think they prefer milk chocolate over dark, give this bar a try.  You won't be disappointed.  Well, at least not until you go back to your old favorite milk chocolate....<br /><br />As with any order from Amedei, it will be shipped with ice packs to preserve the integrity of the chocolate but has the unfortunate effect of driving up the total cost of shipping. Anticipate a significant shipping charge if ordering just one item. My recommendation is to order several items to spread out and justify this cost, which only makes sense as this chocolate is too good not to share with friends!
