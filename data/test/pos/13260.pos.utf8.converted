This is an excellent addition to any chef/cooks kitchen, as my husbaqnd is a chef and I am a baker, we find many excellent uses for it!! Yes, it is hard to find, but this price is reasonable to the prices I've found it for in the Korean markets. Yuzu is SO flavorful (truly something you have to taste for yourself to believe!), a very nice, pure and clean citrus flavor withouit any of the bitterness! Great with seafoods, crab cakes, desserts, etc! Substitute it for lemon juice in any recipe and the flavor is a tremendous difference! Please give this a try!! Just a note, if you store in the top/back of fridge, it does seem to freeze easily, so beware!
