My dogs, a shepherd/lab mix and cattle dog mix, have done well on this food.<br /><br />The maker has improved this line recently.  It is on the "Approved" list for 2009 in Whole Dog Journal.<br /><br />What makes it good dog food?<br /><br />-No by-products, unnamed animal components, bone meal, wheat, corn, soy, sweeteners, artificial colors or flavors.<br />-Decent meat content.  Chicken is the first ingredient, but more importantly chicken meal is the second ingredient.<br />-Good nutrient values:  %26 protein;  %4 fiber; 5:1  Omega 6 to Omega 3 fatty acid ratio.  Just right for my pups.<br />-It is a great value.<br />-My dogs love it and seem to thrive on it.<br /><br />I've worn myself out trying to find a very solid reasonably-priced food with a fine ingredient list that doesn't have  objectionable ingredients.  This one is right on the money.
