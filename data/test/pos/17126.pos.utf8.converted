I wanted flax and, boy, did I ever get it!  The reviewer who said only one 40-ounce canister is included in this offer was wrong.  (Maybe he should inquire further about his order.)  I received TWO 40-ounce canisters, and that is a lot of flax!  Included inside each canister is a 2-ounce measurer (like you use with coffee), which is very convenient.  Also, I was pleased to read that because this is a cold-milled flax. it does not require refrigeration, unless you want to.  I am enjoying it mixed in my applesauce (gives it a thicker texture that I like) and sprinkled on my peanut butter on toast (gives the peanut butter a nutty texture).  This is an introduction to flax for me (and I guess I will be a pro at using it by the time I have used 80 ounces!).  I am glad I chose this particular product as my first experience with it.
