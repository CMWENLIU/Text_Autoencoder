Like other reviewers, these are most enjoyable to me.  Until fairly recently, the 1-lb 14-oz container was available at a great price from our local warehouse club.  Today however, only the chocolate flavor and in some stores for the holidays the gingerbread flavor is available.  I do enjoy these but the "Originali" is my runaway favorite.  The sources for the 1-lb 14-oz container show prices 40% higher than the warehouse club, and then you have to add unreasonable shipping amounts.  So the deal now is the 12-pack of boxes of 8 for a total of 96 biscotti at a price rivaling the warehouse club.
