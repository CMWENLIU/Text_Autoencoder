To be honest, for the price, this is very good Balsamic Vinegar.  I know that the price is rather low for quality vinegar and I was a bit leery of that aspect being a firm believer in that you get what you pay for.  In this case that old saying just did not apply.  As inexpensive as this is, the quality is actually quite high.<br /><br />I use quite a lot of this stuff in my cooking and a very large number of my salad dressings have this as an ingredient.  It would take an extremely sophisticated taste to tell this product from the more expensive vinegars and for everyday cooking I find that this Manicardi #12 more than fits the bill. Frankly, I was rather amazed at what I got for my money here.<br /><br />Like all Balsamic Vinegars, it takes a bit of experience to know where the cut off point is and where too much is too much...this product is no exception to that rule.  A light hand at first is the best policy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this.  You get the taste  you want, the essence, without having to sell off an expensive piece of jewelry each time you cook or whip a salad into being.
