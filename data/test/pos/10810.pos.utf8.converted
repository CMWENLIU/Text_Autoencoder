This is the best tonic. I orginally tried it because it was "natural". But, I love it because it is awesome!!  Much less sweet than the other brands. Crips and light.  When I first tried it I was confused. My vodka tonic was so light. I thought I had addeded too much vodka - as if. But, nope it's the Q. I love that the product has way less calories and a lower glycemic index.
