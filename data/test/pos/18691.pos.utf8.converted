Seriously. We were against the sugary, artificially flavored fruit snacks that my daughter liked to eat and decided to break that habit when my second child was born - after all, we knew he'd eat the same things she did! They both adore these yummy, naturally flavored snacks and they come in either bigger bags for travel or smaller snack sized packs for convenience. I just wish the Tasty Baby range was bigger!
