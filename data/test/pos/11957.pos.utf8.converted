This tea is the perfect wake-up beverage when I stumble out of bed.  It really does give you that much-needed "oomph" to start out with.  I recently weaned myself from coffee and a friend suggested Twinings.  I bought the sampler package and settled on two favorites; Irish Breakfast in the mornings and Lady Grey in the afternoon.  It is rather strong though, depending on how long you let it steep.  I would suggest the minimum the first time just to get an idea of the flavor; at first I used a little half-and-half and a dallop of honey, but now I prefer it straight-up, just because I don't have that kind of time.
