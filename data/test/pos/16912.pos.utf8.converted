I first came across the Natural Balance dog food rolls while in obedience class with my first dog.  She could be picky about the treats, but a few weeks into class one of the trainers tried giving a small piece of roll to her.  She LOVED it and would do ANYTHING for it!  After that I immediately went out and bought one, and have used it to help train my second dog, too.  The best way for using it as a treat is to cut off a small slice (maybe a quarter-inch thick), then cut that into small squares to make them bite size.  Perfect for dog training!<br /><br />Another way I use it now is with the dog food.  I don't use it as a straight feed for my dogs because it would cost me too much.  I found what works great is adding it to their dry food.  I feed my dogs Natural Balance Ultra Premium Dog Food and I use a grater/shredder and shred some of the roll and mix it in with their food.  Even the pickiest of eaters will probably eat their food then.
