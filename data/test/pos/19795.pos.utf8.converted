Hi, I am on a special diet that requires that I don't have any sugar.  I can use the Stevia products and love this chocolate raspberry in green tea made as ice tea.  You can sip on it all day long and never get sick of it.  This is my favorite along with the rootbeer one in green tea.  Have a great day!
