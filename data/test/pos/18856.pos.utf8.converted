I starting eating Brazil nuts daily about 3 years ago after reading the Mayo Clinic thought they might be helpful for middle aged women with arthritis in their knees.  Brazil nuts are loaded with selenium, magnesium, & copper, making them a very healthy food.  My knees have improved, but don't know if the Brazil nuts had anything to do with it.  I'd never eaten them before, but have come to really like them.  I've tried several brands from different websites, but have found these to be the best.  I also like the fact that Amazon offers free shipping on orders over $25.  Other websites can charge almost as much for postage as for the nuts.
