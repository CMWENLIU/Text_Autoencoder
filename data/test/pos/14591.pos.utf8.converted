I've been trying a number of the Haribo gummi candies since I found them here on Amazon: grapefruit slices (white and pink), fruit salad, raspberries, golden bears, sugar free bears (intestinal nightmare) and these mini frogs.  No, I don't eat entire 5 lb bags by myself, I take them to work and give my coworkers sugar rushes :)  Of all of them the frogs are what I come back to time and again, and I get the most requests for from my coworkers.  I'm not sure if its the size or the foam, but something about them puts them above the rest in my book.<br /><br />The golden bears are a close second.
