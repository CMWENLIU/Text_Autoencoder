I really like prayer plants and was interested in buying a red one.  I decided to purchase these since I was having trouble finding one locally.  They arrived quickly by priority mail.  The 4 inch pots had tape around the top to keep the soil in place and the box they were in was full of packing peanuts.  Be prepared to repot the plants within the week, 4 inch pots are a bit small.<br /><br />The green plant was much larger than the red one.  The green one was also blooming (they arrived in September.)  After repotting both plants they are both thriving and growing like weeds.  They like light, but not direct sun.  The green one folds its leaves more tightly than the red at night.<br /><br />The only thing that would have improved the purchase experience whould have been if Hirt's Gardens had included a care sheet for the plants.
