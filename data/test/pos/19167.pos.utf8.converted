We Received the Nifty 54 Coffee Pod Drawer and I could not wait to use. I love the black mesh design and it is very sturdy. I had a chrome carousel which was nice but only held 24 K-CUPS.  This drawer holds 96 and I can now separate my teas and flavored coffees from non-flavored coffees. It also has a small enough foot print to sit next to my Keurig.  I would recommend this drawer to anyone.
