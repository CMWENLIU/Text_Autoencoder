Just delighted with this product!  I make popsicles all the time, usually using just fruit juice, or a combo of fruit + juice. Without guar gum the popsicles are still tasty, but the ice crystals are annoying. WITH just a tiny bit of this product -- wow, what a difference!! The bars have no ice crystals at all, and have a creamier consistency. I poured about 3 cups of juice into my blender, and added a scant teaspoon of guar gum, processed it on low for a few seconds; poured it into popsicle molds and my boy friend was ecstatic with the results! Can't wait to add a bit to our homemade ice creams too!
