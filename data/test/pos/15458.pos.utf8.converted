I've been searching for a quality canned crab since the mid-80's. I happened to stumble across somebody that mentioned Miller's in a forum.<br />Miller's has several types of canned crab and I recommend you pay extra for the Lump. It comes in whole snow white crab sections in the can. Much nicer than the product picture. Fantastic quality for canned crab.
