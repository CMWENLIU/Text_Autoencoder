These Payday Peanut Caramel candy bars were very yummy. I don't know why the first description of the product says 8 bars. A bit further down in the details it does tell you 18 bars. $17.51 for 8 candy bars would be a rip off. But you get 18 King Size candy bars, which equals 36 regular size. So the price, with the free s/h is a good deal. I would buy again.
