I've been buying product from Back to Nature for a while.  I have to buy them from Amazon because there is no Whole Foods or other natural grocery store in the near vicinity.  I love these cashews.  They have strong flavor.  They are always fresh and crunchy.  I've bought other brands and the nuts were tasteless and a bit rubbery sort of like humidity had gotten to them.  Never happens with this brand.  Great taste and great value.  I would recommend them to everyone.
