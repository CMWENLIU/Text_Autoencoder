I love this milk!!  Like many others that wrote reviews, I don't use very much milk and was looking for a more economical way of buying it.  This really fits the bill.  I think it tastes great and works well with cereal.<br /><br />Some folks mentioned they had trouble mixing it.  I found using a Tupperware Quick Shake container (holds 2 cups) works well.  I pour in 1 3/4 cups of water and 1/4 cup of powdered milk.  Then all you have to do is give it a quick shake and chill.
