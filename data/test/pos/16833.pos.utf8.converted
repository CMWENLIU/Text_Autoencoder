I'm a sardine purist in that I typically prefer my sardines with little more than olive oil and perhaps a hint of smoke. I found myself in the canned fish section of the local supermarket and was tempted to try something new. While there normally would be something off-putting if not downright scary about anything that comes in a "sweet and tangy sauce", I figured what the hell and took home a tin. I'm glad I did. The sardines are filleted completely without and bones. The texture was middle of the road. The could be easily picked up with fingers without fear of breaking, but just as easily given a quick mash with the tines of a fork. The meat was a little darker than most, probably from the sauce, and has a nice robust flavor but without smelling fishy. The sauce was thin and clear, mostly oil obviously, but tinted brick red. There was an ever so slight hint of heat but a definite but once again not overpowering vinegar tang. It's the perfect oil flavor to complement the bread for the active dipper. I've purchased these many times since.
