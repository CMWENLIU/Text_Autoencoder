We bought this meal to make healthy chicken nuggets, and it really tastes great. I like the nuggets even better than with breadcrumbs, and the kids loved them too. It really is more of a meal consistency, not like almond flour which is ground finer. To me this leaves a nice texture if you're using it to coat something. Great product.
