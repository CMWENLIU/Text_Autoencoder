I go through about a pound of unsweetened cocoa powder per month just eating it by the tablespoon as a snack and I'm so glad I found this.  Even though it's lightly Dutched with a ph of 6.8, this dark reddish brown cocoa is really chocolatey and noticeably acidic. The word "Superior" is actually part of the product name rather than simply a descriptive. Ghirardelli's natural cocoa is called "Merritas" ( ph 5.5 ) and "Sunrise" is more heavily Dutched ( ph 7.5 ).  [...]  I think this cocoa will work nicely in any capacity, from baking to hot cocoa. My order arrived in about one day via FedEx home, originating in Lewisberry, PA. And many thanks Pumpkin King for sharing your product images!
