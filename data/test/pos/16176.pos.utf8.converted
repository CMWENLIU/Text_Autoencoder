I have tried many coconut water and juices in my lifetime. I guess you could call me a coconut juice and water fan. I have tried coconut waters in Hawaii, South America, and many Asian countries such as Thailand. The best coconut water, in my opinion, are those that are produced from coconuts harvested and grown in Thailand. The coconuts from Taste Nirvana were harvested from Nakorn Pathom province. Taste Nirvana representatives are telling the truth when they say that the large Thai coconuts that they harvest produce a sweet taste. This is absolutely the best tasting coconut water, with or without pulp. I definitely feel nourished and better after I drink this Taste Nirvana coconut water because it helps restore electrolytes (Potassium, Magnesium, Sodium, Calcium, Chloride) in my system.<br /><br />I have tried Zico, O.N.E., C2O, Vita Coco, Amy and Brian, Nature Factor, Blue Monkey, Harvest Bay, Naked coconut juices and waters, and this Taste Nirvana coconut water honestly surpasses these brands when it comes to taste, texture, and replenishment factors. This Taste Nirvana coconut water contains all natural ingredients - natural coconut water and coconut pulp. Based on percentage in daily value - you get 12% Magnesium, 6% Calcium, 8% Vitamin C, 6% Iron, 28% Potassium (1000 mg - the amount of two whole bananas), zero cholesterol, no caffeine, no preservatives, 1.7 grams of protein, and 130 calories per can.<br /><br />Taste Nirvana's slogan - Happiness Inside - is actually true. The taste of this coconut water puts a smile on my face, and Thailand is known as the "Land of Smiles". It's really amusing and fun to pour this coconut water in a clear glass to see the floating pulp. It doesn't matter if you buy Taste Nirvana coconut water with or without pulp. Taste Nirvana have done a great job with their coconut water products and all of them taste great! As soon as I drink this Taste Nirvana coconut water, I feel hydrated. And when I order these Taste Nirvana packs of 12 from Amazon, one 12 pack is usually gone in a week's time, because my whole family loves this Taste Nirvana coconut water so much! Out of all the coconut waters that my family members have tried, Taste Nirvana is the one that disappears the quickest because everybody wants to grab a can right away! I strongly recommend Taste Nirvana's real coconut water with or without pulp. You really haven't had the best tasting and most satisfying coconut water refreshment until you've tried Taste Nirvana coconut water!
