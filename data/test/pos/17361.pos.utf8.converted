I bought Love n Bake Pistachio Paste for the first time last year at truffle making time and was delighted with the flavor. I've been making home made chocolate truffles from scratch for over 20 years, normally (in recent years) using Love n Bake Praline (hazelnut) Paste and decided to try pistachio on a batch. It was/is delicious. Someone's review mentioned the oil on top when the can is first opened, but that's the nature of the product. Both praline and pistachio MUST be stirred which is no easy chore since both are so thick. Worth the effort, though...for the quality of the product and the great flavoring. Plus you get a little upper body workout to counter the calories of the goodies you're creating! >&lt;>
