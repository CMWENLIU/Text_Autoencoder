I bought this honey after a friend suggested it to me to help calm my skin. I have mild but persistant acne and have been looking for ways to clear my skin without it being too harsh. Previously I had been on benzoyl peroxide 2% and it had helped my skin, but made it rough and discolored. I went off of the BP and started looking for other ways to combat my acne.<br /><br />I use the Manuka Honey as a mask (occasionally mixed with Aztec Indian Healing Clay, but often times just by itself) and it has done wonders with my skin. It's calmed my active pimples down greatly. I use it about 3 times a week and I leave it on for about an hour each time. I find it best to place the honey on strips of paper towel before sticking it on your face. This will help with the dripping.<br /><br />I also love to drizzle it on fruits or in teas! It's as delicious as it is helpful!
