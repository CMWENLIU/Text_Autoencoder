I also was buying this at HEB, but they reworked the cereal aisle and the #2 vanished. They still carry other numbers, but this is the one we like. I don't avoid wheat, but I like the grains this one features instead. Don't hesitate to buy the case. As all Seitenbachers, it's in sealed foil bags. If you like it well enough to order the case, you won't have to worry about shelf life. They don't skimp on the dried berries, either. Shake it up, though. The raspberries, being large and light, tend to float to the top of the package. Otherwise, the predominate notes are dried apples and oats.
