The discovery of this product on Amazon has seemingly led me into a long term relationship with Go Picnic. I'm in love. These adorable and easily transported boxes are filled with high quality, interesting, great tasting foods. The meals are as balanced as they can be and I feel good about eating them. After buying this product I went on to order two other Go Picnic products, so I am very well-stocked for days I'm on the go and in need of food.
