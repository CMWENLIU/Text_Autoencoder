I can make gluten free bread for my celiac child. However, I have found this mix to be so good and it stays together better than my homemade bread. One time my Celiac child thought I gave him the wrong bread. It tasted so good and "normal". I like to have it on hand for times I am too busy to make it by scratch or for traveling or when I may be out of an ingredient. It was also cost effective to purchase it through Amazon!<br /><br />Thank you.....
