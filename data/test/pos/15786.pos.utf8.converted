If you like tinned tuna you must try this. It has a light (almost white) colour, a distinctive whirled, flaky grain and  a delicate fresh taste. It is worth the extra few dollars over the supermarket brands (which, afterward, will seem like pet food). I especially like it as a quick meal on its own with a bit of fresh bread, some cracked pepper and a small drizzle of lemon-infused olive oil. Toss it through pasta or a salad or whatever else you like - just don't overdo it - the product speaks for itself.
