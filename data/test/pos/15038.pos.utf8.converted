This is a perfect product for me, being the Chai lover that I am.  I ordered some before Christmas, was a bit unsure how it would be, but I loved it so much that I am now a repeat customer.<br /><br />This tastes as good or better than the expensive chai you can find at Starbucks or like coffee shops, and of course it is much more affordable.  It's creamy, even with just the water added and the spicy taste is perfect!  Very highly recommended.  Please Amazon, keep this product on your site forever and ever...
