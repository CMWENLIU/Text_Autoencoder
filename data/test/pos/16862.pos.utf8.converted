Marzipan has always been my favorite treat, but it's not easy to find in this country. When my grandson expressed the same preference and his birthday approached, I knew what I wanted to get for him. And Google made it so easy, just a few clicks, and there they where, Marzipan to choose from. It's not easy to choose food by description alone, but reviews helped, and when it promptly arrived and tasted it, I was thrilled. And so was my grandson. The price is reasonable, and being packaged in six individual rolls, makes it easy to store and share. It's excellent marzipan. Since I'm a writer, and thinking requires calories, I now treat myself to some marzipan too. Roswitha Mcintosh
