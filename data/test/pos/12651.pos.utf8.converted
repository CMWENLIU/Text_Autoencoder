I used to buy flax seeds in a local store in bulk, they were really cheap (a little more than 1$/lb) but I could not find any organic ones anywhere for less than 4$/lb.<br />Bob's Red Mill Organic flax seeds are really fresh, they do not smell rancid (like I happened sometimes with those bought from the local store), they come in 4 packages so you can easily freeze 3 of them. And are organic, which is important to me.<br />Also, they are convenient as a price. I did the math and they cost 2.81$/lb (2.38$/lb if you use the "subscribe and save", like I did). This is a great price for organic flax seeds. If you buy them from the official Bob's Red Mill website, they cost a lot more, it is about 25$ for these 3 packages.<br />To grind them, I recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C2GWTI">Cuisinart SG-10 Electric Spice-and-Nut Grinder</a>. That's what I use and works great.
