As a European and an absolute rye and pumpernickel bread fan, I have always snapped up any of the Mestemacher brand variety in the local store.  But it becomes increasingly hard to find.  Amazon seems to be the one source that can offer such specialty items.  My family and friends love it when I entertain with German dishes on special occasions and these make a great addition.  Also, it makes more sense to buy these in larger quantities such as the one offered, as they can be stored for 9 to 10 months.  Because of this quality, they can be part of someone's emergency pantry, too.
