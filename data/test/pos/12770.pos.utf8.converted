My little dog loves Beneful dog food, and initially she ate the regular size kibble.  I noticed, however, that she had to spend a lot of time breaking the pieces into bites that she could then easily eat.  When they came out with these little IncrediBites, I knew she would love them.  They are so much easier for her to chew, and she doesn't leave crumbs all over the kitchen floor like she did with the big pieces.<br /><br />The only problem I have had is that I've only been able to find the 16-pound bags in the stores in my area.  That includes all the grocery stores, Walmart, Target, etc.  I bought the big bag, and it lasted for many months.  I have read that it's better to buy the amount of dry dog food that your dog will eat within about a month.  Otherwise, the dog food loses moisture and nutrients, can become moldy, becomes hard, and becomes less flavorful.  It may seem like a good idea to buy huge bags to save money, but you end up losing something in quality.  So for my tiny dog who eats such small amounts each day, I really wanted a smaller bag.  Fortunately I found this 7-pound bag here on Amazon, and with my Prime membership, it was shipped for free.  Can't beat that.
