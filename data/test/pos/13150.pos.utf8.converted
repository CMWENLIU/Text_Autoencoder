I used to buy organic coconut fiber to add to smoothies as a source of dietary fiber, but it became unavailable.  The manufacturer suggested I substitute coconut flour, which is really the same thing but more finely ground. This is the fiber left over from coconut after most of the oil is removed, and it is an outstanding low carbohydrate source of dietary fiber.  It absorbs a great deal of water, which is excellent for elimination.  The coconut fiber cured my 87 year old mother's problems with constipation after years of trying other remedies that didn't work.  I've tried other finer ground coconut flours in smoothies or mixed with yogurt, but none were as palatable as Let's Do Organic because they were too finely ground and over-thickened the mixture.  This brand also has the best coconut taste of any I've tried, and it is excellent in my low carb, high fiber and protein pancake recipe. It also makes an excellent low carb, high fiber coating for fried or sauteed seafood, especially when mixed with rice protein powder. More people should be aware of the health benefits of coconut fiber.  I'm sending a six pack of this to my mother.  Since the other coconut fiber is no longer available, I'm sure she'll be relieved!  lol!!
