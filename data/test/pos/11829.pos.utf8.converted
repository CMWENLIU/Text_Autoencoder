My kids love sour patch kids, and there is no local store that provides the unit pricing available from Amazon for this product. The product delivered is fresh (soft not hard and stale) has great flavor, and the kids really enjoy it. We have established a rationing system, and 10 lbs can last quite a long time.<br /><br />If you like to indulge your children, and are looking for a good value in a sour patch product this could be your answer.
