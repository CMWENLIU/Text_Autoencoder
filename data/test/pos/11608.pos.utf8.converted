Yes, these do smell fishy straight out of the package but you just need to rinse them for a few minutes and the smell will go away. Also, whatever sauce you use will soak into the noodle and you will not taste any fishiness. I make a very tasty asian dish with these noodles, some cut up chicken breast and Liquid Aminos as the sauce and the total calories is about 100 for a serving! You cannot beat that! Not only that, these noodles will make you feel full afterwards. Definitely worth trying - keep an open mind & prepare them right and you will NOT be disappointed!
