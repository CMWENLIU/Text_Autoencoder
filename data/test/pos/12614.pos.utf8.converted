I initially tried the Albanese Gummi Worms... since I just LOVE Gummi Worms... they were pretty good... but I figured the Gummi Bears were a better value.<br /><br />OMG! These things are incredible! Usually with gummi's, unless it clearly says a flavor on the package, you get the standard "fruit punch" flavor. But with these gummi's... I can distinctly taste... peach, watermelon, blueberry, green apple, pineapple/pina colada, banana, cherry, strawberry, grape, orange, lemon and cherry!<br /><br />The ONLY thing that I don't like is the consistency is a little too soft for my tastes... but, I put them in the fridge to firm them up a bit and I'm all good!<br /><br />By far the best gummi's I've ever had... and I LOVE gummi's! You MUST try them!
