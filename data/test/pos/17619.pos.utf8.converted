My favorite tea is raspberry flavor and I have tried every one I have found in the stores. This one is by far my favorite! The flavors are so sweet and I have been able to give up coffee for this one! This is a great price too if you buy two 6-packs you save the shipping. At my local store I can get this tea for $0.15 per bag but on here it works out to $0.11 per bag, which would save me $9.60 on that amount of bags.
