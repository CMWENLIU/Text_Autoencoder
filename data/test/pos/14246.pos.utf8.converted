My dad always used to eat the long packaged raisin cookies.  They disappeared from the grocery stores sometime in the 1980's.  When I saw this product, I just had to order it!  We have since eaten all of them!  I can't say they are exactly like the ones I remember, but they are pretty close!!  I would recommend this product, for sure!
