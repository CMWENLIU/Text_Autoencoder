I've tried just about every sauce out there, trying to duplicate the "Starbucks" style iced white chocolate mochas. The Torani sauce is close, but I tried the Ghirardelli sauce, and it's by far my favorite and the one I will stick with from now on. It doesnt like Starbuck's white mochas, but exactly like the other coffee shop's that I frequent, which I prefer. So if your looking for Starbucks equivilent look elsewhere, but this is definitely worth trying.<br /><br />Like others have said it has a taste of its own, which I happen to like better than any other sauce I've tasted. It was the last one I tried, because it seemed to have the worst, or at least mixed "love it or hate it" types of reviews. I happen to love it, but taste is simply a matter of opinion so you will have to see for yourself.<br /><br />This does come with a pump so don't waste your money like I did and pay two (it should say this in the description, at this time it does not).<br /><br />I had some problems with pumps not holding their prime at first, but finally got one that works perfectly. If you have any problems, Ghirardelli customer service is great and quick to help you.
