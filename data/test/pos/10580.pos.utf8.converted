They came not one was broken, they were delicious I had to stop myself from eating them all bc I bought them to make tiramisu. Which turned out great!! I was actually able to make a 2nd one and eat one whole package(it came with 5) of them. I will definitely buy from this company again and I will also get these lady fingers again. I highly recommend these lady fingers to anyone who is thinking about purchasing them through Amazon.
