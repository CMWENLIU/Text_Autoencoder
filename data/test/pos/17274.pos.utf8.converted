I disagree the reviewer who said "Calling this product Pure Cane Syrup is like calling sugar water with maple flavoring "Pure Maple Syrup"."  This product is made with pure cane sugar and water, thus, it is pure cane sugar syrup.  Sugar water with maple flavoring is not analogous at all, as it contains ingredients OTHER than maple sugar and water (i.e. cane sugar!).  Anyway, this is really just simple syrup, which can easily be made at home, but this offers a convenient dispensing of the product and with no heating, cleanup, cooking time, etc.  Not an economical substitute, then, but a convenient and satisfactory one.
