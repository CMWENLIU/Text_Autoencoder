I had pretty much removed grains from my diet to lose 120 lbs. I started adding back no-gluten carbs (a bit of rice, a bit of tubers). But when cold weather hit, I wanted something comforting and hot and "cerealy". I already had used Bob's Red Mill products and knew they were GOOD STUFF. So, I decided this didn't have such a bad carb hit per serving (14 net carbs per 1/3 cup dry)<br /><br />Really lovely. Easy to fix (cook for 2 minutes, let stand 2 minutes, done). I sweeten it with fruit or sucralose and I'm good to go. I feel like my mom is "mothering" me, making me feel very cozy. It hasn't impeded my diet so far (though I was leery of readding a cereal). I figure the anti-nutrients in the oats is worth the comfort. :D<br /><br />If you like oat bran cereal, this is a great one and the price here is good for the 4 pack. (I wish the folks who ordered it via amazon would mention the expiration date, as I have sometimes gotten foodstuffs here close to expiration, and 4 bags of this would last me quite a while...) I plan to order this 4-pack and hoping it's a fresh batch. Will update if otherwise.<br /><br />The nutritionals:<br /><br />Nutrition Facts<br />Serving Size: 1/3 cup dry (31g)<br />Servings Per Container: 16 (per 18 oz. bag)<br />  Amount<br />Per Serving  % Daily<br />Value*<br /> Total Calories  120<br />  Calories From Fat  15<br /> Total Fat  2  g  3%<br />  Saturated Fat  0  g  0%<br />  Trans Fat  0  g<br /> Cholesterol  0  mg  0%<br /> Sodium  0  mg  0%<br /> Total Carbohydrates  21  g  7%<br />  Dietary Fiber  6  g  22%<br />  Sugars  0  g<br /><br /> Protein  5  g<br /> Vitamin A  0%<br /> Vitamin C  0%<br /> Calcium  2%<br /> Iron  8%<br /><br />Thumbs up from me!<br /><br />And for folks doing that Dukan Diet, which isn't what I do,  I hear this is suitable for that. In case that helps...
