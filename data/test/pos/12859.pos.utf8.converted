I bought this about 4 months ago when Roland products were on sale. I just finished my 2nd semester of college and came home. A few days ago I opened the bag, which was sealed extremely well I mean its sealed, but it also has a thin rope to hold it together.(Might take a bit to open depending) I used one cup of quinoa and two cups of water. I made it like rice; adding sea salt to the water. 20 mins later, it was done. The quinoa does expand 3-4 times its size. The taste and texture is something that grows on you. When I first ate it I couldn't finish it. It was very filling.(which is a good thing) While it was cooking I grilled green pepper and onion in olive oil. I added some kalamata olives to the mix as well.  I don't think I'd eat it by itself just yet.<br /><br />In terms of Cooking, it cooks almost like rice. Using the left overs from the day before, I made fried quinoa like I would make fried rice. It was delicious!<br /><br />It is definitely healthy and with the rate seasoning and foods, tasty.<br /><br />Best Wishes,<br />  E.A.C
