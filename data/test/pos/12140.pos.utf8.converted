This starter works perfectly every time. Yogurt has been awesome!<br /><br />I use organic milk, boil and cool...add this starter, pour into the Euro Cuisine Yogurt Maker Jars and then set them into the machine for 8 hrs at least. Yogurt turns out with perfect texture and smooth taste. Just add your favorite fruit or we add the Polaner or Simply Fruit jams/preserves and you have the best yogurt you've ever tasted!
