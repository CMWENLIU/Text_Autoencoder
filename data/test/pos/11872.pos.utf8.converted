I have played around with this and made alot of different colors and shades. Although the only color I had problems with was black, I could not reach the true black color I got purple. Other than that I think all the colors are easy to use and you dont need alot to reach the shade your looking for. If some gets on your counter, it might stain but I used windex with ammonia in it and it came right up. The black did stain my plastic bowl purple but other than that this is a great product.
