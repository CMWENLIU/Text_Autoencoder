My 12 year old Golden was diagnosed with Lymphoma.  As far as cancer is concerned, it's one of the worst... prognosis is generally 4-6 weeks after diagnosis untreated, up to one year with chemo.  My husband and I decided we were not in a financial position to do chemo, especially to only buy our pooch one year, so I started researching alternative medicines.  One thing I read over and over was to switch to a grain-free diet.  Well, we had been feeding him decent food, but not grain-free.  So, I bought a bag of this.<br /><br />10 weeks later the tumors in his neck have shrunk without any medication, and you'd never know this dog has a death sentence.  He can digest it just fine, his coat looks great, he actually slimmed up a bit (which is great because he was a little chubby) and he just looks and feels fantastic.  I'm not saying this is a miracle cure-all and that the cancer won't get the best of him one day soon, but I am forever thankful to this company for making such high quality food that is making his time left easier and enjoyable.  Oh, and he LOVES this food.  Like, circles, cute noises, tail boogie-woogie, hopping etc.  It's almost like he's a puppy again. :D
