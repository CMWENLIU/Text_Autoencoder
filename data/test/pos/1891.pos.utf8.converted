First of all, nobody told me this cereal was getting discontinued in the stores. Big mistake. I almost went Fruit Brute in my city chasing cars and stealing babies. I don't know who came up with the horrible horrible horrible idea to discontinue selling the physical embodiment of delicious. For the last few weeks I've been eating Cocoa Puffs trying to pretend like everything was okay. Well you know what? It wasn't okay. Eating Cocoa Puffs in place of Count Chocula is like dating a girl that looks sort of like the woman you love. You're only fooling yourself. Count Chocula is the best cereal ever. Period.
