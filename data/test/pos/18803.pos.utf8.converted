Finally, thanks to Mae Ploy and Amazon, even an ordinary, Hamburger Helper stir-in kind of cook like me can make mouth-watering exotic Thai fare.  The best part?  All those expensive, impossible-to-find ingredients are right in the paste!  No more shopping, peeling, pounding, mincing, or guessing about quantities.  An easy master recipe is right on the canister, you just decide what vegetables or meats to use, and I haven't tried any yet that did'nt taste great.  In the time it used to take to make a box of macaroni and cheese, I now have a fresh, healthy, and very economical meal.  Love Mae Ploy!!
