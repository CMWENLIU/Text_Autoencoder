Happy Pho is fantastic. Delicious, healthy AND easy to make. I've made the soup and I've used the noodles alone in stir-fry. Both were delicious.<br /><br />I traveled to Vietnam a couple years ago and have been a big fan of pho ever since.  When a friend mentioned Happy Pho to me, I went ahead and ordered some.  Healthy Pho I can make at home?? I'm in. Keep in mind that I'm a bachelor and don't do a lot of cooking.<br /><br />The first time i wanted to make it, I realized i didn't have a few of the basic ingredients that it calls for. So I just stir-fried the noodles with broccoli. The noodles are made from whole grains yet only 2 minutes to boil? A healthy bachelor's dream. In fact, since then I figured out that its pretty easy to just cook them straight in the wok. But I digress.. The noodles were delicious! The tastiest noodles i can recall making at home.<br /><br />Ok, second time around I went all out and made the Pho soup. I rarely cook for other people, but i had someone coming over so figured we'd eat in, and I'd cook Happy Pho. I felt like Kung Fu Pandd making my delicious secret soup!  I was a little nervous, since i hadn't tried the spice pack. Well, it was delicious too.  My friend and I both loved it, and it only took about 10 minutes to do everything..<br /><br />Its a keeper! I can easily see it becoming one of my healthy bachelor staples.
