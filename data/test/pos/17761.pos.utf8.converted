A friend of mine recommended McCann's.  I ordered it up and have been enjoying it every weekend for months.  Firm texture with a pleasantly nutty taste.  Don't overcook, though, or you will have a soggy mass.  I put leftovers in the fridge and reheat portions in the mocrowave, after adding a little water.  Works just fine.
