No question, this is an effective product. Using pheramones [sic.] to attact moths then trap them with sticky paper appeal to my love of science and technology.<br /><br />Today, the product is already folded into a triangular house for the moths to fly into. The interior is coated with adhesive so the moths become trapped after entering the house. Users must removed a pheramone-infused tab from a sealed package, then insert the tab into a slot to get it inside the housing. But almost always, the tab falls out of its intended spot and is stuck to the interior. I've used it this way and it seems to work fine, but the manufactuer can help users by making three changes in the way they package the product.<br /><br />1. make the little pheramone-infused tab already correctly  positioned and attached to the interior so that users don't have to open the sealed package and handle the tab.<br /><br />2. They should cover the whole item, including the sticky paper, with wax paper, score where the folds go, and indicate how to fold it into the housing shape. Then users would just have to peel the whole wax sheet off to expose the sticky paper and the pheramone tab, fold it up, and voila, done!<br /><br />This way, the manufacturer can also save on packaging by shipping the items in a flat envelope rather than a mostly empty box.<br /><br />3. Make the sticky housing attachable to something so it doesn't knock around my pantry.  This can be as simple as a hole to hang it on a nail, or a weak adhesive like that used on Post-it notes to attach the trap to a wall.
