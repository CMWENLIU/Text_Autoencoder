I am an adult who has to follow a gluten free diet.  I check out the Envirokids brand(as well as any other gluten free cereal)if I ever see them on sale.  I just decided to pick up a box of Koala Crisp today and I must say this is my favorite flavor and style that they have to offer.  I find the other 2 that I have tried(panda puffs, gorilla munch)to be decent but i couldn't quite get into the texture of them.  The coala crisp soaks perfectly into the milk and has just enough crunch to go along with that sweet cocoa flavor to satisfy my cravings.  I personally only eat cereal on the occasion as it doesn't fill me up all that well(not to mention I keep wanting to have another bowl, and another), but these are perfect for the occasional treat. Congratulations envirokidz, a 24 year old has bestowed upon you 5 stars.
