I don't like most bottled water. Some seem tasteless and don't really seem to quench my thirst. I usually prefer a tea drink. Volvic is the exception. There is a balance to the natural mineral content that imparts a great water taste and drinkability. I have tasted bottled water from all over the world and some that are really expensive but this is the ONLY one that gives what you pay for. I have tried water such as glacier water from iceland and fiji water that are really ordinary except for the bottle packaging. Packaging does not impress me only taste. Chill your Volvic well before you try it and I guarantee you will find it exceptional if you can differentiate the taste of water. If not you may be able to now.
