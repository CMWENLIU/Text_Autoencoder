This product works exactly as advertised and dissolves easily, producing somewhat tart yogurt in about 7hours.  The resulting yogurt can be used as a starter if frozen and stored for later defrost.  I would argue however that buying plain yogurt allows you to decide what taste you want and works just as well.  If you live 50 mile from a supermarket, buy this but if you want to experiment, buy as many store yogurts as you can find and use the brand whose taste you like as a starter.
