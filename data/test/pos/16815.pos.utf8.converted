I'm 23 and had a hormonal imbalance where i would  not get my period. My doctor immediately said, well here is some birth control for you. I tried the pills and got sick (nausea/migranes/stomach aches). I wanted something natural, so i decided to do some research online and bumped into this tea. I read some good reviews so i decided to give it a try. I have never really been a tea drinker so the initial taste was horrid but since i was hoping to get better i decided to drink it anyways. I started getting my period naturally after 3 months of drinking this cup of tea with two tea bags everyday. I guess it depends on the severity of your imbalance, some people say they see a difference within days or weeks. Bottom line is it has worked for me, i am still using it and will continue using it. Yes i recommend it! :)
