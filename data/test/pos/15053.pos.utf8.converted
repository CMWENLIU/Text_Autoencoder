I purchased this after the review by Cooks's Illustrated that recommended it. It was the only one of the top-rated ones that was 100% whole wheat and it is delicious. I have tried whole wheat pastas before and have been completely underwhelmed. This one is wonderful - mildly nutty, but not enough to distract from the dish.
