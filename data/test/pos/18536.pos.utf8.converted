My favorite chips just got better! We loved the new Jalapeno, Chili Lime, Parmesan Garlic and Thai flavors. The Sweet Potato was least liked.<br />I've been wanting to try all the new flavors for a while but didn't want a case of 24 packs of a single flavor. Our local stores only stock the most common flavors. Now the problem is solved and I'll definitely be re-ordering these every month.
