...but if Britain is seen as a nation of Tea drinkers then Yorkshire would be the county where Tea making and drinking takes on mythical status and seroius cultural meaning, the process is highly ritualised.<br /><br /> I was born in Yorkshire and as a child "Coffee" was a dirty word amongst my older relatives. Tea has to be strong, flavoursome and refreshing in Yorkshire and people embue it with medicianl properties. This product has long since been endoresed as the perfect Tea for the county and it is really good. Taylor's, who make it, are a damn fine company and never cut corners in their art and craft.
