This was a nice change from most fruitcakes sold.  I am a fruitcake fan, but i really have had some that were just way too much citron for my taste.  What i liked is the cake is REALLY dense, smells of brandy, has a lot of cherries and very minimal citron/citrus and tons of nuts. Stayed moist for weeks as i nibbled away at it, and still not finished..LOL.  Try it you'll like it.
