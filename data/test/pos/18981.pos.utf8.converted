I love this stuff. It is delicious. It is solid at room temperature but I prefer it in liquid form which I achieve by running the jar under hot water. I take 1 tbsp about 3-4 times a day and use this as a moisturizer after the shower. It tastes yummy but I did have to get used to the feeling that I was swallowing oil. My hubby had no problem w this and even joked it was so good that he could drink it with a straw. I have suffered w a systemic yeast infection for years which has caused numerous skin problems and a nasty white tongue. This has cleared that up in a week. The pimples I had on my arms and thighs are gone and so are my undereye dark circles. My nails are growing smoothly and my hair stopped falling out when I brush. I also started using it as a vaginal moisturizer and I am extremely pleased with the results. I also noticed how it helped with my cold. My symptoms were mild whereas everyone else had a more severe reaction. It also helped with my cracking feet and my pinky toe, which has been blackened forever, is returning to normal. I love using it on the kids lips because I know when they lick it off it's not harmful. My hubby started taking it as well when he saw how I benefited and he loves the natural burst of energy he gets after. My daughter finally tried some and now loves it on her madelines in the morning. I cant say enough wonderful things about this product. I feel like a brand new person. I wish doctors knew more to recommend this instead of blaming loss of energy and skin problems on aging. This is healthy for you, gives you energy, aids in weight loss and kills bacterias, yeasts and fungus. First magazine just wrote an article on the benefits of adding coconut oil to your diet in their January issue. It's so good that I'm going to subscribe to it.<br />UPDATE: I still LOVE this product and use it daily. I've found it makes the best pancakes when you grease the griddle w some. It is an excellent wood cleaner and the only way I clean wood, now. I also make a lip scrub w a drop of coconut oil in the palm of my kids' hands and a pinch of sugar. They love how yummy it is, I don't worry if they get it in their mouths, and they no longer have dry, cracking winter lips. My youngest has been using it nightly, after her bath, and the excema that plagues her legs, hasn't returned w the dry, cold air. This has become one of the most used products in my home.
