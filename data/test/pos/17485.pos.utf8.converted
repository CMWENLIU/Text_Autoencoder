Pour this turmmeric into a pan and add some water and cook it down to a paste for at least 8 minutes. Then, add 1 tsp of this paste into a warm glass of milk with black pepper sprinkled in. stir and drink. Watch how your asthma will improve rapidly! Drink twice per day, in morning and at night. Refrigerate the rest of the paste. The taste is ok. It stains so be careful not to spill the paste on anything. Also look into drinking raw milk and taking probiotics to help with your asthma or if you have eczema, which usually occur together. Not sure if turmeric supplements yield the same success..  but making a paste worked for my asthma, dramatically.
