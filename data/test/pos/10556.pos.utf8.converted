The wilds of Kamchatka are a brutal, harsh landscape filled with death and despair where only polar bears and monsters born out of the nightmares of children roam. I had once thought of Kamchatka only as a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000IWCX">Risk</a>y way to get my armies to Japan, Alaska, Mongolia, Yakutsk and Irkutsk. Now, however, I knew differently. You see, the ghost of my dead wife explained to me through my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CT2A6I">Diamond HDMI Digital Audio/Video Cable W/ Ethernet Connection (5M)</a> to pack up nothing and track the No-armed man to the wilds of Kamchatka. I did so, and found I was woefully ill-prepared for our encounter. If only I had <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9622177808">Kamachatka: A Journal & Guide to Russia's Land of Ice and Fire (Odyssey Illustrated Guides)</a>, I would have been better prepared for all the ice and fire. Instead, all my training in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WVXM0W">Zubaz Pants</a> with Master Goh did nothing but keep me alive. After the No-armed man finished beating me to a pulp and escaped my grasp I found myself starving.<br />I trundled through the insane weather conditions, alternating between snow and burning forests and came across a strange site. There, rising out of the snow and flames, like an apparition, was a massive building. On the front it read "Cloverdale." I thought of the monster with a similar name, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018QCXGY">Cloverfield [Blu-ray</a>], and how that movie would play a crucial role in this theater of pain I was trapped in. But it was at Cloverdale that an old woman, nearly 80 years old if a day, walked out wearing a headscarf and leading a Yak that was strapped with bundles of polar bear skins, and spoke to me. What language it was that poured out of her broken toothed mouth I could not say, but the intent was clear. "Eat this fresh whole rabbit," her eyes explained to me what her language could not. She picked me up and placed me on the back of the yak with the polar bear skins. I would live. My vengeance would keep me warm. My vengeance and all those polar bear skins. And I would find my strength in all those fresh whole rabbits. Strength for my next encounter with the No-armed man.
