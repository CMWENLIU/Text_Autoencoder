I have tried all the Annie Chun's rice, and this is definitely the best tasting one.  It really only takes one minute to fully heat up, and it tastes like it just came from the rice cooker.  I have eaten white rice all my life, but the black pearl rice tastes better than the white rice.  I am ordering my second shipment now.
