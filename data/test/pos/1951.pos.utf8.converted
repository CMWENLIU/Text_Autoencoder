My Persian cat, who suffers from polycystic kidney disease, needs low protein food. He did not like the low protein veterinary diet and it is impossible to segregate his food from the rest of our cats anyway. I bought this food because the protein content is much lower than most foods but is still appropriate for all cats. I have to say that all of our cats love it and are maintaining excellent health on it. This is very expensive food, but the results make it all worth it.
