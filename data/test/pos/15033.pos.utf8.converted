This kit comes with pretty much everything you need to get started in the molecular gastronomy world.  You get 50g of each additive, which is just about perfect.  Since most solutions are 1-2% by weight, this gives you plenty to help you get over a learning curve, create some dishes, and become familiar with each component.  It's much easier to gauge what you need to reorder (and how much) once you have this basic understanding.  Each additive is labeled for easy identification, and a guide that provides a brief overview is included for reference.<br /><br />The packaging is great as well -- each ingredient comes in a resealable pouch, and all of your pouches come in a small little cooler for storage (about 12"x12"x12").  Be sure to purchase some scales if you are already not equipped with them to go with your kit as well.  You will absolutely need a scale accurate to at least 0.1g.  You will also need a kitchen scale to measure the larger solutes (such as water) as almost all scales accurate to 0.1g cannot handle heavy loads.<br /><br />In all, this is a great buy.  I am very pleased with it and the quality of the additives.
