Dove has to be the best chocolate that I have ever tasted.  It is just out of this world, its like eating sweet smooth silk.  I have not ordered this product from amazon but have gotten it from my local grocery store.  Dove was actually an ice cream before it was a chocolate, I had no idea.  But they are sure a winner in my book when it comes to chocolate.  The perfect little treat to end a hard day.  The dark chocolate is my favorite, and dove never lets my taste buds down.
