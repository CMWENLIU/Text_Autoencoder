I send one box of this creamer to my wife each month.  She is currently working in Kabul, Afghanistan for the Army Corps of Engineers.  This creamer survives the trip very well, with only the loss of a few little packets - they sometimes blow up or get crushed.  The great part is by getting it via Amazon's subscription service, I don't have to remember to buy it, I get it cheaper and it just shows up at the house!<br /><br />If you have products that you use regularly, I strongly recommend you look into the Amazon subscription service.
