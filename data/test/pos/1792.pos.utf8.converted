I have been a slim fast drinker for years. One taste of this shake and I'm hooked! I like to put it in the freezer for about 30 min. before drinking it so it is nice and COLD. I love chocolate so the milk chocolate flavor is my pick. It is a much smoother chocolate than the slim fast milk chocolate. I just wish it came in 6 or bonus 8 pack like the slim fast. So far I've only seen it in 4 pack. Because of this it is a bit more costly than slim fast. But again the taste is much better. I highly recommend it!!
