My dogs love Stella & Chewy. I've tried feeding raw before. It was a real pain having to remember to put it out to thaw the day before and one of my dogs would not eat it at all because it was cold. This is a perfect compromise. No need to defrost and using warm water to rehydrate it makes it more pallatable for my little picky one.
