I used to eat these a lot when i lived in the UK and am eagerly awaiting their arrival here in the states. You can order them from England and Canada but the shipping is 20x the cost of the packets.<br /><br />These taste great -- a hint of prawn, or something -- and melt on your tongue. Please hurry up and stock them already.
