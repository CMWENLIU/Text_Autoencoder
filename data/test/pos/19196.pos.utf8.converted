I bought this gift for my brother and his wife, since my brother and I were big candy addicts in the 80's. He received it on time (which was during the last holiday season) and they absolutely loved it! He thought it was so great to see some of the old candy that you can't get in stores these days. I did not personally get to see the item, but it seemed to make a gift for them and they really enjoyed it.
