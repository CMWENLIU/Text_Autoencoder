I have dry mouth because of a medical condition, so I drink a lot of liquids -- in my case, tea, nearly two gallons a day. (Of course, road trips take me longer than average!) I enjoy the flavor I get when using one bag of Constant Comment along with regular (daytime) and decaf (evenings) black tea each time I brew up a gallon. It's also very good by itself for a hot cuppa.
