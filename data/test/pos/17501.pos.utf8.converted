I'm reluctant to share all the recipes of things we're using Bob's Red Mill potato flour for. Why? Because they're so good, once people try them, it might start selling out!<br /><br />Oh, what the heck. You talked me into it. I'll share a couple of them anyway.<br /><br />For delicious gluten/grain-free chicken nuggets:<br /><br />Start with a pound of skinless, boneless chicken, cut into nugget-sized pieces. We use dark meat, because it comes out moister and more flavorful. Pat the pieces with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.<br /><br />Next, combine the following in a quart-size Zip Lock bag. You can adjust the seasonings to your own taste, of course:<br /><br />1/4 cup plus 1 tbsp Bob's Red Mill potato flour<br />1 tsp salt<br />1 tsp onion powder<br />1/2 tsp garlic powder<br />1/2 tsp paprika<br />1/2 tsp white or black pepper<br />1/2 tsp dried parsley flakes, crushed to powder<br /><br />Put half the chicken pieces in the bag, zip it closed and toss gently to coat the chicken. Remove the chicken pieces, shaking off the excess coating back into the bag, and cook them in a little oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.<br /><br />It's important to cook over medium-low heat like that, because potato flour can scorch. Using tongs or a fork, turn the pieces occasionally until lightly browned and cooked through. Repeat with the remaining chicken pieces.<br /><br />Once you try chicken made with potato flour like this, you may never want chicken made with wheat flour again. :)<br /><br />For a quick and easy, dairy-free, gluten-free, tapioca-like pudding -- yes, pudding:<br /><br />Bring 1-and-a-half cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add a pinch of salt and 1/4 tsp baking soda to the water. (The baking soda will neutralize the potato "tang" of potato flour.) Add a generous dash of vanilla extract.<br /><br />In a small bowl, use a fork to stir together a quarter cup plus 2 tbsps of white sugar, and a quarter cup plus 1 tbsp of Bob's Red Mill potato flour.<br /><br />Remove the saucepan from the heat (this is important -- you don't want the thickening mixture to boil and spatter on you). Gradually pour the dry ingredients from the bowl into the hot water, stirring the water with a fork to mix while you do. The mixture will thicken instantly.<br /><br />(No matter how much you stir, there will be some lumps. So if you don't like lumps, either don't bother with this recipe, or take an extra step of pushing the mixture through a sieve.)<br /><br />Allow the pudding to cool. We usually hasten that process by placing the saucepan in a sink half filled with cold water.<br /><br />We also use potato flour as an extender for wheat-free meat loaf, and as an extender and coating for chicken-fried steak. (Cook in a skillet with a little oil over medium low heat so the potato flour doesn't scorch.)<br /><br />We also ---<br /><br />Okay, I'm not going to tell you any more. I've said too much already. Now don't go buying up all my Bob's Red Mill potato flour!
