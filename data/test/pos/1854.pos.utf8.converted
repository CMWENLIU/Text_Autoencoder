We adopted a neighborhood cat a few months ago. She is very nice, but had horrible breath even after we started feeding her various special cat foods. Otherwise great cat, but when she would yawn in your lap, you had to fight fainting.<br /><br />We took "Dentabites" more for fun since our cat loved other whiskas tempations we tried with her, but well, thought let's try to see if it really can do anything about her breath. After about a week of giving her dentabites, we noticed her breath "improved" and after 2 weeks it was amazing. Her bad breath is almost completely gone, or gone as much as it can without brushing teeth i suppose. We didn't change anything in her diet at the time so we were pretty sure it was dentabites that did the job. Also, since then, we've been feeding her various foods but keep the dentabites snacks and bad breath hasn't returned... one more point to be sure that Dentabites really work.<br /><br />Really great product. Just a few treats a day make enormous difference. Highly recommended.
