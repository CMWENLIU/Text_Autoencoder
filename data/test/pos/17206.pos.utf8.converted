What else can I say. Starbucks coffee is the best and always excellent. I'm very partial to their French Roast. It's the best. You'll never go wrong with Starbucks quality and selection. Starbucks and Amazon make a great team for great value and selection for the customer. I wonder if its a Seattle thing? None the less, I recommend them over everybody else. I going to get a refill right now. Enjoy
