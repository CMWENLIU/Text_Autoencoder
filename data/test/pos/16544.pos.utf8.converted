If you're looking for a well priced raw organic sugar with a good flavor you won't do much better than buying this from Amazon.  I really like the flavor of this sugar and while I like some of their Fair Trade sugars a little better (their non-organic Turbinado from Malawi is hard to beat) I've got little kids so I'm trying to stick with organic products when possible.<br /><br />Someone in a previous review claimed this is bleached.  They may be mistaking this for a "brown" sugar (which isn't bleached but it is refined into a white sugar [often using an acid] and then the molasses is added back in).  As the name makes clear this is a raw Turbinado sugar.  That means it is raw cane that is spun in a low speed centrifuge (i.e. "turbine") just enough to remove most of the cane plant detritus.  While this version is raw you can find plenty of Turbinado sugar that has been baked or steamed.<br /><br />You can use this sugar pretty much anywhere you've been using regular white sugar.  If you've got a recipe that calls for bakers sugar then this will probably be too coarse.  This won't melt as easily as white sugar:  I find that around 375 degrees it caramelizes nicely but at 350 I still get crunchy bits of sugar.  I kind of like the crunchy bits but if you don't turn the heat up a notch.  If you are putting this in cereal it won't dissipate as easily as plain white sugar but this isn't something that ever bothered me.  I like that is has a more interesting flavor than white sugar and that lets me use a little less of it.  Anything that helps the waste line is a good thing in my book.<br /><br />Incidentally if you are shopping around and see something called "Demerara" sugar it's just the English name for sugar made in pretty much the same way as Turbinado sugar (there are text book definitions of these things but most of the sugar makes aren't reading them so don't get too worked up about the name).
