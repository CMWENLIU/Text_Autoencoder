I can't praise the Solid Gold products enough! My dogs love all of the Solid Gold products. A couple of years ago, I switched to Solid Gold Hund-n-Flocken because of allergy problems my shepherds had. The dogs had previously been on Science diet for years - but I wanted an organic food that was corn free. I tried many organic dog foods - but the dogs would not even touch the food, until I found Hund-n-Flocken. The dogs love it and their allergies have greatly decreased (ear infections, itching, etc.) since they have been on the food.
