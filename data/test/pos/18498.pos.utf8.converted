I've looked for a good country ham ever since a past trip to Tennessee, where it was served in a restaurant.  Not available here in the Northwoods!  But this is definitely the real stuff.  It's much stronger flavored than regular ham, and very salty -- which, lord help me, I love.  A small serving goes a long way, though.  Also, it's not pink like most ham, and it is MUCH firmer.  You'll need a sharp knife!<br /><br />We started out frying it by the slice.  Then I baked it, whole, and dumped the grease.  But that dried it too much, so I then boiled it to soften and reduce the salt a little.  Used the water from that to make the BEST bean soup I've ever made.  Now we just cut off a thin slice at a time and warm it in the frying pan.
