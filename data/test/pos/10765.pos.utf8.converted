I drink at least 1 gal. of water a day. I've tried sooo many brands. Some are impossible, many are acceptable but very few are exceptional...Glaceau Smartwater with electrolytes tops the charts! This water is great with meals, during & after exercise, just because you're thirsty or if dieting, it helps fill you up if you drink a bottle 20 minutes or so before eating while helping to keep your electrolytes in balance! This is of great importance. When your electrolytes are "off", it can affect your heart as well as other important medical conditions. This is why scientists came up with Gatorade for pro athletes 25 yrs. or so ago. Look what we've learned since then! Thank you for a superior product!
