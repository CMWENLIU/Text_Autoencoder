I used to get this dressing at Wally World (a.k.a. Wal-Mart). It was always available. When I started noticing that the dressing was only there "sometimes", I would buy all of the bottles of it--partly because I was afraid they were going to quit stocking it, and partly because I wanted Wally to see that this stuff is profitable for them to stock.<br /><br />No matter. It's gone, for good.  It has a terrific, tangy flavor without having too strong a bite. It was hard to keep around this house. Now I can't even get it to bring to the house.<br /><br />I am going to hold my breath and order it online, and just hope that what has happened to others (wrong dressing, way past expiration, etc.) won't happen to me.  If it's close to the expiration date, I'll keep it anyway, because we really use it up, especially during gardening season.  The stuff tastes just fine a couple months past the expiration date, too, if it hasn't been opened.  I think the reason for the date is that the quality supposedly starts to deteriorate, not because it's "rotten".  Though, I've never noticed any deterioration in quality.<br /><br />I sure wish I could duplicate this recipe at home.<br /><br />Update:  The bottles of this dressing that I ordered from Amazon weren't anywhere close to the expiration date, and is good as always.
