No smell at all. I HATE walking into a house that "smells like cat" and this is the ONLY litter I've used that doesn't create or cause that smell. I have 4 cats, and 2 of the ginormous Pet Mate litter boxes; I use one bag and pour half of it in each box. It lasts about 2 and a half weeks before I have to change completely change it out.<br />1 entire box of clumping clay litter lasted me only a week and its nasty and hard to clean. So while this is slightly more expensive it lasts a lot longer. I subscribed to the auto shipping and the price is only $2 more than a box of clay clumping litter.<br />I highly recommend this stuff! Your cats and you will love it!
