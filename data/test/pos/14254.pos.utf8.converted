These oatmeal squares are delicious! They are chewy and you can taste the chocolate chips on every bite. I first got hooked on these due to Costco. Unfortunately, the Costco around the house stop selling these. Lucky for me, I found the squares on Amazon. I bought a box of these in November of 2010 and the best by date on the squares is June 2011. It looks like it has a shelf life of 6 to 7 months.<br /><br />These squares are 190 Calories, fat is 50 calories (6 grams), sodium 110 mg, total carb 28 grams, sugar 13 grams, and protein is 6 grams.<br /><br />(Update 10/2/2011)<br />Well, it appears Corazonas changed how they made the oatmeal squares. The squares are on my 'Subscribe and Save' list from Amazon and the last two monthly shipments I noticed some changes. It is now less sweet, less chewy, more thicker/airy, and more dry then before. I still think the squares are good and will continue to have them on my 'Subscribe and Save' list, but I do prefer the old recipe.<br /><br />(Update 12/6/2011) Back to the old recipe!!! Hopefully, I just had a bad batch.
