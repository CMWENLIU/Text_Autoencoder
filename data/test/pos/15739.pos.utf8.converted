Okay, so I haven't tasted this yet, but I guess I would have a hard time rating it based on taste, since I have never eaten sorghum flour (not to my knowledge, anyway#. However, I was really impressed that they included a packet of their gluten free flour mix with a recipe booklet. I have never reviewed a product on amazon before #and I shop on here at least once a week), but this excellent perk inspired me to do so.
