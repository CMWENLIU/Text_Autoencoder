When ever possible I try to buy the Duncan Hines angel food cake mix as it's the best tasting box cake mix on the grocery shelf. Some of the other angel food cake mixes may have a slightly funky after taste. The Duncan Hines brand does not.<br /><br />The cake mix is easy to prepare and bakes up tall and light.<br /><br />Highly recommend.<br /><br />Note:  I like the two-step version of this cake mix but it's no longer made. :-(
