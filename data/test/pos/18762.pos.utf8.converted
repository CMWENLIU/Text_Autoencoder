My cats eat every scrap of this food...not just this flavor but every Organix flavor.  It NEVER smells.<br /><br />One thing I am afraid of with cats is their bowels movements.  If the food sucks, so will the movements.  Hence, my plan is to improve the food they take in and the bowel movements will follow.  Also remember cats are very susceptible to stomach cancer.  The better the food, the longer your cat will last and the higher the quality of the purr....get it?<br /><br />I can tell you the stool has been clean, with nearly without any incident.  As long as the stool is simple, I think the food is doing what it should be, and thats Organix.<br /><br />Worth the cost, in my eyes.
