All kids and adults love the Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers - I know I do and I'm 43 y/o! I'm writing this review even before I get them in.  I bought these individual packages to put in my son's Elmo themed birthday party favors bags to give to the kids that attend it. Since Elmo and his best friend, Dorothy (who is a goldfish), I thought that would be a cute idea.
