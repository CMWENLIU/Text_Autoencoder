I was very happy to find several sources for bulk gelatin at amazon.  I enabled be to compare prices and pick the cheapest product.  Since I had been using Knox Gelatin for years I had no hesitation in ordering it.  The price was a great improvememt over that charged in a grocery store.  I much prefer measuring the amount of gelatin used in a recipe, rather than just emptying the  the packaged product.  The packages were reviewed several years ago, and it was found that the contents of the packages were not nedessarily aacurate.  I am very happy with the product.
