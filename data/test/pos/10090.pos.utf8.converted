I have tried several pumkin flavored coffees, & found none that could come close to Green Mountain's fall seasonal offering of "Pumkin Spice".<br />However, I find this one equally as good.  I will always buy this one since to me, there is little difference in flavor, if any that I can detect, (not to mention it is about one half the price).  Thanks Amazon for offering this.  I absolutely love this coffee.
