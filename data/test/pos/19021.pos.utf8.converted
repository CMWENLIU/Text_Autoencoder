I used this product as suggested for hair conditioning.  I put the oil on for two hours before washing my hair.  I also use a little before drying my hair for moisturizer.  A little goes a long ways.  One definitely does not want to use too much of this.  I wrap my hair at night in my satin head wrap and unwrap non-greasy, extremely lustrous, well moisturized.  I am African American and naturally have dry relaxed hair, but using this routine bi-weekly, I have hair that does not sound powerfully like snapping twigs when I press it between my fingers near my ears listening for dryness.  I definitely recommend this product for anyone that suffers with dry hair especially if it has been chemically treated.  It is a hair saver.  I do shed hairs as badly as I used to.  It is hair saving.
