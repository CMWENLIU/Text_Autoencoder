This tea tastes like the kind in restaraunts, unless it is made incorrectly. Usually, you are recommended to add cardamon and cloves to it for enchanced flavor. I use 1 cup milk to 2 cups water ratio for making the tea and sweeten it with regular sugar or splenda. Sometimes I'll make it unsweetened and add 2 tblspn sweetened condensed milk to each cup. If you do not know how to make it properly, I suggest looking up the recipe online. There are many great sites out there which will tell you how to do it, do not count on the instructions on the back of the package for a perfect tea.
