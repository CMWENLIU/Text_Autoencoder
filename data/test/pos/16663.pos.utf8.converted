Although we're not Asian, we have considered this a staple in our household for years. Recipes using Jufran's typically earn raves, though people can rarely believe the sauce is made out of bananas. It has a sweet and spicy taste with the texture of catsup/ketchup but not as sweet. Recommendations: use it as a sauce for your favorite brisket; baste ribs or a pork tenderloin with it.
