There is the tiniest, faintest "edge" to this spam that I presume is the bacon, although you could have fooled me --- it seemed like a denser type version of the regular spam.  It's okay as spam goes and I prefer this to the regular spam, the few times I'm in the mood for it --- but more bacon would be preferable --- i don't really think they have a right to call it that name, to tell you the truth.
