Although this noodle is the "default" according to my Korean friend, I believe it is the best spicy noodle on the market. It is VERY spicy for those that are not accustomed to spicy food. If you have not tried this noodle before, I'd recommend using only half the chili powder packet. Then adjust as necessary for later meals. I've been eating this noodle for years and years. The recipe that I normally use is:<br /><br />1 egg<br />Chinese green onions (chopped)<br />lemon juice<br />sesame oil<br /><br />Bring water to a boil with the noodle in a pot. Then pour out the water and run cold water over the noodle. This cleans the noodles of the materials left over from the manufacturing process. Set noodle aside. Then bring filtered water to a boil with both ingredient packets. It takes several minutes for the dried vegetables to hydrate. Put noodles back in. Add 3-4 drops of lemon juice and 1-2 drops of sesame oil. Add the green onions. Stir. Break the egg over the top of the noodles. Make sure your hands are dry to avoid steam burns! Wait until the egg white turns from translucent to white. Serve over large bowl. Break the egg and allow the yolk to run over the noodles. YUM!
