I'm nearly finished using my first 50 lb bag of Honeyville Artisan Flour, and am ordering a second.  Before ordering, I contacted their customer service person, who took time to answer my questions about flour processing and content.<br />My sourdough thrives on this flour; the dough is easy to knead and form, with just the right % of gluten and malt, plus the added bonus of no bleach!<br />Just out of the oven, I can hear the caramel brown crust crackling - just like it should.  The crust is crunchy and chewy; the bread is moist and full of bubbles - a difficult combination to achieve.<br />I make 5 or 6 loaves of Austrian sourdough bread a week, enough to eat and plenty to share.  Friends and neighbors say these loaves are sooo delish. Leftover slices make wonderful French Toast.<br />The lower shipping costs make my hubby happy.
