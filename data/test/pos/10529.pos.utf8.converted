With the lack of wild animals in my town, sacrificing to the Dark Lord has become a real chore. I can't tell you how many times I have had to pay someone to go into a pet store to get my daily sacrifices (they don't let me in anymore. They say I'm a "too frequent" customer).<br />But with this rabbit, I don't have to bribe a hobo to get a living creature. The Dark Lord has never blessed me so much sense I have been using this. 5 stars for sure.
