If you like Thai food or peanuts and slight-to-medium spicy food.....this is a product I highly recommend.  This product is a dry coating that sticks to moist meat.<br /><br />I use it with skinless/boneless chicken breasts....and let it cook for 40 minutes or so covered at 350degF, and the last ten minutes take the cover off, lower the heat to 325degF and let the juices condense to a syrupy consistency that your guests/family can spoon over potatoes (mashed or baked or sweet).  Careful, it burns easily past a certain point.  I was so glad when I saw this product available on Amazon as not many markets carry this product and while you must buy 12 packs, it is about 30% less than buying the individual packs at the market.  The packets are foil, so the product will have a long shelf life. I have been using it for five years and my family and friends always compliment me on the meal.  This product is the REAL DEAL...trust me.
