Treacle toffee is always a treat. I first found it years ago while<br />visiting relatives in England. At first, I really didn't like it,<br />but at some point decided to try it again. Since then, I've sought<br />out places in the U.S. (stores or online) where I can buy it.<br /><br />  Treacle toffee generally wouldn't appeal to Americans; most seem<br />not to like it. BTW, "treacle" itself seems to be (nearly) equivalent<br />to "blackstrap molasses".<br /><br />  Am glad I can usually get this toffee online.
