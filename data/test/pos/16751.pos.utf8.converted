This is truelly the nylabone you want to buy.  Others that are out there to buy for your dog are not the same as this one is.  If you have a chewer, this is the bone for you.  It looks like plastic but isn't.  they can chew and chew and it does not splinter or break apart.  We have a 60 pound lab/greyhound mix and she chews everything to shreds.  The only thing that comes close is a real bone.  This does not get all yucky like a real bone.  It doesn't make a mess on your floor.  It is the real deal.  If you are looking for a bone for a heavy chewer or just a little chewer, this is the bone for you, hands down.  This is what you are looking for.
