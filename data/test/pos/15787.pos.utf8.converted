These are THE original veggie stix.  If you go to to a major grocery chain store or Whole Foods, most have resorted to selling veggie "straws," which are like veggie stix but hollow, hard, and overly salty.  The Good Health veggie stix are a lighter snack and simply, just taste better in my opinion.<br /><br />I was happy to find the product on Amazon, but learned quickly that 10-7oz bags is a lot.  I bought the product in the beginning of Summer and it had an expiration date for August.  Unless you really love snacking on these things, it's probably more worth it to buy in the store if you can help it.
