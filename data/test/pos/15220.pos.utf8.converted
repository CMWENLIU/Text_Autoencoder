If your only ramen experience was a dry, tasteless brick dumped into a pot of bowling water that you purchased six for a dollar, then you are in luck. Once you try a Nong Shim noodle bowl you will never go back to Nissin Top Ramen.<br /><br />Nong Shim delivers a flavorful instant noodle meal, balancing seasoning and spice for a perfect lunch on a cold, winter day. The noodle bowl has a rich, red broth that is visibly loaded with spices. I've recommended Nong Shim to many people but a few, because of the kimchi flavor, have been hesitant to give it a try. I can attest that Nong Shim's noodles are not as pungent as `fresh' kimchi.<br /><br />I submitted two product photos. Please give them a look. One shows the ChefsBest Award and endorsements Nong Shim received. Nong Shim is the leading brand of ramyoen (ramen instant noodles) in South Korea.<br /><br />I recommend adding refrigerator scraps to your noodles; perhaps, whole kernel corn (for sweetness) or some tofu, finely chopped green onions (scallions), chopped, cooked beef, chicken or seafood. An egg is another delicious addition, either hard boiled and chopped or over easy.<br /><br />One final note: a serving is high in sodium, so skip drinking the soup if that is a concern as the noodles themselves contain little sodium. You can reduce your sodium intake by more than 60 percent if you don't drink the soup.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.
