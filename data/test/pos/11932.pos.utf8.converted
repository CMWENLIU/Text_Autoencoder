These kidney beans help to make a great chili.  They're full of protein, and healthier than canned beans (no added salt, or aluminum or BPA residue from the can).  There are no instructions on the package and they do need to soak/cook for a LONG TIME!  The first time I used them they were too hard.  Now I soak the beans in a crockpot overnight and then cook them in the crockpot for about 10 hours the next day before they're tender enough to use.  I'd recommend them; my children even like to eat these kidney beans cold as a snack!
