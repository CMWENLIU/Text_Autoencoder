I first tried Puerh tea 5 years ago and ever since was willing pay for the luxurious experience.<br />It's hard to describe like trying to explain what a truffle tastes like.<br />Very earthy and savory .<br /><br />I am exited I found this Numi brand it is difficult to get that whole leaf taste and this tea bag tastes like<br />it was prepared with the whole leaves and from a very good quality . I was expecting it to be somewhat of a knock off or similar to an Oolong but this is the real deal and I do not have to go through all the fuss to prepare it without the tea bag now.<br /><br />Puerh Tea tastes better when the leaves or Tea bag is reused up to 5 times. Just make sure the bag dries completely. This is the way the Tea connoisseurs recommend drinking it. I personally use my leaves or tea bags 4 times with this type.<br /><br />I love this and will repurchase again.
