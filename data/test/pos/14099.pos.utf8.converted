I remember my dad using a similar item (made of wood) years ago to keep our yard gopher free. The new generation Black Box is plastic, but works just as well. The snare is very strong and seems to do its job very quickly (at least none of the gophers have been alive when I've gotten to them). Once tripped, it requires a bit of muscle to release the spring and a little shaking to get the gopher out, but that's just a testament to its effectiveness. I hate to kill these little guys, but they're destroying my yard! The Black Box is a a definite Gopher Getter.
