I use to use the regular Lipton Onion soup mix for chip dip until I came across this a few years back.  This is far and away the best for dip.  The other was too salty and too strong.  However, the Golden Onion is far less salty and more subtle.  Lipton suggests using one packet for each pound of sour cream.  However, I buy a 3 lb of Daisy sour cream at Walmart and mix two packets (2.6 oz's) into the container and it makes the best dip.  I have literally caught guests dipping their fingers in it.  I hope they never quite offering it.  I like it best with big thick pretzels.  It's also delicous with vegies too.  My husband and I are active in the motorcycling community and and we like to entertain.  People literally look forward to our gatherings because they know we'll have the dip.  My husband tells our friends it's his "secret recipe".
