Seeing as this is a food product, I can't explain to anyone how it tastes. Obviously you, yourself would have to go out and purchase this in order to have the pleasure. That being said: I must stress of how tastey this milk candy is. They come in a nice fairly transluecent bag with around 20-30 pieces stuffed inside. I didn't bother taking the time to count due to my unquenchable hunger and eargerness to taste the morsel. As I have said, I can't tell you how it tasted because it was so heavenly good that it is hard to portray an image. Creamy would be very accurate yet sentuous would also be a good description. Just order a bag and you will be glad you did, but be careful: this product can be quite addicting!
