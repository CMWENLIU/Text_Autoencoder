My dog is even getting picky on her treats she is so spoiled.  She will no longer eat pupperoni or any treats along that line.  She loves what we call chicken treats, the dried chicken jerky treats, but not much else.  I found thes on a saver offer and eligible for free shipping so I gave them a try.  She loves them.<br /><br />To give you an idea of similar taste preferences, she also likes Merrick Texas taffy but that is expensive and unfortunately not available for free shipping here.
