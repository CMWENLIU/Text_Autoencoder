I eat well. I read a lot of research on health. I'm a Medline junkie. I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs. Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.)<br /><br />None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life.<br /><br />That is, until Natural Calm.<br /><br />This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically!<br /><br />Here are the things this supplement has helped with:<br /><br />Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night.<br />Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed. Also increased my ability to deal with difficult "crisis" situations.<br />Mood--- Made me generally happier.<br />Decreased muscle cramping and soreness.<br />Improved gums and teeth.<br />Improved hair loss.<br />Improved digestion and transit time.<br /><br />Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right?? Me too!<br /><br />But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without. It has made that important an improvement in my life. It is almost like a miracle. Really.<br /><br />There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume. Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume. In America this ratio is about 4 to 1. Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1. I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day. (Try "The Magnesium Factor" by Margaret Seelig or "The Magnesium Miracle" by Carolyn Dean here on Amazon if you want more science of magnesium.)<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two. You probably won't need that long. I noticed an improvement in two days. A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement.<br /><br />If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results. Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want.<br /><br />Here's wishing you great health!
