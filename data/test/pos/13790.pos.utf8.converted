Well, I am neither British, nor British-born, but I absolutely love Marmite.  It is an acquired taste and one that produces very strong reactions indeed!  Their "Love It Or Hate It" ad says it all in fact.  As a proof of this, I have two dogs: one loves marmite sandwiches, the other one starts sneezing when she feels the smell of it.  My recipe for the perfect breakfast: marmite soldiers and soft boiled egg. Delicious!
