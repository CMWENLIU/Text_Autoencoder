I use this with 16oz jars of Stop & Shop Natural Peanut Butter - it fits them perfectly.  I would think that it would fit most standard 16oz jars of peanut butter.  It works exactly as described.  It makes mixing natural peanut butter quick, easy and mess free.  It's very easy to use!  Cleanup is also easy... I was shocked, but it does actually clean the rod almost pefectly when you remove it from the lid.  There's also a thin, removable, plastic inner lid which is a breeze to clean.  Do be sure to lube the mixing rod with either peanut oil or olive oil prior to use, as per the instructions.
