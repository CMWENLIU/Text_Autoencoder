I have two cats.  One cat has been overgrooming for a few years resulting in a bald stomach and legs, not to mention hairballs.  The vet thought it might be a food allergy or anxiety and suggested that I experiment with different foods.  The other cat has a sensitive stomach and would throw up a couple times a week.  None of the foods I've tried over the past year seemed to make any difference. It never occured to me to try grain free food until it was mentioned in a Tidy Cat Breeze review I was reading (another highly recommended product - I love it!).  I purchased this food a couple weeks ago and not only has the puking stopped, but my cat's hair is already starting to grow back. This food is definately worth the price!
