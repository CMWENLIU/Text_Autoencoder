I received this basket as a present for my anniversary and I absolutely loved it! It has everything you need in it for a gourmet dinner and more. It came in a cute basket that's reusable, and had an amazing hand tied bow in top, and when I cooked and ate the food inside it was delicious! The other person who left a review said there was no instruction on how to cook noodles but I honestly thought that was kind of common sense(LOL). Anyways overall this was a great gift and I highly recommend it!!
