Quinoa is a concentrated complex carbohydrate, meaning you only need a quarter cup for 29 grams of carbs as opposed to brown rice which a whole cup is needed to attain the same. Those of us who eat complex carbs for weightlifting purposes, eating six to seven or more meals a day, know the daunting task of getting enough complex carbs through food without eating cup after cup of bulky brown rice, this is the perfect replacement, in my opinion.
