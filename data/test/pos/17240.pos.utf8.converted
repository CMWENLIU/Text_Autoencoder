We too got hit with the cat food recall and our beloved Destiny didn't recover like the other three 4 legged babies did.  When she died I started researching cat food and the additives.  Cats are NOT vegetarians and the first ingredients in many foods was corn or other grains.  Blue is chicken 1st and then human grade sweet potato and blueberries.  A heathy diet for anyone, but especially for my babies.  They were on Blue exclusively for food but we (hubby) still gave them various brands of cat treats.  A few months ago we had a problem with severe itching in two cats.  I checked and the treats included processed corn (again).  We got a second flavor of the Spa Select and we now use that as "treats"...it took a couple of days before they accepted that as their treat, but no more itching. They are happy, contented, energetic and look forward to meal time and treat time.  (If we are a bit late, they remind us.)
