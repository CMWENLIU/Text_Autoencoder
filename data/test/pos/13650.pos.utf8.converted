I have tried many gluten free pizza crusts, and this is by far the best. Be sure to use very hot water when mixing it (near boiling). This will make the dough easier to handle. I recommend making many small pizza crusts and storing them in the freezer so you can pull them out, add toppings, and toss in the oven for a few minutes. Makes a great quick meal.
