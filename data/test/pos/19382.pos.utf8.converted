I bought this product because my 18 year old cat just wasn't eating anything and I wasn't ready to lose her.  She loved this stuff and I know it gave her an extra six months of her life because she was losing weight at a fast pace - eating this stopped the weight loss.  I would recommend it for anyone who has a sickly or older cat.
