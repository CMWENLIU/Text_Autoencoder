I love the taste of tangy roasted red pepper in this soup. It makes for an interesting twist on the boring old tomato soup. This variety is thick, tasty and filling. I like to accompany the soup with Glutino Cheddar Gluten Free Crackers and/or plain low fat Greek yogurt (instead of sour cream). A few points about the size and sodium content:<br /><br />1) Each box contains 32 oz of liquid. One serving is 8 oz. However, for a filling meal I need double that (16 oz). Even doubled, the soup has only 220 calories and 4 gr of fat.<br />2) The sodium content is "lower", not "low". Each 8 oz serving contains 360 gr of sodium (or 720 gr for my doubled serving). Regular soups have typically upwards of 550 gr of sodium. Better choice for a healthy person, but not the right choice for someone on a sodium restricted diet.<br /><br />This soup makes a great work lunch. The container is resealable (the cap is twist off). In fact, it is also sold in 16 oz containers. Once opened, you should store it in the fridge and consume within a week or so.<br />Enjoy!<br />PS: The soup is certified organic and kosher dairy, for those to whom it matters.
