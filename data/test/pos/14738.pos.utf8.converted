I had to write a review on this mainly because they really are SO GOOD! They are bite sized clusters, being 100% natural with No preservatives, No Artificial flavors, No Added Colors. Ingredients are: Almonds, Brown Rice Syrup, Pecans, Cashews, Organic Sugar, Sea Salt and Sunflower Oil. I bought 2 bags of these at Sam's Club and I decided to look for them on Amazon because I thought they'd be cheaper, and I actually paid about $8.69 for the same 24 oz. bag at Sams Club. Wow, now I want to go back to Sams Club, these are so good, but I think very overpriced if you purchase them here. I would suggest going to your local Sams Club if you have one in your area, the size of the package is exactly the same.
