For the last 10 years, I have been striving toward healthier eating.  We joined an organic CSA (Community Support Agriculture), we found good sources for free-range meats & poultry & eggs, we switched over to organic milk.  I buy organic, local, or fair-trade (or all of the above), whenever available.  But my daily elixir: a pot of hot black tea with milk & raw sugar... that perfect pot of tea kept eluding me.<br /><br />The organic and fair-trade options in tea were never right. Oh, sure, if I want rooibos, green, or white tea, organic choices abound.  And organic herbals have always been easy to find, as are good chai teas.  But for unflavored black tea, my organic choices were limited to an adequate English Breakfast, which was never as tasty as I thought it should be for the high price.<br /><br />The proprietor of the local tea & herb specialty shop finally helped me solve my challenge, when she suggested I try Irish Breakfast if I was looking for a lovely black tea for my morning routine, since it is mostly Assam tea, which is just the best, in her opinion, for us black tea lovers.  So after 30 years a tea lover, I finally put my finger on what I loved best in tea: Assam.  Armed with a name for it, I typed "organic assam" into the Amazon search box, and found this wonderful tea.<br /><br />Finally a high quality tea that is rich and smooth and bright and lovely and organic!  And leave it to Amazon to offer case pricing on it.  My inner socially-responsible obsessive-compulsive does a little happy dance with every sip...
