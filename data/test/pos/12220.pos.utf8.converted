I have been buying this brand of boneless and skinless sardines for years and still love to just open a can and eat them for a snack.  I know that being boneless and skinless lowers the calcium level but I've never liked the crunch or taste of eating a whole sardine right from the sea. And they are packed in olive oil which is loaded with Omega 3's too so it's as good for you as are the sardines.  However, I am not so sure about their actual mercury levels.  Buying them from Amazon with their $10. off sale on $49. purchases is a great price.  I've even found that many of the local grocery stores as well as Costco and BJ's NO longer carry this product.  Or their price has skyrocketed.  It's great to be able to stock pile them from Amazon.  If you like sardines, you'll love these! And they are just so nutritious for us all.
