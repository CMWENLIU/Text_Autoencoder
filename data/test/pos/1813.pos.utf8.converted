As a long-time fan of Dr. Pepper I thought I'd give this sauce a try. I wasn't expecting it to taste very much like Dr. Pepper and figured it'd just be a pretty standard barbecue. Not only does it have the distinct Dr. Pepper flavoring, it works very well on everything I've tried it with - chicken, burgers, and in baked beans. Even some people that aren't Dr. Pepper soda fans liked it. If you're a fan of barbecue sauce and a fan of Dr. Pepper you're almost guaranteed to like it!
