This is my first purchase of organic coffee, yet I am very impressed and pleased.  I used to get stomach pains if I drank too much coffee and this coffee is so gentle on my stomach that I haven't even had a second thought about acidity levels and such, and it is so flavorful and dark.  I am hooked and will be buying this brand from now on.
