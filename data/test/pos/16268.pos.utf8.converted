I really love everything about this brand of coffee. I appreciate what they stand for as a company and how they operate in a very green & eco-friendly conscious way. The coffee itself is delicious! Tastes great out our Cappuccino maker as well as our little french press. Really, please try it and see for yourself.<br />Oh and the coffee bags are completely biodegradable!
