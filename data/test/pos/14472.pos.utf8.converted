First off, this kit produces 30-375ml bottles of wine, not the advertised 30-750ml bottles of wine.. Also, this is not a 13.5lb box, it's a 13.5kg box which equals 30lb. It does not require the addition of any water. The main juice bag is 9L, and the F-Pack (sweetening pack) is 3L.. That being said, you will need a 3 gal carboy in order to make this wine, along with all the other necessary equipment. The finished product is very good! Like any ice wine, this is very sweet, and meant to be sipped along with a dessert. It fermented from 1.114 to 0.990 in just over 3 weeks, and after adding the sweetening pack, it was 1.060, so it's like drinking candy! I've tasted a few different ice wines from the finger lakes, and this is right on par with them. This is the first Ice Wine I have made, so I can't compare it to any of the other kits available from other manufacturers.. The color of this wine looks like a whiskey. With free shipping this is a bargin price for an Ice Wine.. Normally in the store, these go for roughly $15.00-$25.00/375ml bottle, and these cost $2.00/375ml bottle!!<br /><br />I will be ordering this again!
