Nostalgia moment:  Perched on the counters of my mother's kitchen, my friends and I would eagerly await her magic mix of Carnation malt (generously added), Mayfield chocolate ice cream and enough milk to smooth it all together.  She mixed it in a big bowl with a spoon and served the thick malts in cups with a spoon. Awesome chocolate malts! Those malts were perfect snacks for late night original series Star Trek.  I am so glad to find it available here.
