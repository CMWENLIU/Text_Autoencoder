I have one of these every morning on my way to work. They have a great flavor and are just enough to tide me over until my breakfast break. I was a little hesitant to buy so many after never trying them, but I'm glad that I did. I ordered these and their French Vanilla Yogurt bars and was very pleased with both. I also like that they're organic and don't have a lot of the added chemicals and preservatives that other cereal bars do. I would definitely order these again.
