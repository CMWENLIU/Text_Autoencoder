I searched and searched for natural food coloring.  I was wary of this one, because it had some bad reviews on another listing on Amazon.  I decided to get it anyways, and couldn't be more happy with it!<br /><br />The yellow was kind of seperated when I got it, so I just shook it up really well.  I was able to get gorgeous, rich colors.  I will definately be buying this again.
