These are well made, with nice crisp shapes.  I had a hard time envisioning how much volume 3 lbs represented, so if this helps anyone...these completely filled an 8 x 5 x 3 inch box.  I had enough to give a generous amount (maybe 1/2 to 3/4 cup) in each of 12 goodie bags.  And if anyone is looking for ideas, I put these in flat white bakery bags, folded the tops down and then printed a little round label with a picture of lego blocks to seal them.
