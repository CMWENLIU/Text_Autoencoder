I trained my dog with these treats.  He can now speak 5 languages and knows the meaning of "euphemism". If he was vicious and a bit bigger he would kill me for them.  If he had opposable thumbs I'd have to worry about being robbed at gunpoint.  Chocolate is said to improve the mood of humans.  These treats do the same for my dog.  I might even try them.
