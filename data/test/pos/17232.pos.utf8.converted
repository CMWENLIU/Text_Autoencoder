I absolutely love these lentils. You get the high protein and fiber that you get from beans, but they cook very quickly. They are a very small lentil. They can be used as a side dish, in soup, and cooled then put in salads. Very versital.<br /><br />A 1/2 cup serving is about 100 calories with zero fat. You also get 4 grams of Fiber, with is very important in your diet.  Along with 6 grams of Protein.  Wow, fat free protein!
