Incredibly smooth, Sumatran Reserve has become the coffee of choice in my house.<br /><br />Big and rich coffee flavor without bitterness and an ever so gentle natural sweetness makes every cup something you really enjoy and want to savor.<br /><br />The 12 count package is small and opens easy, perfect to have sitting near the Keurig on the counter.
