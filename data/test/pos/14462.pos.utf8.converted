This is by far the best bread product for celiacs if you can have cheese.<br />Any kind of cheese makes this mix tasty.  As someone who doesn't like to cook, I am thrilled with the ten minute prep time and 25 minute baking time.  My house smells fabulous, I get fresh bread, and hello sandwiches!!!  Something I love and hadn't had in over two years as I have MANY other food allergies, including yeast and rice, so all other celiac bread options I found were not suitable for me.<br />As for the directions, I find it easier to add the baking soda to the mix and THEN mix all wet ingredients together BEFORE adding to the mix.  Incorporate wet ingredients and then knead.  Then add the cheese and continue to knead.  I bake rolls at 375 for 25 minutes and they are moist and a bit chewy.  I find 35 minutes is too long.<br />There is no sales tax on Amazon and this is a MUCH better price than in my local supermarkets or health food stores.  I will only order Chebe from Amazon if the price stays this reasonable.
