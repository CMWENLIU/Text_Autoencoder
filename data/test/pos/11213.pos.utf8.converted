I had been going to Grand Cayman for years and always saw these cakes, in a little gold box, always thinking how good can a cake that's been sitting in a box be?  In July 2010, we were there and walked into a store that had a sample of each flavor of the Tortuga Caribbean Rum Cake.  Needless to say, I tried every flavor and went back for more.  These were the most tasty, and moist cakes I had ever had in my life!  Now, they're my "go to gift", and I send them to friends and family.  Everyone loves them...and thus, the cycle continues!<br /><br />Thank you Grand Cayman for producing a little slice of heaven, right here on earth!
