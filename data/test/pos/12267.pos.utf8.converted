I am seeing one of the 84 board certified lipidologists in the U.S. and he strongly recommends Benecol margarine, so when I saw these chews I knew I had to try them. I was having trouble eating 2 tbsp of the Benecol margarine a day, but it is easy to get the recommended amount with these chews. I will have my cholesterol checked again in a couple of weeks, so hopefully it helps along with medication. They really do taste like a caramel candy. I would recommend them highly!
