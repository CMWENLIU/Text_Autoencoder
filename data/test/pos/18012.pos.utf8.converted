El Yucateco hot sauces are great. I've been enjoying the red and green for a long time. I also tried the other ones, the Carribean which is good, and the Habanero Extra Hot sauce is exactly what its called, it is hotter than all the others. I think the best El Yucateco I've tried was the Chipotle one, which sadly is not included. Overal El Yucateco has some real good hot sauces which are not just hot but big on flavor.
