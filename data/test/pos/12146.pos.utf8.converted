I love homemade yogurt when made with this starter.  It is relatively foolproof with an inexpensive yogurt maker, and really delicious--much more delicate and fresh tasting than what you buy in the store.  It sets up well and provides a good base for added fruit and honey for a healthy, nutritious and satisfying breakfast or lunch.  One packet of starter is added to a batch of warmed milk, per your yogurt maker's directions, stirred and left for the required length of time--about 6 to 8 hours.  That's all there is to it.  The finished yogurt lasts well in the refrigerator and can also be drained through cheesecloth for a denser, Greek-style yogurt.  I'm told the quality of the yogurt depends on the starter and this is the only kind I'll use.
