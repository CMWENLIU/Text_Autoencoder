For family members who just will not eat their vegetables, this is a welcome option.  From the Campbell's website, here are the ingredients in the strawberry banana variety: RECONSTITUTED VEGETABLE JUICE BLEND (WATER AND CONCENTRATED JUICES OF SWEET POTATOES, CARROTS, TOMATOES, BEETS), RECONSTITUTED FRUIT JUICES (WATER AND CONCENTRATED JUICES OF WHITE GRAPES, ORANGES, APPLES, STRAWBERRIES, CLARIFIED BANANAS), CONTAINS LESS THAN 2% OF: NATURAL FLAVORING, BANANA PUREE, VITAMIN C (ASCORBIC ACID), MALIC ACID, CITRIC ACID, VITAMIN E (ALPHA TOCOPHEROL ACETATE).<br />With each can comes one serving of vegetables and one serving of fruits.  A grab and go way to get a little more nutrition into the hands of those who would otherwise be drinking a carbonated beverage or other nutrient free substance.  I have found several people who will not touch a traditional V8 will drink this one.  Try the Pomegranate blueberry variety too.
