Most of us (girls mostly) grew up running away from, chasing, or killing this little insect. You'd never think of actual eating one. Most people have a problem with eating crickets or any insect not because of the fear of how it may taste, but the fact that it's an INSECT. People also see these little guys as dirty and not worth being food for humans. This is understandable looking at some cricket or other insect that wanders inside of your home, but it's different when they are farmed especially for human consumption as these. I mean, you wouldn't just chuck some random insect into your mouth, even if you were into eating insects. It's like gnawing on a cow while it's grazing and this clearly isn't the case.<br /><br />This product is one of the first "alternative-protein" foods I've tried. Like almost everyone, I had to get over the shock of putting something that could also have die in the soles of my shoes into my mouth. Once you get past the looks and the no no thoughts, they pretty much taste like roasted, flavored peanuts though a bit hollow. The more you eat the more "normal" it feels. I even had a friend try one ( I paid them $1), they popped it into their mouth, Fear Factor face and all, and asked for more. The only drawback for me is that it takes more than one at a time to make it feel as though you're not eating air and I didn't get my dollar back.<br /><br />After eating crickets, I wanted to know what else there is to try and so I've sampled just about every other bug Hotlix has to offer. If you're an adventurous eater like me, this is a must. Absolutely. If not, they're great for gag gifts, party icebreakers, and pranks.
