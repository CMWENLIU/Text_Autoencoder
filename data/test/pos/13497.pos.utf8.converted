This was a gift to my wife for valentine's day and she really liked it.  I was worried the lavender would be overpowering on some of the products, but it's a good balance between noticeable and pleasant.  The sponges/scrubbers are big enough to get the job done - about the size of a hand each.  The mix of items is great for enjoying a bath and lathering on some moisturizers afterward.  The potpourri is bigger than you can tell from picture - at least a liter in volume. The containers are all pretty nice and easy to use.  None of the included items seem cheap or useless.  Finding a nice bathrobe and some candles to compliment this gift basket would really make a special romantic present.
