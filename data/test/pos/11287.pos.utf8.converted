This is great stuff! The texture matches peanut butter and has some nice little crunchy bits throughout. I had some for lunch on crumpets (also from TJ's) which were really good! If you like ginger flavors you will love this. I will be buying more to have around as a change from peanut butter. My only gripe is the cost online. There is no reason a small jar 11oz jar should be $12+ dollars! If you have a TJ's next to you this is $3.69 per 11oz jar as of 4/17/12.
