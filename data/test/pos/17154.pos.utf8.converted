I really enjoy using this sugar. It never hardens and is really full flavored. I ran out and had to buy another brand and my cookies just didn't come out as well. They just tasted sweet and didn't have the depth of flavor that Wholesome gave them previously. I'm never using any other sugar if I can avoid it.
