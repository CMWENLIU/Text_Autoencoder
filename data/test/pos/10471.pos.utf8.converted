So I bought two of these, keeping one in my odd collection of energy drinks and drinking the other. They arrived days earlier than expected in perfect condition, and were nicely packaged and cold. This drink is very heavily blue, so dont drink around friends if you dont want to have blue teeth for an hour or so. The taste was excellent, a blue candy raspberry flavor. The buzz was pretty good for the size of the can. I wish mainstream energy drinks put as much energy as this company did into the taste of their energy drinks. I will definantly be buying more of these, 5 stars
