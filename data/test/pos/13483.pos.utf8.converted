I live in Kazakhstan and, unfortunatelly, we don't have any type of vanilla beans in our supermarkets. Plus, most of the companies simply do not have delivery to our country. Friend of mine was visiting US and I've ordered the Vanilla Beans from Arizona Vanilla Company to his temporary address. But, unfortunatelly, my parcel hasn't been delivered by indicated time and I've contacted Arizona Vanilla Company for their assistance. They found out that the parcel has been lost and offered to ship new order. I've explained my situation that friend of mine has already left US and that I live in Kazakhstan. Despite the fact that they initially do not ship anything to this direction, they kindly offered to do an exception and ship it to my home address in Kazakhstan! I was soo impressed with such high level of customer care. I've got my parcel and finally can start baking :)<br />Thank you very much for your care and support! I wish you company great success!
