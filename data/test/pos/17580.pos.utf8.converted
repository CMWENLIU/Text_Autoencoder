Coming from south Texas with most of my family from generations of south Lousianans, hot sauce has been a staple condiment for most of my 50+ years.  Certainly, my family never had the mania seen by some today for the absolute hottest sauce one could stand.<br /><br />The most common hot pepper sauces are still staples in my kitchen:  Crystal, Frank's, Louisiana, and Tabasco.  They all have their uses, and I must admit I use Tabasco less than any because of its heat.  One little drop can be enough for me.  I enjoy Frank's most on meat products, not just Buffalo wings.  I really like Louisiana Hot Sauce on eggs and other egg products.  However, the most-used in my home is Crystal.  Why?  It's certainly hot, but not so overwhelming that heat drives out foods' flavors.  I really love the Louisiana Hot Sauce's smoky flavor, but it's also twice as salty as Crystal.  The garlic used in Frank's is also not desirable for all uses.<br /><br />No, Crystal gets more use than any other.  It costs a fraction of Tabasco--but then, someone has to pay for all that Tabasco advertising.  I love the fact that I can actually fill a teaspoon with Crystal and down it straight without cauterizing my oral cavity.<br /><br />Crystal may be considered the poor man's Louisiana pepper sauce, but it has been around a very long time and has endeared itself to an awful lot of people down here!  Worth a try, and quite inexpensive to boot.
