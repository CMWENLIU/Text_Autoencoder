I was not able to find any UNSWEETENED coconut flakes in local stores. Coconut is kinda sweet in itself, I have no idea why they load it with sugar.<br />Anyway these flakes are so flavorful. There are a trillion ways you can use them. They are also so fresh.<br />Some people have said in their reviews they are dry... well I suppose that is inevitable because they need to dry the coconut meat in order to preserve it. Also, obviously these will tend to be more dry than those shredded finely because finely shredded flakes will have more surface in contact with moisture from other foods (or your mouth if one eats them alone) and thus will absorb more moisture than large flakes. But it is very easy to shred them more finely with a food processor or similar tools. Personally, even eating them alone without shredding further, I have not found them dry at all.<br />Overall, outstanding product.
