I recently purchased three orgeats available here on Amazon: Ferrara, Monin, and Teisseire. I tested each orgeat in a variety of cocktails, and Monin was the best choice in every test. It has a rich almond flavor that stands up well even when mixed with a number of ingredients in a cocktail, and gives drinks a smooth depth. Unlike Ferrara--which was my second choice--Monin's product has no preservatives and comes in a glass rather than plastic bottle, both plusses in my book. I highly recommend this orgeat.
