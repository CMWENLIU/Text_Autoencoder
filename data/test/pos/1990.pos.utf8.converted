I ordered 2 four-oz tubs of the julienne tomatoes and two bags of porcini "kibbles".  The tomatoes are really fresh - bright ripe tomato red, flexible (neither hard nor soggy), aromatic, tangy and delicious.  (I'll review the porcini later)  The customer service was outstanding - speedy shipping, gracious communications, and excellent packaging, with each item wrapped carefully in tissue paper inside the shipping box.  Impressed? You bet.  I'll be ordering again.
