I bought this as a gift for a friend of Italian heritage who had often remarked about the unavailability of his childhood comfort food here in the States.  I was very aprehensive that my gift would be only one of good intention since I had no way of knowing what the cream should taste like and I had no idea if this would measure up. I got my answer half a second after the first taste when he did a prolonged "mmmmmmmmmm" and the biggest grin of delight lit up his face.  This man is a very well mannered gentlemen (he eats his pizza with a fork) and I caught him licking his fingers after he put the remaining cream in a storage  container...he'd wiped the can clean!  Thank you Roland Creme for resolving that age old question "what do I get him for Christmas?"  Excellent product, delivered in a timely fashion.
