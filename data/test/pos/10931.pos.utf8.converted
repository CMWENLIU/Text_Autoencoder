I agree with the last reviewer. This is indeed the best Chai tea I have ever tasted! Truthfully, you don't even need to add the milk and honey, it is good simply by itself. It is strong, pungent and spicy; the perfect replacement for that early morning coffee. After purchasing this product, I will never use a tea bag again! Highly recommended.
