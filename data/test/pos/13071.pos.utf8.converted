I expected these to be the typical CFL (packaged in heavy plastic) and really bulky with horrible color.<br /><br />Wow, was I wrong.  These bulbs arrived in a cardboard box and each one was small enough to get into my 14" light fixture.  I replaced 6 100W incandescent bulbs with these 6 23W CFLs.  Not bad and I did not need to have all of that plastic packaging.  The bulbs do come on immediately, but as with most, they need about 120s to full hit maximum light output.  I liked these so much, I'm thinking about buying the candelabra six pack for another fixture.<br /><br />Now only time will tell if this was a good investment.  Will they really last?  I hope so.
