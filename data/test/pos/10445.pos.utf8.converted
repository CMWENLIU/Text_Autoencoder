This tea has just the slightest hints of orange zest and a little spice. It reminds me of when I used to go to Seattle to my grandmother's house and we would have tea and her famous apple pie. A relaxing tea you can drink with honey or with milk and sugar. Orange Blossom honey is recommended.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
