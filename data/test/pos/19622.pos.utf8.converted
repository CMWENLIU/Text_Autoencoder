We have a Nostalgia Cotton Candy Machine.  When we tried this floss with our little machine one scoop made a nice fluffy cotton candy cone that almost resembled the ones we get at the fair.  It gave us better results then the floss that came with the machine.  I think we will get a lot more use out of our machine with this!
