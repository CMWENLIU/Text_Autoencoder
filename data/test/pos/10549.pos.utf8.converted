My wife is a big Glen Close fan, and I think Michael Douglas is one of the best actors of the 20th century.  We love quoting the lines from "Damages" and "Wall Street," but when Friday night really gets cooking (if you know what I mean), we like to play "Fatal Attraction" -- the romantic game that's sort of, well, the grown-up equivalent of spin the bottle, which we remember playing back in seventh grade.<br /><br />The biggest problem, though, is where to get the rabbit.  My neighbor always seems to notice when we break in and take Fluffy (as well as Fluffy 2 and Fluffy 3).  It really seems to bother him when we do this -- obviously, he doesn't have much tolerance for role-playing, or maybe he just wants to save Fluffy for his own recipe.  Whatever.  When we found this dead frozen rabbit on Amazon, we said, "Hey, that's the kind Glen Close would use" (if, that is, she was not very quick and agile and was unable to capture a bunny by her wits and fast grabbing).<br /><br />Packaging is fine -- nice shrink-wrap deal -- but a little bit too tough to cut through when the passion is starting to escalate and you need a frozen dead rabbit to put in that pot of boiling water right before your lover walks through the door.  Sometimes you wish it was just in plain old white butcher wrap.  But then again, the letter carrier would be jealous; no doubt he'd take it home to his own wife and they would play some kinky game themselves.  For now, I'm the one who brings home the big dead rabbit, thanks to Amaazon's all-inclusive website.  (Next week, my wife and I will go online in hopes of finding supplies to act out that fine Joe Pesci film, "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag."  With luck, maybe Amazon will make it a Daily Deal!  Or, who knows, at least maybe they'll let us buy a nice, new duffel bag if the rest of it is on backorder!)
