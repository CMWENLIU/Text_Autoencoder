This is excellent quality pure coconut oil at an incredibly good price! It works very well used in lieu of damaging, petroleum based anti-chapping agents. When cold it will harden but can easily be returned to its liquid state by inserting the bottle under hot water(it does work equally well in its hardened form.) We transfer a portion to a small container and carry it with us in lieu of petroleum "sticks" when we hike, climb or ski. It goes on smoothly without a greasy feel and more importantly, does not block healthy lip tissue regeneration. It also tastes and smells good.  We were very pleased with the manner in which the seller communicated with us to assure that our transaction went smoothly. This seller and his product rate an A+ in our book!
