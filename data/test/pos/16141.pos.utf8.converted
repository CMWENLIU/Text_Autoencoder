I've been using Happy Hips for almost a year now for my pooch who was taking a long time getting over a torn ligament.  I've ordered them from many places but this particular supplier is top notch.  Does not kill you with high postage and handling and the product came well packed so hardly any of the strips were broken.  Can't say that about other suppliers of this product.  Will definitely only order from them in the future.
