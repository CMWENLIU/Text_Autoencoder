In every sense, this is a fine quality espresso. I was surprised that Nestle could prepackage espresso in a capsule yet retain all of the desirable characteristics of a good espresso. The espresso is strong yet smooth, sweet without bitterness, and had nice thick crema. I haven't enjoyed an espresso this good in a long time, but this was a pleasure to sip.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Green Mountain Coffee Extra Bold Espresso Blend, but I have to admit that the Dolce Gusto Espresso wins this battle.<br /><br />This would also make a nice base for homemade coffee beverages. At 44 cents per serving, this is not only inexpensive but makes a nice afternoon pick-me-up drink.
