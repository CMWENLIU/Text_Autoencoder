I have used gold flax for years and love the health benefits. Do some study for yourself on the anti-oxidant, anti-cancer benefits. I also love the taste of gold flax which is slightly higher in Omega 3 than brown flax. I eat it in a health shake, granola bars, banana nut muffins, sprinkled on cereal, in brownies and cookies.T his pack of 4-26oz. is =6.5 pounds and a great value.
