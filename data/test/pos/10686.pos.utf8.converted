my vet has told me to buy the best pet food i could afford. that used to be iams. after working in a pet store, i discovered merrick. wow, what a difference in ingredients and only a few dollars more. now, all four of my dogs eat merrick wilderness blend dry. they love the taste. i like the natural ingredients. a great product.<br /><br />steph
