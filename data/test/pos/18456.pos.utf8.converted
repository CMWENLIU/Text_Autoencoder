We try to use olive oil for as many purposes as possible because of the health benefits.  The best olive oils are first pressed/cold pressed because there is less processing involved and the oil has higher levels of the good stuff, plus it is generally of a lighter nature with a less pungent taste.<br /><br />The latter is particularly important when you are cooking for picky little kids.  And it's one of the reasons we use Bertolli's extra-light.  This extra-light oil is nearly tasteless.  HOW TASTELESS?  I use it all the time in cake recipes.  It absolutely makes no difference to the taste.<br /><br />Pam T
