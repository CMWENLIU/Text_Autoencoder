This Chocolate drink mix is great.  I drink rice milk and it even makes that drinkable.  So i can only imagine how it would make regular milk taste.  it reminds me of nestles quick from the way it smells to the way it tastes.  no sugar and no calories and no artificial ingredients.  You only need to use a tiny bit,  this thing will last a long time depending on how many people are using it.
