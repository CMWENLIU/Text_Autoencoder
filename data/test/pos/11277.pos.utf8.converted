I can not say enough good stuff about this protein shake.  I scoop it into my blender ball in the morning shake and drink.  The whole process take 1 minute and I'm not hungry again until lunch time!  It tastes great, sort of like gazpacho and It could not be more important to get enough leafy green veggies in anywhere we can! At less than $3.00 a shake, it is also a great price to pay for a quick nutritious no fuss breakfast that leaves you no clean up.
