I always used Gephardt Chili Powder when I lived in California and never thought much about it. It wasn't until I moved and could no longer find it in the grocery stores that I realized how good it really is. For years family members would pick me up some every time they visited California. When that option ceased and after throwing out bottle after bottle of inferior chili powders after using them once, I am thrilled to find it available online. Chili powder is not all about heat. Gephardt's provides a much richer and fuller flavor in addition to the heat. According to history, William Gephardt, originally of New Braunfels, Texas and later of San Antonio invented the first commercial chili powder in 1896, but very little else is known about him; he apparently sold out to a brother-in-law and disappeared from the scene. His chili powder nonetheless remains popular today with a cult following.
