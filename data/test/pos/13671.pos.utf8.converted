I purchased this product on a whim. It happened to be a gold box deal so I went ahead and purchased a case. As a college student, I sometimes find myself staying up late to study. I also find myself researching and testing various energy drinks. 5 hour energy, 10 hour energy, monster, venom, bawls, red bull--nothing I've had compares to this product.<br /><br />Hansen's Energy Pro Citrus has a fairly smooth taste, with a little bit of bite. It's not overly sweet and I don't like drinking pure sugar anyways. Speaking of sugar, the ingredients list on the can mentions NO high fructose corn syrup or fructose of any kind--only sucrose and glucose. Amazon needs to update their ingredients information. An interesting ingredient is ginkgo biloba leaf extract, which I've never seen in other energy drinks. The benefits of ginkgo biloba are fairly well researched (google it).<br /><br />Effects may vary, but I noticed an immediate improvement. I no longer felt tired and my mind was ready to go into action. Other energy drinks that I've had will get your body going, but your mind is still tired--not the case with this energy drink. I didn't feel jittery or have trouble concentrating.<br /><br />The cans are the same size as a red bull (not the larger 12oz cans), but the taste is so much better than a red bull. If there was such a thing as a "healthy" energy drink, this would be it. The price is not bad at all either, especially if you subscribe--which I will be doing before I run out.<br /><br />If you're looking for a new energy drink and happen to come across this--give Hansen's Energy Pro a try.
