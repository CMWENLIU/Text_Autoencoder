This product has been available to runners for quite a while. The flavors are just like the Jelly Belly beans, but with a little extra kick and loaded with carbs. Very useful during those long runs when you need those carbs and potassium. Low in calories. Very convenient small packaging for your fanny pack or Fuel belt. Highly recommended and great price to boot!
