With a husband who has been on a gluten-free diet for twenty years, I've tried just about every alternative I could find to substitute for "all purpose flour" in traditional recipes, including mixing my own from a vast array of other flours. Some were OK, some failed in texture, some failed in taste, some were downright inedible.  With Beth's Gluten-Free All-Purpose Flour, I've finally found a product that works in most of the cookies, tea breads, muffins, and so on that we all enjoy, and is also affordable for everyday use.  It can be substituted in an equal quantity just about anywhere a recipe calls for "all purpose flour" - obviously you'll need to experiment if you use it for yeast breads.  Oh, and by the way, it doesn't taste "gluten-free".  We had a very merry Christmas at our house!
