Vegan. Natural. Kosher parve. Sunflowers are so beautiful. Sunflower seeds are a joy. German whole grain bread. Moist. Hearty. Flavorful. Great with soup, or a salad, for veggie sandwiches with dressing, or with your favorite jam or marmalade. Or just plain to enjoy the moist whole grain German flavor right from the vacuum sealed package. Slices can also be cut into squares for making your favorite appetizers. Made with whole kernal rye, wholemeal rye flour, sunflower seeds, salt, oat fiber, and yeast. Long shelf life. My order has 10 months left on the suggested use by date. Pre-sliced. 7 slices (the long way) per loaf. One long slice can be cut in half for two square pieces for one sandwich. 140 calories, 5g protein, 6g fiber per slice. Great option for those who like German style bread but may not have an authentic local bakery. Product of Germany. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference.
