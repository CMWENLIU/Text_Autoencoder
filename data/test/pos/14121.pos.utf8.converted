I've been using Satin Ice for a year now on my cakes.  I purchase it from local bakery supplies stores as well as online.  It is nice and smooth, soft and pliable. It doesn't require much kneading and tastes like vanilla, a bit on the sweet side though.  If old (over a year), it will taste rancid and be a bit hard but can still be rolled out.  Wilton brand rolled fondant is gross tasting and not as soft and pliable.  Marshmellow fondant is more pasty tasting and gummier.
