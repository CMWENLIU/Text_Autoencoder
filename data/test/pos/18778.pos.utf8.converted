Green & Black's Organic Orange and Spices Dark Chocolate bar is for serious chocolate lovers only.  It has intense flavor that will make it difficult to go back to "standard" chocolate bars from makers like Dove and Ghiradelli.  G&B's bar tastes like an infusion of orange rind, light spices, and, of course, chocolate!  This bar melts in your mouth like no other and is more than worth the extra cost.<br /><br />A nice bonus is that this bar is Fair Trade certified, so you know that you're buying a chocolate bar that was purchased for a living wage to the farmers that grew the cocao.  I love all of G&B's products, and I think you'll like this one too!<br /><br />Keep in mind that in stores, one of these bars retails for ~$3.99.  At Amazon's current price, they're only $2.79 each.  Quite a deal.
