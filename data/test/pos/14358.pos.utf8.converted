The customer who wrote about these not being organic is a total ijit. What could be more organic than growing wild in a pristine mountain environment, and then hand-picked and sun-dried by glove-wearing natives who have been harvesting them for centuries? You don't get much pure than that. Who cares if they are certified or not?<br /><br />These do not taste burnt. They taste incredible and make you feel really good. My whole family totally loves them.<br /><br />There is a mistake in the description that says they are incan berries. They are not.
