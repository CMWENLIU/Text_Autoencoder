I was so delighted to learn that I didn't have to give up pasta when I was diagnosed as celiac.  The quinoa pasta is very tasty and has a nice bite to it.  It has a smaller window of peak perfection when cooking.  If cooked too long it does get mushy and I find it tends to stick together.  A quick cool water rinse helps.<br /><br />We had tried rice pasta first.  It is pretty slick and tends to slide off your spoon.  We liked the taste in Pad thai, but not with Italian sauces.
