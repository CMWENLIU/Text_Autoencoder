This is the most awesome-tasting Larabar ever.  I've given all Larabars 5 stars, but this one (Blueberry Muffin) is the best one ever!!!  If you only try one flavor of Larabar, let it be Blueberry Muffin.<br /><br />The Larabar people obviously are really good at what they do.  They make all these Larabars taste exactly like whatever it is they are, but without any added sugar, preservatives, soy, or other bad stuff.  All ingredients are natural.  For example, these Blueberry Muffin Larabars (the feature Larabar) tastes just like a blueberry muffin.  The Pecan Pie Larabar tastes justs like a pecan pie.  The Peanut Butter Cookie Larabar tastes justs like peanut butter cookie.  The Cashew Cookie Larabar, to me, tastes like shortbread cookie.  The coconut Larabar tastes like an awesome coconut treat.  The Lemon Bar Larabar tastes just like a lemon bar.  The Banana Bread Larabar tastes just like banana bread.  And so on and so forth.<br /><br />The Larabar people don't do just taste, but also texture.  For example, this Blueberry Muffin has a different texture than the Peanut Butter Cookie or the Cashew Cookie.  Those two cookies have a harder texture, like a cookie.  But the blueberry muffin has a softer texture, like a muffin.<br /><br />I can't get over how awesome the Blueberry Muffin Larabar is.  It is the perfect blend of ingredients that give it the awesome and perfect taste and texture.  And they do not skimp on blueberries.  I love the taste of blueberries, and it has a rich and wonderful taste of blueberries.<br /><br />This is the best Larabar of all of them, and I've had them all.  I do love all of them, though, and I've given 5 stars to all of them.<br /><br />Larabars are vegan, all natural, no soy, etc.  They are so good, even if you are not vegan, or don't care about healthy bars, I think you would still love them because they are so good.  We don't have to skimp on taste just because they are vegan, healthy, soy-free, etc.
