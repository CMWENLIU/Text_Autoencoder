Research other tuna products, their sourcing, processing, and then research Wild Planet.  In addition to their quility processing, their selection of smaller fish, and the fact that the tuna is cooked in the can is quite different from say, Bumble Bee.  Most others freeze the fish first, then bake it, which removes a lot of the desirable Omega 3 oils.  This is sushi grade tuna, hand packed while raw.<br /><br />Plus, the taste just blows all the others away.  I've been using this product for quite some time, and have never had an experience such as the 1 star reviewer has.  I would have to imagine, had that person requested a replacement or refund Amazon would have made it right.<br /><br />I don't often buy the best product out there nor shop organic, but with tuna it is important to me to consume the best product I can obtain.
