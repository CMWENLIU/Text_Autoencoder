This product is a lifesaver for us! We are on a strict form of the HCG diet and added these noodles to our maintenance phase. We missed pasta and it is a great alternative. I added meat and tomato sauce and found it very filling! I recommend these to others on the diet, or those who have gluten allergies. Remember to rinse, boil one minute and pat dry before using. You will notice a fishy smell when you open the package, but it goes away when you prepare them. Thank you for a great product...I just ordered the variety package and will make some more recipes with seafood and veggies!
