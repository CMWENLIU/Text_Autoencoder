I've been searching since the days that Kashi stopped producing their meal replacement shake mix for something that tastes just as good and is just as good for you.  I've tried both available flavors of Orgain and I find the chocolate to have no remnant of soy protein in its taste.  The shake tastes great at room temp and amazing chilled.  I appreciate that there's some remnants of veggies and fruit in the shake too.<br /><br />Potential downsides:<br />It's not all oil, sugar, and protein....although its mostly that...  So it's not exactly as good as sitting down and eating a sandwich.  The shake is only made in pre-measured little boxes so there's no opportunity to save some money with a tub of a dry mix.  The shakes are expensive too.  The trade off is better ingredients, instead of unpronounceable and artificial junk found in say, Slimfast (although that too is mostly oil, sugar, and protein...just from worse ingredient sources).  The shake is also not vegan if that's something you're looking for.  There's currently only 2 flavors of the shake too, so if variety's your thing, this isn't a good shake to try out long term.<br /><br />I still rate this 5 stars for the ingredients, the taste, and the fairly extensive nutrition content.  I wish this had more veggies and fruit in it though...vs. 50 mg each of a fruit and veggie blend.
