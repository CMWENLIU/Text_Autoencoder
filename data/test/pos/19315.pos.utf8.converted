For years our now 7 year old Manchester had eaten Science Diet bought from vet. She had dry skin, eye problems, hair loss and chronic skin sores with frequent vet trips and constant antibiotic spray with no results. Walking through Target looked up and saw dog food display. Brain flash said try new food. Bought Purina One. Within 2 weeks noticed marked improvement. Searched web and found site where owners rated food. Science Diet rated "F". Purina One better but rated "C". Natural Balance Ultra Premium rated A+. Bought first bag 3 years ago. Coat now thick and glossy, eyes clear, skin clear with no lesions after first few weeks, feels great and very energetic and playful where used to be in pain and acted like old dog. GREAT FOOD, Dog loves it, made from good stuff. Can't say too much good for this product.
