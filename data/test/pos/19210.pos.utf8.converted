I've had a yen for my "super duper gut bombs" (oatmeal patties) but since I'm vegan now, it wasn't an option to make them with eggs. AHA! Garbanzo flour to the rescue and this brand is the best I've ever had. It held the patties together fully as well--or better--than eggs did. I'm a happy camper. BTW, I do the "throw together" method of cooking. Ingredients are quick oats, garbanzo flour, chopped fresh mushrooms, chopped onion, Braggs, coconut aminos, olive oil, garlic granules, Italian seasoning, sea salt and enough water to combine everything.  Baked them on an oiled cookie sheet @ 350 until brown, turned once. The mushrooms keep them moist. YUM!!
