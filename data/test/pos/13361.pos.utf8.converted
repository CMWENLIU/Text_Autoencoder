I don't like flavored coffees.  However, I do love chocolate, and I love coffee.<br /><br />I thought I would give Chocatal a try based on a couple other reviews I read on the web and I am very pleased I did so.<br /><br />The two flavors blend very well in Chocatal.  It is not at all as if you poured some chocalate syrup into your coffee.  The chocolate flavor is more subtle than that, and blends extremely well with the coffee.  It is very smooth and leaves with a very clean finish.
