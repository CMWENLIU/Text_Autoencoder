I purchased this Bonsai directly from Brussel's since I didn't know Amazon carried them at time of purchase. This was an anniversary gift for my wife and she absolutely loved it! According to the Brussel's site it is 5 years old. Here are the details of the purchase.<br /><br />Packaging: I was very impressed overall with the packaging. The box was much larger than I thought it would be and was quite heavy overall. Upon opening, the box was filled with foam peanuts which were surrounding and within the leaves and branches. After removing the peanuts I noticed the leave were green and not one had fallen off during shipment. The base was well wrapped in bubble wrap and tape and it was clear it had been well watered before shipping. The outside of the box had been marked with "LIVE PLANT". I couldn't have been more pleased with the packaging.<br /><br />Plant condition: If I hadn't unpacked the plant myself I would never have known this plant had just been shipped via UPS or Fedex during the middle of Summer. The plant was larger than I expected, with the planter measuring 10"x13" and the height from counter to top of the tree being 17". The leaves were lush and shiny green and the planter soil was still moist. As I previously mentioned, I found no leaves that had dropped during shipping.<br /><br />In the weeks after arrival the plant continues to do well and I've noticed new growth. We've placed it next to a plate glass sliding door that faces west where there is ample sunlight all day.<br /><br />Based on this experience I will definitely look to Brussel's and Amazon for my next Bonsai purchase.<br /><br />Big Red
