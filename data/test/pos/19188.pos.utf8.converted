I am a GF Newbie.  There I said it. ;-)  In the beginning, I tried to buy all the flours and mix all the ingredients to get a general all purpose gluten free flour.  What a mess, what an expense!  I then started trying the GF Flour blends like Bob's Red Mill, Pamela's etc.  Eh.. didn't care for them.  I stumbled upon Better Batter and gave it a try.  This stuff was made for GF newbies!  Substitution is close to cup for cup for wheat with the addition of a little extra liquid.  I am now making breads, cakes, cookies once again and having them turn out instead of flop or turn into bricks.  Wish I had known about Better Batter when we first started on the gluten free diet.  That would have saved me time and money.
