There are several retailers that sell these Chocolate Ice Cube candies, but this company offered the best price.  It came in a plastic bucket as pictures and didn't have a lot of those nasty styrofoam peanuts.  The candy tasted fresh (don't tell my sister, but I snuck a couple of pieces before giving it to her as a gift - quality control!).  I'll be buying them again next year for the whole family.
