This is the best mix we have found.  Makes great bread sticks and wonderful calzones! I make a batch and freeze it until were ready to have it then cook it.  It works well in our toaster oven as well as our regular oven.  My daughter and I can't eat gluten.  We both really missed bread stuff.  This is a perfect replacement!  We have used other chebe mixes and have not been disappointed.  Everyone who is GF knows things have a different taste and texture but this is really close to the old things we used to love.  I think you will like it as well. This was an especially great find to help make the transition for my 5 year old.  If she give it a thumbs up you know it's got to be good!!
