Being a student, I am constantly searching for something that is going to keep me awake and alert throughout the day and even the night. Coffee and 5 hour energy definitely does the trick but I hate feeling jittery, all to crash at the end of the day.<br /><br />My grandpa actually gave me some Puerh cause he was trying to cut back on coffee and said it might help. I have never been a big coffee drinker so the flavor was a bit intense at first but i've grown to like it.<br /><br />What I like most is it keeps me energized throughout the day but I'm not shaking and spazzing out like I would be after taking shots of energy.<br /><br />I would recommend this tea to anyone who is looking for something not as intense as an energy drink or coffee but still needs something to keep them awake or alert.
