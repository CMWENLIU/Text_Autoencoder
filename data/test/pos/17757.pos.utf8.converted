I have used this product for years.  I have it auto delivered.  I make it in the crock pot at night.  Sometimes adding vanilla, nuts, or dried fruits.  Make according to product directions, but add additional 3/4 cup liquid (I like half n half).  Set to low when you go to bed and you have a wonderful morning meal for the whole family.  Is great for weekend guests and it's ready to dip into as each person arises.
