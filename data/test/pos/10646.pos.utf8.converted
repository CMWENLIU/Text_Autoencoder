I know this product tastes good because I mix it with salt and use it for gum issues.  The gums stay sore after using this mixture on them for about a week to a month but then they heal completely.  It takes daily use to get the gums to heal but they eventually do.<br /><br />Others have said mustard oil stinks.  I washed my hair and put some in my hair as usual and a co-worker said "you smell good."  We couldn't figureo out what it was but the only smell on me was the mustard oil.<br /><br />Finally, I don't know if this is true or not, but I think my hair is growing quicker; I put a permanent dye on my hair two weeks ago and now I have to put some more on it; dye normally doesn't grow out in two weeks on ethnic hair.<br /><br />What I like about the oil, even if the rest is the placebo effect, is that on ethnic hair, the oil absorbs in about a day and your hair doesn't feel oily but it is indeed moisturized.
