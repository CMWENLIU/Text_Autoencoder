First off, this is a STELLAR product. Just opening the box and taking a whiff of the tea makes your eyes roll to the back of your head. And the taste of it is...pretty amazing. I get mad sugar cravings after meals and this usually does the trick to suppress them.<br />But the price here really throws me off. One box for $5.99 PLUS shipping is an extraordinary ripoff. I got a box at Whole Foods last night for $2.49. At WHOLE FOODS. If some vendor is marking this up more than double than at the Markup Emporium that is Whole Foods, something is wrong.<br />So, please shop around! This is a product that is definitely worth the little extra effort of finding a better deal.
