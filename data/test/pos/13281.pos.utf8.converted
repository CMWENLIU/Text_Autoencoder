Tupelo honey is the finest honey on the market, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ517G">Cal's Honey, Tupelo, 22-Ounce Squeeze Bottle (Pack of 3)</a> is value priced! Tupelo honey does not get grainy or turn solid over time, and it is digested differently than other sugars so it doesn't cause sugar highs and lows - making it a good choice even for diabetics. This is thin, free-flowing honey, so we store it in the refrigerator to make it pour thicker. The flat top on the container makes it easy to store upside down for fast dispensing! Cal's Tupelo Honey is produced in Georgia, USA.<br /><br />More facts: Tupelos are valued as honey plants in the southeastern United States, particularly in the Gulf Coast region. They produce a very light, mild-tasting honey. In northern Florida, beekeepers keep beehives along the river swamps on platforms or floats during tupelo bloom to produce certified tupelo honey, which commands a high price on the market because of its flavor. Monofloral honey made from the nectar of the Ogeechee Tupelo has such a high ratio of fructose to glucose that it does not crystallize.<br /><br />The Apalachicola River in the Florida Panhandle is the center for tupelo honey. The honey is produced wherever tupelo trees (three species) bloom in southeastern USA, but the purest and most expensive version (which is certified by pollen analysis) is produced in this Florida valley.
