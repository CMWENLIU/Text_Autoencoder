Quinoa is a staple in our household, it has tons of vitamins and minerals, a higher amount of protein then any other grain so it doesn't spike a blood sugar, gluten free, and comes naturally in "two flavors", white and red. i add white to my son's oatmeal and chicken dishes (white has a milder taste), and red quinoa goes better with red meats and tomato/avocado dishes. Although the difference is not significant, it is nice to have a variety.<br />I like Alter Eco brand because it is a fair trade.<br />I highly recommend it to everyone! I'd give it ten stars if i could.
