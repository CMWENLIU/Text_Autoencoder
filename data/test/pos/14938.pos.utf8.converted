After reading about honey for wounds by Dr. Peter Molan (University of Waikato, New Zealand), I decided to purchase this honey with its anti-bacterial properties for treating a bad wound in order to prevent scarring using gauzes and skin-safe surgical tapes after cleansing with hydrogen peroxide (low percentage, like 1%). I have never seen a wound heal with such minimal scarring despite the depth and severity of the wound! I come from a family of medical doctors and everyone is impressed and asked about these results, including my own doctor!<br /><br />-Manuka honey has an antibacterial property due to the release of hydrogen peroxide which can kill bacteria.<br /><br />-UMF = unique manuka factor<br />This is rating system that measures non-hydrogen peroxide antibacterial potency of manuka honey. The range is 0 to 30 but typical manuka honey has a rating of 10 or more. The higher the rating, the higher the anti-bacterial activities. This Wedderspoon Manuka Honey has a rating of 16+<br />Here is the UMF rating rubric:<br />* 0-4: Not detectable<br />* 5-9: Maintenance levels only (similar to table honey and not recommended for special therapeutic use)<br />* 10-15: Useful levels endorsed by the Honey Research Unit at The University of Waikato[citation needed]<br />* 16 and over: Superior levels with very high activity.<br /><br />-Extremely effective in aiding: Acid Reflux, Heartburn, GERD, Stomach Pains, loose stools<br />I like to eat spicy foods and used to rely on heartburn pills. My stomach condition got worse recently, and certain foods (even if they were NOT spicy) started triggering the acid pains. My chest began to have acid-related pains. This honey has really helped me to get off of the acid reflux or heartburn pills and my stomach is functioning regularly.<br /><br />-Raw honey = doesn't use the sterilization process using gamma radiation.<br /><br />-Chemical and pesticide free, Antibiotic and GMO free<br /><br />-Never feeding the bees sugar<br /><br />-USDA Organic certified to have no additives.<br /><br />-Has a very strong floral taste and unique flavor. I personally love it.<br /><br />-More viscous than other honeys you can buy at the store. You have to spread it on breads. I enjoy this in tea and on various breads and cakes.
