This product reminds me of the natural coconut.  There is no after taste and it is not sweetened artificially.  As a swimmer, I highly recommend it for its electrolytes and flavor.  It is refreshing and rejuvenating. In my opinion, you cannot get more natural than this brand (no preservatives).  I highly recommend it and proudly give it 5 stars. Delivery was quick and no dented cans.  Glad to see it is back on sale and under $24 with super saving shipping (big bonus).  I am also  interested in automated ordering, if possible.
