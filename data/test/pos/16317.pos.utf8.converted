So I had never tried these, but I like the lavender Howards- and I love guava.  How to express the delightful island flavor of these little guys?  Imagine a smarty candy with a really intense, grown up, guava flavor (think pineapple, strawberry and pear- all mixed up together)- and them imagine that smarty is really large- that's this candy.  I like these.  My kids like these.  Their friends like these- but I told my kids they just can't share these with their friends- because they disappear too fast.<br /><br />You might want to know the ingredients:sugar, invert sugar, natural and artificial flavors, stearic acid, citric acid, malic acid, magnesium stearate, red 40 lake.  These little candies are made in the USA by the C. Howard company, 1007 Station Road, Bellport NY, 11713.<br /><br />Try these!  You won't be sorry- unless you don't like guava.  Then you might be.
