I have a very interesting type of cat; he's a Siberian, sort of like a Norwegian Forest cat, and rather rare. We got him as a rescue from the dumpster cat rescue volunteers in our area; my husband saw this cat in a cage and absolutely just had to adopt him. (And we already had a cat. And were living, temporarily in 2 rooms. So you can imagine, it was SOME cat.  One characteristic of the Siberian is that they molt or shed fur in great quantities twice a year. It just COMES off--there is a downy undercoat that stays put and some guard hairs, but the main coat, thick and lustrous, just flies off. You should see the pile outside my office door at home--he sits there. Insane. So the cat gets hairballs. How can he help it? And he prefers to disgorge those hairballs on the BEST decorative rug we own OF COURSE; not on the linoleum in the laundry room, the wood in the entrance, or the regular wall-to-wall carpeting either, no, right smack in the center of the BEST rug.<br /><br />So something had to be done. Anyway, he needs to get rid of the hairballs and merely arfing them up isn't sufficient; cats can get a lot more hair stuck in their gut. So I got a tube of Laxatone on the vet's recommendation. While you can use Vaseline, the problem with vaseline or mineral oil is that the lubricating agent also pulls some nutrients out of the cat, and that is not healthy for them. Laxatone is rather like thick, gooey petroleum jelly, but it is fortified with  linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and peptonized iron to prevent some depletion of nutrients. It's flavored (in this case) with malt. It would seem some cats enjoy the taste of malt. (It's known some cats will lap up beer.) I think it may be that cats eat rodents, and in eating the mouse, they eat what the mouse ate, including perhaps grains that have malted in the gut of the mouse. So perhaps this is, naturally, a flavor cats are inclined to enjoy. In any case, MY cat, LOVES this. He gets the recommended dosage for his larger size, over three days, then gets a maintenance dose once a week or so. The result is a reduction in hairball expulsion and better elimination.<br /><br />If you cat doesn't like malt flavor (there is no pleasing some cats) there is a tuna flavored variety. My previous cat, an equally hairy furball of a Maine Coon, was persnickety about food and was not a snacker. She would eat the malt Laxatone to some extent, then she'd refuse it. This cat eats practically anything, so he's no trouble, and he enjoys his medicine. I enjoy the improved health of my kitty.
