Between 7 and 8 months I started my baby on Cheerios, until I found Puffs.  They truly melt in his mouth and the nutritional value exceeds Cheerios.  He would sit and eat Puffs all day if I let him.  The banana does not have much flavor, but I also bought the apple and it have more flavor.  Either way, the baby loves them the same.
