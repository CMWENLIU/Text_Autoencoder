I was afraid to buy this because I wasnt sure how it would taste. I was afraid it would be too strong tasting, but to my suprise, its great tasting! The strawberry cream flavor isnt so strong and just right. Its my healthy dessert. I have it for breakfast and sometimes as a dessert after dinner. I think its way better than peaches and cream flavor, although I do like peach and cream too, strawberry just taste better in my opinion.
