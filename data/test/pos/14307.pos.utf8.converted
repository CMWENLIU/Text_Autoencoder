I had heard of ghost chilis for years before finally having the nerve to try Dave's Insanity.  I was amart enough to try it in the dead of winter (California gets 40-ish, not too cold).  My first encounter with dipped chicken wings still broke me in a running sweat.  I could not feel my tongue anymore, and I suffered the after-burn for thirty minutes tnereafter.  Tearing was constant over that half hour span.<br /><br />I would recommend diluting this monster and not using it as a dip, like I did.  Use an eye dropper to measure out Dave's sauce with your favorite barbecue recipe.  You will be shocked by how little of Dave's your system can tolerate.<br /><br />All this dilution is a pity because there is a definite flavor to this touch of lava.  At present, I can consume an entire plate of barbecue or wings with about 20% of Dave's Insanity.  Actually, one of the best uses of hot sauce is a tiny dlution of Dave's with your salad dressing.<br /><br />I do love spicy, but there is one drawback to a plate of Dave's.  Cast-iron stomach or not, the heat will invade your innards.  No amount of iced beverages will tamp this sensation down. Please be careful as many people will not tolerate ghost chiles in any dilution.  The biggest problem appears to be uncontrollable coughing jags.<br /><br />A little goes a long way.<br /><br />Finally, keep your dogs from the leftovers; a simple swallow could be the last bit of food your dog will ever consume.  The consequences might be fatal.  This is no joke.
