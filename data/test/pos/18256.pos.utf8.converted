I got this product for my girlfriend as she has had trouble getting a good sourdough starter going. She prepared the mix as instructed and it was bubbling in no time. She followed the directions about feeding, etc and made a loaf a few days after she started the mix. I'm a southern fella so I don't know how authentic her bread is compared to the San Francisco sourdoughs, but I think it is great. Makes good bread with a nice sour crust to it. She's still experimenting with rise times and whatnot to get lighter loaves, and I'm happy to eat the results!
