T.V.P., three wonderful letters known to most vegetarians. Let me say that I still eat meat (*gasp!*), but I am trying to transition to a vegetarian diet. Rather than going cold turkey (or cold tofu maybe?), I figured I'll try to work in one or two vegetarian meals into my week. That isn't so easy when you feel like there's nothing to satisfy that chew, that texture that only meat seems to exhibit. Enter Textured Vegetable Protein. When I first heart of it, I thought "what a weird sounding product". But reviews said it provides a meat-like texture in meals, and it was cheap, so I figured why not. While TVP may not look too appealing (soylent green anyone?), and the smell when raw is a bit unpleasant, it is a wonderful product. It really does have the texture of ground meat when reconstituted in boiling liquids. And just like tofu, it's a flavor sponge, adapting to any spice or flavor you throw at it (warning: throwing spices at something could be a messy affair). I've made tacos, chilli, used it for spaghetti and meatballs, and made some pretty good veggie burgers with it. I also took the suggestion of using it to extend the ground turkey I had in my house, so even my meat meals are turning vegetarian!<br /><br />I know I'm barely cracking the surface of what this stuff can be used for. I just want to say to any meat eater considering going the vegetarian route, it's not all gloom and doom. TVP will help you out. In fact, you can say TVP = The Vegetarian Pathway (I just made that up while typing, but it seemed fitting!). The value is great too; with Subscribe and Save, amazon's price is much cheaper than what I find at my local grocery store. This will be a staple in my pantry for quite some time. I'm already on my third order in fact.
