Well, nothing that comes with an brand name label beats this. There are brands that are better, but not one you'd find easily. These are not ground leaves. They are tiny little leaves allowed to dry and curl up, so expect to see almost mini-peppercorn-like granules. If you're not familiar with leaf teas, the boiling/steeping time is higher, and the outcome is very strong, so if your normal cup of tea involves lukewarm water and Celestial Seasoning, I'd let this be. Note that you should use less, but not steep it a shorter time. The full taste only develops after the leaves open up.<br /><br />I'm from the Indian subcontinent, and once I got this, I introduced it to other folks from around there, and they've all been sold on the taste, aroma, and body. I personally feel that's a pretty good endorsement from that bunch.<br /><br />Also, this is a huge pile of tea, enough to fill a 5lb bag of sugar (though of course much lighter in weight). Tetley also makes the round bags in the purple box that have a very similar quality if you don't drink tea 3 times a day.
