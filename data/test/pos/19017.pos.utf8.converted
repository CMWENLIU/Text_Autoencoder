I am in sheer heaven! It smells sooo wonderful. Not overpowering, just a subtle scent. I'm using this product as a skin softener (marvelous), hair product (so soft) and for cooking (light, tasty). Although, I have 3 different bottles for their uses. I keep them refrigerated for longevity (just a preference). I prefer the product in its solid state rather than the liquified state for use.<br /><br />Add a few drops to your lotion, use in your co-wash bottles and great when grilling foil wrapped seafoods and brush on shish kebabs and grilled veggies. Its light.<br /><br />I will remain a faithful consumer of this product.<br /><br />Nina
