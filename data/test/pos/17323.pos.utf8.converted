Mini Naturals - 1 pound - Salmon Flavored<br />Great product for training dogs!  I use them all the time for training (walking on a lead, sitting, fetching).  They are high in flavor so even with our 7 month Golden Retriever, treats cut in half work well for a reward.  Unlike dog kibble or other treats, these are quickly digested so that your dog will not be gagging on them as he/she works on the next behavior.  To keep fresh, keep bag tightly closed and put a portion of the cut treats in a resealable sandwich bag.  If they do get exposed to air and dry out, a small portion of a moistened paper towel in the bag will restore them to original texture.
