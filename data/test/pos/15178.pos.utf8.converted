I have suffered from severe cystic acne for a few years now. My face is really starting to clear, and I'm seeing the glow that other reviewers have talked about. In the past I have tried eating healthier, taking tons of supplements and using all sorts of ointments, benzoyl peroxide, salycic acid. Nothing cleared my skin. There are several factors here. First I was a heavy coffee drinker and for those that don't know, coffee is very acidic inside your body. Stopping coffee helps, plus all the unneeded cream and sugar in my cup. Sugar and dairy should also be avoided for clearer skin. This tea is naturally sweetened with stevia, I think it's sweet enough by itself. If this tea is not sweet enough for you I would recommend adding extra stevia, or honey. Just avoid using white bleached processed sugar and artificial toxic sweeteners, like Sweet and low, Equal, and Splenda. One other thing, your body will heal itself. Avoid, washing your face more than twice a day and applying<br />lots of products. If you wouldn't eat it don't apply it to your skin, your body absorbs all those chemicals.<br /> I believe that cutting way back on coffee, and replacing your caffeine source to a green tea will have a dramatic affect on your complexion. That being said, the glowing has to be some ingredient in this tea.<br />I have been alternating between Yogi skin detox and Yogi super green antioxidants, for over a week. I haven't broken out<br />badly sense drinking this tea, well one or two pimples,  but they are nowhere near as large and painful as before, they also seem to be healing faster. Hopefully after a few weeks I will start seeing even better results. Also shaving for the past few days has been easier, my skin feels less dry and the razor glides over my face with less irritation.
