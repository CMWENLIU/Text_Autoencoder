I tried these the first time they were on sale, and now I'm hooked.<br />I don't care much for regular ramen and this isn't regular ramen.<br /><br />The dried vegetables and the other flavors give it a more 'lo mein' taste, than a 'soup'.<br />Somehow, it seems more authentic.<br /><br />The one cup of water that you add to the mix in prep leaves the proper amount of moisture in the mix.<br />The second packet is quite flavorful, but not so MSG'd that you have a MSG headache afterwards.
