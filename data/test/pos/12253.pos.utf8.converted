I thought I would use this like coconut milk but OH NO, I didn't. It is like a coconut butter (along the lines of peanut/almond/etc).  Please be prepared to enjoy it and have to stop yourself. FYI it is too firm if put in the fridge like the package recommends. When I got it it was soft and separated like oil and coconut. Just squish it all together and  go for it.
