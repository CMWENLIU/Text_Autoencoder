My local stores have not carried the chocolate flavored malted milk anymore for the last 8-9 years. My mother-in-law who lives in the mid-West shipped me a case several years ago and I have been hording it like a mizer. I love this stuff...it was comfort food when I was sick or just needed a treat while growing up. So glad I finally found it after numerous google and internet searches...please keep selling it!! If you do, I will buying!!
