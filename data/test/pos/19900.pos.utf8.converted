Just thought I would share a way I enjoy these.<br /><br />I put about a tablespoon nibs in the magic bullet, grind them up.<br /><br />Put about a teaspoon of ghee (grassfed clarified butter) I get organic from healthfood store and 1 teaspoon to a tablespoon raw organic honey (unfiltered and unprocessed) in a custard cup.<br /><br />I let the mixture melt a bit in toaster oven set at 105 degrees. Yeah it's a raw foodist idea. (minus the ghee)<br /><br />Stir it up into a little ball after the ghee and honey soften. Enjoy slightly warm or for a different texture, throw in the fridge to reharden.<br /><br />Simple, quick, perfect little power food.<br /><br />I'm not a calorie counter, but this is a small amount and I feel great having it.<br /><br />Quality calories count. :)
