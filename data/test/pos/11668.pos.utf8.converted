I LOVE these colors. I used them in pastry school to make brightly colored buttercreams and fondants, and there really is no substitute. In a lot of confection making, using too much color will ruin the formula and your product will come out poorly. These colors have worked for even the most delicate uses! I was so excited to be able to buy my own, and I'm sure they'll be getting a lot of use in the near future. :)
