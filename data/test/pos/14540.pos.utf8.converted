I am a chive addict.<br /><br />I use them in cottage cheese, on cream cheese, potatoes, rice, meat and more.<br /><br />As a volume user, the high cost of buying in the small jars in grocery stores is not an option.<br /><br />Not only do I save a lot of money buying in large containers, but as a bonus I get a better quality product than any other dried chives that I have tried.<br /><br />When you look at the contents, you will immediately notice that they are a more vibrant green than other bottled chives.  And in this case, looks are not deceiving.  These chives have a noticeably fresher taste than I have found in other brands.<br /><br />The only way to get better chives would be to grow them fresh in your own garden.
