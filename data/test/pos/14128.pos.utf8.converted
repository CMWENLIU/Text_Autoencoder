I long assumed there was no meaningful difference between whatever pepper came pre-loaded in a salt & pepper shaker set and the little tin boxes of pepper in the spice aisle and either of those couldn't be far behind any freshly ground pepper. There's probably some difference but basically pepper is pepper, right? Well, turns out that's a bit like saying "Coffee is coffee, right?" More accurately, basic grocery store pepper flavor-wise is like the decaf instant coffee of the world, and these peppercorns are like a fresh roast from a favorite coffee shop - their quality is so different they're incomparable, one an unflattering caricature of the other. If you are even remotely tempted then get a grinder (I'm very happy with this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00032RYP4">Kyocera Ceramic Fine Mill, Black Top</a> myself) and get this pepper. You will not regret it! And you will be re-paid many times over by the faces of those who taste your food!<br /><br />This pepper is rich, soft and pleasant, but still assertive. My wife and I agreed on the first bite that the pepper we had been using (and always just thought hey that's what pepper is) was not only bland but also sharp, even acrid, by comparison. I cook enough that I made it through my last pepper tin (about 3 oz) in about 5 months, so it wasn't brand new but it's not like I'm comparing this to something I found in my cupboard dating back to the Carter administration.<br /><br />Make no mistake, I'm no expert, but I have a feeling many of the people checking this out are in the boat I was in last week, maybe can't imagine spending more than $3 to $5 on pepper, maybe can't imagine it will be worth the extra step of grinding to use, and that's why I'm writing this to say yes it totally is worth the extra step and more. But if by contrast you're already a pepper connoisseur then I can't really give you any insight comparing this to other "real" peppercorns (though I hope to try more in the near future!)
