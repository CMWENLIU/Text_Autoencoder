I absolutely love this product! I get the angel hair variety, too, but the rice-style is my favorite. It is so versatile and easy to use. I just rinse it for a couple of minutes in a strainer under cold running water and put them straight into a skillet of browned minced turkey or chicken that's been pre-seasoned. I cook it all together long enough for the flavors to mingle and any extra fluid to be cooked off it...delicious! I only wish it didn't sell out as fast as it does and that it was more available than it is.
