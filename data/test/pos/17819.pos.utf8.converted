I use oat bran both as a hot cereal and in baking. Bob's Red Mill Organic Oat Bran Cereal is delicious as a hot cereal (especially when cooked in milk rather than water) and ordering it online from Amazon is cheaper than buying Quaker Oat Bran in my local supermarket (if I buy it with enough other stuff in my order to qualify for Super Saver Shipping). However, if you are using it for baking you should be aware that it is not as finely ground as Quaker's. Sometimes this has an effect on the texture of your baked goods and sometimes it doesn't. It depends on the recipe. I definitely prefer it to Quaker's as a hot cereal because it has more texture.
