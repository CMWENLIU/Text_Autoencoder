I do not need sugar free products. However, when I bought these chocolates for a diabetic family member, I found myself wanting to eat them instead of the regular chocolates in the house. I prefer Amber Lyn over See's and most other European chocolates available here in the US. The texture is very smooth and creamy, the chocolate is not overly sweet, and the portions are just right.
