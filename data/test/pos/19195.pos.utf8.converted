I had just about given up on colas (diet) cause I figured it wasn't worth all the crap they put in it. But, hey, I LIKE cola. Have loved colas since I was a kid and now I'm creeping into pension territory.<br /><br />I had tried the grape and cherry Zevia earlier in the month, and really, really enjoyed them. I decided to try the cola (without much expectations as a former Coke lover).<br /><br />Well, I like it a lot. It's VERY fizzy and totally the sort of cola flavor I love. Without aspartame or weird stuff. Without caffeine...I prefer my caffeine in my morning fresh gourmet java, not my casual summer beverages.<br /><br />If you're a cola lover and want a nice--though granted, really expensive--alternative, here it is. Even if you're normally a stevia hater like me, you might just like this.<br /><br />Enjoy...
