We own the Nostalgia hard candy cotton candy machine. We tried using the hard candy and it worked great, but it wasn't giving us the true cotton candy flavor we love. My machine states I can use both cotton candy floss or hard candy, so I thought we'd give this floss a try. We purchased both the pink vanilla and blue raspberry flavors. They arrived today and I couldn't wait to try it. This stuff worked so much better than the hard candy.  We used the scoop that came with the machine, and I was surprised how big and fluffy it turned out. One scoop made a regular sized cotton candy just like at the carnival or fair. With the hard candies I was getting just a small amount at a time. The flavor is the flavor I remember from my youth. Absolutely YUMMY!!! Will definitely buy this again when needed. But the 4lb container is so big, it should last us a very long time.
