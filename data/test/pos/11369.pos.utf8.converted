My Morkie puppy loves these, she will dance for them when I pull them out.. Way better received than other alternatives to rawhide chews we've tried. I give her one of these when I need to keep her busy and quiet, like while I'm working or when company comes over. I have also bribed my clients Chihuahua mix with half of one of these as she is a barker and wouldn't stop barking at people.. It worked like a charm, she took off under the couch and chewed away, ignoring everyone and making our meeting peaceful! Love these!!
