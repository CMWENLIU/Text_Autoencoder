When the sweeteners were changed back in the early 1980's,  I thought something was different.  This 'not-so-new' Pepsi Throwback brings back memories of what a 'real Pepsi' tastes like - and it's GREAT!!  I would recommend this to anyone and to definitely give it a chance.<br /><br />Also, the Mountain Dew Throwback is extra good.  The only drawback is it's not quite as fizzy as I remember it being years ago before the change of sweeteners.  But it's far and away better than the crap they've been putting out for the past 25 years or so.  I tried a regular Mountain Dew recently and thought it tasted like a flat bottle of club soda.<br /><br />Message to the Pepsi Company -  KEEP THE THROWBACKS and drop the other stuff.
