I ordered these chocolate coins for a treasure hunt for my son and daughter. Chocolate coins are available everywhere, so I only really ordered them for the treasure chest. My kids were thrilled, and offered one to me. Wow! These are the best chocolate coins I've ever had! They are smooth and creamy, with a subtle honey undertone. If you want chocolate coins made with quality ingredients instead of the usual second rate chocolate coins, order these!
