This honey is great tasting, which is not too unusual; what sets it apart is the consistency. It's thicker and not as runny as most honeys, so it's easier to serve without making a big mess. With most honeys you leave a trail between the jar and the destination, but the White Gold honey comes out clean, without dripping everywhere.
