These are the best dried figs I have ever tasted. I also bought the black mission figs for comparison. These figs are larger and tastier than the black variety, yet have a chewier exterior. I personally find these to be worth the extra expense over the other variety, yet find both to be excellent organic dried fruits. Perfect, as nature intended.
