Pronounced "Stoke," these shots each pack 40mg of caffeine (the equivalent of an espresso shot). I keep a box in my office. I pour a shot into my cup and top it with French press coffee. What is great is that Stok adds a kick without altering my coffee's natural flavor.<br /><br />The box recommends children under 18 avoid use and that no one drinks more than two shots per day. The leading energy drinks are selling for $2-$4 at convenience stores, so purchasing just one a day sets you back $60 per month or $720 per year.<br /><br />Stok can save you a lot of money. How much? Well, the company recommends that you use no more than two containers (80mg of total caffeine) each day. Two containers cost about $0.15 total, which means you can drink Stok for 3-4 weeks for the same price as a single can of an energy drink.<br /><br />My recommendation is that you pour the shot into your cup first and follow it up with the coffee, either hot or iced. I don't recommend drinking Stok by itself but some of my co-workers tried it, but never twice.<br /><br />I notice the biggest difference in the afternoon. I'm more alert during the last three hours of work and all the way home. Rating: five stars.
