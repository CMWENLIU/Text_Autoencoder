When my cat was diagnosed with diabetes, the food the vet recommended was dry Rx food and ALL WRONG - full of corn. At a diabetic cat forum I learned that the Kitten Fancy Feast canned turkey has zero carbohydrates so I switched to that. Amazon's subscription plan was the cheapest I could find it, with no tax and free shipping. Well, I have 8 cats and the cost got out of hand with all of my cats on this so I got a meat grinder and started making my own food. If I only had a couple of cats, I would have continued with the Fancy Feast kitten turkey. I highly recommend it for preventing your cat from getting diabetes and for general health. My cats all loved it and it agreed with their digestive systems. After less than two months of TR (the diabetes protocol), my diabetic cat went into remission and has remained so for over four months.
