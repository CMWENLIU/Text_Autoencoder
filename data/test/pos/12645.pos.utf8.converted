This is great stuff!  I did research on the benefits of flaxseed and with some reservations, decided to give flaxseed a try.  I am beyond thrilled I gave it a try.  I have been grinding it and mixing it in my protein shakes.  Not only is it filling (very high in fiber and protein), but it tastes great!  In addition to thickening my shakes, it gives them a nutty flavor.  And the best part is I am no longer constipated!  I am looking forward to broadening my use of flaxseed.  Those looking to improve their health and diet must give flaxseed a try.  Remember to keep it refrigerated for its nature is sensitive to rancidity.
