We often order our holiday meats from New Braunfel's Smokehouse and have NEVER been disappointed.  It's foolproof and makes it so easy and they are always OUTSTANDING!!!  We had this ham last Christmas and it was delicious and is being requested again by our family : )  All of the meats and gift packs get raves!
