Bob's Red Mill Soy Protein Powder is a low-cost, versatile source of protein.  It has negligible fat and no cholesterol, has a neutral taste and odor, and mixes well with the foods with which I have tried it.  I have been using it more or less daily for approximately 1 month.<br /><br />At breakfast I mix 2 tablespoons with 1-1/2 cups of milk, 1 tablespoon of nutritional yeast and 1 tablespoon of blackstrap molasses.  The mixture is highly nutritious and tastes surprisingly good.<br /><br />I also add 2-4 tablespoons of it to approximately 2 quarts of mixed fresh and frozen veggies that I steam for lunch most days.  The protein powder takes on the taste of the veggies.<br /><br />Down the road I anticipate that I will add it to beans and vegetarian chili to give additional protein to these foods also.
