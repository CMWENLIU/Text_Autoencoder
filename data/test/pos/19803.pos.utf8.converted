I have 2 Labs and they are eating machines,  this was the only dog food I found that didn't contain chicken meal or anything chicken.  My dogs have a beautiful shiney coat now.  One of the best benifits of this food is what I like to call less mess factor.  The piles I have to scoop from my yard are much smaller.
