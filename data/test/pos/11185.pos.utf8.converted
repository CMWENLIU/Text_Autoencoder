At first I was a little hesitant to buy it because I've heard other dogs won't eat the life source bits, but I was at a local pet store and decided to give it a try. I had looked over the ingredients before so I was familiar with what was in it. I knew that it was a pretty good food and certainly better than most. I decided to give it a try because it wasn't too expensive and it didn't have too much protein. I've tried other really good brands and the ones with too much protein didn't work out. I was surprised the my dog liked it so we stuck with it. To this day he is still eating the same food. He does great on it. No gas. No loose stools. Everything has been great. The size of the kibble works out great for my pug. It's not too big and it's not too small. I also like that it doesn't have corn in it.
