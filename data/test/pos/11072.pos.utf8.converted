I got my first shipment a few weeks back and made two cups that same night.  Big mistake!<br /><br />I am a super picky eater and have no shame about criticizing 'food' that should never be considered food!  If I am putting it in my body, it better be good!  Not to mention the fact that my stomach retaliates every time I feed it something that goes against it's evil plan to control my life and dominate the world.<br /><br />Quinoa is absolutely delicious!  I prefer the taste and texture to rice and no need to mention the fact that quinoa is much more nutritious.  It goes great as a side to any stir fry.  Just by itself it is absolutely delicious.  And my stomach loves it!  It is simple and easy to make.  Just rinse it three times, put it in the rice cooker, add water, olive oil, salt, and a little bit of cumin....and you've got yourself a taste of heaven.<br /><br />Now go out and tell your friends about quinoa.<br /><br />By the way, those two cups I originally made, they were not enough.  I should have made four cups because some people--I won't name names--gobbled it all up.
