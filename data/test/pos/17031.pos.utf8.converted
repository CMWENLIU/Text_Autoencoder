This is a good gluten and soy free mix.  I've found most GFSF mixes that people rave about not to be any good without eggs.  This one holds together OK when made with egg replacer or flax seed meal as suggested on the package, but recently I've found it to be even better when I added 1/4 tsp xanthan gum (to the dry mix) on top of that.  To make thin crust, I put the dough on a greased pan (without holes), brush the top with a little oil and cover with a sheet of parchment paper (or plastic wrap), then roll out with a rolling pin.  Carefully and slowly lift the cover sheet and pre-bake the crust according to the instruction, then you can make a pretty good pizza.  I do make my own mix from time to time, but this is the mix I use when my stash runs out and I am short on time.
