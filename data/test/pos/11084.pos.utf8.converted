If you know how to cook, then it is definitely possible to cook these noodles in a way that tastes absolutely delicious and is quite filling. I imagine most of the negative reviews are from people that expect to top these bad boys with store bought sauce and be done with it... not the case. I like to saute a bunch or red peppers, tomatoes, and onions in spices until they are nice and soft with some moisture left over (I sometimes use curry, or fajita seasoning, definitely fresh garlic every time). Then add the noodles and simmer a bit longer... it's delicious! OR you can go the Asian route by sauteing leeks, onions, garlic, and snap peas (and/or any other veggies you like) in some soy and ponzu sauce, then add the noodles at the end and simmer a bit longer again. All these noodles require is imagination really. No you're NOT going to eat them with just salt and pepper and butter, but if you know how to cook they're great.
