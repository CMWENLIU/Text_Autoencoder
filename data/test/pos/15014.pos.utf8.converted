We all know no packaged soup--canned or cuppa--is gonna be as delicious as the fresh, home-made stuff. Still, convenience is worth a bit of sacrifice, for those rushed or lazy days. I ordered this because 1. I like split pea, it's like a filling, comfort soup and 2 I wanted to try a vegan soup (no ham or the other stuff that they usually put in pea soup).<br /><br />I didn't expect much. I expected ADEQUATE, no more.<br /><br />Well, surprise me. This was TASTY. I am very pleased with this dried/cup soup. If you follow instructions precisely, it should come out with a terrific texture (not too runny, not too thick) and a nice pea flavor. My only quibble is that it's on the salty side (though not eye-crossingly so).<br /><br />I would definitely get more of this. I'm gonna go through this case pretty fast, I can tell you.<br /><br />I'm ready to try more of McDougall's vegan soups. If others are as good or better than the Vegan Split Pea with Barley, then I'm in for some nice convenience lunches.<br /><br />Each container has 240 calories (that's considered two servings, but please, who eats just half?), 10 grams of fiber, 16 grams of protein, 1 gram of fat (no trans fats), and 42 carbs. The sodium count is 600mg. 24% of Vitamin A requirement.<br /><br />Yum.<br /><br />Mir
