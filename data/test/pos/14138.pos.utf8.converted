The farro  arrived promptly and was much less expensive than my local specialty foods store.  I first tried farro in a little restaurant in Newport Beach and fell in love. It is a lot heavier than pasta, so it keeps you full for hours. Most recipes that I found use it in salads and soups; however, you can use it in place of pasta. Goes well with tomato sauces. Has a texture similar to that of cracked wheat.
