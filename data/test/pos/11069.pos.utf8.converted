I have tried all sorts of different miso varieties.  That, by no means, makes me an expert - I'm only an authority on what I personally like but when it comes to miso, I feel that it should have a hearty, almost beef stock taste and that is what the Mugi miso produces.  It is wonderful served up simple with some broccoli and sprouts in a soup with just a teaspoon of miso, couple of cups of hot water and a dash of toasted sesame oil.  Delicious.  And I can't help but say this; whenever I have felt poorly, miso is my medicine of choice.  It is easy on the stomach, good for your digestion, and very filling.  Edensoy makes a variety of miso flavors, from Shiro, or white miso to Hacho which is almost black and has a bold and unusual flavor, a bit too bold for me.  Mugi is the happy medium of flavor and consistency in an easy to use resealable pouch.  I'm really happy that Amazon is carrying this (Prime shipping and all!) Miso lovers dream of this kind of good deal :)
