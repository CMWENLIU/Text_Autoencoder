When I went to Cancun for vacation the flavor of the meats and poultry had this distinct flavor that I truly enjoyed. When I came home I researched to find the flavor so I could make it at home. This is it and it gives great flavor to Steak and chicken. You don't need the entire package to marinade your food. I add lemon juice, salt and olive oil - Mix and maybe half or a quarter of the spice...and your food will have an authentic Yucatan flavor. Mild and not overbearing !!
