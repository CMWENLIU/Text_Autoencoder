S&B curry and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ATZQ68">House Curry</a> are two of the major brands of roux, and if you want to experience the Japanese twist on curry, this product is the perfect way to do it. This is the same product you'll find in Japanese homes and supermarkets.<br /><br />Many people are unaware of just how popular curry is in Japan. Frequently served in homes, restaurants, and schools, curry rice is so commonly-eaten and loved that it can be considered a third national dish, right after sushi and ramen. Introduced to Japan during the Meiji Era (1860's) by the British, curry was at first only affordable to the wealthy, appearing in gourmet restaurants in Ginza and other fine dining establishments, but now it's very ubiquitous and eaten frequently by young and old. Curry is filling, easy to make, nutritious, versatile, and can feed many people for very little money, not to mention delicious.<br /><br />Inside the box are solid, dry cubes of roux, arranged sort of like an ice cube tray. Preparation is so easy that kids often make this on camping trips. You simply break off as many pieces as you need, brown some meat (usually pork when I was living in Tokyo), add the roux and water, then simmer it with your choice of vegetables until tender. Usually, this is carrots, potatoes, onions. Sometimes apples are added.<br /><br />Japanese curry is more liquidy than curries served in typical Indian restaurants in the US, sort of like a rich brown gravy. It goes over rice, or sometimes udon. When served on rice, it is accompanied by a heaping spoonful of chopped pickles like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019LDFRE">Daikon Takuan Pickle -7oz</a>. Japanese levels of spiciness are typically much lower than American tolerances, so "Hot" is not really that hot.<br /><br />The Amazon price is reasonable, especially if you live outside of large East Asian urban centers, where Japanese foodstuffs can be hard to find.
