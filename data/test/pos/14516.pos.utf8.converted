Sumatra roasts have typically been some of my favorite coffees. This Camano Island Sumatra is among the best. It's got exactly what I'm looking for: a nice, bold flavor without too much acidity. There are some hints of chocolate in there that made me compare it to Trader Joe's MochaJava. It's a great afternoon or evening coffee, especially with a rich desert since it has the character to contend with the sweetness of a rich cake.<br /><br />The price is remarkable for the quality of the coffee. You could pay $15 a pound for some 'premier' coffee from the likes of Intelligentsia, but I don't feel the price difference is at all warranted when you can get a coffee this good for half as much. Are there better coffees out there? Sure, but they're not that much better at 2-3x the price.<br /><br />This is well worth getting if you like Sumatra style roasts.<br /><br />Very tasty.
