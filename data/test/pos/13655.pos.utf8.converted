This is my first time using tvp. Tvp is really easy to prepare and inexpensive when compared to ground meat. To me, it doesn't taste like meat, but it has the same texture in my mouth, just not that greasy flavor. It works well in recipes too. A much healthier alternative to ground beef. We love this stuff. Each bag has about 2 cups dried tvp, which will make a couple of meals.
