I am a huge fan of French green lentils, and this is by far my favorite recipe:<br /><br />Cook up dried lentils til dente.  Toss with crumbled gorgonzola (or other favorite cheese) and sauteed onion and chard stems.  Roll the filling up inside of wilted chard leaves and place in any old baking dish.  Top with a simple bechamel sauce and bake til warm through.  It's a great vegetarian dish to share with company but it's soo good you shouldn't wait until you're hosting.  Just cook it up for yourself!
