This product is great. Has no taste or smell by itself. But add it to a dish with sauce and it's wonderful for dieting. I used it with a frozen low calorie Chinese beef and broccoli. Very, very good.<br />Microwave your main dish, rinse the rice and add to hot entree.<br />Also tried it with baked greek chicken. A little homemade gravy. Or package if you can't cook. It was excellent.<br />Let your dish sit for a few minutes before eating. This gives time for the rice or noodles to blend with the sauce.<br />I had a little mixup with the shipping and this company couldn't have been more helpful.<br />I would highly recommend this product.
