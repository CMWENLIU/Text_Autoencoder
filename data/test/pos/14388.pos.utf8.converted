Just got a coffee drawer for my new kitchen -- what a pleasant surprise ... It looks good and functions as expected. Great design! It is just the right size -- fits right under my keurig machine, no extra space taken from my limited counter space. Fill the drawer with an assortment of coffees and teas and your choice is at your finger tip.
