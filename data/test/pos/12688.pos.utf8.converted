Outstanding melt in your mouth chocolate.  The dark chocolate is not bitter like many chocolatiers - it has the perfect blend of taste for any chocoholic.  I've had many different types of chocolate from Belgium and can guarantee - Leonidas is the "Mercedes-Benz" of chocolatiers.  The general assortment is an outstanding sampling of ivory, milk and dark chocolate.  If you love dark chocolate then go for the dark chocolate assortment.  You will not regret it.  Also forget Godiva - it's medium grade quality.
