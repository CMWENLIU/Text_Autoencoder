I tried this tea after sampling one from one of my co-workers, it is great! I ordered a few boxes off of amazon since I am an avid coffee drinker and wanted to try a different alternative. Well, I haven't drank or felt the desire to drink any coffee since my first cup of yerba mate this morning.  It also suppressed my appetite; I was not running to the vending machines for my usual 3 PM pick me up.  Definitely give it a try, it is very good, and not bitter at all, some teas if I steep them too long, they become bitter, making me gag, not this tea, the bag sits in the cup all till the last drop.<br />I love it!
