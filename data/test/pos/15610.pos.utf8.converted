As others have stated, this isn't a good price, but the sauce itself is amazing!  Best way I can describe it is simply a sweet version of soy sauce.<br /><br />My mom always bought this at Sam's when we were growing up, then for a while we couldn't find it available anywhere.  I bought every type of sauce I saw that looked like it could possibly be similar, but I never found any other sauce of this type...<br /><br />I especially love the sauce with rice.  Just a plain bowl of white rice tastes wonderful with some Yohida's Sauce on it :)
