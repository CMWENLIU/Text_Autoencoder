I visited Sicily about a decade ago. I ate many almond desserts on the island, and encountered the delicious Sicilian marzipan the first time. Unfortunately, I haven't found the same flavor since... until now. The Stramondo marzipan has a superb intense almond flavor, despite that it does not contain any flavorings, only organic raw sugar and almonds. The texture is very fine,smooth. I cook quite a lot, and like almonds, so I fell in love with the product. The company sends it with UPS as default, i. e. the postage is rather expensive... therefore now I will order three packs of it in one shipment...
