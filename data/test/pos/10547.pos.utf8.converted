When my son reached the age of having pets, we thought long and hard about what to get him. sure, we had taught him that pets meant cleaning, feeding, looking after...but since his goldfish died 2 weeks after we got it for him, we had to go back to the drawing board. Then I came across the Fresh Whole Rabbit. The fact that it was fresh drew me in. And the WHOLE part, even better! Now we don't have to worry about our son forgetting to feed and clean after his pet! And whats more, when he is finally tired of it, we can have it for dinner. Talk of killing one whole rabbit with one stone!
