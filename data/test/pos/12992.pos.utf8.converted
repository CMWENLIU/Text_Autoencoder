If you haven't had it before, Elderflower tastes similar to the more common, saint germain liqueur.  It also tastest similar to the lychee fruit.  It's hard to find in the US, so I find this bulk order of 6 bottles of concentrate to be great.  The suggested mixing ratio on the bottle is 1:13.  It took longer than expected to arrive, that was my only complaint.
