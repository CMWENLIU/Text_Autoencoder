I've been a fan of airheads since the candy first came out, so when I came on here and saw a box of 90 I went insane! I had to have it! I have to say, it was fabulous. Being able to eat an airhead any time I wanted was pure magic. The box lasted a long time and the candy was fresh and delicious. Airheads are chewy, gooey, fruity and refreshing! I could go for one right now! If I hadn't just gotten two crowns put in at the dentist, I would order another box! Highly recommended!
