I purchased this product after reading many of the positive customer reviews.  One review said that this product cleared up their allergies and they threw all of their prescription drugs away.  I bought it for that reason and I was happy to say that it cleared up mine as well.  I usually take year round allergy meds.  The Manuka honey gave me the freedom of not having to put prescription drugs in my body.  I am particularly allergic to juniper so I'll have to see if it helps during our juniper season. I might have to take supplements at that time, which I normally have to do anyhow, but for now I'm free and clear of any other seasonal allergies!  I am so grateful for this product and it's delicious too.  I am now on a monthly plan and have been saving money on every jar.  I'm taking roughly 1 teaspoon per day to rid myself of seasonal allergies.  At this rate, a single jar will last about one month.
