I have been searching for a TVP product for a while now and when I saw Bob's Red Mill TVP on the net I looked for it at Amazon and there it was.  I hadn't used it in years, so it was a new learning experience and I got an acceptable burger on my first try, but not quite what I was looking for.  With a lot more research on the net I discovered that a mixture of TVP and Vital Wheat  Gluten, also from Bob's Red Mill and available at Amazon,  will give you a much meatier burger. There are several websites that can help you, one is Vegan Dad, which can give you a recipe that will help you find a better burger that isn't so mushy as TVP can be, also check out Thrifty Living. If you are trying TVP for the first time, don't give up on it. Go out to You Tube and type in TVP burger recipes and see what you can find. Also check out Everyday Dish on You Tube. It is a learning experience for sure.
