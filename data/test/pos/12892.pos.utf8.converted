Until now I have always considered salt something that came in a shaker and was used as needed. Now I know better! First off, this salt is saltier than what you buy in a box at the grocery store. Just a pinch is enough to flavor almost anything. The taste is fantastic and it is great to know that it has many minerals in it. The price is a plus too. If you have not tried this salt for yourself yet, try it - you will thank yourself.
