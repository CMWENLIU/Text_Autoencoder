I was a little concerned about the shipping and packing after reading the reviews.<br />They evidently listened to you and took your suggestions, because my items were very well packed, each individually wrapped with bubble wrap, and bubble wrap around the six of them inside the box.  I enjoy this Manuka Honey every day on a slice of whole grain/whole wheat toast.  This brand is my favorite.
