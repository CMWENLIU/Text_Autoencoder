How in the world do you review a gummy worm?  Well, I think it's all about expectations.<br /><br />Was it huge?  Yes.  About 3 feet.<br />Was it bigger than I thought it would be?  Without a doubt.<br />Was it big and heavy enough that it was slightly comical?  Absolutely.<br /><br />Consistency: Consistency is on par with other gummy candy.  In fact, I the texture is slightly tougher than the average American gummy.  It reminded me of gummy candy that I got in Germany.<br /><br />Taste: While not as concentratedly sour as candy much smaller, the sour green flavor is definitely detectable.  And pleasant as well!<br /><br />This product is exactly what you'd expect.  It is an eye-opening jaw-dropper that looks cool, weighs more than you'd think (4 lbs), tastes good, and will probably last a month of consistent eating.
