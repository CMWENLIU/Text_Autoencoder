I love these noodles as an alternative to higher-calorie noodles.  Are they as good as big plate of spaghetti? No, but they have only 20 calories compared to 185 calories in your average serving of pasta.  They do smell pretty terrible when you open them, but I have found that if I follow the instructions and rinse them well, there is no smell/bad taste while eating. I was surprised to see the mixed reviews since I think shirataki noodles are wonderful, but it looks like you will either LOVE these or HATE them.  So my advice would be to ignore the reviews (good and bad) and try them out for yourself; looks like it's a toss up as to whether you will like them or not. :)
