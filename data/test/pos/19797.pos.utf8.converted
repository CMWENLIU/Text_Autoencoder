We have two dogs.  And they both LOVE this stuff.  (But one doesn't count because she'll eat anything.)  Our vet said that the other dog needed a special diet due to a severe wheat/corn/soy allergy--she was constantly itching, biting and digging at her skin.  As a vegan myself, the thought of feeding her sweet potato/duck/salmon food was SO wrong, but of course, I conceded because I wanted my doggie to be happy and comfortable.<br /><br />Long story short, I went out of town and the dog sitter accidentally mixed up the foods and gave v-dog to my allergy-ridden pup.  When I returned from my trip and discovered the error, I expected a big itchy mess, but she was completely fine!  No more itching, no pink irritated skin, nothing.  Even our vet agrees she's not special needs anymore-- apparently, v-dog helped her build up an immunity to all that ailed her.<br /><br />And all of us have been vegan ever after.  :)
