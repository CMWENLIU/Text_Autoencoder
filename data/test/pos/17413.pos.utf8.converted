My daughter is allergic to milk, eggs, and nuts, so finding good snack food that all my kiddies can eat is problematic. They simply LOVE veggie booty! I open a bag, throw it on the table, and get out of the way fast so I don't lose a hand. My three kids ages 18 months to 8 years can demolish a bag quite easily in one sitting, so obviously I don't have to worry about it going stale.
