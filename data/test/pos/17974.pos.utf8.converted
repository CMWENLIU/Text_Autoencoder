I first bought Redmond Clay when my daughter had Pityriasis Rosea. It was a viral induced skin condition that there was no real treatment for and it could have lasted for months. I put the clay/water mixture all over her rash and set her in the sun for a bit.After washing her off I put a good moisturizer on her. She healed up in just over two weeks. I know use it on fire ant bites, mosquito bites, scrapes etc. I keep it with me always!
