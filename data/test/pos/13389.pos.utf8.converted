These are about the size of a snack candy bar, and they are great to eat just like that, straight out of the package. There is no chocolate or any other covering so you get the pure marzipan taste. There are only 3 ingredients: almonds, sugar, and invert sugar syrup. No nasty artificial ingredients. The main ingredient is almonds so the product is not too sweet, unlike other brands where the main ingredient is sugar. Product arrived fresh, soft, and moist, sealed in a plastic pack. It is eligible for free shipping, and it was shipped next day express. It is more expensive than other marzipan products because other products are mostly sugar or contain artificial ingredients. If you want to make marzipan fruits (especially for kids), consider purchasing love 'n bake marzipan in a can instead, which contains more sugar, which makes it more ideal for that purpose.
