Everything started when my favorite supermarket stopped carrying my Taramosalata...What a shame!<br />To make my order worthwhile, I ordered 2 jars, because just for one, the shipping is more expensive than then content! But that's fine (to get 2 jars)because the expiration date was in about 1 year, so obviously I have plenty of time to eat both of them.<br />The taramosalata was as tasty as usual- no disappointments there. The shipping was fast. Would order again.
