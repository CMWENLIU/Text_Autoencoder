I never expect a lot from microwavable soup cups or bowls. I'm happy if their reasonably edible and are not gunky or too thin. It's a nice surprise when a soup tastes not just edible but very tasty! This creamy tomato parmesan from Campbells is nice ans smooth with just the right hint of cheese and cream. It's a perfect combo for a grilled cheese sandwich or a piece of crusty bread. I've also mixed in some crushed red pepper flakes to spice it up and that works well.<br /><br />Texture: 5/5<br />Taste: 4/5<br />Consistency: 5/5<br />Repeatability: 5/5<br /><br />Total quick lunch score: an excellent 5/5!
