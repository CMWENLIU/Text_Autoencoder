I have been a big flavored coffee fan ever since I first tasted hazelnut coffee about 20 years ago. My wife orders the K-cups for our Breville coffee maker and likes to rotate the flavors so that we don't get bored. Green Mountain certainly makes a wide variety of flavors- Perfect Peach, Wild Mountain Blueberry, Golden French Toast, etc. and I like them all, but when I tasted the Island Coconut for the first time I was blown away by how coconutty it tasted. This is not a strong coffee, it is more like a medium strength (probably on the weaker side of medium) but anyone who enjoys coconut should try this flavor. This is definitely one that I will be asking my wife not to rotate out in the near future. (My second favorite flavor right now is the Van Houtte Candy Cane which is peppermint flavored, but only available over Christmas, so we will be running out soon).
