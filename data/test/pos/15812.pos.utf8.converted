My 5-month-old puppy had lost interest in his Iams Puppy food, so I was on the lookout for a tastier brand of dry puppy food.  I read the reviews of Wellness on Amazon and said, why not, let's try it.  Now we are hooked--Dexter LOVES his Wellness!  He gobbles it all up in one sitting (he used to eat a kibble here and a kibble there with the Iams).  He seems happy and healthy and looks great too (shiny coat!).  He doesn't have any specific health problems (I saw in the reviews that some dog owners tried Wellness to treat allergies and such) but I am hoping Wellness will keep him on the up-and-up.
