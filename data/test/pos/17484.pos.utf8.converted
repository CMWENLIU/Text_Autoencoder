I wanted to try Turmeric to see if it helps with inflammation for arthritis. I could not find organic Turmeric in stores where I live, so I ordered this product from Amazon. I am very happy with the taste and quality. I put a teaspoon of Turmeric in some decaf green tea, with some black strap molasses and coconut oil and drink this daily. Weird concoction I know, but all of these ingredients have anti-inflammatory properties and I am into natural remedies.<br /><br />Overall, these product has a great taste and quality.
