So I got this because a friend of mine mentioned it and I was all like, let's do this.  Well, the TVP Black Bean Enchiladas were the bomb!  If we hadn't told our other friend, I'm pretty sure he would have never known it wasn't beef or turkey.<br /><br />You have to use a recipe with some flavor in it.  We made ours with vegetable stock, but beef stock would help, if you are a meat eater just supplemented or reducing.  It makes a lot though.  One bag was half a bag too much for us, so watch your measurements, you might try a little less than it calls for.<br /><br />This is a great substitute for meat in things like enchiladas and spaghettis sauces and stuff.  Haven't tried combining it with real meat in a meatloaf or something to cut down on meat in stuff.  Maybe that's the next experiment...
