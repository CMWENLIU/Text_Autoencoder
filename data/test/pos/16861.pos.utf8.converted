I've been working out 5 days a week for the past 2+ years. By now working out has just become routine. I've never tried a pre-workout before because I work at starbucks and my routine has always been black coffee before a workout. I picked the blue raz up from GNC where my boyfriend works and I felt the difference instantly. I didn't get the crazy tingling sensation from it which I expected but the pump it gives me is intense. I went from running two miles a day with fatigue to being able to run 4 miles with the help of hyper FX without the fatigue that I naturally feel. I feel with the help and the push of this product, I can once again lose the last 15 pounds that I've been struggling to lose for about 6 months now. I'm afraid to taste the fruit punch one because it's not my favorite flavor, but I'll probably try it next. The blue raspberry flavor is incredibly delicious. 2 thumbs way, way up for this product!
