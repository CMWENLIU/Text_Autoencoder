I read the longest review on this page, and it is right in every respect. One area I can add on, however, is that I have used black peppercorn grinders for a while now. I refuse to use black pepper any other way. Previous to me getting this stuff, I had used McCormick's from the grocery store. McCormick's was around $4 for a 1.5 oz jar! This pepper is far and away superior to their pepper, and much cheaper for the size of the bag. Even though it was "fresh" ground, the pepper doesn't taste anywhere near as complex and flavorful as the Tellicherry. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys black pepper, and especially if you cook a lot. The only drawback for some may be that you also have to purchase a grinder of your own, but once you take that step, you'll never use pre-ground pepper again.
