I discovered this India Tree dark Muscovado sugar on a trip to D.C. a couple of years ago and became hooked.  Unfortunately, the few pounds that I bought soon disappeared and I searched everywhere for more Muscovado.  Nothing I tried compared to the India Tree sugar.  We live in rural Wyoming, where gourmet food stores are fairly non-existant.  Finally, I did a Google search, found India Tree Dark on Amazon and now I get my fix 5.5 lbs. at a time.  This is the best sugar you will ever taste - hints of caramel and spices, slightly salty undertones, uneven and lumpy texture with delicious dark chunks heavy with molasses.  Excellent with gourmet coffee, over fruit, etc.  I brew beer as well, and this sugar is my "secret ingredient".
