I love this stuff!!! It is so much better than any other brand we have tried. Probably because it is roasted and has sugar in it, while the other brands are mostly raw. I'm sure the raw versions are healthier, but in this case, I consider it an indulgence! Another reason that we prefer this over any other "sun-butter" is that it comes in a glass jar, while all the other sun-butters seem to come in plastic jars. I like the flavor of this even better than almond or cashew butter. When I could find the Once Again Sunflower Seed butter locally, I would stir in coconut oil and that made it even yummier!<br /><br />Unfortunately my local grocery store stopped carrying it a while ago, and the shipping is rather expensive to order it direct from Once Again. I wish Amazon would start carrying it (not just through a sub-seller).<br /><br />Update: I originally wrote this Feb 2011, and now Once Again is labeling their sunbutter as Gluten Free!  I knew that it was GF, but I'm glad to see it on the label too!  Still hoping Amazon will offer it with a Subscribe and Save option however, and bring the price down!
