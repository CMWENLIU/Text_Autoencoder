I got my Aerogarden back in December, 2006. I have been seeing it sprout very well from when I first started using it December 18th to be exact. I'm almost to the point of clipping back the branches to let it grow even further. I'm so excited as I got the cherry tomato kit...<br /><br />My only cons are that the light it needs to grow under is extremely bright as another poster mentioned here. I wish they would have perfected it so it wouldn't bother us being so bright. If you have a place where you can keep it out of your sight it will help. If I had a larger place I'd have gotten 2 Aerogardens for sure!<br /><br />IT is a bit expensive I think as well... But on the upside you could order it at Aerogarden's website with 3 installments of $49.99 which I am currently under here. So in that way that helps make it affordable.<br /><br />Also they need to make it even a possibly cuter design... Maybe they are working on this? LOL...<br /><br />Also wondering if they'll make it so we can grow more then one "kit" at a time too? That would be great as well.<br /><br />I hope you'll get this! Like I said if I had a bigger place I'd get 2. You'll love to watch it grow quick!
