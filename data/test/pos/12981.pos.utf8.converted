I've tried several brands of Xylitol and only disliked one ("Ideal") because it contained other ingredients. This brand does not. The granules are sugar sized and it tastes like sugar and can be used like sugar. I even put it in my coffee bean grinder to see if I could turn it into powdered sugar and it worked (very quickly) and was delicious. The down side is that it became very hard a couple days later, but that may happen with regular sugar too...I know that powdered sugar is sugar plus an ingredient to keep it "powdery" so this shouldn't be held against Xylitol.<br /><br />Several things worth knowing about Xylitol:<br /><br />1. It is very hard to tell the difference between Xylitol and sugar, both by the way it looks and the way it tastes. The only real difference is that it has a cooling effect on your tongue, rather like mint. It tastes like sugar on your tongue but I've found when cooking/baking with it, it takes a little bit extra (maybe 10%) to achieve the same sweetness. Also, it doesn't caramelize when heated. Xylitol definitely does not have a chemical taste to it like other sweeteners, which makes sense because it's not a synthesized product like other sweeteners. I far prefer it because I don't expect to hear about discoveries in ten or twenty years from now that it causes cancer or tumors.<br /><br />2. If you want an artificial sweetener for diet purposes and don't care about chemicals, this probably isn't your best bet.  It has fewer calories than sugar by about 40% but the artificial sweeteners have fewer calories. (I personally think chemicals are far more hazardous than calories, but to each his own!)<br /><br />3. It kills harmful bacteria. A great use for this is dental care (you'll find it as an ingredient in many mouthwashes, toothpastes, and gum) and it works very well. I dip my toothpasted toothbrush into Xylitol sometimes when my mouth hasn't been feeling clean and after brushing my teeth, they feel smooth like after a dentist visit. Possibly the slightly abrasive effect of brushing with crystals has something to do with it but my mouth also feels pretty clean after drinking hot cocoa made with Xylitol and that's not the case when I make it with sugar. I use Xylitol because I have Candida and I can use the help killing it!<br /><br />4. It is known to soften the stool and I have personally found this to be true. I told a friend about it and he now eats Xylitol specifically for this purpose, something I hadn't thought of. So one person's downside is another person's upside! I don't know if this is a universal effect but I would recommend keeping your intake small (a tablespoon or less) for a few days to see how it impacts your system. I baked a cake with it and didn't have a problem (and ate probably 1/4 cup of Xylitol that day) but I'm not sure if that was attributable to the baking or some other reason, perhaps the softening effect is achieved with a small amount and larger amounts don't increase it.
