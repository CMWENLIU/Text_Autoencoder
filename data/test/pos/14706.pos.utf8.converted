I bought this for its convenience and "thrift factor" -seldom do I use an entire can of tomato paste and usually end up throwing the remainder out. I was extremely pleased to find that it had a very fresh taste, without the slightly burnt and "tinny" taste of canned tomato paste. I would not pay the  around $4.00 price for a single tube, but it is an extremely good for the price when bought in bulk in Amazon's grocery store. It's great having it shipped to my desk at work, also - saves time that I'd rather spend on cooking and gas because it's not available at local stores.
