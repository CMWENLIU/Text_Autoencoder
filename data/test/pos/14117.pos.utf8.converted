Wow!  I was surprised by the negative reviews because I think Miracle Noodles are great!  Yes, the liquid in the bag they come in has a strange odor.  Yes, the texture may seem a bit off-putting for some.  But for someone like me who can't eat normal pasta, these truly are a miracle noodle.  The garlic flavor in particular gives a nice mild taste to the noodle.  If you put a bit of Earth Balance (or butter, etc) on them, the salt helps to balance the flavor.  The texture is kind of chewy, but I would not compare it to a jellyfish like a previous reviewer!  I have tried seaweed noodles before, and THOSE taste and have texture like jellyfish.  If you are simply trying to low-carb diet, I don't know that I would recommend these.  Or, if you are gluten-free only, I don't know that I would recommend these.  However, I am gluten-intolerant and pre-diabetic, and I have had to stop eating grains entirely, and these are the only "noodle" I can eat.  At 30 calories and 6 grams of carb per bag, my blood sugar doesn't spike, and they keep me quite full!  For anyone with similar medical problems as me, I would definitely recommend trying them.
