I have never purchased  this type of product before but I am glad I started with this one. The smell is savory coconut. I scrapped some into a small glass pot to keep in the bathroom and I take a small amount, melt it in my palm and treat my hair ends at least 3 times a week with it. I also use it for cooking (great to add to shrimp or anything you want to infuse with a little coconut essence'. Would absolutely go with this brand again.
