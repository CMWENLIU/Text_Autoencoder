I have limited counter space, so when I saw this drawer, I thought it would be perfect. It is. We love it. Since my husband and I drink a lot of coffee, the 36-count drawer holds a our coffee machine and (almost) a weeks-worth of K cups. It has a nonskid mat on top, so our Keurig doesn't move. Both fit under our cabinets nicely. I have zero complaints. I love this product!
