I was really hesitant to buy this food because it costs about twice the most expensive premium brand grocery dog food costs at the pet food store, but decided to give it a shot since Amazon offers a deal for subscribing. (I bought the 15 lb bag, which is why I don't have a verified purchase in the 30 lb listing) I honestly wouldn't even know about this product if our new puppy's breeder hadn't recommended it, and was using it on their pups. I'm not one of those people that have to eat organic, or those guys that have to have the word "holistic" on their animals' food. In fact, I usually just buy what's on sale, as long as it meets my personal quality standards. But after trying this, it kind of makes sense why they cost more.<br /><br />When I first opened the bag, I noticed that it did not have that strong dog food scent that most dog foods I've purchased for my dogs have. It actually smells kind of good, to where I would almost be brave enough to taste it. Second, the kibble size is perfect for my golden retriever puppy. Not too big or small, and it perfect for training treats. In the morning before feeding my dogs in their bowl, I usually let them earn their meal through training, and these are perfectly sized and tasty enough to use for that. The outer layer seems almost coated, so you don't get kibble crumbs in your hand and into your fingertips. Third, and most importantly- It's really good for your dog! Prior to buying our new puppy, I did a lot of research (as a good prospective dog owner should) on raising a healthy dog. One of the biggest things that stuck with me was that you WILL pay for your dogs' health- either in the form of good dog food, or in the form of a vet bill. Have a nice day:)
