I first came to sherry vinegar because it is milder than the normal grocery-store plonk; I had in mind using less olive oil and therefore freighting in fewer calories. And it is good for that. But bear in mind that because it is not as acidic you might use more if you're looking for sourness, but the sherry taste is good.<br /><br />But I've found another use for it, a French technique. Finish reduction sauces with a shot of it, and it adds a great depth of flavor. If you want to blow the calories you've saved on the oil, mount the sauce at the end with butter too. Add a shot of this vinegar to stews too; a normal vinegar might be too overpowering but the sherry vinegar merely adds flavor.<br /><br />I buy it by the case.
