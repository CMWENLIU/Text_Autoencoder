It is hard to put into words on how great this product is.  Not only does it come with multiple varieties of Bacon Salt, all excellent by the way, but included is a jar of Baconnaise and Lipbalm.  I am not a huge fan of the Lip Balm, but it is a novelty item and won't kill you.... so far.  The Baconnaise is super-fantastic (in the Arnold voice).  It is the envy of every coworker in the building.  I recommend the Baconnaise on a cracker of your choice and sprinkled with some flavor of Bacon Salt.  Why? Because everything should taste like Bacon.  Bacon is what all meat strives to be.  J&D did right when they made this product.  God Bless them....every one!<br /><br />Don<br /><br />Bacon - It's whats for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!
