I bought these to make bubble tea for a kid's party and had no idea what I was doing.  They arrived within just a few days, in good condition.  You do need to cook them, which took me a few tries to figure out how. What I found best was to first sift any residual powder out so you cook only the bubbles.  Bring a pot of water to a rapid boil and stir while adding the bubbles.  Don't let them settle on the bottom.  Boil and occasionally stir for 25 minutes, cover and let sit for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Don't just dump them in the pot or you'll get a big blob.  This is a large package of bubbles, much more than I needed for a party of 15 kids.  The kids loved them and they even tasted good - a brown sugar taste.  We served them with 7Up.  I've stored the extra uncooked bubbles in a Ziploc bag in the refrigerator and they have kept well.  Overall, this is an excellent product, just like at the bubble tea caf&eacute;.
