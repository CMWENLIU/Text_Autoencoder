What can I say about Oberto BBQ Pork Natural Style Jerky?<br /><br />Simply delicious...<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />(But if you'd like more information....)<br /><br />I am spoiled by my grandmother who made homemade jerkys when I was a kid. She did it the old fashioned way, she seasoned and flavored them and then she used the combination of the sun and slow heat (through her homemade clay oven) to create jerkys that were out of this world.<br /><br />Since her death(many years ago), I have been looking for a jerky that might come close but more often than not, I would be highly disappointed.<br /><br />When I found Oberto's BBQ Pork jerky at a Costco, I was skeptical. But after the first bite, I was hooked. It comes extremely close...<br /><br />TENDERNESS...this jerky is tender. Not slimy or gushy kind of tender, but one that you can sink your teeth into easily yet, have enough of a texture to "sponge" back to make it tasty. It is NOT chewy like you would a regular jerky, but as you chew it, it does "melt" in your mouth.<br />It reminds me of eating "filet-mignon" yet more flavorful.<br /><br />Pork jerkys are more flavorful than beef jerkys and this pork jerky is definitely flavorful.<br /><br />The spices that are used to cure and make this jerky seem to be just right. Hint of smokiness yet not over whelming. The spices blend well in your mouth while the jerky melts.<br /><br />Truly enjoyable jerky...<br /><br />As for nutritional value, it is very very lean meat. So it IS high in protein.<br /><br />But bare in mind that ALL cured meat are going to be considered: Dangerous and NON-healthy<br /><br />but if you just have to eat some cured meat, if you LOVE jerkys, if you just gotta have a jerky sometimes because you are tired of eating "healthy" food all the time.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Oberto BBQ Pork Jerky more than any other jerky that's out there on the market.
