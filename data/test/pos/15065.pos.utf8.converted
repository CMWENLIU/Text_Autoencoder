This stuff is extremely tasty and can sometimes be hard to find in anything larger than a rather-expensive 2oz bottle.  I finally took the plunge and bought myself the gallon.  I can now dispense it liberally on whatever grub I so choose, and the fact that this stuff is now practically "on tap" in my kitchen means that I'm now trying it out in some recipes - I tossed some chicken wings in this, let them soak in it for a while, then stirred in some melted butter, plucked the wings out and put them under the broiler - delicious.<br /><br />One thing - Tabasco - if you're listening - start selling a pump that screws onto the bottle.  We'll use it faster and buy more sauce.
