My mom needs potassium due to her high blood pressure meds and she hates eating bananas. So my sister sent her a case of the Vita Coco brand of coconut water and while it tastes better than the ONE brand, it still has a weird chemical taste to it. In the meantime while waiting on the Naked coconut water shipment, we found out that real coconut water straight out of the coconut actually tastes really good, what you would imagine coconut water ought to taste like rather than the odd sweat taste from the tetra paks. Although the Naked brand coconut water doesn't taste as good as the real thing, it is much better than the Vita Coco and ONE brands.
