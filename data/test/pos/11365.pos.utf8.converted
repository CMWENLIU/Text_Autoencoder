If you try to buy bully sticks at your standard pet store, they aren't cheap!  And if your dog loves them like mine does, that adds up pretty quickly.<br />That being said, these were a fantastic deal.  They are thicker than the ones we were buying at the pet store (we were getting pencil sized thickness bully sticks) - these are more like 2-3 pencil size thickness.  Given that I have a little yorkie puppy, these 12" sticks are humongo.  She enjoys them better when they are smaller and she can hold on to it.  So they are really tough to cut through (I'm weak...other reviewers have an easy time breaking them but I certainly don't!), but it's possible, especially after she's already chewed on it.<br />Plus they last much longer.  The pet store 12" one that we were getting for $8 a stick (but they were nice, they were pretty odorless too) - would last her a couple of hours in one night!  1/3 of one of these will last her a week!<br />And yes, they are almost odorless compared to other brands we have tried.  Granted if you stick your nose right where she is chewing, it's a little bit stinky, but not anywhere close to some of the other stinky brands out there!<br />BTW, we started to get these because Cesar Millan the Dog Whisperer recommended them in his book...he said they are better for your dog's digestive system than regular rawhides.<br />I will definitely continue to buy these, but the nice thing is that I don't have to buy it that often since they are longer lasting!<br /><br />In summary:<br />PROS:<br />-yorkie puppy LOVES them!<br />-great value<br />-most "odorless" we've found yet<br />-much longer lasting than other brands of bully sticks<br />-Dog Whisperer recommended - better for your dog's digestive system<br /><br />CONS:<br />-hard to break into smaller pieces if you're a weak, petite person like myself!
