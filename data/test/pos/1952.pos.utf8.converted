Callard & Bowser, an English confection company, used to make small licorice toffee candies that were just magnificent. They were about an inch in size, and a dark green-black color. Sometimes they'd be loose in a cellophane bag, other times you could find them stacked up, about 12 to a slim box about the size of a large cigarette case, each in a striped silver and black wrapper. I could not get enough of them. Although Callard & Bowser's licorice is long extinct, this is about the closest to the creamy taste of their licorice. Very tasty. I like it a lot. I hope they don't discontinue it. I will be ordering more.
