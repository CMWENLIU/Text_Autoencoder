I try to eat salmon because it's supposed to be healthy when it's wild caught.  I like that this is salt free, so I can add my own sea salt and use less.  I called the company because I was worried about BPA in canned goods, but they said it is free of BPA, so that's good too.  This is so much cheaper than fresh salmon.  Nowhere near as good as fresh, but one of the better canned salmons I've eaten.  I add some olive oil, apple cider vinegar, sea salt, and a few spices and I've really gotten to like it.
