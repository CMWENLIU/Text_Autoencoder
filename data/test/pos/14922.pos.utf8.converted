I have(had!) terrible GERD from years of Fosomax/Boniva (my "pre" education years).  Also contracted horrible yeast infection from way too many antibiotics from narrowly-focused Western medicine doctors.<br /><br />This Wedderspoon honey solved both of these persistent, painful problems.  It cleared up my eczema-like patches (I believe these were from yeast infection) with no scarring.  I tried EVERYthing else, nothing helped and I suffered from terrible itching until I found Manuka Honey. Whenever I eat something that I think may cause a GERD flareup, I take a couple teaspoons of Manuka Honey before bed or after a big meal, and no problems occur.<br /><br />Tastes wonderful.  BTW, I also give my Border Collie a 1/2 tsp. every morning.  He loves it and it seems to have solved his sensitive stomach problem.
