These are delicious olives and a nice mixture of different sizes and types. And a great deal for a pitted olive mix.<br /><br />Another reviewer said they were too salty, but that might be true if you eat them straight out of the tub. They are packed in a salt brine for preservation. That's easy to deal with - before I ordered these, I found several web sites with recommendations to soak brined olives to remove the salty taste, and it worked!<br /><br />I scooped a few cups out of the bucket and rinsed them in cold water and then soaked them in fresh cold water in the fridge overnight in a resealable container. Then I drained them and added a bit of red wine vinegar and some olive oil, gave the container a good shake, and put them back in the fridge. The result - very mild slightly spiced and very delicious olives. (Don't soak the whole tub - the storage life is supposedly reduced when you remove the salt)<br /><br />The green ones are big and nice and crunchy, the smaller kalamata and black olives a bit softer. There are herbs and a few garlic cloves and red pepper rings in the mix but only enough to flavor without overpowering the olive taste - I find some supermarket mixes can be a bit too spicy, these are perfect.<br /><br />If you order these, have them shipped separately, because the container will likely leak and Amazon seems oblivious to that (they do stick the tub in a bag, and mine only leaked a few tablespoons worth of brine which stayed in the bag).
