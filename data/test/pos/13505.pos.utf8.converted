I simply love Bob's Red mill products, and love Amazon for selling them for quite a bit less than Whole Paycheck. I've been enjoying a lot of things from them recently, including Kamut Breakfast Cereal and a really delicious soup mix. Their Buckwheat Pancake mix is another example of a healthy, tasty, and reasonably priced item from Bob's Red Mill. I got a taste for Buckwheat pancakes as a kid (My mom used to make them on cold mornings in January), but stopped eating them as an adult. My wife LOVES pancakes, and while I enjoy them too, I find the regular kind not keep me filled up, nor are they particularly healthy. I remembered that I used to really like buckwheat pancakes, and decided to hunt some up. I found these, and have been enjoying them ever since.<br /><br />The mix is easy to prepare, but this isn't a 'complete' mix and does require an egg and some oil in addition to cold water. As an alternative you can use milk, which gives the pancakes a slightly richer flavor. Milk or water, either way they're tasty! Buckwheat is a wholegrain, meaning these fill you up and keep you filled much longer than traditional pancakes which are full of sugar and cheap carbs. I can eat probably a dozen regular pancakes. I can only manage to put away 5-6 of these guys!<br /><br />A few recommendations on preparation:<br /><br />1) Mix the pancake batter and then let it sit 30 minutes or even an hour in your refrigerator. It makes the pancakes lighter and fluffier.<br /><br />2) Go for thinner batter rather than thick. It makes the pancakes easier to cook, and gives you a tastier pancake as a result.<br /><br />3) Cook on medium heat, not high. Because the batter is dark to begin with, it is harder to tell when your pancakes are done without overcooking them. Use less heat to help you get them cooked perfectly.<br /><br />4) You can easily mix this batter with a regular pancake mix to make 'hybrid' cakes if you find these are a bit too thick for your taste. I've gone that route a few times for my wife since she likes her pancakes less dense than these.<br /><br />5) Get yourself some real maple syrup! Nothing goes as well with Buckwheat pancakes than real maple syrup! That's how the American pioneers ate them, and I love feeling like I'm participating in an American tradition when I make these for my family.<br /><br />6) Eat them for dinner! Pancakes and eggs for dinner is amazing.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with these pancakes. Buy them. Cook them. Eat them. Repeat!
