I needed the bigger tubs as I use Knox Gelatin for my Greek Yogurt... 1 Tablespoon adds 8 grams protein and creates a "cheesecake texture" to my daily non-flavored yogurt ... with a dash of sweetner, I feel like i'm cheating on a diet with the delectable "cake" ... makes my cold cereal THICKER too, when added to the bowl with a quick stir ... Helps me get calcium cause I need to add a tiny bit more milk due to the slight thickening (I use almond milk) ... You can add this Gelatin to any liquid or creamy COLD stuff to add protein ... My skin & fingernails have turned lovely ... DIETERS: when added to several dishes per day, will help you eat less, as it feels "heavy" to tummy, so you eat less, feel-full faster AND stay sated longer! ... I dropped 90 pounds doing this ...I'm no Dr, but I found the secret to permanent weight-loss for us ppl who stuff & stuff their mouths to get that full feeling
