I hold a gumbo cook-off every year and host approximately 1000 people.  I like to have gumbo file powder available on the tables and sure couldn't afford the $11.95 per 1/2 oz. they sell in the grocery and specialty stores.  This product filled the need perfectly....with great taste and a price I could afford.  Thank you Frontier Natural Brands.
