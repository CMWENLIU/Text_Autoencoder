I have been buying and trying different brands of beef jerky for a while now and this is easily one of my favorites!  The taste is delicious -- not too sweet and the spice mix has a kick to it which I love.  The texture of the beef is great and I cannot imagine this bag lasting very long.  Amazon, please get this back in stock!  Also, the price can not be beat -- all of the jerky I had in the past that was comparable in taste to this one has been exceedingly more expensive.  Overall, it's just delicious..plain and simple.
