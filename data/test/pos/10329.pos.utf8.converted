I bought this because I'm slowly getting into doing bentos, and rice onigris seemed like something cute to try to do, but I feared they would be too bland.  I heard about furikake and it seemed like a good idea in order to give rice some taste; then the problem was: which furikake variety to choose?<br /><br />I like nori (the seaweed used to wrap sushi, and the one most furikakes contain if it just says "seaweed"), but I know I would be wrapping my onigris in it to avoid them falling apart.  I was reticent to try one of the more "fishy" ones, as I'd heard that the fish taste could be overwhelming.  So this one -- mixture of bonito and nori -- seemed like a good choice.<br /><br />Just tried it for the first time last night, and it's great!<br /><br />I just wish that either my Asian grocery or Amazon also stocked egg furikake, since I've heard that that one's pretty good too.
