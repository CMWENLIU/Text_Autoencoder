Imagine only paying $13.00 for 24 cans of cat food.  I pay $18.99 plus sales tax at my local Walmart and a bit more at the local grocery store.  I like the fact that I can subscribe and have the food delivered as often as needed straight to my door with no sales tax or shipping and handling.  The only problem I have encountered is a lack of flexibility as to the shipping date.  I only get paid once a month and I have to wait until the money goes into my checking account somewhere between the 5th and 9th of each month.  Amazon.com ships the food on the 4th of each month.  I have sent an email to Amazon requesting a different shipping date.  I know that I will soon receive an answer because Amazon.com customer service is awesome!  My five cats really like the Friskies canned cat food and getting two different variety boxes with 24 cans each lasts for 3-4 months.
