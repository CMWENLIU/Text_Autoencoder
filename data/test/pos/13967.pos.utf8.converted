We make mugs of hot cocoa every morning here, three parts cocoa one part sugar add to heated milk and stir, so we've done a lot of looking for the best. We avoid the alkalized, ie the Dutch-processed cocoas; all the excuses that dark chocolate is good for you vanish with those, and we consider the taste inferior anyway.<br /><br />We ordered some of this and it was an instant win.  The flavor was complex yet not as bitter as some; I found myself using less sugar with it.  Can't wait for the new order of it to arrive!
