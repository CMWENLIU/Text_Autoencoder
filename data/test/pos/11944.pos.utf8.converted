Finding consistently good sardines in the American market is a challenge.  I've tried cheaper, but there is always a nasty can in my purchases.  I have never had a bad can with the olive oil version of King Oscar.  I first had these in the 1960's with the old key wrapping the lid off the top can.  Nothing except the can has changed.  But I will say the packaging from decades ago was more impressive, if that matters at all.  And yes I know there are some southern European brands that are fantastic and probably the height in sardine quality.  BUT, I've found them to be hard to find and even worse, priced too high.  Maybe there are other sources I do not know about, but until that day, I'm buying cases of 12 for delivery.  (there are no consistent local sources for this product locally anymore, sigh...  my guess is, if there is a large Scandinavian population like the Midwest, it might be much easier to pick up on the grocers shelves.)
