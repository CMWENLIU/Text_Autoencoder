I have been using this trap for 30 years and it has always done the job. The trick is to know how to use the trap. You need to have two of them, each one going in the opposite direction in the tunnel. And it makes a big difference if you bait the trap before you place it in the tunnel. You want to attract the gopher to the trap, otherwise you will not be as successful.
