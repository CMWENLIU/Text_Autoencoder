If you are used to the dark brown, coarse ground flaxseed, do yourself a favor and try this golden flax.  Wonderful!!!  I got it a week ago and have already tried it in smoothies, bread, muffins and oatmeal.  It is very finely ground, which makes it all but disappear.  Much better than what I was eating before!  And the value was far greater than the grocery store.  Highly recommend!
