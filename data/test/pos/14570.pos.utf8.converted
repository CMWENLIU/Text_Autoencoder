These are awesome!  I believe another reviewer made a mistake on the nutrition info.  A serving size is 1oz or 28g and measures out to 17 pieces (each piece is a 1 inch diameter disk).  I could barely hold them all in one hand.  There are 3 servings in a bag.  167 calories, 12g fat, 269mg sodium, 8 gram carbs.  21.7% protein, 11.4% omega-3 and 17.1% omega-6.  They are raw so the bag says to check for mold and bugs and maybe keep in fridge, but they guarentee them for ANY reason.  They are raw, vegan and organic, but I don't follow any of those diets and love them.  Flavor is not too much and you won't have orange fingers when you are done.  They contain sprouted seeds (easier to digest) including flax, sunflower, sesame, and tomato.
