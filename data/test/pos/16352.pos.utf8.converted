The first container I purchased was excellent quality so I purchased a second and then a third.  Unlike the first and second the third was shipped by UPS and was mildly dented, but that is not a concern for *this* type of product.  The third canister contained soggy-ish "dried" ginger with a disturbingly high frequency of dark spotting on the ginger slices.  Before discovering the less than awesome quality of the third container I had already purchased two more containers.  I am hoping five and six will be the fame FANTASTIC QUALITY of container one!<br /><br />(will edit when I find the locations of the two respective fulfillment warehouses)<br /><br />Be aware that the canisters reveal their origin: CHINA.  This information was not on the amazon product page at time of purchase :(  I hope my ginger is not seasoned with lead.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Canister five was severely damaged in shipping thanks to change for the worse in amazon shipping policy.  The giner in canister five was exposed to air.  As a food product I insisted on replacement.  Eventually after shaming amazon via [...]they condescended to ship a replacement.  The replacement canister was cosmetically damaged but air tight.  Canister six was similarly dented but air tight.  Canister six ginger had a higher "thread count".<br /><br />_beware_<br /><br />Amazon seems to have a policy of not-bothering to include sufficient padding according to UPS/FedEx guidelines. Their bean counters hope the customer will absorb losses from goods damaged in shipping. I insist my new items arrive in new condition: padding on ALL SIX box surfaces.
