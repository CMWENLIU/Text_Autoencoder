So apparently Australians spread Vegemite on their bread slices. The Germans think it's Nutella before realizing that it is FAR from it. I would never put it on my bread because you have to grow up with it to LOVE it. I have put it on a hard-boilt egg and then it's quite pleasant. I gave it 5 stars because everybody should get a jar and let their friends taste it for the fun of it. It's a yeast spread and it tastes very salty.
