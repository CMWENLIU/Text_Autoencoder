My family began eating quinoa<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO60JQ">Eden Quinoa, Organic Imported, 16-Ounce Pouch (Pack of 6)</a> after seeing it on the Food Network and then looking up all the healthy benefits. It has a good protein profile and is a good tasting alternative to rice. It is my opinion to stay with the Eden brand because it is organic and also because of the proper way it is cleaned. You cook it like rice. It has a similar taste that easily takes on the flavor of whatever other food you pair it with. Look it up on the web and read about it and then plan to add it to your meals. Children (as well as grown-ups) will love it for breakfast with a little milk, sugar or honey, and banana or apple sauce added. Much better way to send them off to school. The white quinoa is best for this. Also, for many dishes (you need to just experiment) you will want to try the red quinoa<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002133Z56">EDEN
