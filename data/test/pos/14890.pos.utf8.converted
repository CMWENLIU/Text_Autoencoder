I discovered GoPicnic when I was diagnosed with gluten intolerance. I am so happy that Amazon has such a large range of these handy meals. Small enough to go in a purse, but filling enough to substitute for a normal meal, they run about 350 calories per pack. I have tried all the gluten free flavors, but the Tuna and Crackers is my favorite. There's a container of tasty tuna spread, a small bag of multigrain crackers to spread it on, a tub of the BEST apple sauce (Sweet Perry Orchards - not too sweet, terrific apple taste), a bag of fruit and nut mix and a small but delicious square of organic dark chocolate. The box also contains a folding plastic spork for dealing with the tuna spread and the apple sauce. I have a stash of these meals at work, and use them frequently when I am at all day meetings where lunch is provided. Since the lunch is usually not gluten free, I need to be self sufficient, and this gives me enough indulgence not to feel deprived when I see others scarfing down their sandwiches and cookies. I bought them on Subscribe & Save, which brought the price per meal to just over $3, which those of you who buy gluten free anything will recognize as a pretty good deal! Unfortunately, they are currently out of stock on Amazon, but I am hoping they get them back in and continue my monthly delivery.
