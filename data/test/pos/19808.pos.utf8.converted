This is an excellent, cost-effective alternative to Red Bull.  The flavor is spot on--even though a purist may be able to notice the difference, I was very pleased with how close this comes to the real deal!<br /><br />For the price, two cans of the real stuff almost pays for 12 liters of this.  Also, with this syrup, you have the option to how strong or weak you'd like to make each serving.  I find that I can add less than the recommended amount and make this mix go even further.<br /><br />I think you would be hard-pressed to find a cheaper alternative that tastes so close to the original.
