I have been eating these noodles for a very long time.  It can be purchased in some Asian markets; however, it depends on the city.  The noodle is hot if one puts all of the spices in the bowl, so the hotness can be controlled depending on how many spices are dropped in.  Some vegetables that are dried moisten when water is added, and this helps add texture in the noodle.  I think there is some dried seafood or something in it as well.
