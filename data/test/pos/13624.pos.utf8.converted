I didn't want to buy these when I noticed that they were manufactured in the US (plus, Annie Chun is Korean so I wondered how authentic her Japanese soba would be). However, the price was good so I decided to try them. They're actually fantastic-- good flavor & just the right amount of chewiness. These work well on their own, for yakisoba or soba soup. I can't tell the difference from noodles I used to eat at stand-up soba places in Koriyama.
