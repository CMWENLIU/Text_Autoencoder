Being half-Cuban, I had heard of Iron Beer before, but I had never actually had a chance to try it. Unlike Materva, which is relatively easy to get (even in South Carolina), I've never so much as seen Iron Beer on a shelf here. I went ahead and took the plunge, ordering it online, and was ever-so-pleasantly surprised. It definitely reminds me of a mix of cream soda and orange soda (another reviewer said it tasted like orange dreamsicle, which is pretty dead-on actually), but somehow it manages to be a lot more than the sum of its parts...maybe it's that "hint of island spices." Highly recommended for those who want something new, or those who simply want a taste of home.
