The Buckwheat pancakes have a hearty, earthy flavor that is appreciated by most, but not all people.  For those who prefer white bread and Bisquick pancakes, these will be a bit heavy and the dark brown color was an objection one friend had.  For me, however, these cannot be beat, especially with real Maple syrup and fresh blueberries.  Bob's Red Mill products are a good deal through Amazon, as compared to grocery stores.  The packs of 4 keep the product fresh until use.
