While there are lots of small coffee roasters whose espressos I enjoy, this is truly a good basic everyday espresso.  Espressos should be dark and full bodied. This one is rich and flavorful.  It makes a nice crema.<br /><br />It is also good for using in a countertop espresso machine. We have a Jura Capressa E8 Super Automatic.  A lot of the flavored coffees and roasts that are too dark gum up the system and make it sluggish.  And while it is not a big deal to change the grinder, it is probably better to use a bean the machine likes.
