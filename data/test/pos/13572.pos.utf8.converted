Finally!!!!! I love eggs, but don't like to carry them backpacking for obvious reasons; weight, breakage and spoilage, but every powered, dehydrated or other egg-like product just tastes awful!!! But these eggs actually taste like eggs!!! I made them as just plain old scrambled eggs, omelet, and I used it in fried rice and soup. The quantity of the bag, 12 eggs was definitely 12 eggs, between 3 of us, we managed two breakfasts and plenty for soup. I can't rave enough about these eggs, if you camp, hike, backpack, even hotel stays where you have a kitchen, this is a great product to take along.
