I purchased these with the idea they would go into Christmas sacks and stockings.<br />Then my husband and I ate them all and it is two weeks BEFORE Christmas.  They should come with a warning from the Surgeon General "Addictive and proven to add inches to your waistline".<br /><br />Walker's shortbread is reknown for its rich buttery taste, add some chocolate chips and what could possibility go wrong?  Nothing that my husband and I could find and believe me we did a thorough examination.<br /><br />We have NEVER had a better "pre-fab" chocolate chip cookie in our lives.  Just check our bathroom scales if you don't believe me!<br /><br />YUMMY!
