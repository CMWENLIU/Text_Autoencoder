I have purchased a variety of DOP tomatoes in the past. Typically I been disappointed. I usually find that California products taste markedly better. The DOP tomatoes I have tried previously turned out to be mealy, and tinny tasting.<br /><br />These tomatoes on the other hand, had a bright taste and a balance of sweetness and acidity that made a very good marinara. I have not used up this shipment so I don't know if every can is as good as this lot, but if so, these Strianese tomatoes, some garlic, a couple table spoons of olive oil, a pinch of crushed red pepper, salt and pepper are all that is necessary for happiness.
