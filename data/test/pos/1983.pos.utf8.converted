A disappointed buyer and reviewer of this tea commented that this tea is not like Twining's Jasmine tea, which has a much stronger jasmine flavor. Nor does this tea contain (many) actual jasmine flower petals, which perhaps led to the other reviewer's statement that this tea is mislabeled. However, it is not mislabeled and it is jasmine tea, and unlike stronger jasmine teas, the flavors of the tea and jasmine in this scented tea are very well balanced.<br /><br />This tea is exactly the same as that served in many Chinese restaurants, so if you like that tea, you will like this. The jasmine flavor is produced by placing a large quantity of green tea in an enclosed hopper, placing jasmine flowers in an adjacent hopper with a mesh or air channels between, then blowing very hot air through the jasmine flowers, which picks up the flowers' fragrant essential oils and distributes them onto the tea leaves in the adjacent hopper. This process produces a gently but wonderfully jasmine-scented green tea with a well balanced flavor. I love it.
