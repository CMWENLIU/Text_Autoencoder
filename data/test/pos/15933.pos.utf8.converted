If you are old enough to remember the aerated "big block" style chocolate bars from the 1970s marketed as Choc O Lite, then if you're like me, you miss them terribly.  Well, the mother country and our neighbours to the North still get those air filled bricks of joy from Nestle called Aero bars and while the shape is more squat, the joy of the bubbles combined with the melting milk chocolate is worth the import price and it beats the heck out of Hershey's, although if you might feel your ethics compromised, if you've been keeping up with Nestle and the controversy surrounding their infant formula sent to developing nations.  If so, I applaud you, but I'll risk the charges of hypocrisy, these are great.<br /><br />Signed,<br />epsteinsmutha
