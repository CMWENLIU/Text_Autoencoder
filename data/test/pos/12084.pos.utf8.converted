I can say that this spice came well packaged and that there wasn't any loose in the box. Pretty impressive in my opinion. It seems strong and has a nice smell once opened. I have to admit though I don't use it for cooking. In my neighborhood there are quite a few inconsiderate pet owners. Cat owners that let their cats loose to pee and poop all over the neighborhood. Dog owners that let their dogs dig and destroy during their daily walk. I got fed up with how rude they were being, so I bought the cayenne pepper. I surround my front yard to my townhouse with it after every rainstorm. It has drastically cut down on the invasive pet species that roam the streets. Even an actual neighbor! Her dog wouldn't get close to my yard and pulled away. She reached down and picked up the pepper and sniffed it! I love this stuff and I will keep buying it as long as it's available!
