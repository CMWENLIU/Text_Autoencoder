This is my first experience buying and eating quinoa.  I bought both red and white types, but decided to eat the red type first because it looked so cool.<br />I read that quinoa had to be washed till it no longer frothed to prevent a bitter taste.  The Eden organic quinoa had instructions on how to rinse and prepare it. It had no dust in it and the first rinse did not froth at all. I rinsed it till I no longer saw any little stems which needed more than the five rinses recommended.<br />I cooked it in my rice cooker and it turned out great.  I like the flavor very much and plan to continue my subscription to receive the Eden Organic Red Quinoa through the year.
