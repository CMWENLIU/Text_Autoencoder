This syrup is great for EVERYTHING: waffles, oatmeal, yogurt, bbq sauce - you name it.  I purchased the "Grade B" syrup for a master cleanse, but decided to try it with food as well.  Now we don't bother with "Grade A" any more.  This is much more flavorful.<br />I chose the Highland Sugarworks product because of the great price, but I keep going back because of the quality.  Highly recommended.
