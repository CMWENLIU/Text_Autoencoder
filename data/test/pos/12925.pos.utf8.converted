I'm a home brewer and make wine, beer, and root beer.  I have tried several different extracts for root beer flavoring and this one is simply the best and very easy to use.  I dump the whole bottle into a fermenting/bottling bucket with water (5 gallon total liquid when done), 5 lb sugar, and about 1/2 teaspoon of yeast nutrient and a packet of champagne yeast.  After everything is mixed well I bottle and cap it (makes around 50 12oz bottles) and let it mature for a few weeks in the basement.  The bottling process only takes about an hour (with sanitizing bottles) and I have several folks that have been wild about the end result.
