This was the first coffee I sampled from my Keurig coffee maker.  The flavor is nutty and mild without the acidity of many drip coffees.  I am not a fan of the bold, strong coffees and prefer the milder blends.  This is a great early morning coffee to enjoy with your breakfast.  While you can order it on Amazon, I've found it for a better price on another website provided I buy 4 boxes of 25 K cups at a time.  However, I can mix and match other flavors and brands to get the 4 boxes.<br /><br />I like flavored coffee as well so in addition to the Nantucket, I also recommend the Southern Pecan and Wild Blueberry.  I like to brew a cup of the blueberry just to make the room smell like blueberry cobbler. Also check out Gloria Jeans K-Cups, French Vanilla, 25-Count Box (Pack of 2) if you like flavored coffee.
