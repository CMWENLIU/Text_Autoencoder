Although the advertising for this product was deceitful - it was advertised at $3.26 for 6 boxes and it turned out that it was $3.26 for only one box (shame on me for thinking I was getting a deal because someone was trying to rid themselves of too much of this tea). I received a refund from Amazon and the seller but there have still been some misrepresentation with the advertising that I have had to remind Amazon about with this. But because I have tried other teas by Triple Leaf (Dieter's Green Tea) that were successful, I thought I would try this one. After just 2 mugs of this tea, my blood pressure was back to normal. It was as high as 164/100 and now it's at 128/80. Although I do not recommend anyone to stop taking any medications without consulting their doctor, I do suggest incorporating this into your diet as an aid to help lower your blood pressure naturally. I have started to blend this tea with my regular sweet tea that I drink with my meals and that makes it easier to get in at least 2 glasses a day. I am now going to start buying it in bulk.
