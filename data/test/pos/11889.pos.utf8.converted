If you're not going to buy this product, which I recommend, then try to avoid fish sauce that contains "hydrolyzed wheat or soybean proteins". Also, many will say "Phu Quoc" on them because that's where the best fish sauce are made but if it's not made in Phu Quoc or Vietname then it's probably a fake.<br /><br />I use this brand for sauces and salads, and I can taste the difference. Also, it's good to know I'm eating something that is made from natural ingredients. I'll pay extra for that.<br /><br />This is the FAQ from redboatfishsauce site:<br /><br />What are the ingredients for each product?<br />The two ingredients in every Red Boat fish sauce are fresh caught wild black anchovies and sea salt.<br /><br />What is the difference between 40N and 50N?<br />Degrees N is an industry standard to measure the number of grams of nitrogen per liter of fish sauce which relates to the protein level. The highest quality fish sauces are greater than 30N with the flavor becoming more rich and complex with larger N designation.<br /><br />Are your products gluten free?<br />Yes. Our sauces do not contain wheat or wheat by-products and are produced in a gluten free facility.<br /><br />Do our products contain MSG?<br />No. Our product also does not contain hydrolyzed wheat or soybean proteins which are hidden sources of free glutamates.<br /><br />Do our products contain any type or form of peanuts or shellfish?<br />No.<br /><br />What are the clear crystals in the bottom of my bottle?<br />Natural sea salt may occasionally crystallize on the bottom of the bottles of Red Boat sauces. This is a natural process and does not affect the product quality in any way.<br /><br />Are other fish sauce brands labeled "Phu Quoc" authentic?<br />Look at the label carefully. If the product does not say "Made in Phu Quoc" or "Product of Vietnam" it is likely not authentic. Many knock-offs are made or processed in Thailand or Hong Kong.
