Our dogs have eaten this since they could eat solid food. Both were adopted from a rescue place and the food was recommended by the owner. My dogs love it. They have had excellent health and we get great reports from the vet. I also love this food because it promotes healthy teeth. I only do organic food for my puppies and this is a great foundation!
