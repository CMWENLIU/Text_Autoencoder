I've used many types of chocolate for baking. From Chuao(southern california chocolaterie made from Venezuelan cocoa beans), El Rey ( also Venezuelan ) to Valhrona(french) which is really expensive. Callebaut has the quality of these other three that I love without it costing quite as much. YOU can never go wrong with going quality in your baking items. Once you taste this you'll never go back to Ghirardelli's or Hershey's ever again. I almost don't even consider those brand's actual chocolate anymore.<br /><br />I've gotten the large blocks, but find that they are hard to store properly. I prefer them in the air tight bags in large dollop morsels. Always store them in a cool/dry place when purchasing in bulk.
