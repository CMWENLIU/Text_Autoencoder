Oh, how I love thee, Cheese Powder! Let me count the ways: macaroni and cheese on the cheap, added to soups or casseroles instead of real cheese, sprinkled on popcorn or homemade corn chips--or just lick a finger and dip into the neon orange powder and lick again--delicious!<br /><br />To make 2 servings of Kraft-like mac and cheese: cook 1 cup pasta (mini ziti is fun), reserving a bit of cooking liquid when you strain it. Then add 3 tablespoons of cheese powder and a pat of butter. Stir until the cheese powder is dissolved (though it's known to clump a little, here and there). Add a bit more water if needed, or if too watery, just turn the heat back on and boil it away. We've always added in cooked meat or flavorings to taste. We love ham bits and fresh ground pepper on ours.<br /><br />Tastes just like the "blue box" Kraft, but is way cheaper and more convenient! Word has it that this actually comes from Kraft itself. They buy it in bulk and repackage it as needed for resale. Nice!<br /><br />Now if you're looking for cheese powder for making the cheese sauce that you'd put over broccoli and the like, that would be this powder here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9ZM7M?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8
