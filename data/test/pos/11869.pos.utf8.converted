Check the picture I've submitted to see the kind of color that just a little of the dye give you. There's a good mix of color choice here, everything from black to light flesh tone to violet. I've only made one cake with it so far but I only needed a little for spectacular results. I'll get a lot of use out of the amount provided, and when I'm done I will be coming back to this brand for more. There is a huge difference between this and normal liquid food dye that most of us grew up with!<br /><br />--Updated April 2011--<br /><br />The same jars have been in use for ages now and still continue to impress me. Just last week I used them to color some home made play dough with fantastic results-- I expected that there would be an issue with the dye coming off on little hands during playtime, but we were careful to mix the dye in with the dough and haven't had any issues. I highly recommend this set whenever someone I know is looking to do something involving food dye.
