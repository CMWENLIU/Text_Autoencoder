I've been a fan of spam since I was a kid and I usually avoid the "diet" or "low fat" variety of most foods.  But, I figure I might as well give Spam Lite a try.  It tastes almost the same to me.  I don't think I'd be able to tell the difference in a blind taste test.  That is why i give it 5 stars.  I will be buying spam lite in the future.<br /><br />I usually just fry it in a pan and eat it with rice and eggs in the morning.  Throw on some hot sauce and thats all you need to get going in the day.
