I grew up on various hot cereal products and frankly, I loved almost all of them. My wife however, didn't like ANY of them. One day as we sat in the restaurant of a nice bay area hotel, she ordered 'steel cut oatmeal' for her breakfast... and I joined her. She loved it.<br /><br />I found Quaker's Steel Cut Oatmeal hard to find...but definitely worth it! Thank goodness for Amazon... the Sears Catalogue of this century!
