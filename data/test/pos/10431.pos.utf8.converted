This wheat gluten flour makes very tasty seitan and is much cheaper than buying the smaller boxes of Arrowhead brand. Amazon sells this at a good price with free shipping. It's much easier to make seitan with this than to have to go through the lengthy process of washing the starch from regular wheat flour and homemade seitan is much tastier and cheaper than pre made store kind.
