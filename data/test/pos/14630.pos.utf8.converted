As an avid baker, I've tried just about every kind, brand and blend of flour out there.  Whole wheat pastry flour tops the list.<br /><br />Even for people who think they won't like "whole wheat" because it sounds too health-food-y, think again.  Every time I use this flour I get superior results and I've used it for everything: piecrust (the best!), muffins, cakes, as a thickener in sauces and soups and any other use for which a cook needs flour.<br /><br />One mixed flour product I've tried is labelled "white/whole wheat flour" and it cannot compare to real whole wheat pastry flour.  True whole wheat pastry flour is more finely milled than traditional whole-wheat flour and has a light texture that always blends perfectly in recipes.<br /><br />Any serious cook needs to try using this flour, if you haven't done so yet.  Prior to finding it on amazon, I had to make trips to specialty health food stores and once bought a 50-pound sack just to avoid running out during our New England winters.  Storage was a challenge, so finding smaller packages online is a wish come true!
