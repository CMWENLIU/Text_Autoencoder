The shipping on these is prohibitive, but I eat these and MIRACLE NOODLES all the time.<br /><br />How to prepare:<br />1. Open bag<br />2. Hold nose<br />3. Rinse well with hot water<br />4. Dry roast in a big pan.<br /><br />I add Laughing Cow cheese, a can of roasted diced tomatoes, fresh basil, sauteed or roasted vegetables for a great big bowl of low calorie pasta.<br /><br />A whole bag of these noodles has only 40 calories.<br /><br />See [...] for lots of recipes.<br /><br />They are, admittedly, an acquired taste.
