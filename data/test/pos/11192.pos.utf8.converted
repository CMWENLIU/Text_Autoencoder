Isn't it odd the weight and power that one bad review can have?<br /><br />I LOVE Thai Iced Tea but the nearest place was a thai restaurant I would have to order a meal from in order to get the tea. Even then, the allure of the tea would draw me to order somewhat mediocre food. Suffice it to say, I was looking for a way to make it on my own.<br /><br />I came across this tea (and various other brands) and it was looking promising except that one bad review relating to Green Tea. I second-guessed a potential purchase so much because of that one review.<br /><br />Finally I took the plunge and I couldn't be happier. It tastes exactly like it does from the various sources i've tried it from. Maybe Thai Iced Tea isn't supposed to have green tea, I'm not sure. I don't position myself on internet forums as an expert in tea. I DO know however that if it looks like thai iced tea, it smells like thai iced tea, and it tastes like thai iced tea, then for all intents and purposes it IS thai iced tea. Besides, green tea leaves are probably better for you anyways.<br /><br />Don't let this one negative review turn you off like it almost did to me.<br /><br />Now on to other matters:<br /><br />The quantity the package calls for is really too much. I make the tea in 64 oz. quantities and it only takes 4 tbsp. or so. I boil the water with the tea inside until it reaches a rolling boil, then I allow it to steep for 4-5 minutes. I was using the stainless steel muslin filter another reviewer mentioned, but unfortunately it was getting really groady looking and it was hard to dry as a college student. I've now invested in T-Sac tea filters, size #3.<br /><br />There is some "dustiness" to the tea. When I first started drinking it, I never noticed it until I got to the last 4-5 oz. or so in the pitcher since the dust sinks to the bottom. Now when i transfer the tea to the pitcher I just dont pour the last few oz. into the pitcher which effectively gets rid of any issues with tea dust.<br /><br />I mix the tea with milk and/or coffee creamer (original non-fat works splendidly) though i always use coffee creamer if I have it on hand.<br /><br />There is ONE problem. If you really liked thai iced tea before, there's a chance you're going to get addicted to it. I have a reusable 24 oz. iced drink tumbler and it's easy to fill that up a couple of times a day or more if drank with meals. with 2.5 of these cups you're looking at 64 oz. of thai iced tea a day if you're not careful. With that being said i'd much rather drink 40-50 oz. of thai iced tea than the 30-60 oz. of iced coffee with (regular i.e. with fat) cream, sugar, and caramel flavoring.<br /><br />It's a great alternative to coffee and I couldn't be happier.
