I find that the flavor of coffee is improved by using Coffeemate.  Buying it in large containers is fine for around the house, but buying the small envelopes of the stuff is more convenient to carry.  Liquid packets don't taste the same and can be crushed, leading to an unholy mess.  The envelopes or packets are great to carry in a pocket or computer bag (my wife carries them in her purse) for when you go out, and for travel they can't be beaten.  The only bad thing is to find someone who sells them.  The creamer comes in Original, French Vanilla, and Hazelnut, but try to find ONE distributor who carries all three, and good luck!!!<br /><br />Bob Morton
