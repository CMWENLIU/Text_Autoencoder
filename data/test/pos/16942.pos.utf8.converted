Now sure what the previous reviewer talking about.  There is no "whey" in this Brown Rice protein.<br /><br /> Reasons why I love Growing Naturals Protein:<br /><br />1.  Its Organic !!<br />2.  Its  NON-GMO  even [...] verified<br />3.  It's Vegan and gluten free.<br />4.  It the smoothest protein powder ever, I can't stand the grit in other brands.<br />5.  It taste sweet with natural organic stevia. I've only tried the Vanilla, wonder if the original is as SWEET.<br />6.  Can i say it's super smooth again, the powder is so fine you don't even need a blender.<br />7  The brown rice is sprouted, so it's the only rice protein isolate 90%<br />8.  Sprouted Brown riceis easier on digestive system than other types like Hemp.<br />8.  Love the Amazon subscribe & ship extra 15% discount, best thing ever<br /><br />Go to growingnatural.com website read more about it.
