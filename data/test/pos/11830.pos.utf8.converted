Wow, are these good! They are crispy and crunchy, light and flaky, and still have a bit of texture and depth to them. Sometimes with "healthier" chips I feel like they are almost too light, but these feel like a REAL snack food.<br /><br />Their taste reminds me of SmartFood (which turned out not to be so smart) with a mixture of whole grain chips- there's a nice tang to the crunch. There's just the right amount of spice- it's almost unnoticeable when you first open the bag, but by the time you eat a few chips, it's definitely there.<br /><br />We're big corn chips fans- Fritos, tortilla chips, etc. I also love anything cheddar (Smartfood, Pirate's Booty, Cheez-It) so these were a GREAT find for us.<br /><br />The only downfall is 6 grams of fat per small snack-size bag. But at 140 calories, and the amount of flavor, it's well worth it. My entire family LOVES these chips and they are our new obsession (little ones may not like the spice, though, so try the white cheddar ones...)
