These are the absolutely perfect choice for your coffee table candy jar.  They are individually wrapped, and the wrappers are color coded for what's inside.  The variety is generous and truly diverse.  And every morsel is unbelievably delicious.  I can't think of an American made candy that compares.<br />You won't be buying these to hand out to trick-or-treaters, though. The price (in this country) is bank breakingly high.  If you have friends or relatives in England, you could ask them to send you some.  Or, as my wife and I agree, they make a wonderful additional motivation for our next trip to London.
