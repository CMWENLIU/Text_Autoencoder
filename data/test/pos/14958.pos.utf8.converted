Ignore the price because this organic honey from New Zealand is worth every dollar! It has helped heal wounds, kept those annoying winter colds & sore throats away and on top of all that it has given my skin a lovely glow.  PLUS the taste is extraordinarily smooth and sweet. It is by far my favorite natural healer, cold minimizer and honey product ever. My teenage daughter loves it too.  I have it on monthly auto ship and I'll never be without it. Take a tablespoon twice a day when you first feel that sore throat coming on and you will be amazed at the ability of this honey to stop the pesky colds and coughs right in their tracks. Love this stuff.....
