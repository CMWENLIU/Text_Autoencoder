This is a direct response to the misleading, non-sensical review that starts with the headline: "No Bargain":<br /><br />First off, the "No Bargain" review is EXTREMELY MISLEADING.<br /><br />Here's the two things the reviewer got right: 1) If you DO have the Fancy Feast cases delivered regularly via Amazon's "Subscribe & Save"-- you pay $14.02 a case. 2) If you buy 24 cans at Petsmart (at 53 cents per can) you pay $12.72 for a case.<br /><br />BUT HERE'S WHERE THEIR THEORY IMPLODES:<br /><br />If you buy your case at Petsmart (in CA-- specifically in Los Angeles where I live)-- YOU HAVE TO PAY SALES TAX... Adding as much as $1.24 to the total cost of a case.<br /><br />Now the Petsmart case costs $13.96. Since we've agreed that the Amazon case purchased via Amazon's "Subscribe & Save" costs $14.02... That means there is only a SIX CENT DIFFERENCE PER CASE between Amazon's price and California Petsmart and Walmart prices.<br /><br />Plus, you also have to PAY FOR GAS if you go to Petsmart or Walmart. Plus, the extra travel time to and fro. Plus, you have to drag all that cat food to your car from the store and then drag it from your car to your house.<br /><br />MY Amazon Fancy Feast is DELIVERED TO MY FRONT DOOR BY A UPS DELIVERY PERSON.<br /><br />I'll gladly pay a EXTRA SIX CENTS for DELIVERY TO MY DOOR.<br /><br />If folks follow your thinking-- they'll spend A LOT MORE MONEY for their cat food!<br /><br />Think it through! Fancy Feast is a PERFECTLY FINE DEAL HERE!
