I've been buying the various Simply Asia products at my local Dollar General Store at a really cheap price and I'm certainly pleased with the product(s). This particular one happens to be my favorite but they're all very good.<br /><br />I'm a scratch cook, preparing supper for my wife and myself every day, (I'm retired, she still works full-time), so I don't usually buy many microwave food products. However, I have fatigued of eating leftovers for lunch every day and these products have turned out to be the perfect solution. I like them much better than frozen dinners in terms of flavor and convenience. I've also found them much more savory than similar and comparable microwave dishes.<br /><br />For me, the bottom line is flavor and, secondarily, heartiness -- I don't want to be hungry again fifteen minutes after eating lunch. This dish goes into the microwave following a minimum of preparation fuss (all you need is a little water -- everything else is included) and is finished from beginning to end in just minutes. I cannot say enough about the good flavor, and the portion size is fully adequate for me which is a rare occurrence in my past experience with such products since I weigh 265 pounds.<br /><br />If you have any specific concerns about nutrition or ingredients, you can check those issues on the product description; however, I did wish to let others know how convenient and how tasty these Simply Asia products really are.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
