Terra Blue potato chips are everything they say they are: delicious and so good that they're practically addictive, lower in fat than most other types of potato chips with zero tans fats, and they have a neat bluish color with just a touch of black here and there that gives them an aesthetic appeal. As another reviewer notes, it's very, VERY easy to eat a whole bag of these at once--they're only one ounce bags and even if the bags were larger these chips are as good as can be!<br /><br />They do contain salt and some carbs, so check the nutrition label if these are concerns for you. They are also kosher if that matters to you.<br /><br />Overall, these chips are the best! I highly recommend them.
