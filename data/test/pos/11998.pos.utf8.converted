I use this salt for this Kalua Pig In A Slow Cooker recipe I found, and man is it delicious. 4 pound pork butt, 1 tablespoon of this salt, and 2 tablespoons liquid smoke. Put it in a crockpot/slow cooker for 20 hours, and you have one of the simplest and most delicious dishes ever. I used regular sea salt my first time cooking it, but then ordered this to try it the "real" way, and it was even better.
