My Molly is 18 years old and has chronic renal failure.  Because of the renal failure, it is very difficult for her to maintain weight.  Catsure is the only thing that does it.  I recently took her to the vet and he was impressed that she had actually GAINED weight (she's always losing)!  I told him about this product and he said the company that makes it has been a highly respected company with veternarians for years.  And our cat LIKES it!  She will eat this on days she won't eat anything at all.  If you have a cat with renal failure, you know how hard it is to get them to eat.  You have to try this, it's been a lifesaver!!!
