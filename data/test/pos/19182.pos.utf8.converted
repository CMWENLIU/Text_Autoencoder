This is pretty good tea! It's not the best gunpowder green that I've ever had, but it is certainly a bang for your buck for the price. Someone previously said that it's a good "everyday" tea, and I 100% agree with this. It's good, it's almost great, but it's not a tea that I would anticipate curling up with in a blanket on a cold evening and savoring the experience. It's just a good cup of organic green tea. I'm still so pleased with it and the price--you can't beat that! Buy it!
