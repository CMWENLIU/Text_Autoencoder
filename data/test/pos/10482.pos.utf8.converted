Hands-down, the absolute best, sesame snack I have ever had...<br />Being a physician, I hate having too many carbs & fats, and so avoid MOST candy/snack items...<br />These packs are excellent: each pack has 4 thin sesame wafers; so you can easily control your portion size (I use a ziplock bag to save the rest, for eating the next day...). Very crisp, fresh taste, NOT super-sweet. It is more sesame, less sugar...<br />I tried the sezme sesame snack (a different brand sold by amazon also): the sezme ones are MORE sugary (more caramel); these sesa-kiss ones are MUCH better...<br />Hope this helps...
