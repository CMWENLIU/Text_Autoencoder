I had looked for this extract for years and was unable to find it anywhere because its so rare. One day I got the idea to check Amazon.com and was elated to see that they had it. My mother used to use this in cakes when I was a little girl and they were absolutely delicious- like nothing I'd ever tasted then or since. I had tried to replicate her cakes for many years but could never do it until she finally told me her secret ingredient: rose extract. I bought 2 bottles to ensure that I have it for awhile (you only need to use a little bit at a time). This is now my family's favorite type of cake. Another plus is that the seller had it to me in 2 days!
