I am a type 2 diabetic and it is under excellent control.  Nevertheless, I'm always looking for ways to give me a hand with it.  I read that Ceylon cinnamon was the 'real' thing so I purchased a pound of it last summer and have been using it.  I did not change anything else in my diet.  Two weeks ago I had my six-month check-up and my 3-month levels were WAY down.  We were all quite surprised and although I do get outside and do more work in the summer, which might help a bit, it has not helped to that degree in years past.  I'm thinking it was the cinnamon, which I use quite a bit in cooking and in the breads I make (I make all our own).  Yes, it's got a great taste, but I'm afraid I'm not much of a gourmet when it comes to cinnamon -- I like it in whatever form it comes in!  I am thinking, though, that there really is something to the claims being made for this stuff in terms of blood sugar control.  I'm ordering more now.
