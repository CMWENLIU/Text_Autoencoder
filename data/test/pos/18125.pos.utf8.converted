While I'm the first to admit that I am biased when it comes to anything from Louisiana, it's hard to find a coffee better for the price or the flavor than Community Coffee's Cafe Special.  I believe that coffee is best tested while drinking it black, since there's no way for sugar, cream, or anything else to change the flavor of the coffee.  That's how I'm reviewing this coffee.<br /><br />Cafe Special is a medium-dark roast that serves up a not-too-bitter taste.  It's perfect for early mornings, particularly while part of a sweet breakfast of pancakes and syrup, doughnuts, or beignets (if you can get your hands on some good Louisiana ones).  For later in the morning or early afternoon, it's a very good pick-me-up.  It has a deep and rich flavor that's sure to please even the snobbiest of coffee drinkers.<br /><br />I'm fortunate enough to have met people from all over the United States of all ages, races, and creeds.  While many of them have a favorite regional coffee (or chain coffee such as Starbucks), they always ask me if I have any Community Coffee on hand when I see them.  My parents, both of which are retired, travel the country in their camper and have run into the same thing.  No matter where you go, if you run into someone who has tasted Community Coffee, they are always thirsty for more.  To me, that stands taller than any review for the quality and flavor of Community Coffee.<br /><br />Try some today!
