As far as I am concerned, bulk is the only way to buy yeast. These little packets and tiny jars are ridiculously priced for what you are getting, and beside that most people arent using enough yeast in their baking either. I use yeast for everything from bread to pancakes to corn bread. I use more than most people do. Unlike baking powder and soda, yeast is actually nutritional (as long as it is cooked, never eat it uncooked). Yeast adds a nice flavor and aroma not found in these 'powders'. I don't know where some of the common practices for using yeast came from, but I've found that you don't need to let things rise two or three times unless, that is, you are looking for a way to pass time. Also like in pancakes, just mix up the batter and throw it on the griddle, it rises for me. But don't be so stingy with the yeast. Yeast is not some rare thing that needs to be conserved, actually it is cheaply made, yet yeast boasts rather high nutritional value.<br />  I may be biased, I rarely if ever bake with white flour, I use whole wheat, corm meal or perhaps rye, mostly whole wheat. I use egg in my dough, batter etc., rather than the added white flour for gluten. Again the egg adds flavor, nutrition and RISE POWER without damaging the texture or character of the whole wheat or cornmeal product.<br /><br />  Red Star is offering a great deal here, and the price is right.
