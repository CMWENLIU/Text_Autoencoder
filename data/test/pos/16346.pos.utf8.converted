gave my mom this thing for her b-day/mother's day(same day for her) haven't persoanally seen hers.  She said it was more than what she saw online and so impressive she offered it to be a pres for both her and Dad.  I have tasted some of the things she grew in it.  It makes for a wonderful low maintainence indor plant grower for those of us who have would like to improve the atmosphere indoors yet do not like ot open window to give plants sun for reason of noisy(and nosey/ loitering) nieghbors.  I will be getting one of thse for myself soon.  Great for houses with gas furnaces that are in the den.(that stink and suck air.).
