I do not know why the person said this cocoa taste artificial.... maybe they added too much water you have to experiment a bit to see what is best for you. I use a lower setting to make it richer. This is one of the best kcup cocoa's I have found and am ecstatic that it is at this low price I will stock up. Truthfully the worst hot cocoa I have ever had was the green mountain, I just open the kcup and pour it into hot water because most of it does not drain out it lays in the cup hence making it taste weak. Anyway give this one a try you will like it especially since it has 3 different kinds in it..... peppermint, dark chocolate and the milk chocolate. And one more thing I find if you shake up the kcup it loosens up the cocoa to allow the water to completely dissolve it.
