This is awesome bone.  We have a 60 lb chocolate lab and she went nuts over this thing when we gave it to her.  It is her favorite chew toy.<br /><br />It's very durable and looks like it will last for years.<br /><br />Since it is a natural product, it has "wild" scent to it that dogs are attracted to by instinct.  We play hide and seek with it.  She always sniffs it out.<br /><br />(Don't worry, it doesn't "stink" like cow hooves or pigs ears.  But, your dog will love it just as much.  It's just a subtle smell and it does fade after a week or so.)<br /><br />I probably could have gotten the smaller version.  But, this one is fine for our pooch.<br /><br />It is pricy, but I expect that this will out live my dog.
