I use to purchase this brand, but over the years it's gotten more and more expensive (I use a lot of oyster sauce).  That said, I used to purchase it exclusively because it was the best. If you are looking for one of the best, then definitely purchase this one. Otherwise, you can get the non-premium Lee Kim Kee or Panda Brand.
