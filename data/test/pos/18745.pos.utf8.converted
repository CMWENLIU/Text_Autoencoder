I'm on the website today to order a second twelve-pack of this mix.  I haven't shopped around a lot; Carroll Shelby's is the first and only mix I've tried, and I'm very happy with it.  I found it on Amazon earlier this year after being unable to find it in local stores, and I've just recently gone through the first twelve-pack (okay, I gave one pack to my mother-in-law).<br /><br />I've converted my daughter and my mother-in-law to it, as well; they're both chili lovers and we use this recipe together with dark red kidney beans, diced tomatoes, a small can of tomato sauce, and ground turkey (healthier, and cheaper, and there's a small difference in texture and none in taste from ground beef).  We recommend going with the recipe option that calls for a large can of diced tomatoes, and about half the cayenne packet, and about 32 oz of canned dark red kidney beans, drained (the recipe only recommends 16 oz), and between 2 and 3 lbs of ground whatever.<br /><br />Ground beef, not too lean, or chopped chuck, or cubed pot roast are all good candidates for the meat.  As the package used to say, fifteen years ago, don't waste your money on expensive cuts of beef here.<br /><br />The directions are pretty basic and perfectly adequate to produce a good hearty meal.  Use a _big_ frying pan, 13" if you've got one, and have a larger stew pot/saucepan of some kind standing by in case your ingredients are too much for the pan.  Do stir frequently once you've added the spices and flour, because there's some tendency for the mix to thicken up and form a skin on the bottom of the pot, and you'll lose good flavor that way (not to mention the bottom might get burned and ruin the whole recipe).<br /><br />With 2-3 lbs of meat, two cans of beans and a large (28 oz) can of diced tomatoes in tomato juice, the whole thing makes six or seven _really_ generous portions (12-14 oz each).  I make it and freeze most of it in individual portions, taking it in to work and microwaving it at lunch.
