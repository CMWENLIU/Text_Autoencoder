I have taken Juice Plus for about 5 years now.  Ever since I started taking it, I feel better, I look better and very rarely get sick.  I had run out about 4 months ago and within those four months of not taking it, I got a cold twice.  That's proof enough for me.  I don't eat enough fresh fruit and vegetables (I wish I did) and Juice Plus is a great supplement.  I have noticed though, that when I'm taking Juice Plus I actually crave the real thing more.  That is another thing I like about it!  AND...there are no strange ingredients!
