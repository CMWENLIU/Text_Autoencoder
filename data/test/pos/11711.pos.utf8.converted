Morning Thunder is an excellent name for this drink, but I have a feeling it might put some people off, as the tea is very good without being too whacky and crazy tasting. I was expecting a real potent punch, but upon reading that it had yerba mate in it, which I  drank in one of my favorite Chai mixes, I was sure it would be palate pleasing and I was right! This tea is very simple, as the ingredients list is short; roasted mate and black tea-no fillers, no funny stuff and no funky herbs and spices.  Upon further search on the internet of it I found out that Yerba Mate is an herb that is traditionally prepared as an energizing tea and consumed by natives of South American countries as it contains high concentrations of antioxidant flavonoids possessing potent free radical quenching activity.  It also includes several B vitamins, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Beta-Carotene and Calcium. Mixed with black tea, the Mate tastes like dark chocolate, just a hint mixed with the tea, it's a subtle yet an eye opening experience upon the first sip.<br /><br />I try to take good care of my health and drink lots of tea and water, but I had no idea how high in antioxidants this tea was! Per serving it had 1150mg, compared to 375 to 800 in broccoli, 600 to 900 in Tomato Juice and 650 to 1100 in Orange Juice. Tea is much easier to prepare than eating a bowl full of broccoli and drinking tomato juice, and it's quite refreshing and also tasted nice with some milk and sugar. I don't add lemon to it, just sugar and I let it soak in for about 3 minutes. Its makes a slightly smoky, chocolaty and exotic brew, yet it's still tea can be drank at breakfast or tea time. I love the cover art and the simple goodness of Celestial Seasonings, as it reaches out and transforms many coffee addicts to tea lovers :)<br /><br />-Kasia S.
