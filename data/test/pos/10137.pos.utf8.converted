This candy is stupendous (it tastes divine with Coca-Cola, especially) -- but if you really like it, you must try dicing it into smaller pieces (pea-sized), and putting it in your home-made vanilla ice cream.  It does not work well with chocolate or strawberry, but a good rich vanilla recipe will really bring out the licorice taste and have you coming back again and again for more.  And as far as the Coca-Cola goes... well, try some of your new licorce-bit ice cream in a Coca-Cola float, and you'll think you're in heaven.
