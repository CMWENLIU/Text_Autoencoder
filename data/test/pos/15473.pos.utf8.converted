I was introduced to Madhava Agave from my sister back in Jan. 07. Because diabetes runs in our family I decided to use it for our teas and coffee, cereal(cold and hot). I have passed it to my friends and family and found that they are also enjoying the benefits. It has no after taste and doesn't take much to make any thing sweet.<br />I highly recommend it to anyone, children as well. Amazon had the best price.
