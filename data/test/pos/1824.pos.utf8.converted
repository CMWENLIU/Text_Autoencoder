This is the best tea I've ever tasted. It is mild--only slightly lemony, a little ginger taste. I drink it every day, all day long. After a year of drinking it, I'm still not tired of it, and I have tried to add other types, but they have all been rejected and given away. I guess I'm stuck on it. And since it's decaf, it's okay to drink a lot, so how can I go wrong? Especially when it contains all those wonderful antioxidants? I really like Numi's Gunpowder Green Tea, as well, but don't drink as much of it because of the caffeine.
