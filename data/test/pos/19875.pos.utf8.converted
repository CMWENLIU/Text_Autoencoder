I bought a bag of these and the chocolate covered blueberries and both are great. The stawberries are about the size of a marble and covered in thick dark chocolate. You can still taste the berry though. Its the perfect mix of sweet and  dark chocolate. The chocolate and berries contain no artificial colors or flavors. The taste is addictive and for the price you cant go wrong. If I knew they were this good I wouldve got 2 bags. Enjoy.
