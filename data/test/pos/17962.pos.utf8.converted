After reading all the negative reviews regarding the water pumps on the other Keurig machines, I decided to try the OfficePro.  So far I'm very happy with it.<br /><br />It is a little loud, but it only lasts for a few seconds while the water is being pumped.  I'd rather put up with the noise rather than have a machine that only lasts a few months.  The coffee comes out a little strong for my taste, so I use an over-sized mug and use the (same) pod twice at the 6 oz. setting, then add some soy milk. (Could be the coffee -- I use Gloria Jean's Hazelnut bought here on Amazon.)  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZKI">Gloria Jean's Coffees,Hazelnut K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>  I also got the Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha which was way too sweet for my taste, but my son loves it. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EE0TYK">Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha, 12-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 3)</a>  I also got the Keurig Carousel which I'm really happy with. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PVYW48">Keurig 5071 K-Cup Carousel Tower</a>  I saw the carousel today at Target, where it cost $1 more (plus tax).<br /><br />The best part is, I found this on a site called eCrater (seller coffeehots) for $87.99 -- no tax, free shipping.  I ordered it last Tuesday, and had it on Friday.  I was wary of ordering from them (found them Googling, looking for coupons), but they had a lot of recent positive reviews so I took a chance, and was very pleasantly surprised.  The model I got was the current B145 model, complete with an 18-pack sampler of K-cups.  Set-up was a breeze -- there was a quick set-up guide that walks you through what to do; I was drinking my first cup of coffee within 5-10 minutes of taking the maker out of the box.  : )<br /><br />When you register your machine with Keurig, they send you a code so if you buy 2 boxes of K-cups, you get 2 free.  I ended up with 4 boxes, plus 3 samplers for $39.05 (free shipping, because my original order was over $45).  The Keurig website is a great place to go to see ALL the K-cups offered -- over 200 of them.  Plus they sell samplers that contain 5 K-cups for around $3 -- a great way to be able to test obscure flavors (like Southern Pecan) without buying a whole box.  There are a lot of customer reviews there too, just like Amazon, which was really helpful.  (That's where I got the idea of running a K-cup through twice.)  The prices are comparable with Amazon's but with the free Prime shipping, I think Amazon wins out.  Still, it's a good place to get flavors that Amazon doesn't offer.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase.  Now I can have a fresh cup of coffee whenever I want, and I don't end up having to throw out the occasional half-a-pot.  And it's so convenient compared to making a pot of coffee -- no filters to worry about, no loose coffee grinds, no washing the pot, the different flavors, etc.  I love my new toy!  : )
