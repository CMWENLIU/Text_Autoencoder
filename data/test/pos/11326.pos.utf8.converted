I hadn't cooked with hominy before but wanted to give it a try. Considering that this is just lime-treated corn, it's hard to believe the nutrition label on the back. Per serving (1/2 cup, 245g) there is:<br /><br />Calories: 60<br />Fat: 0.5g<br />Carb: 10g<br />Fiber: 6g<br />Sugar: 4g<br />Protein: 2g<br /><br />This product is incredibly low in carbohydrates and very high in fiber. But even more promising than the nutrition facts is the taste. I recently used this in a "Peanut Butter Chili" along with 15 other ingredients and the hominy was my favorite part. Once cooked, the hominy has a wonderful texture and consistency, better than any bean or corn I've had. I highly recommend this product.
