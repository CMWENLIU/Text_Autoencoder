I have an English Bulldog, who is now 1.5 years old.  He has suffered since he was about 6 months with terrible scratching.  He will chew on his paws, lick his legs, do the fancy 3-leg-standing belly scratch, and often would lay on the brick hearth and scrape his chin back and forth.  Needless to say, this would cause his skin to be red, raw, often broken, etc.  Hot Spots weren't really a problem, but we could tell he was miserable.  Ear infections plagued him for about 3-4 months repeatedly...<br /><br /> The vet was no help - the did try to alleviate his symptoms, but never tried to find the source of the problem.  I decided after researching for a while, that a food allergy was to blame.  I eradicated all corn and chicken from his diet, as these are common Bulldog allergens in food.  I slowly switched him to Blue Buffalo Fish and Sweet Potato formula.<br /><br />Previously, he had been on Eukanuba adult maintenance formula.  I had raised many dogs in my life with this food formula, and they had led long and healthy lives.  With a proper, slow integration of food, he did not encounter any loose stools, and his itching has greatly subsided.  i have had him on this food now for 3 weeks, now eating only this food.<br /><br />Bulldogs are BIG chewers, so I traded all his chicken basted rawhides for beef basted rawhides, and changed from Milkbone treats to another one made from Cranberries and Oatmeal with NO corn or poultry products.<br /><br />He was tentative at first with the food change, as he would normally eat once a day around 4:30. Now, with his new Blue Buffalo food, he eats the food as soon as it hits the bowl, and is a much happier dog.  His coat is healthier, and his shedding has slowed to a crawl!!!<br /><br />I highly recommend this food to anyone!
