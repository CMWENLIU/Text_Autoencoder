I love a healthy nutritious breakfast but hate spending any time on preparation.  I was delighted to find McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal, Quick and Easy since I prefer steel cut to rolled oats.<br /><br />I have this every morning (I posted a picture of the nutritional label) and prepare 3/8 of a cup of oatmeal with 3/4 cup of water in the microwave for 5 minutes but at 40% power to prevent over boiling.  It gives me a really good consistency and I add Splenda, lots of cinnamon and canned pumpkin puree along with whatever fresh fruit I have around.  It's delicious and for just over 300 calories, prepared this way, I have a breakfast that doesn't play havoc with my blood sugar and keeps me satisfied till lunch.<br /><br />I will admit that my little dog stands in line for her fair share of a couple of spoonfuls in her dish.  She loves it and I think it is a nutritious way to start her day too.
