People familiar with Indian cuisine already know ghee: it's like butter with all the junk that can burn taken out.  Use this in your pan instead of butter and you'll have the advantages of oil with the creamy richness of unsalted butter.  Besides Indian dishes, I use it to make excellent grilled cheese sandwiches with crispy golden exteriors.<br /><br />As ghee goes, this is a fine one.  If you prefer a ghee that has the runny golden oil component this may not be what you seek if the jar I got was representational.  What I got was mostly solids, which I am fine with, as I have no preference.  I have bought many makes of ghee over the years and this is very good.  I bought this ghee to bump an order total up to get free shipping, and was not disappointed.<br /><br />I can make no claims about the healthy qualities of ghee as opposed to butter - all I can tell you is that it is great for cooking and tastes terrific.
