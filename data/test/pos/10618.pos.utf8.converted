Timothy's Colombian Decaf is a true coffee without sacrificing full body flavor, unlike any other decaf I've tasted.<br />It's not readily available in stores, as it is very popular and sells out quickly. In fact, I've only had success with Amazon, not only for this product but for others as well, and will definitely recommend using this service. Their price for the product count and quick service make it a waste of effort and money to go stores shopping for it.
