I have no complaints with this sauce--in fact, I was just about to order another bottle.  Like one other reviewer, I got it from ThinkGeek (tm?) originally and was happy to find it here.  I eat it on my morning omelet (seasoned with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001II46YO">J&D's Original Bacon Salt, Low Sodium, 2-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3)</a>) alongside rashers of bacon.  BHS has the right amount of heat and salt where my palate is concerned--and now I'm hungry so excuse me for my abrupt departure to prepare breakfast.<br /><br />With bacon.<br /><br />And Bacon Hot Sauce.
