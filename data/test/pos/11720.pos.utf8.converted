These are vegan, dairy-free.  Very tasty.  I had only ever had the white chocolate that uses dairy cream and whey, and I thought I hated "white chocolate" and wondered why they called it chocolate.  Well here is why... because white chocolate should be made with cocoa butter.  Then it is truly white chocolate.  And it doesn't have that dairy flavor; it has a very mild chocolate flavor.  These chips melted down well and also went back to solid at room temp.
