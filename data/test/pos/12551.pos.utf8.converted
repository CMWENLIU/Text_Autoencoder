I felt the effects from this tea the first day I started. I noticed I had more energy, I felt more productive and I wasn't as hungry. I didn't even think at the time about the fact I had had a cup of this tea in the morning. It wasn't until about 2 days later when I realized that all the energy and less hunger that it was probably the results this tea.<br /><br />Also...I have horrible kidney problems and since drinking this I've noticed a Huge change. I drink a lot of tea and this is the first time I've ever noticed a difference.<br /><br />Seriously..this is a great product..as well as their Peach Detox tea. I highly recommend it :)
