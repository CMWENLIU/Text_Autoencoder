This is a mild curry with surprisingly strong flavor. I have used it for years, but ran out a while back and had trouble finding it so was forced to used other curries. I tried several and none had the wide range of flavors that is characteristic of Ship Brand without absolutely eliminating all others. Curries can take over food so that the taste of vegetables and other ingredients are completely lost. Other curries are too mild and have an uniform taste. Not so with Ship Brand. The taste is mild enough to allow other flavors to shine without being tasteless or bland.<br />I highly recommend this curry.
