I'm a cook's cook, typically loving the process of making meals from scratch.  However, there are those inconvenient moments in my life or even times when I don't feel like cooking!  Then, I pull out what I call my "dirty little secret." :)  I LOVE this soup-- I amp it up with a healthy dose of EVOO and a generous amount of fresh grated parm reg.  I top the whole deal off w/homemade sourdough croutons, roasted w/EVOO and parm.  The whole deal takes 15 minutes and you have an amazingly tasty meal.  Highly recommended!  (I get ticked when I can't find it at the grocery store, which has been a lot lately. So, I just go ahead and order my sixer here)
