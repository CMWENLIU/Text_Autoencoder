I like to add this to curries.  Creamed coconut contains both the coconut fiber and the fat, unlike coconut milk which has no fiber.  It has a pleasant grainy texture, but once dissolved, is not very noticeable.  It's slightly sweet and has a good coconut flavor.  Google "creamed coconut" recipes for some good ideas.
