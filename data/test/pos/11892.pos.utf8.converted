-I'm editing my review because due to travel, I've been forced to buy various brands of regular black beans at the grocery store.  These Natural Value beans are 1000 times better than regular canned black beans you buy at the store.  Seriously- they taste better, they look better- way blacker- their consistency is way better- they are just far superior.  In my original review I said all black beans were the same- NOT TRUE!! I can't wait to get back home so I can stop eating crappy black beans from the store.-<br />Organic farming practices are way better for the environment and the watershed, therefore even though these and all canned black beans taste, look and feel exactly the same either way, you know you aren't contributing to the huge dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico by supporting all the farms that spray chemicals all over their fields. SO buy up.
