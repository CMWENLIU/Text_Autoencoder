I read about lecithin years ago in an old nutrition book by Adele Davis, and decided to try it. I liked it, or liked the idea of taking it anyway, but stopped taking it when I learned that some health problems I was having at the time were related to soy in my diet. My health improved greatly when I stopped eating soy, but I missed the lecithin.<br /><br />I was happy to discover recently that other types of lecithin were available. One source is sunflowers.  I tried sunflower lecithin capsules, but was less than enthused about them.  Nothing wrong with them, but they felt like an inert food somehow, maybe because of the processing when it's put into the capsules.<br /><br />I found LoveRawFoods Raw Sunflower Lecithin online a few weeks ago and decided to try it. It's a little pricey, not so much the product itself, which is reasonably priced, but when you combine the product price with the shipping, it adds up.  But I'm glad I bought it.  I really love it.  It's great to be able to eat lecithin again after all of these years.<br /><br />To reiterate: sunflower lecithin is not like soy lecithin. Soy lecithin is an industrial waste product marketed for human consumption (made usually from genetically modified soybeans). It's toxic and bad for you.  Sunflower lecithin is a beneficial food product derived from sunflower seeds. And better yet, the LoveRawFoods brand is raw. Very cool.  It tastes like very fresh sunflower seeds.  I'll keep buying it as long as LRF keeps making it.<br /><br />If you're new to lecithin, I'd recommend mixing some into a smoothie, till you develop a taste for it. I actually eat it by the spoonful. But I know that's unusual :)Most people would want to mix it into some food.
