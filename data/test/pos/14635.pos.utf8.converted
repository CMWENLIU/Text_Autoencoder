I love this brand of oats, and the shipping was fast, the grain was fresh, and the packaging was perfect. Made my 1st batch of oat casserole with it and it turned out superb:<br />ORGANIC OAT CASSEROLE:<br />2 cups steel cut oats<br />1 cup nuts (I used sunflower seeds)<br />salt<br />kefir<br /><br />Soak the grain and nits overnight in water, salt, a tablespoon of kefir (or yogurt), it will make them nutritionally more available.<br /><br />Drain and rinse the mix and put in bowl.<br /><br />Put in a blender:<br />6 eggs<br />2 cups milk or 1/2 and 1/2<br />2 tablespoons cinnamon (I also add pumpkin spice, ground vanilla beans to taste)<br />Blend till smooth and add to grains.<br /><br />Add a cup or 2 of dried fruits (I used fresh dates, raisins -- use what you like)<br />Add 1/4 cup of coconut oil<br /><br />Stir it up till mixed and pour into greased glass pan<br />bake for 45 minutes<br />let sit for 10 minutes<br />cut in squares, add extra cinnamon and sweetener if you like (I use Vanilla Stevia on top)and serve with milk or coconut milk or nut milk.<br /><br />It's like a very special cereal for breakfast, or a nutritious snack any time.<br />It is very filling and satisfying, and inexpensive to make.<br />Enjoy.
