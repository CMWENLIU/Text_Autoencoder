I've been feeding my cats Tiki Cat's fish-based cat foods for a while, so when I saw that Tiki Cat also has chicken cat food I just had to try it out, and I am very glad I did. Although my cats would be happy to eat nothing but fish for every meal I try to feed them a balanced diet with protein from chicken, lamb and beef as well. This is a very nice chicken cat food: each of these tiny cans is jam packed with chicken shreds that look tastier than most canned chicken intended for people to eat (though as I am a vegetarian I haven't tried eating this food myself :-)<br /><br />This chicken is certified delicious by my two fussy felines, who ate up everything I gave them and then begged for more. And as an animal loving pet owner I am very glad that the label of each can makes it clear that no dolphins were harmed when they rounded up all the chickens. I only hope they managed to keep the whales out of the chicken farm as well.
