My first bottle of orange oil from this producer was a gift.  I did not even open the bottle for several years.  Then I decided to try it in some homemade bubble bath.  The experiment was a failure, but it smelled heavenly.  Since my favorite cream chocolate filling is orange, I decided to try adding a few drops to our microwaved chocolate cake that I make most evenings for a treat.  It's delightful!  I have also been successful in making stir-fried orange chicken using this oil, and I sometimes put a little into hot chocolate.  When the gift bottle was down to only one-third, I started looking on Amazon for a replacement bottle.  In the end, I decided to go with the same brand.  If I could make just one wish about this product, I would like a way to always add drops instead of an uncontrolled dribble.  However, I'd rather have it the way it is than to pay more or get a poorer product.
