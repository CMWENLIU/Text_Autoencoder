my wife and I really enjoy cooking and baking. when it comes to making muffins we found this product to be a great healthy timesaver.especially when it comes to high temperatures I don't want any artificial chemicals leaking in the our food and we are confident this is a clean alternative. I also like that this is environmentally focused company that uses recycled paper in their packaging products.
