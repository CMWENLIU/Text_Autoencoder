"WOW"...My first time to try Thai Coconut Ginger Soup, I'm Hooked! This is really good, and so easy. I made it with chicken, added some precooked rice, a few mushroom slices, a can of chicken broth, and a can of coconut milk...The flavor is so good and rich. There are 12 packets with 2 packets of soup base mix in each one, for a total of 24.
