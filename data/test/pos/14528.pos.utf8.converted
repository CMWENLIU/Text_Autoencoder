When only the ingredients in the bag are used, this noodle can be very spicy. However, when veggies are added, such as, onions, green onions, egg, and even beef/other meats, it can get mild. There are a lot of Korean noodles, but Shin Ramyun is one of my favorites! If you don't enjoy spicy food (or msg - some mentioned it), then don't bother.
