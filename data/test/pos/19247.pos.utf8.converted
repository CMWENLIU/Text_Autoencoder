I was lucky enough to have a grandmother who had traveled the world and had certain foods that she went great lengths to get at home. This marmalade was one of them. Some grocers carry them now, but it was hard to find at one time. Made in the United Kingdom, it is a marmalade for purists. No preservatives or artificial sweeteners here, they still use the ancient recipe. For real authentic marmalade that is so good you will not be able to eat the cheap stuff again, try this. Remember that you are buying a case on this page, not one jar. This company or seller carries hundreds of gourmet and retro food items on Amazon.
