I've battled with my weight since high school. I'm 50-something now and finally found a way to lose weight without feeling deprived, thanks to my Tribest Blender and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6GFZI">Fiber One Bran Cereal, 16.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>!<br /><br />I had reached an all-time high with my weight - 220lbs plus. I can't say for sure how much I weighed when I decided to start to losing weight (yet again), because I had stopped weighing myself once I hit 220. I didn't wanna know. However, my actual weight had to be 230 or more because I was wearing my 220lb jeans, but I could no longer zip them at all. So it was either lose weight, or buy a whole new wardrobe.<br /><br />I started trying to find a diet that I could stick to, but I had to face it - I had tried them all, and always failed because of my ginormous sweet tooth. After about a week or two of depriving myself of sweets, I'd wind up breaking my diet. I knew the only way I was ever going to lose weight was to find a way to do it with, somehow, including sweets.<br /><br />I won't bore you with the details, but I finally wound up creating a smoothie recipe that was so delicious that I didn't feel sweet-deprived. I substituted the smoothie for two meals a day and ate sensibly for the third meal. I LOST 50 LBS IN 6 MONTHS! Whoo-hoo!!! I haven't been this "skinny" for over 20 years!<br /><br />I'm still losing too (-60 lbs at the time of this writing). It's been slower going lately, but that's because it's winter and I'm not walking my dog in the park for an hour 4 or 5 times a week. Once the weather warms up, I plan on going back to my walking and I'm sure the weight loss will speed up again.<br /><br />I prepare my smoothies with my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q5TIJS">Tribest Personal Blender PB200 Super Convenience Pack</a>. You drink using the container you used to blend, so there isn't an extra blender container to wash. Rinse the blade assembly with warm water immediately after blending to save more washing. I grind the Fiber One cereal in the small, 8 oz container first. Then, in the larger, 16 oz container or the extra-large 24 oz container (available separately), blend all the ingredients except Fiber One Cereal together, or just cover and shake, to make room for the cereal. Add the Fiber One last and blend thoroughly.<br /><br />The commuter lids are great for taking your breakfast with you in your car. You can make and store smoothies in the 'fridge overnight, with the included regular covers, for a super-fast breakfast. You can also get replacement parts and extra accessories (unlike similar as-seen-on-TV products). You can also get an optional carrying case for the blender to take it to work or on vacation.<br /><br />I like the mason jars for mixing and freezing both dry and wet ingredients with the Tribest, like ground flax seed and home-made veggie blends. You can get extra mason jars just about anywhere and also use them for freezing leftover or batch-made spaghetti sauce, soup, etc. Also dry ingredients like flour, rice, brown sugar (no more hard lumps!), bulk spices, etc. The dry products can store either in the freezer or on the shelf.<br /><br />As far as some of the complaints saying that their Tribest blender died after only a short time - it has a built-in, shut-off mechanism to prevent the motor from over-heating, which can happen if the mixture you are blending is very thick, which over-works the motor. If you just let the blender cool off for a few minutes, it will work again. Thin the mixture with a little more milk or a few ice cubes.<br /><br />There are several Tribest combo pack options for purchasing the blender which can save you money. Just type Tribest into the Amazon search to see them, and to see all the available accessories.<br /><br />Anyway, enough about me - if you've stuck with reading this to this point, you're probably hoping I'll reveal my secret recipe. So, without further ado, here it is.<br /><br />Basic Fruit Smoothie Recipe (makes approx. 14 oz)<br /><br />1/2 cup Fiber One Original Cereal, pre-ground if possible<br />6 oz skim milk<br />1 cup fresh or frozen fruit (nuke frozen for 15 sec. to make blending easier)<br />2 Tbs Sugar-Free French Vanilla coffee creamer (optional), I use powdered<br />No-cal sweetener, to taste (add last, after blending and tasting)<br />1-4 ice cubes, if necessary, to reach desired coldness or to thin a too-thick smoothie<br /><br />Frozen fruit works best because the smoothie will be very cold. Bananas can be frozen if you peel ripe bananas, slice into one-inch pieces, arrange on cookie sheet so that the pieces don't touch, place cookie sheet in freezer until bananas are frozen, put frozen banana pieces into zipper plastic bag, and return to freezer. You want to freeze the pieces on the cookie sheet first because if you just dump all the banana pieces straight into the plastic bag, you'll wind up with one giant frozen banana lump. You can use this method for other fresh fruit too.<br /><br />Suggested flavors: Banana, strawberry, blueberry (my fave!), raspberry, blackberry, pineapple, orange, lime, lemon.<br /><br />Suggested combos: Banana/strawberry, blueberry/strawberry, pineapple/banana, pineapple/orange.<br /><br />Use fruit juices in place of fruit too. Use 6 oz. of juice or, if using frozen concentrate, 2 oz. of concentrate and 2 oz. of milk or the equivalent in ice cubes. When buying juices, choose only those marked as 100% juice if you want to avoid sugar.<br /><br />I often use a few banana slices to sweeten, instead of no-cal sweetener. The banana will also add a little more thickness for the thinner consistency smoothies, such as those made with juice.<br /><br />Other variations: Chocolate (1 Tbs cocoa added to banana smoothie), mocha (1 Tbs cocoa, 1 Tbs freeze-dried coffee, 2 more oz. milk, banana or no fruit), pineapple-upside-down smoothie (sweeten with Splenda Brown Sugar blend - it's half Splenda, half brown sugar), pumpkin pie smoothie (cook and refrigerate pumpkin first and sprinkle in some pumpkin pie spice), sweet potato smoothie (same prep and spices as pumpkin pie smoothie), banana nut (blend in a few Tbs chopped walnuts).<br /><br />For those who want a bigger meal, add another cup of fruit and 2 more oz milk. Use the larger 24 oz container. You could also get all your fiber for the day in one meal by using a full cup of Fiber One Original cereal and a few more oz of milk, juice, or ice cubes.<br /><br />The main point of using Fiber One in the smoothie is that it makes the smoothie meal very FILLING and will keep you feeling full longer. You can't get much more filling in a 14 oz meal than 14 grams of fiber! None of the commercial diet liquid meals can't touch that - and you pay a lot more for them. With two smoothies a day, you're getting over 100% of your daily fiber, 4 fruit servings, 2 cereal servings, and 1 1/2 dairy servings. Fill out your food pyramid with your third meal. Doesn't hurt to take a vitamin/mineral supplement also.<br /><br />And, if you're really into veggies, you can make green smoothies with Fiber One too.<br /><br />I LOVE FIBER ONE AND MY TRIBEST BLENDER!!!!<br /><br />UPDATE: As of Sept. 2010 the weight loss is 100 lbs! Only 15 more to go! WHOO-HOO! This recipe really works! I wound up making mostly blueberry and/or banana smoothies - they're my favorites. I also kept frozen OJ handy for if I ran out of fruit before shopping day. I can't believe the difference when I look in the mirror - not only do I have a waist again - I re-discovered I had cheek bones too! LOL<br /><br />Since I'm so close to my goal, and since it's been a year on this regime, I've eased up on the food restrictions for my 3rd meal and I allow myself a treat every now and again. Yeah, it'll take longer this way, but after 100 lbs, I deserve a break! Besides, all along I allowed myself to get one candy bar when I went grocery shopping. It helped me avoid other temptation knowing I'd be enjoying that candy right after shopping. I still lost the weight fast. I figured, allowing a little was better than getting to the point of utter deprivation frustration and quiting - which is what has always happened in the past. Cut yourself a break every now and again and do it without guilt!
