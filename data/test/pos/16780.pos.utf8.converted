My wife and I are both diabetics so sugar candies are never on our list. We have<br />tried other sugar free chocolates but most have an after taste but were OK.  Amberlyn Chocolate are the best we have found.  We treat ourselves to half a bar each most nights, some nights we include a glass of red wine with our dark chocolate which adds a nice complement to Amberlyn's dark chocolate.  Maybe some day someone will create a sugar free wine to go with the chocolate? Well maybe but probably not in my life time. Anyway give ameberlyn a try, it's well worth the price.  God Bless and God Bless the USA!!
