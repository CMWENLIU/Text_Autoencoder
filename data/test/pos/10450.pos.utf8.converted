The closest store that I can find blue sky soda is an hour away and it sells it for $1.25 a can so finding it here was fantastic. The New Century soda doesn't differ too much from the regular soda, I can tell a slight difference but probably wouldn't notice unless I knew it was a different kind. Really fantastic, it is more expensive than coke or pepsi but at least I know that the ingredients weren't coming from a lab.
