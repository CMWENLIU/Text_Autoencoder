My dog is allergic to beef, so I needed an alternative to rawhide and tendon chews.  I tried these, and he loves them.  I have not found them to be messy or gummy.  I also love that they are made of real food (sweet potatoes), with no additives or fillers, and that they are made in the U.S. rather than China.  They are not as long-lasting a chew as rawhide or tendons, however.  If you are looking for a longer-term doggie pacifier, my recommendation would be a Zuke's Z-Ridge Edible Dental Chew Bone.
