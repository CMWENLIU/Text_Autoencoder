This is excellent tea!! Real blueberry flavor but without the caffeine!!!<br /><br />I really like tea in the winter and was suprised when even my kids loved this tea. My 5 year old thought I was making muffins when he smelled it steeping. He tried it and then the rest of the kids had to try it. I now order it here in bulk!!
