You will hate it if you spread it on toast like you would peanut butter or jam. A little packs a big punch. 1/2 tsp is sufficient.<br /><br />I spread it on toast add cheddar cheese, tomato, lettuce (sometimes a boiled egg) and bacon. It gives blt's a kick and the cheddar enhances the flavor.<br /><br />TRY IT.
