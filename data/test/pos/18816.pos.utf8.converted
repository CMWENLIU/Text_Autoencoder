I happened upon this item in the aisles of my local health food store and was quite impressed with the taste, texture and nutrition of this "fast food" vegan entree.  Once I had enjoyed my first package, I went looking for more and was glad to find it online at Amazon at a reasonable price for a box of six.  I believe I paid 4.69 at my local store for one package, so this is much, much better... Enjoy! It's great for that on the run lunch when you want something tasty and nutritious too.
