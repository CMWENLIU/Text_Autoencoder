... were a basic flavoring ingredient in the cuisine of ancient Rome and Etruria, used as widely as The Chinese use soya sauce or the Americans use catsup. It may be something of a surprise that the same fish sauce is one of the necessary elements of the Southeast Asian cookery, from Burma to the Philippines. The clear pungent liquid is called 'ngapi' in Burmese, 'nam pla' in Thai, 'nuoc nam' in Vietnamese 'yu chiap' in Chinese, and 'patis' in Tagalog. Tiparos is a good brand, and this is a proper price.<br /><br />The Thais serve "prik nam pla" as a condiment on the table for every meal. It's simple 'fish sauce' with chopped Thai chilis, those little hot devils, and chopped coriander weed, commonly called 'cilantro' in parts of the USA. It's indispensable. You can judge the authenticity of a Thai restaurant by whether you are served prik nam pla automatically, or have to ask for it, or can't even get it. In the latter case, you are ethically authorized to walk out without paying your bill.<br /><br />Likewise, any Thai or Vietnamese cookbook that doesn't discuss the uses of fish sauce would be better reserved for starting campfires.<br /><br />As I said, the Romans used the same stuff, which they called LIQUAMEN. My guess is that as the Empire was transformed by immigration from the north, especially via Gaul, fish sauce was replaced by sea salt and rock salt. The Haida, Tlingit, and Kwakiutl peoples of the Pacific Northwest used the oil squeezed from candlefish for a similar taste treat. That oil was so valuable as a trade item that wars were fought over it.<br /><br />Soya sauce is NOT an adequate substitute, whatever your Betty Crocker cookbook says. But now you can get fish sauce anywhere you choose to live. I'm still getting accustomed to the implications of internet shopping. Imagine this: I can get a novel by Roberto Bola&ntilde;os, a DVD opera by Monteverdi, and a bottle of Tiparos nam pla, all in one package delivered to my door by the US Postal Service.
