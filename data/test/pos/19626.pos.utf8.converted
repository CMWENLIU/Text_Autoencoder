I absolutely love this coffee! It is extremely rich and smooth and without any of the bitterness that most other coffees have.<br /><br />Don't let the cost of this coffee scare you because you will actually use less of this coffee when you brew so it really ends up costing about the same as any other "regular" coffee. I highly recommend it.
