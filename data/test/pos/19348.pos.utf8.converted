I've only recently begun to branch out in my tea selections from fruity teas to dessert teas.  I don't like sweeteners in my tea, and I was afraid that teas that were meant to taste like desserts would have to taste as if they were sweetened.  Thankfully I was wrong!  I've now tried several of Adagio's dessert teas and they are wonderful- chocolate is one of the best.  The flavor of this tea is strong, and it tastes unmistakably of chocolate.  But thankfully, somehow, it does not taste as thought it is has been sweetened with sugar.  It's amazing- I have no idea how Adagio manages it, but the taste is smooth, rich, creamy chocolate, just not sugary.  This works beautifully as an after-dinner tea, and it fulfills my need for dessert after dinner (well, most of the time).  I think it is excellent with a splash of milk.  I didn't really know what to expect from this tea flavor-wise, but I am very, very pleased. This is a high quality loose tea.  It always brews a nice cup for me. I'll certainly be buying more.
