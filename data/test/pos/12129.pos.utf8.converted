Having tried just about every fiber-branded cereal there is over the past couple of years, I would always pass by the Cheerios in the cereal section while grocery shopping and look to see if they had released a fiber version yet. Well, I can now happily report that my search for a consistently good-tasting fiber cereal are over. Don't get me wrong, there are a number of other competitor's products out there that are really good (Fiber One Shredded Wheat, for instance) but if you're a normal person, you will probably get sick of eating the same thing for breakfast in a matter of weeks or months. This cereal on the other hand, tastes great and never seems to get boring. It's lightly sweetened- just perfect as it isn't overly sweet or bland in flavor. It is pretty filling as most fiber cereals are, and is best enjoyed immediately after being immersed in milk so you can still enjoy the crunchiness of it(meaning it will get somewhat soggy if left sitting around for too long). I'm tempted to knock a star off for pricing as this is somewhat pricier and smaller-sized than competitors' offerings, but for how good the cereal tastes and the fact that I can't seem to get tired of eating it (going on 5 months now), I'd say its worth it to pay the small premium.
