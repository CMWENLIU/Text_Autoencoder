I'm a big fan of good jerky; made plenty of my own, and this stuff is great.  It's a little pricey, but the quality and flavor are worth it.  It is on the sweet side, but that's to be expected hence the name "sweet n' spicy".  You won't be disappointed. I couldn't keep my hands off the 8 bags and scarfed them down in 4 days--dirty gluttonous pig!
