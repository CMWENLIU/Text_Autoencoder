This is a great deal for the 2-pack of lemon zinger tea.  I'm a big coffee fan so the tea has lasted me for a while but is awesome for those cold nights - it's also decaf so you're not left wired!  It's strong enough that I keep it in the Keurig to 'top-off' my current cup of tea and it still has a great strong flavor.  You won't find a better price than here on amazon, especially if you add coffee and get free shipping!
