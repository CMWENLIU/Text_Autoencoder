This has a very unique taste.  At first you are expecting something like lo mein with a lot of soy sauce (because that is what it looks like), however it is actually a black bean sauce.  I have to say that I am addicted to it though, but the taste does not appeal to everyone.  It is definitely worth a shot if you can find a single package rather than buying 20 on amazon if you might not like it.  That being said, this is my favorite nong shim ramen!
