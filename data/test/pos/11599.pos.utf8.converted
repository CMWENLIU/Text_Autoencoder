I first tried this with macaroni, and it was fantastic. Much smoother, tastier and creamier than the boxed macaroni and cheese. I also topped popcorn with it and it was just as good. May try making some homemade cheese crackers next.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Edit: I finally made cheese crackers with this (just replaced a bit of the flour called for in the recipe with cheese powder. Sorry, I rarely measure things--just added it until I was satisfied with the color and smell of the dough.) They turned out really well, much better than store-bought cheese crackers, and I've since made them with a hint of cayenne--delicious.<br /><br />Oh, and for those using it on popcorn, just spray the popcorn with spray oil and the cheese will stick reasonably well.
