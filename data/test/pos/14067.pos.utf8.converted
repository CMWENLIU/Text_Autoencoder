This is the first product that I have ever felt strongly enough to write a review on.  This tea has definately gotten some undeserved bad reviews.  It is a Chai Tea!!  It is supposed to be spicey, have a fairly strong flavor, and you are supposed to add sweetner and milk to it.  This VANILLA DECAF CHAI is fantastic!  My kids love it, my guests love it, and I love it!  Everytime I serve it, everyone wants to know where to get it and how I made it.  Even non-tea drinkers get hooked on it.  It is wonderful cold or hot, and has a lighter spice flavor than most Chai teas, but they added a touch of vanilla instead.  This tea really is one that you can enjoy everyday.  It really is worth a try.
