I had the chocolate drink and was pleasantly surprised by how good it tasted. I drank it after my work-out before dinner, and it filled me up so well, I wasn't even hungry for dinner! it had a smooth flavor without the grittiness of most protein drinks. The chocolate was not intense, which I like. It did have a little bit of the Stevia flavor, but I was expecting that. At least it's a natural sweetener, in line with the organic nature of this drink. Bravo for producing an all-natural product. I'm ordering the variety pack to try out the other flavors.
