Was turned on to this product by a family member. It's delicious! Use anytime a recipe calls for broth, stock (liquid, powder or cube) or (unfiltered) pan drippings. It's richer and tastier than any other broth or stock I've used. An excellent base for home-made soups, stews or cooking in general. It'll make a 15 min. "soup" that's good for the soul.<br />The large box is an excellent value too!
