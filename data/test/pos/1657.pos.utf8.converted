I was very apprehensive about the noodles, but they are really great!<br />I got the angel hair style, and they are just like Asian cellophane noodles.<br />I personally wouldn't use the angel hair style with a marinara sauce, as I can't imagine they would hold up to that heavy sauce.  I made them with fresh tomatoes, basil & mozzarella with a tiny bit of olive oil and it was delicious!<br />Again, much like a cellophane noodle, they soak up whatever sauce you cook them with.<br /><br />They come packaged in water, and they say to rinse them then drop them in boiling water.  When you first put them in the colander, they do have a slight odor, but this dissipates as soon as you rinse them, and have no flavor.<br /><br />Totally worth it!  Saves you so many calories.
