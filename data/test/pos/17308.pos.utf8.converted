I started eating breadsticks because they are a healthier snack than  potato chips and other junk foods.  I tried several brands of breadsticks, and Alessi Sesame Breadsticks are the best!  Many other brands are too dry, hard, and flavorless.  Alessi Sesame Breadsticks are light, delicately toasted, and crispy. They are easy to chew unlike some brands that feel like you are biting into a concrete brick.  Alessi's Breadsticks are really delicious, and they are made with healthy extra virgin olive oil.  I wish more grocery stores would carry this brand. I'm so glad that this excellent food is available through Amazon.com.
