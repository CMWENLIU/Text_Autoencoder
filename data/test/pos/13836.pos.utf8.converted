It's expensive, obviously, but if you're looking for black truffle oil, this stuff is fantastically good. It's cheaper than I was able to find locally, and had a lot more truffle flavor than the last truffle oil I had purchased (locally from the place that has two dollar bottles of wine). You don't need a lot of it!<br /><br />At this price, do make sure you can't get it local to yourself for less. But don't hesitate for quality issues. Drip it gently over scallops and you'll be a believer!
