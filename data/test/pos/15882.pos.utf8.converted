I use very, VERY few processed, pre-packaged foods, but this soup is one I do use regularly.  As a vegan, I'm used to having to bring my lunch to work all the time.  What I love about McDougall's soup is that I don't need any tools (can opener, scissors) to open the box of soup.  Its top is designed to be scored, and then tear off and it works perfectly.<br /><br />You then have a sturdy, leak proof box from which to pour the soup out into your bowl.  The design is superb ... I consistently can open the box and pour it into a bowl without any difficulty and with no spills.<br /><br />Of course the packaging's design would be unimportant if the soup did not taste good ... the flavor is excellent!!  Lots of flavor AND very filling.  You aren't stuck with a tiny 4 or 6 ounce "bowl" of soup .... each box provides a LARGE bowl of soup.  I'm a very hearty eater, and am more than filled and satisfied with a bowl for lunch.
