I love this stuff!  I was a hard core, 4-6 cups a day coffee drinker for about 10 years. I would wake up and if I didn't have coffee right away, I got a horrid headache.  Well, one day I became sick with a nasty head cold and the coffee didn't sound as appealing as hot honeyed tea so I drank that and used exedrine for the headache and caffine.  After a few days without my normal jug of-joe-, I just didn't crave it anymore like I used but I still wanted something in the morning.  I tried a bunch till I found this.  The flavor is wonderful- mellow & sweet- I would buy it for the flavor alone but the extra health benefits are nice. I can't way to try it iced too!
