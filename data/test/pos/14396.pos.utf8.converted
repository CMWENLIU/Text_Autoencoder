Campbell's Cream of Shrimp Soup has been a staple in my pantry for decades.  It was an easy starting point for all kinds of lovely seafood soups and sauces for nights when I was desperate for something fast and delicious.  Over the past few months, one supermarked chain after another in my area stopped carrying it. Totally unavailable, even by special order.  I was getting desperate.  So I tried Amazon.  Not only was it immediately available, the price including shipping was less than I had paid at the market.  Thank you Amazon - there will be shrimp and crab chowder for dinner tonight.
