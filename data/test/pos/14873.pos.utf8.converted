This sauce is medium heat for everyday use.  It has an excellent roasted pepper flavor, and there is *NO VINEGAR* to get in the way.  Consequently, you get exactly what one should expect from a pepper sauce...versatility and flavor that does not try to smother the character of the food you season with it.<br /><br />An every-day sauce should not leave a patina on your tongue.  This is not a boutique novelty, it's a household staple.  The 32 oz. size is the right size for a hot sauce household.<br /><br />You want good?  Try Tapatio on cottage cheese.  You'll never eat cottage cheese any other way again, I promise.<br /><br />I use it on just about anything except cereal and ice cream, but my personal favorite applications of Tapatio are:<br /><br />eggs<br />potatoes<br />pizza<br />anything creole (forget tabasco!)<br />cottage cheese<br />most rice<br />mac cheese<br />and of course...Mex<br /><br />In my opinion, this is the best sauce in your local grocery store.
