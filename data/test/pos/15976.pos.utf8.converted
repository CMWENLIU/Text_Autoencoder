These are just as good as the ones you buy in Italy! Excellent quality dry porcini mushroom. Leave in in warm water for a few hours or even overnight and then bring out you creativity: Porcini risotto (save the mushroom water and use it to cook the risotto), pasta with creamy mushroom sauce, a delicious sauce for your pork loin or your steak.... I could go on... Wonderful taste, you'll love them!
