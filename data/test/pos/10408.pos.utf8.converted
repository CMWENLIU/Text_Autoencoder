This is the best canned chili I've ever tasted.  It has large white breast chicken chunks, white beans, and a mild taste of green chilies.  It has 19g of protein, 17g carbs, and 8g fat plus 290 calories even with sour cream in it.....Great for almost any diet or even great for children...my nephews love it!  I buy mine at Walmart for $2.02 a can.  You can't go wrong for a fast, super easy meal!!!  Just serve with salad.
