My wife and I have been heartily enjoying the delicious flavor and incredible health properties of coconut water for years now. When it was affordable to do so, we'd buy 10-20 raw young coconuts at a time and just drink the water straight from the husk. It was a magical time, but it became impractical to do that, unfortunately, and so we've searched for quite a while to find a suitable replacement. We've tried almost every brand of packaged coconut water available on the market. Most have been abysmally terrible, with extra sweetener added to mask the extra saltiness that is characteristic of the coastal locations most of those companies buy their coconuts from.<br /><br />This is not so with C20 coconut water. C20's water is absolutely incredible; it's amazingly light and super delicious. It's all natural too, with no extra sweetener added. It's simply young coconut water in all its glory. C20 use a special variety of young coconut unique to the groves they get their supply from, a variety with more sweetness and much less saltiness than the coastal coconuts most other brands get theirs' from. They also adhere to very specific and strict quality assurance processes to be certain that their product is always the highest quality available on the market. All of this clear devotion to the quality of their product as well as the quality of the water itself really sets C20 above all others out there. Exceptional stuff.<br /><br />My wife and I are raw foodists, and are conscientious of what processes most products go through before arriving on store shelves. I personally wrote to C20's customer service and asked about this, and they assured me that none of the nutrients, minerals, or enzymes are harmed in the process they are required by the FDA to go through before selling their products. This is a major selling point for us and hopefully that will help you health-conscious folks out there as well.<br /><br />Really, with the exception of going to the store and buying fresh young coconuts and draining them of their water straight from the husk, I'd argue there's no better way to experience coconut water than with C20. In fact, and I don't say this lightly, it may just match it. The only problem with this product is that oftentimes the price online will fluctuate between what's normal and what's unreasonable. If it's more than 24 dollars, then I recommend going to C20's website. From there, you can search for stores near you that sell their product, many of which offer discounts if you purchase entire 12-packs, which is nice. So whether you are a raw vegan who lives and swears by young coconut water, or an athlete who wants a very healthy drink that will replenish and revitalize you, or you're a regular person who just wants a delicious, natural, and healthy drink to enjoy, this is the best packaged coconut water on the market. Buy it, take in this incredibly refreshing and delicious water, and feel its awesome health benefits revitalize, replenish, and build-up your soul.<br /><br />*Update: 7/12/12*<br /><br />Just thought I'd mention that my wife and I have been buying about three cases of this coconut water a week for the past 7 months or so. We have a standing order of three cases just for us every week at our local grocery store, we get a special 10% "case" discount, and the local store we get them from seems to have had a perpetual sale that keeps the price at $1.79 per can instead of $2.20. When combined with the case discount, that's less than $20 a case (even less if you recycle the cans and get some cash back that way! :D). Sometimes the sale price is even lower. Great deal, but that's not the reason I posted this update. After 7 months of buying 3 cases every week, I still have not found a single unsatisfactory can of coconut water in that whole time. I'm not exaggerating and I'm not making this up. There genuinely isn't a single sip of C20 coconut water that I didn't love, and we've literally gone through hundreds of cans. If there ever were to be a bad can, I'd definitely remember it in contrast of the perpetual "awesome" streak we've had with this brand. The longer I drink it, the more I am astounded at this company's quality. Hope this helped solidify your confidence in this coconut water and that you'll be enjoying it yourself soon. Thanks for reading my review. Have a good day, Toodles. :D
