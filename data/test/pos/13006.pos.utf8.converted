These are exactly the candies I've been craving for so long.  A million years ago when the earth was still cooler, once a week I'd walk with my dad to the delicatessen and he'd buy me some while he waited for those yummy cold cuts.  My favorite part was the thin paper-like wafer that would stick to my gums then quickly melt. Then I'd bite into a thick nougat loaded with almonds and slowly chew every morsel.  Probably why my parents let us have these since it kept us kids quiet while they shopped!<br /><br />The La Florentine is close to what I remember though I was looking for the originals in the blue box.  I found them -- Ferrara -- from the same vendor and ordered both.<br /><br />They're both loaded with almonds and same-texture nougat; not too chewy but doesn't fall apart or crumble unless you force it to.  Each square is 1" x 1.3/4" x .1/2(thick) Perfect size for a sweet pick-me-up. Each box comes with Vanilla, Orange, and Lemon flavors.  I started with Vanilla and have to wait awhile for the next taste but expect them to be just as wonderful. Minute they arrived I ripped open the boxes and started remembering why I loved them so much.<br /><br />The La Florentine's are the sweeter of the two but that doesn't mean the other brand isn't sweet or any good.  The Ferrara is actually in the range I prefer, more the "touch of sweet" as I love nougat but only want sugary-sweet sometimes.  Getting both was a great idea and covers all moods!<br /><br />My next order to Fine Products will be the hard candies, especially the Anise, Liquore, Caffe, and the Gran Mix that I might share with others. I'll probably have to buy 2 of each so I can have my own :)
