I am a huge fan of chocolate flavored cereals and Cheerios, so when Chocolate Cheerios came rolling around I knew it was just a match made in heaven.  While I can't say this is the healthiest of breakfasts, it's a nice treat for dessert or to mix in with plain Cheerios.  There is whole grain corn and oats in the cereal, however there is a whopping 9 grams of sugar, so I wouldn't want to feed this to my kids every morning.<br /><br />If you like cereals like Cocoa Puffs or Cocoa Pebbles, the flavor is close to it.
