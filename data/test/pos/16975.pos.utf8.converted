I am fighting cancer, and I decided to do a vegan diet. With no animal protein, and mostly vegetables it was super hard to get enough protein. My nutritionist suggested whey, but after learning it had soy in it, I searched for alternatives. Since soy is so controversial, I figured i would just stay away from it. He said pea protein, and I am ok with that, but I decided on the 50% Hemp protein. He said go ahead and I just received it today. I have to say I really like it. I made mine with 8 oz. almond milk, 1 tablespoon of raw organic cocoa powder, and 2 packets of stevia (probably could use less stevia). I used my hand help immersion blender and tada..... it was tasty. I look forward to having this every day.<br /><br />I already feel great on my new protocol, can't wait to see if this addition makes even more of a difference.
