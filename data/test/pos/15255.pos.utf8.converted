I've been eating King Oscar Kippers all my life.  One day our grocery store was sold out of them so I took a chance on Polar and boy am I glad I did.  The fish has a much smoother texture and the taste is excellent.  I panicked when I saw Polar was no longer available at the same store so I'm very glad that Amazon offers this product.  If you invest in this product you'll be glad you did.  Its just right for those times when you're hungry but don't want to eat heavy.  I use a small squirt of mustard on a cracker, close my eyes while I'm chewing, and have a heavenly experience.
