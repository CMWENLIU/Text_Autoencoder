It's straight protein, and that's what I like best about it. Most other brands of protein powder are diluted with all sorts of stuff I'm trying to avoid like sugar, cholestrol, fats, and carbohydrates. But Bob's Red Mill Soy Protein Powder has none of that stuff. It's also easy to use in almost any way you want to.
