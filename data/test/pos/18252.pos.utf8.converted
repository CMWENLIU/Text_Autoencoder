We have two kittens and they LOVE the 'Tender Turkey Feast', but not a fan of the 'Ocean Whitefish' which seems bland and smells odd. The Turkey always smells good and is always very moist and fresh in the cans. The only downfall so far is that the 'Kitten' food comes in limited flavors (Ocean whitefish or Turkey) and it dries/hardens quickly if not consumed fast enough so leave out smaller bites for your kittens which means you are constantly on watch feeding the hungry growing critters.<br />I also suggest using paper plates because its easier to feed them and toss out the plate instead of washing out a bowl and smelling it.<br /><br />[...]
