If you're still eating refined flour, sugar, and artificial sweeteners, this cereal (and all the Ezekiel products) will probably taste like granulated styrofoam to you. We train our palettes, for better or for worse.<br /><br />I have been eating Ezekiel for at least 20 years.  I don't eat sugar, artificial sweeteners, refined grains, red meat, or artificial anything, and this cereal tastes sweet and crunchy and nutty to me. I usually eat it with a handful of chopped walnuts, cut up a banana or peach, and add almond milk. It's low on the glycemic index, which is also an enormous plus if you're trying to eat healthy. And it's filling; unlike when you eat those sugary cereals, you won't be hungry in an hour.<br /><br />When I walk into the grocery store, and 99% of the groceries are all about sugar and carbohydrate addictions and foods all pumped up with chemicals and addictive substances, I feel discriminated against. It's much harder to eat right in this country. I can't even find Ezekiel in most stores. I hope, I hope, I hope they never go out of business!
