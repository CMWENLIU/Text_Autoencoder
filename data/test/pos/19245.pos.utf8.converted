I was lucky enough to visit Oak Alley last Spring.  I enjoyed a lemon mint julep.  I tried for the better part of a yeat to duplicate the taste.  It was impossible without the syrup.  Most mint syrups taste like mouth wash, very overpowering.  This syrup is light and sweet, the perfect compliment to the lemon and the bourbon.  Absolutely delicious!  Kentucky Derby this weekend and I have the drinks covered!
