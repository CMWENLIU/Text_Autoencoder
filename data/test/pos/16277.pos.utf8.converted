This is now the ONLY cocoa mix I buy! It is soooo good. I like how the ingredients are better than the other big brands. I can't do alot of dairy products and most other companies slam their mixes with milk powders. This one does not. I use it in my cereal to make it chocolatey and also on toast to make choco toast under the broiler. mmmmm
