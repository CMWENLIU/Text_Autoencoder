I saw these mentioned on a raw foods site and decided to check them out. I just tried them for the first time. I snipped open the bag and ate one... and then another and another. I had to finally force myself to use some self control and stop munching on them. I like olives well enough, but there's a savory richness to these that could well make them addicting... moist chewy texture, tasty tartness, not too salty. I can think of a few recipes I'd like to try these olives in, if I can keep myself from snacking on the whole bag of them "as is." I just ordered another bag because I don't think this one will last very long.
