I bought this by accident attempting to get the toroni sugar free chocolate. I am pleasantly surprised. There is nothing fake tasting about this sugar free product. I use it in coffee to make a sort of home made mocha. espresso from our areopress coffee maker with a little of this and some milk has eliminated my expensive coffee shop habit.
