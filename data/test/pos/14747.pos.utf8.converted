Dassant is one of my favorite brands for baking mixes, and the pumpkin bread is no exception. This mix has a delicious flavor with just the right amount of cinnamon and nutmeg. Yes, the mix does require canned pumpkin, but there really isn't any way to have authentic pumpkin flavor without adding the real thing.<br /><br />Besides adding the pumpkin, the mix requires water, eggs and oil. Good additions to the mix include 1/2  to 1 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans and/or 1/2 to 1 cup of chocolate chips (mini-chips do not sink to the bottom of the pan.)  The finished bread freezes well which is helpful if baking in advance. The pumpkin icing recipe on the box is quite good. It requires some of the canned pumpkin (the entire can isn't needed for the mix), butter, milk, vanilla, cinnamon and powdered sugar.<br /><br />When I can find Dassant mixes I buy them and here's why. The Dassant ingredient list includes six items - enriched bleached flour, sugar, spices, salt, leavening and either soybean or canola oil. The list on a name brand spice cake mix I had in my pantry has 18 ingredients including partially hydrogenated soybean oil, corn syrup, artificial color and a number of unpronounceable items. I love to bake from scratch but sometimes I don't have time. Using a mix is a time saver but I still want it to taste free of chemicals and be as natural as possible. This brand makes that possible.
