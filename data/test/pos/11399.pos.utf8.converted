My family has been adopting a raw foods diet for the last year, and one of the things we have been able to enjoy is eating young green coconuts.<br /><br />A young green coconut looks like a woody white cylinder with a point on the top of it.  In order to open it, you take a heavy cleaver type knife and you strike it in four sides around the point of the coconut.<br /><br />You then take off the top and inside you get anywhere from 1/4 to a full cup of coconut water- a clear sweet nectar with subtle coconut flavor.<br /><br />Drinking this type of juice is a delightful experience, however, it does take some work to get at and is not always convenient- until now.<br /><br />When I first saw the 11 oz aseptic container of O.N.E coconut water, I was not sure what to expect.  I know that I expected it to be flat tasting and probably nothing like I was used to from having fresh green coconut water.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />This coconut water might not be fresh and raw, but it is the closest thing to it that I have come across so far.<br /><br />The foil wrapped box has about a 5/8" opening (slanted square) that is covered with foil.  You peel that off and it forms a slight spout for easy pouring.<br /><br />It is best served cold, so I kept in the refrigerator.<br /><br />The water/juice inside is a slightly cloudy clear liquid which has the delightful taste of young green coconuts.  There is a refreshing coconut flavor that is not at all overwhelming, but just right.<br /><br />It has no added flavors or sugars to it, which is delightful.  It has only 60 calories which is also a nice feature.<br /><br />I have compared it to fresh coconut water, and although I do prefer raw fresh water, I am very happy with this as a substitute.<br /><br />I can say this, my family all fought to taste this stuff- so it made a big hit here.<br /><br />If you are into raw foods and need to have a beverage which is close to what you are used to and is not cooked to death and sweetened in a package to take on a picnic, trip, or even to work, this is definitely a great item to have handy.<br /><br />You might like it even if you are not into raw foods, but like the fragile coconut flavor in coconut water- you should give this a try.<br /><br />I do want to mention that this is NOT the kind of water that comes out of very dark brown dried coconuts- that tastes very different than young green coconuts.
