Been using this for 3 weeks now. I was using another brand for about a month prior to using this. I liked the other brand but i wanted to see what else was out there and get the best. Well I'm done searching. This combines fruits and vegetables! I've been using this to supplement my breakfast and lunch throughout the day and i feel great!  I have more energy than before. I'm not getting tired halfway through the day anymore and i feel i have more mental focus.  I feel healthier than i ever have. I thought being "regular" was going once daily. Well since i've been taking this I go an hour after i eat usually. Overall hands down best product bar none. Get it from amazon too - in my local stores they are usually a good bit pricier.
