I looked everywhere for reviews of this product before buying it and couldn't find a single one, so let me spare someone in the same situation... This is really, really good. Far better than I expected after reading reviews of other low-carb barbecue sauces. It has no negative taste whatsoever, it's sweet, tangy, completely pleasant. If it weren't low-carb, I would still like it a lot. Do note that it has 3 grams of Xylitol per serving, which I know many people try to avoid. But 3 grams isn't so bad...<br />With that said, I have not tried cooking with it, only using it as a dip. I'm definitely going to be attempting a low-carb barbecue chicken pizza with it, and if it comes out well, my life will be complete.
