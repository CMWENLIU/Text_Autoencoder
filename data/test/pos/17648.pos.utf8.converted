Alessi's Caffe Espresso is rich, smooth, and not bitter - and this is in my office coffee club's drip coffee maker.  I rate this a 5 star because even though I know it's full flavor would come out as real espresso, it is fantastic on my cheapie set up.  I've been testing a variety of coffees including the black can Lavazza and others, but so far this is my favorite.  Excellent coffee at an excellent price from Amazon.
