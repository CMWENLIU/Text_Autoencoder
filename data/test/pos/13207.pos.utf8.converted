I used to use Bigelows green tea in tea bags. After purchasing  a Keurick Kcup machine I finally found their Kcups on Amazon . For me this tea is just right at 12 oz. If I want it a little stronger I just cut back on water. A little squirt of lime juice makes it perfect. I receive my orders from Amazon fast, as I have 2day shipping. I will continue to use Amazon and Bigelow tea in future.
