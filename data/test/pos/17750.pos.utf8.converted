Long time Oatmeal eater here.  I usually bought McCann's in the store, but it can get pretty pricey.  Amazon is a great deal, and you get free shipping.<br /><br />FYI, medium- to long-term is it unhealthy to consume steel-cut oatmeal UNLESS you soak it in warm water with something acidic between 12 to 24 hours, preferably some fermented milk product like yogurt, kefir, buttermilk, etc.  Reason being is that oatmeal contains in its hull enzyme inhibitors that have a chelating effect on your body, i.e., they remove metal from your body.  While short-term this may be beneficial (meat eaters stockpile extra iron, copper, etc. over time), medium-term this could lead to deficiencies in essential metals.  Soaking the oatmeal at least overnight neutralizes the enzyme inhibitors.  Additionally, it allows you to cook up the oatmeal in about five minutes, versus over 30 minutes when left unsoaked.<br /><br />This recipe follows the recipe in Nourishing Traditions, but basically soak one part oatmeal with one part lukewarm water.  Add a little bit of yogurt to create the acidic environment: I use one TBSP per 1/2 cup of oatmeal and 1/2 cup of warm water.<br /><br />Oatmeal should be eaten with some fat (many of the vitamins are fat soluble), so I add butter or cream.  I also add shredded flax and coconut, increasing the healthiness of my breakfast.  I then top it off with plenty of raw honey (also from Amazon), which sweetens my porridge and thus makes me look forward to breakfast in the morning.<br /><br />Enjoy!
