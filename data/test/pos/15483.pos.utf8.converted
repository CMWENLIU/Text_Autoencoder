A nutritionist recommended truffle oil to me as a healthy alternative to butter. I don't use a lot of butter to begin with but am always looking for ways to improve my diet and I do like popcorn with butter, it's kind of my "downfall" Well, the nutritionist recommended truffle oil I then e-mailed her and asked her "which one" white or dark truffle? She said both are good, the white is milder. I have only used this on a couple of items so far. I've used it on steamed pot stickers and on some bow tie pasta. I must say, it is the most delicious condiment...I never would have dreamed that a flavored olive oil could be so magnificent! And fortunately, a little bit goes a long way because it is, as you can see, rather expensive. I haven't tried it on popcorn yet. Instead I bought some of the 100 calorie Jiffy Pop Microwave Kettle Corn (also available from Amazon and also recommended by my nutritionist). It too is great and needs not butter or anything added.<br /><br />You really should try truffle oil. I don't know how this particular brand measures up to the other brands but I can tell you this Plantin White Truffle infused oil is delicious. I believe you can buy this product with confidence. I am going to order some more but I'm going to order the dark truffle instead just so I'll experience the difference.<br /><br />One final note: I was warned that once opened it can go rancid rather quickly. Accordingly, I've been storing mine in the refrigerator and when I want to use it I just take the cap off and microwave it for about 20 seconds. Voila! This is truly a gourmet and HEALTHY item. Enjoy!
