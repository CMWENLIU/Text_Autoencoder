Take me back to my childhood with all 25 grandchildren underfoot while Grammy, Mom, the Aunts manned the stove and oven.<br />Still don't know how they did it but boy, was it fun.<br />Anyway, the corn pudding ws a favorite and I have carried that over into my repretoire (sp?).<br />And it is always YUM!
