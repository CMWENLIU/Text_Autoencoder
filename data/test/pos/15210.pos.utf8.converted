I could use this space to tell you all about how wonderful this tea tastes and about how healthy it is but I see that other reviewers have done a great job of that.  I do not write food-tasting columns for a living so I shall not be more dramatic than just simply stating that this tea is soothing and easy to drink.  We all can use the antioxidants, so drink up!<br />  Quick facts:  ALL Tea comes from the very same plant.<br />White tea is fast-dried.<br />Green tea is roasted in an oven or pan.<br />Oolong and black teas are fermented before curing.<br />  Now, 'Silver Needle' white tea is the best. It is picked between March 15 and April 10 when it is not raining and only using undamaged and unopened buds.<br />  Yes people, this is ARTISAN tea.<br />The fact that it coms mixed with Jasmine flowers makes it smell great.<br /><br />  ~Gan bei!  (Mandarin Chinese for- "Dry the cup!")
