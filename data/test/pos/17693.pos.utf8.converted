I originally purchased these to use as a fun gift for a 'secret sister,' and happened to be starving when they arrived in the mail today.  The crackers, cheese spread, and pepperoni were incredibly tasty!  The dried fruit complimented the trio well and the chocolate toffee was a perfect top-off.  I immediately got online to order another variety to try!  It seems like a small meal, but it has kept me full all afternoon.  I'm going to package two in a gift basket along with a bottled drink and some napkins--seems a napkin is the one thing the GoPicnic folks forgot!  They'll be perfect for an early fall afternoon in the park.  Hope the other 5 meals will make it to the gift wrapping stage!
