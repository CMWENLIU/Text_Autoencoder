The Country Choice brand is domestically produced and certified organic by Oregon Tilth and is significantly less expensive than the imported brands as a bonus.<br /><br />These oats are of such high quality that I admit to sometimes eating them uncooked with milk and a few raisins or dried tart cherries.  (Yes, it gives the old jaws a bit of a workout.)<br /><br />I also eat these steel cut oats for dessert by preparing them just like rice pudding:  oats, water, raisins, milk, brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon in that order of quantity, cooked slowly according to the directions on the label but not overcooked, to retain chewiness.  To make it even better, I top it with sour cream or whipped cream when serving.  Delicious and absolutely outrageously rich in healthy fiber:  4g per 1/4 cup of dry oats.<br /><br />The quality is superb; always very fresh, fairly uniform, free of foreign objects with a very pure oat taste.<br /><br />I also like that the paper container takes less toll on the environment to manufacture and ship than a metal container and is also easily recycled.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
