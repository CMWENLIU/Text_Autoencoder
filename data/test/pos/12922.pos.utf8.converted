The flavor of this tea is strong and bold without tasting bitter. PG Tips is the best tea I've ever tasted and I've been drinking it for over 10 years!  I'm glad that Amazon.com is selling it because it's definitely more expensive if you buy from those specialty tea shops.  Everyone that I've introduced this to loves it.  If you're a serious tea drinker you can't go wrong with this.  It's the UK's #1 tea, that says it all!
