There are a lot of inexpensive yogurts in the stores but I feel I want to make my own for many reasons.  It takes a little planning because the yogurt maker (also a Euro-Cuisine) needs 7 to 8 hours and I need to bring the milk up to proper temperature before adding the culture - but the end product is worth it.  As soon as I open a jar of the finished product I first smell it - you don't get that smell from the store brands.  This particular starter makes a 'thicker' variety like Greek yogurt and when you dip your spoon into it you see it.  Then the taste - there is a tang that I've never tasted in a store brand.  Most of the time I don't get around to adding any honey and grated lemon to it (my favorite) because if I start eating I can't stop.  The instructions are on the back of the packets and are easy to follow.  I like using whole organic milk from a local dairy so my experience is based on that - but I'm sure you get good results from low fat milk.  And I have also had success with allowing the yogurt maker to work over night - then I quickly refrigerate the jars in the morning to stop the culturing process.  For me it's not just about the cost it's more about the quality and sustainability of ingredients...it's food for my soul.
