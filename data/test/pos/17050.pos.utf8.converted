on coffees, I can only tell how it tastes to me and that taste is really fine.  I like arabica bean coffee and the hint of chocolate tops off the real coffee flavor of the Obsidian k cup.  I like a dark roast and strong coffee.  This one fits that requirement.<br /><br />I'm also a tightwad and can use one of the Obsidian k cups with my Keurig B-40 set on the small cup size and get 2 cups of coffee.  I rotate the k cup 90 degrees before the 2nd brewing.<br /><br />Also, either Amazon or Target has a mispricing on the 18 count box of Caribou Coffee Obsidian.  I bought an 18 count box at Target for $9.95 10/05/2010.  This was my 1 st box to try it out.  Glad I did.<br />I use Amazon's subscribe and save program for my coffee so that whatever variety I get will be at the best price.<br /><br />A really good, smooth, dark coffee with an easy flavorful taste.  No bitterness while drinking it nor after drinking.
