I have gotten to drinking iced tea made with freshly brewed organic green, white and red (South African Rooibos) teas every day. It's relatively easy to get green and white teas that don't cost a lot, but not that easy to get organic Rooibos at a good price. Well, this one is excellent, for sure, and at a great price on Amazon! Plus, you get an additional discount if you sign up for regular shipping every month or three months or six months, which makes sense if you are a regular tea drinker like me. (If you are not, Amazon will let you cancel at any time prior to the next shipment.)<br /><br />This tea has good body, excellent flavor and very good color. Rooibos is best brewed at 190F, allowing for steeping from 3 to 5 minutes tops. It has zero caffeine and reportedly has 50 times the antioxidants of green tea. It also has anti-inflammatory and calming properties and hence makes the perfect bedtime tea. Also makes great iced tea, either by itself or in combination with other teas (as I make).
