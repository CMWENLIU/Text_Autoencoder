This IS the missing ingredient to movie theater popcorn!  I just got this (it was drop shipped from Paragon themselves) and tried it out when I got home....  mmmmm delicious!<br /><br />You need this and Flavacol popcorn salt.  Good corn.  And you are set!  I think this even tastes just like the butter that they pour on the popcorn at the movies!  I like this better than the coconut oil.
