Kikkoman's Sushi and Sashimi soy sauce is a slightly lighter, slightly sweeter variant on their great basic product.  It is excellent for dipping sushi when plain soy sauce might flavor the rice too strongly.  With sashimi, it's slightly sweet texture nicely compliments delicate fish, and is a superb counterpoint to wasabi.  All in all, I highly recommend this product.
