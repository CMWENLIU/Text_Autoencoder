I never liked green tea. I always found the taste terrible and bitter when compared to black tea. And even though I have tried to acquire the taste for green tea by trying many different varieties, I have always been unsuccessful until,... I was introduced to this Japanese tea. It is truly wonderful! It is mildly slightly sweet and aromatic. The nylon tea bag and individually sealed packages are great as well. A truly great green tea!
