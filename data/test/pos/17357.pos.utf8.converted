For instant coffee I think this is the best brand out there.<br /><br />I see one of the 3 star reviewers wondered if the 5 star reviewer realized they were reviewing instant.  Well, yeah.  It is *instant* coffee, which I imagine some folks just don't like.  But I like it.<br /><br />Several positive points:<br /><br />1: I like strong coffee.  Office coffee is never strong enough.  With this I can put in as much as I want.<br /><br />2: I've tried the new Starbuck's instant coffee.  I think this is as good, and WAY cheaper.  I wouldn't say it tastes the same, but I'm not convinced that one is better than the other.<br /><br />3: These 4oz jars are nice.  You can slip one in a jacket pocket to take to work or pack for a trip.<br /><br />4: It dissolves OK in cold liquids, if you like iced coffee, which I do.  It doesn't dissolve completely, at least not at first, but neither does other brands of instant coffee.  If you actually use a spoon (rather than the dump and swish that I use) it dissolves better.  And if you stir (or swoosh) again when it's half gone and again at 2/3 and 3/4 gone, it'll get all of it.  OR start with a bit of warm water, get it dissolved really well, then add cold water, milk and ice.  OR just get used to the small amount that doesn't instantly dissolve on the surface and tell yourself that they're "sprinkles", and basically get over it.  The Starbuck's stuff also doesn't dissolve 100% in cold liquids either.<br /><br />So, for instant coffee, this is darn good, hot or cold.  For cold, I suggest adding some milk.  Iced coffee without milk tastes a bit harsh to me, regardless of the brand.<br /><br />If you don't like instant coffee then you may not like this either.
