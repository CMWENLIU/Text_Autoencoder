I have tried TONS of honeys and NEVER have I tasted a RAW honey that is so pure, rich, texture yummy and flavorful as this one!! I let my wife try it the first day and we are both HOOKED!!! We go through one 2lb container every week, as we eat it every day with yogurt and fruits, or cheeses. This is worth EVERY penny, and you will not regret it. I was diagnosed with Chron's disease, and I could not eat many fruits in the past. I was also allergic to dust and other pollens, and for some reason I can now eat these acid fruits without getting an upset stomach, my allergies are gone and I can easily eat pecans and nuts and digest them without a problem.<br /><br />My gastritis and ulcers are gone, and I don't know if I should attribute it to this honey, but I am one happy man!!!
