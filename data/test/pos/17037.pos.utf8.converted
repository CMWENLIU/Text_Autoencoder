Stonewall Kitchen's Mango Chutney is terrific. Chutney is a very under valued condiment in our American cuisine, too bad for those who don't use it to enhance even the simpliest of meals. This particular Mango Chutney is excellent and goes well on anything from a complex curry dish to a veggie-burger.
