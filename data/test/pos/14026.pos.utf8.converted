Ever had a Warhead? These pack the same sour punch on the outer shell, but inside the shell Toxic Waste has a sour liquid! Very awesome and sour. You can actually pick these candies up at the Dollar Tree.<br /><br />But caution:<br />It's citric acid. Any type of acid burns, the sour you taste is not really a taste... as crazy as it seems, it's really a feeling in your tongue. Yes it's a good amount of citric acid in one piece, but you're not supposed to eat multiple pieces in a short period of time. You will actually burn a layer of skin-like-material on your tongue. Too much consumption can cause the tongue to bleed. It will heal quickly, as long as you don't eat more in the process of healing. It is true your tongue will actually shed flakes like sun burn. I know it's disgusting but it's how the body heals naturally. Hope this information helped you, or any else it may concern. (Mostly your tongues)
