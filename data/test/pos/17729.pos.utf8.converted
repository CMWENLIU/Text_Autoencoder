I live in Panama and for three or four months each year we have fly season. I mean flies like you have never seen in your life. I hung several of these traps outside my house and in just a couple of weeks I had at least 4 or 5 inches of dead flies in each one. I don't know how many that is but it probably a thousand in each trap. I got a lot more than most as we have Toucans and parrots in cages outside and they attract a lot of flies. Be sure to keep them at least 30 feet or so from your house so that the flies stay away from your house. Plus the traps have a highly unpleasant odor for people but the flies love them.
