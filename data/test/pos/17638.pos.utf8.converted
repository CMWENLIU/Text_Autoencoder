This is definitely the best almond butter I have ever had--and cheaper than any I have bought, too. I was a little concerned about the cane juice in it (am eating it in part because it's good for me, not to get extra sugar in my diet :). Anyway, I don't find it to be sweet, and the calories are reasonable for what it is. The crunchy bits of roasted almonds are delicious.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
