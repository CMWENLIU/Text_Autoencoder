My husband and I got into a serious Indian food run a few months ago.  Chicken Tikka is now on standard rotation along with meatloaf and taco night.  We had picked up this ghee at our local world market and when I found that Amazon had it available on Subscribe & Save I signed up right away.  This ghee is tasty and has the added bonus of being an import of Canada so it is rBGH free as Canada bans the use of the growth hormone.
