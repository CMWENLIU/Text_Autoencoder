I work as a security guard at a hospital here in town, and I hate eating in the cafeteria upstairs because everything is overpriced! I bring this meal with me sometimes, along with a chicken breast patty that I cut up in pieces and mix in with this Maruchan Yakisoba cooked meal. It's great! Thank God we have a microwave and fridge in the office! I can eat so much cheaper, and cheap never tasted so good!!
