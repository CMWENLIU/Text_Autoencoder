My Vet recommended these for my dogs.  They completely remove the plack from the dogs teath and eliminated very expensive cleaning of the dogs teath.  It also eliminates putting the dog to sleep while cleaning the teath.  I take my dogs in about once a year and my vet looks at the teath and just says they look great - no cleaning required.  Before I found these, the dogs teath had to be cleaned about every 2 years.  Plus my dogs love the flavor of these.
