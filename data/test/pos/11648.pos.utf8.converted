I was born and raised in Germany and we always used these gelatin sheets for baking. Since moving to the US, I have converted my recipes to the powdered kind, but I find that the sheets make it a lot easier to not get clumps. Just let it sit in cold water for 10-20 minutes, then press out the excess water, return to a clean pot, and dissolve on low heat). If you have trouble getting smooth results with Knox, I highly recommend you try these - and Dr. Oetker is hands down the best brand for gelatin around!!
