This is definitely my favorite new drink mix in the Mocktail line by Crystal Light.  It's a great tasting lime flavored drink.  The artificial sweetener gives this a very slight aftertaste, but just slight.  And I like the fact that it is only 5 calories per serving.  Each pouch makes enough to fill a large pitcher.  There isn't any type of alcohol flavor, which is fine with me.  It's a very refreshing drink.  I can drink this stuff all day!
