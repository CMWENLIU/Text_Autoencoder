UPDATE: Old morning routine - stumble around in the kitchen, tripping over the dogs' beds while I rinsed the coffee pot, dug out a filter and filled the basket with coffee, poured water into the coffee maker, and waited 10 minutes for the pot to brew.  NEW MORNING ROUTINE: Stumble into the kitchen (some things never change), drop a k-cup into the machine, put my coffee cup under the dispenser, and Nirvana pours from this lovely machine in under 30 seconds from heat up to fresh cup of coffee! And if I want a second cup? Pop in another k-cup and the magic happens all over again. This makes me ridiculously happy, and now I know why so many people love their Keurigs!<br />***<br />I bought my Keurig Officepro B145 from a vendor on ecrater for under $90. Was able to use paypal so I didn't have to give them a credit card. Came brand new in the box, with a variety box of k-cup coffees. I also registered it on the Keurig website, which entitled me to two FREE large boxes of coffees with the purchase of two large boxes.  This coffee maker is a dream come true! Set up was very simple. It did make a loud rumbling noise when I primed it by brewing a cup of water the first time. But by the time we popped in the first k-cup and hit brew, it was working fine.<br />Heats the water very quickly - from the time I turn on the power until it's ready to brew a cup is under five minutes. If I leave the power on, it takes maybe 20-30 seconds to brew a 10-oz. cup of coffee.<br /><br />This machine does not use the k-cup adapters - you need to get the solofill brand of adapters if you want to use your own coffee. If you worry about the impact of all that plastic on the environment, do like us. I rip the foil top off the used k-cups and dump the coffee into my compost pile. The plastic and foil go into the recycling.<br /><br />I just LOVE being able to simply pop a k-cup into the lid, hit brew, and 30 seconds later I have a cup of the most delicious and HOT coffee. No pot or filters to clean. Simple and simply delicious.
