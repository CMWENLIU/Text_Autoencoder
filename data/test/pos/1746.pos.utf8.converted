This is my first experience with specialty sea salts.  I thought, salt-was-salt, unless it was infused with my favorite flavoring ingredient, truffles.  Was I ever wrong! These finishing salts are guaranteed to elevate your meal to the highest level of---well, delectable.<br /><br />We couldn't wait to put this trio to the test. On their arrival, we immediately prepared some luscious grilled steak and veggies, tasting the finished products, first without the finishing salt, then experimenting with the different salts. We were truly amazed at the degree of flavor enhancement. The flavors simply popped! And, you actually are taking in less sodium with sea salts, so there is an added health benefit.<br /><br />This trio would make the ultimate holiday gift, or anytime hostess gift.  And, purchasing all three at once is a great opportunity to experiment and identify your favorite.  These are not small trial sized containers, either.  You will receive generous portions of each salt, and since such a small amount is required, I can see them lasting quite some time. You also needn't fear breakage, or spilling during delivery.  They were packaged carefully, and the containers are not glass.<br /><br />I found it fascinating to research each salt---the locations of origin, the harvesting and the mineral contents. This certainly would be an intellectual conversation starter, for any table with those unfamiliar. There are also endless recipes to be found spotlighting the product for guests---like an appetizer of hot, crusty bread, drizzled with olive oil, grated fresh Parmesan, and the Black Lava Salt. I've not tried that yet, but I sure will.<br /><br />The Fleur de Sel is a hand harvested product from France.  It is recommended for grilled fish, salads and crusty bread.  The Black Lava Salt is a product of Hawaii, recommended for sushi, grilled chicken, fish and steak.  And finally, the Alaea Sea Salt, also a product of Hawaii, is excellent on salads and grilled steaks (it certainly was on ours).<br /><br />Treat yourself, or a budding gourmet friend.  I can't really see anyone disappointed with the experience.  I know, I'm already counting the hours until supper preparation tomorrow. Guess you can see I'm having fun, here. Isn't that what life is all about.
