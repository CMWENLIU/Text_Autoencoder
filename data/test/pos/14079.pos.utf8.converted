According to the hype on the bag as well as the nutrition information, this whole grain is quite healthy.  I've been eating it for breakfast almost every day for several months, and it seems to get me off to a good start.  Since the millet itself doesn't have much flavor, I fill a large bowl with 95% millet, and 5% granola sprinkled on top (plus some ground flax seed); I then add milk.  I get granola with each bite, and it makes the whole bowl really quite tasty, without being overwhelmingly sweet.<br /><br />It's cheap, healthy and filling.  Just make sure you have plenty of pantry space, as you get twelve large bags with this order.
