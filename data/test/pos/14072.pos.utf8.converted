I ordered this plant from 9GreenBox and it came quickly.  When it arrived I opened the box to find a very healthy well rooted plant.  I have repotted this into a larger pot and it has already grown almost 2 inches since I received it about a month ago.  This is my second order from 9GreenBox and I plan on more in the future, I have had no problems with them and they have sent me exactly what I ordered and it came in the condition and size that the description showed.  5 Stars!!!!
