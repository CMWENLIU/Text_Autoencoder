I tried to find chewing gum at my local supermarket that did NOT contain aspartame, or some other man-made sugar substitute.  I never was able to.  I checked my local health food store and they sell Spry gum and Spry toothpaste.  The gum is just as good tasting as any major brand, and it doesn't hurt my stomach.  It doesn't become ultra sticky like major brand gum either, so I can give it to my 3-year-old and 1-year-old without worry.  The flavor doesn't last too long, but chewing it is good for your teeth, so I don't have a problem going through it quicker than major brand gum.  One of the best parts - it's cheaper than major brand gum.  I get a pack of 10 for $0.89 from my local food store.  The others cost $1.10 at the supermarket.<br />I also tried their toothpaste and I love it.  I use it everyday.  It's safe for my little ones too.  It says right on the label that there's nothing to worry about if the toothpaste is swallowed, because it is not harmful since the product is fluoride-free and all natural.  I highly recommend Spry products - especially for families.
