So, maybe a tea can't bring happiness, but this one certainly seems to add a little "lift" to my day. The ginger flavor is definitely present, but not overpowering and the lemon is a just-right level, too. Because it's a green tea, it brews nicely at a lower temperature, so it's nice for all the office hot water dispensers. Even when I forget the tea bag, this one doesn't seem to go bitter with the tanins common in other over-brewed greeen teas. I've never made a bitter cup of the Numi. All around wonderful flavored green tea!
