I bought some of this when placing an order with Fiona's Sweetshoppe.  I was hoping to find it locally, in a bricks and mortar store, but no such luck.  It has a distinctive flavor.  When I ordered it, I was expecting a different flavor and wasn't as keen on it, as I'd anticipated I would be.  Surprisingly, I have really come to crave it though... Yum - now if the company just didn't share the same name as our unethical governor here in WI...
