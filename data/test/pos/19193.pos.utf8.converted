I've tried a few flours (Bob's Red Mill, Pamela's, etc) and been ok with most of the results but it was never a first time success like the cookies we just made with Better Batter. They taste identical even though we changed the fat (from butter to palm shortening), milk (dairy to soy) and chocolate chips (diary free and 1/3 the size) as well as the flour.<br /><br />What I love even more than this flour is the company...seriously promise I don't work for them.  I called last week to find out more about purchasing at a discount (they have bulk discounts and greatly discounted auto ship options) and when I hung up the phone I had an entire page of notes.  They didn't just share options and help compare prices but they helped me better understand what changed were needed to recipes, come up with substitutions for going diary free (even explaining the controversy about palm shortening when offering it as a possibility), and really just help me know what to do to make it work best for me.  Later I got on their website to look at their recipes and discovered they not only post recipes but actively post within the comments to help others and answer questions.<br /><br />It is a crazy pricy flour when you're buying it a small bag at a time but they recently dropped their prices at their site and when you buy in a 25 pound bag it is much more affordable.<br /><br />CALL Better Batter if you have questions and I'd bet they'll really help!
