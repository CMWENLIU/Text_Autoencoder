Best Birthday Gift EVER!!!  Mom was born in late 30's so I figured that she'd remember candy from 5 yrs and up... so, I went with the 1940's box.  You should've seen her face... PRICELESS... She was so tickled, surprised and it was just sheer happiness remembering penny candy from her childhood.  There were only 2 items that she didn't recall, but she chalked it up to probably costing more than she could afford = 1 cent each.  So, she said anything over a penny she just didn't pay any attention to except for one item that was her favorite.  Her dad would give her extra money as a "splurge" so she could pay the 5 cents for each piece.  Guess what?  It was in this box ;-)  She LOVED it... and, she placed it up on her sofa table to just look at for a few days before eating.  THANKS so much for such a wonderful trip down memory lane.  She told stories about each kind of candy that she took out of the box.  She said it tasted good too.  This woman has everything.  I honestly didn't know what to get her.  For the price, I can't believe how much she enjoyed it.  Thanks for the fast delivery.  It arrived a few days before her birthday.  Thanks again... I will definitely purchase for other family members too!
