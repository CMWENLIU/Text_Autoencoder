Wow. Finally an organic white tea I totally LOVE!<br /><br />Firstly, this is so super-fresh and you don't get a weak cup of tea from one tea-bag (definitely no skimping in that department). I think the packaging of the tea-bags in individual plastic wraps rather than paper definitely help with the freshness factor.<br /><br />Secondly, this is super mild on your tummy even on an empty stomach. I can drink a cup of tea with a little honey while fasting and not feel ill.<br /><br />Thirdly, I can even drink this in the evening without getting caffeine jitters even though it does have a small amount of caffeine (admittedly, the characters in my dreams are a bit more energetic though, but, not too much as to startle me awake).<br /><br />Fourthly, this tea is very unassuming flavor-wise and can be easily blended with other teas to your personal liking.<br /><br />In udda woids, this is some really awesome tea!<br /><br />And, with that being said...<br /><br />Tasty tea to all and to all some tasty tea!
