I love pasta.  I love everything about pasta except the weight I've gained from pasta.  These noodles are a wonderful alternative to pasta.  You get a similar (not exactly the same) texture and you can use healthy sauces.  The noodles are little chewy/rubbery.  However, when I'm craving pasta and I know I shouldn't have any, the shirataki noodles are the best alternative.  These were a great find for me and my dietary needs/wants.<br />Note: you MUST rinse them.  I put them in a colander and rinse them for at least 10 minutes.
