I discovered this seasoning when I was in Bosnia about nine years ago and have used it ever since.  It's fantastic!  It works in just about every savory application that you can think of - soups, stews, on every type of meat, potato salads, spaghetti sauce.  I'm telling you - everything!  I even add it to my deviled eggs and people RAVE about them.  Try it!
