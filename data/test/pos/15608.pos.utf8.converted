Pepper and Nikki asked me to let you know how much we really enjoy munching on these gems.  They would do it themselves except their paws keep getting tangled in the keyboard.  People are asked often to rate dog products without any knowledge of the dogs' feelings about the food.  We eat these as our daily reward and are just delighted with the taste.  While they may be a little pricey they are fantastic.  We can spend the better part of a day munching on one off and on.  The best part of this pack is the size.  If you are not sure of your dogs appetite and taste you might consider the 6-pack so that in case your dogs are as picky as we are (we are Yorkies and you might know that we are really picky) and they do not like them you have not spent an arm and leg.  If your dogs do not like them just send them here and these honyocks will gobble them mui pronto.  Hope my ramblings were not too awful but you know that dogs are not to hep on this writing stuff.
