I received the case of this spice very timely and love the quality.  All I need to do is heat it up and add pepper and I have the start to not only a great dish but healthy nutrient as well ... heating activates it and adding pepper helps it cross the blood-brain barrier.  I add it to scrambled eggs, soups, fish, poultry, stir-fry, just about anything ... even oatmeal with my cinnamon and raw sugar or stevia.
