Compare the price per ounce before buying your Brazil nuts, this brand is less expensive,less packaging hype since you are buying what is inside the package and not some package appearance.<br />Other brands listed at Amazon are presumed to not taste any better since they all are imported from same sources anyways.<br />My advice buy this brand even though packaging looks alittle plain.
