I bought one of these and like it better than a standard scoop litter box.  I read the review from the person who puts the litter in the box without the sifter and then dumps it into the box with the sifter to separate the clean litter from the doo.  I tried this and it works better than the instructions that come with the box.  I bought a second one and it takes me about 3 minutes to clean both with only occasional use of a scoop to loosen debris.<br /><br />The elevated sides do not keep my cat from flinging litter everywhere.  I think she knows it frustrates me and that's why she does it.
