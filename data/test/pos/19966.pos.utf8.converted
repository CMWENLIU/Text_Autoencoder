my dog loves these and they are super healthy for dogs.  He eats them quickly but an average chewer might make them last a bit, he's a monster chewer.  I put them in a kong toy and make him get it out.  Much healthier than your average dog treat.  Yes they are lungs, I'm not eating it so it doesn't creep me out.  Also these are made in the US
