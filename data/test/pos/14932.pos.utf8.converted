I tried this honey after having stomach problems for several years. It happened every "change of season". I researched it, and Manuka Honey seemed to be benificial for treating pylori bacillus, which can cause stomach ulcers.<br />After taking a few tablespoons a day for about a week,--- no more discomfort which continues to this day. Manuka honey is also a natural antibiotic. Skin sores heal quickly. The Active 16+ seems to be the right strength for it's antibiotic properties. I feel a higher activity level would be a waste of money.<br />Both my husband and I, take a teaspoon before bedtime. He claims it makes for a more restful sleep.<br />Amazon's subscription feature is awesome. The rebate and free shipping for using this option, can't be beat. You can adjust your order as needed from month to month.<br />I would highly recommend this product and the subscription feature as well.<br />Terry Mare
