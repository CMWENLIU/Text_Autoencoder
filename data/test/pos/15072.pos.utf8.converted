I confess that I was once of those shoppers who picked up the store brand of maple syrup, because -- hey, what's the difference. Syrup is syrup, right?<br /><br />WRONG! Once you taste Shady Maple Farms Organic Maple Syrup, you'll toss those drippy, leaky, off-tasting supermarket syrups in the trash.<br /><br />Try a little of this on oatmeal, and you will be in heaven!
