I have a 9 month old baby girl and she is a very picky eater. Nestle Cerelac is a very popular brand in India and I was not able to find this in any of the Indian stores nearby. Accidentally, I found this in Amazon and since then meal time with my baby is fun. She enjoys this flavour very much and this is definitely better and nutritios than Gerber or Earth's best brands. I dont understand why Nestle has not entered this market in the USA, eventhough they market breast milk supplements like good start. My daughter would never eat the gerber brand cereals before and would be very fuzzy throughout the meal time. Cerelac is definitely a life saver.
