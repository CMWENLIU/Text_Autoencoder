We went to Costco the other day, and I grabbed a bag of these. They're wonderful! They have a sweet-tart taste, and a wonderful genuine cherry scent and flavor. I think if you reconstituted them, they'd make amazing cherry pie filling or jam. If you like the flavor of cherries, you have to try these.
