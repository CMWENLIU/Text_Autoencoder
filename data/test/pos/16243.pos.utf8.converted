This sauce is made with the hottest pepper in the world. It's named the Naga Jolokia but its' nickname is the Indian Ghost Pepper. I love spicy and I can handle things pretty hot but this sauce really surprised me. The taste is amazing. It's a very unique, heavy flavor that expands and keeps developing and changing in your mouth. Its just delicious. But the heat expands too. I've been putting a minuscule dash on my burgers and other things just to warm things up. So good but really, really, really, really hot.
