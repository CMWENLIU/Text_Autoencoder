I have dealt with the cholesterol issue like everyone else here. I'll do everything to avoid the Statin poison...fish oil, olive oil, little red meat, exercise, although I'm all of 110lbs, have to watch it, as I loose to much weight, then get grief for that!!<br /><br />OK here we go:<br /><br />My good (HDL) has always been pretty good - anywhere from<br />70 but down to unfortunately 57 in '08 but that's still pretty good<br /><br />2008 much to my horror on total and LDL<br /><br />Total Chol<br />UP to 232  (highest I've ever had!)<br />Naughty LDL<br />UP to 157  (highest I've ever had!)<br />Nice HDL<br />UP to 57  (NOT best I've had/was once 70)<br />Tryglycerides<br />DOWN to 92 (Best I've had in some time)<br />Sweet ol' Glucose  DOWN to 86 (best I've had for a while)<br /><br />So, found this BENECOL stuff!!  I have taken it for just maybe 3 weeks or slightly under - taking 2 with 2 meals<br /><br />2009 Much to my joy, today Nov 18<br /><br />Total Chol<br />dOWN TO 204 - CAN YOU BELIEVE IT??<br /><br />LDL...WAIT FOR IT<br />DOWN TO 122 - CAN YOU BELIEVE IT??<br /><br />HDL though<br />DOWN TO 53  (from 57 in '08)<br /><br />Tryglycerides<br />UP  TO 146  (from 92 in '08)<br /><br />Glucose<br />UP  TO 107  (from 86 in '08)<br /><br />So.....a little set back on a couple of readings, but HDL/TRYG still in range, the Glucose did not seem to bother my Dr. and his assistant immediately went to the Benecol website and announced that they did contain a lot of sugar and could have contributed.  I can deal with that, I can make other changes.<br /><br />Other than those couple of little glitches - I AM OVER THE MOON!<br />The Dr. seemed pretty impressed and didn't suggest the dreaded Statin - I will continue on with these Sweet Little Gems and see what happens - I'm almost looking forward to my next blood tests next year - I might demand them earlier!!<br />Give it a go if you haven't already, for this short period of time I've taken it, I just can't believe the drop in numbers!
