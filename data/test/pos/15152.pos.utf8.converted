My family has been using Dark Roast Community Coffee for over 10 years. We think there isn't a finer coffee on the market.  When we travel to Houston, we stock up, otherwise, we buy it online.  Community has other roasts besides Dark, but that is our preference.  We also like their Reserve Coffee - and the partnerships they have with coffee growing countries.
