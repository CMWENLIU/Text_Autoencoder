Wanted to thank for such a great product! It's absolutely delicious! Its consistency and taste proves that it has not been processed or diluted with sugar and water. If you compare it with processed honey that is sold in stores you would actually feel there is a raw taste to this brand. Processed honey has syrup-like taste and it stays liquid for a long time. If you are looking for raw honey, you have to know that it changes its color and consistency over time.<br />I have also noticed that no matter how much you can eat it, this honey does not make your stomach upset unlike processed store brands.<br /><br />In order for honey to be beneficial it has to be raw! There is no way it can deliver all its goodness to you if it's been processed! Honey is a wonder food! It has been scientifically proven to help heal wounds as it has antibacterial properties; to help restore healthy intestinal flora as it is a prebiotic; help recover from illnesses faster; help you sleep better; restore your nervous system after stressful events (try a cup of herbal tea with raw honey after a stressful day!) and even make your skin contain moisture. Raw unprocessed honey does not make your sugar spike if you are diabetic. But it absolutely has to be raw! If you buy processed honey you just waste your money, you can as well just buy some high fructose corn syrup....<br />Thank you for selling your honey raw! I wish one day people will be educated enough to avoid processed foods.
