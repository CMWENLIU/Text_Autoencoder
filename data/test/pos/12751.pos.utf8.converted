I was hoping to find a powdered version but settled with the tablets. We found that it was better to chew them down and let the granules melt on your tongue. After half of a tab was taken, we noticed a change in the taste of certain foods, but I think it might have taken a full tab to get the effect completely for some of the more intense foods.<br /><br />I have to admit that I don't like the resulting flavors. There's this kind of faux sweet, kind of nasty, artificial sweetener tinge to everything I tried and it left me feeling a little off, but I don't feel it was the product's fault or deficiency, so much as my personal tastes. Because of that, I rate the product with five stars because it did everything that was advertised. I only mention the distaste for its, um, taste, in case there is anyone else who feels ill from fake sugar flavors. The tabs don't actually have artificial sweeteners in them, but the taste effect they produce tastes (to me) reminiscent of foods seasoned with fake sugars. So sure, it's fun to try out a flavor trip, but unless you have serious designs to use this product for diabetic or dieting reasons, playing the 'taste game' hardly warrants the headache you get as you try to scrub the horrible memory of what balsamic vinegar chased with Equal tastes like from your tongue.<br /><br />Never... never... try balsamic vinegar on miracle fruit, even if you don't mind that Sweet'N Low flavor.<br /><br />So, the point is, if you can drink diet sodas, eat sugar free gum, and other artificial sugars without trouble, then the effect of foods on miracle fruit probably won't bother you. But if you're one of those people who can sense fake sugar in something a mile away and it gives you a major headache, then you might feel like me when I say 'weee, that was fun, but not really worth it.' and never try it again. It is fun to offer them to your guests though, and let them enjoy them, though.
