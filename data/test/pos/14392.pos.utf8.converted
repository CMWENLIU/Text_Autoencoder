We appreciate the conversation and realize there can be quite a variety of opinions on any food item based on the vast majority of palates and individuals' past experiences with foods.<br /><br />As a Downeast Maine company that has been producing Lobster Bisque from a local recipe since 1917, it is believed that the recipe, handed down from previous generations, was the most accurate rendition of this regional soup. This is not to say that it is the only recipe or the most popular in this genre of soup, as bisque originated in France and was handed down through immigrants who settled in the Canadian maritimes and then migrated to coastal Maine.<br /><br />The original recipe included the tomalley, or liver, of the lobster and provided a truly robust seafood flavor and a deep orange tone to the finished product. With concerns over mercury in seafood, the recipe has been modified in recent years and a larger quantity of minced lobster has replaced the tomalley. This along with a bit of paprika gives the soup its distinctively strong color. The recipe does not include any tomato products. As to the cream content, milk is an ingredient to create the true bisque texture, however, we intentionally leave the soup in a semi-condensed state to allow the customer to prepare the product to their liking. By adding a bit more milk or cream and a dash of sherry at the end of gently heating the bisque, true restaurant-quality lobster bisque can be achieved.<br /><br />This is one of our most popular soups and at over 20 annual international trade shows it receives rave reviews. Thought we realize we cannot please every palate, we believe the majority of our lobster bisque connoisseurs provide us the confirmation that we are making a high quality, great-tasting Lobster Bique.<br /><br />Bar Harbor Foods is now on Facebook, so please "Like" us if you enjoy our products and we appreciate hearing from all of our customers!<br /><br />~ Bar Harbor Foods
