I am 56 years old, a Lancastrian and a lifelong 'strong' tea drinker. I am also a former owner of two very decent restaurants and tea rooms in a popular tourist area in the UK.<br /><br />Being fussy about taste, preferring strong brews, but disliking bitterness, I had always considered Taylor's English Breakfast Tea to be my favourites among bagged teas. That is, until I discovered Punjana Irish Breakfast tea! At $3.50 for a box of 80 bags in a local overstock store (Big Lots), although I'd never heard of the brand, I figured it was worth taking a chance. I didn't expect anything special - I was simply stocking up on UK tea without paying the outrageous price typically charged here in Indiana for UK brands.<br /><br />From the very first pot I made, this tea has been a revelation! Whether by the cup or the pot, it brews VERY quickly (under two minutes suits my taste), with a rich tan color, with some orange brightness. When drinking, it exhibits no bitterness, even if steeped for more than twice that time - far beyond the point where Twinings and Taylors become bitter and wasted. I really only drink tea with 'milk,' (for tea I use almond milk unsweetened, not dairy, as I am vegan), but I tried this with fresh lemon and it was equally delicious. Fabulous taste indeed. I will be sure to stock up on Punjana now, whenever I find it - this is the best tea I have EVER tasted, by quite some margin. Buy some - you won't regret it.
