This is a great value over buying them in individual packages at the store.  The chews consistently taste fresh because they are packaged very well.  Wonderfully strong ginger flavor, and just sweet enough.  The soft, chewy texture is what really keeps me coming back... so good!  Their other flavors (spicy apple, peanut, and coffee) are also delicious!
