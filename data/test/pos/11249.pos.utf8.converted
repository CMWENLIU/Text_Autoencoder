For years I have been trying to simulate a truly Italian espresso or cappuccino without success.  Several packages arrived [...] just before Christmas.  My son had sent a Briel Cadiz Espresso machine, two lovely Russian china cups and a case of Espressione Classic Espresso Pods.  It was the kindest, most wonderful Christmas present I can remember.  The espresso machine excels in quality and ease of use.  The espresso is exquisite.  Each time I prepare an espresso or cappuccino I experience my son's loving kindness and a small part of the many gifts of Italy.  Heaven on Earth.
