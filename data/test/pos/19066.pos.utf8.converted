Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Vanilla creme filling between two vanilla wafers. The vanilla wafers are very light and crispy which goes well with the smooth vanilla creme. Vanilla bliss. More crumbly than the chocolate wafers. Kosher D from processing on shared equipment. 65 kcal per cookie. I put 2-4 cookies in zipper snack bags to make convenient portions. I save and reuse these snack bags for when I open the next "big" package. Easy to keep these fresh in an airtight cookie jar or gallon (4 ltr) ziplock bag. Wanted to also try this flavor because these cookies are such a great organic cookie value.
