I have been using this product for a year and a half with great appreciation.  It is lovely to have sugar in my coffee, and I make low carb jam with cranberries that is dynamite:<br /><br />RECIPE [ 1 pack cranberries, 1 c. erythritol, 1 cup water, ]3 whole cloves.  I boil this until all the berries have popped.  You could make it sweeter if you like.  A slight sugar crust forms on top.]<br /><br />There is a slight cooling effect which I NEVER notice.  I NEVER have gastric bloating, cramping or gas like other products.  It is good for your teeth.  It doesn't grow yeast.  It tastes great, no bitter after-taste.<br /><br />I make folks try it and they can't believe how good it its.<br /><br />It sure helps to make pies that I can eat during the holidays.<br /><br />And I have lost 120 lbs this year (NO surgery!). Emerald Forest also sells packets of erythritol to carry with you.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KNC18E">Emerald Forest Erythritol Packets 100ct Box</a><br /><br />I buy the Emerald Forest 5 lb bags which is the best price anywhere and buy several so I get free shipping.  This product is BETTER than xylitol which can give gastric symptoms and has way more calories.
