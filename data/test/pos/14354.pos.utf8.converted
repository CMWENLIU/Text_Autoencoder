When I first wrote this review, the product description had "Tibetan Plateau", "Tibet", and "Tibetan Goji Berries" all over the place. I'm glad to see it has been corrected just for the sake of consumer accuracy, although the product picture still shows "Tibetan Goji Berries" at the top.<br /><br />I think this is a great product - my wife and I both like the taste and will continue to buy. I have purchased several different products from Navitas and have never had an issue (other than the product description on this item when I first purchased).<br /><br />Don't buy into the marketing hype of a company that says their Goji berries are from the Tibetan Plateau. First off China has control of Tibet. So Tibet = China. Second the Tibetan plateau where all these berries were supposedly grown is too cold and too dry for a berry producing plant. Search it for yourself. All Goji and Wolfberry products are "Imported from China".
