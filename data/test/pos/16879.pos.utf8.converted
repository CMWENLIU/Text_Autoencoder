I have always loved All Sorts Licorice candy but found it difficult to find in stores. My daughter found it on your Web Site and gave it to me for Christmas. By January all 6 pounds + were gone and we ordered more. It freezes nicely so I sorted it into 10 packages. I'm being a little less greedy this time but, it's still going fast. You'll be hearing from me with another order soon.  Thanks for carrying this item.
