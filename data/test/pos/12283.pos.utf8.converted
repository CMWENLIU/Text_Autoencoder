I have been taking this pruduct now for a month, Before I was taking the Benacol Spread , That brought my Colesteral down from 278 to 244. But These are so much easier , Cause you can take them with you, I have to have my Colesteral taken in a couple weeks, Cause I can;t take statins, So I Just started taking 4 a day, My Doctor wants to see how these work,They have no side effects, And it is working.Thank You Benacol
