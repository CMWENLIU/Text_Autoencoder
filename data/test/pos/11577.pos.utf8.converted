I am glad to have found this source for rosehips tea. The tea is very good, authentic taste, what I was used in my childhood, clean, nice pieces. I drink it pure, let it steep for about 6-8 minutes. My friends think it tastes also very good with some honey. The residue is composted and my worms like it too;))<br />Can't praise it enough, recommend it to anybody who likes this kind of tea.<br />Pure product without the usual mix with hibiscus, will order it again and again.
