I've had at least one mole terrorizing my landscaping for about 8 months now.  I initially let him go, since he wasn't actually damaging plants.  In time, though, he'd separated enough roots from the soil that I nearly lost several plants, and my 20 ft crabapple was dropping half its leaves in June.  Something had to be done.  I'd read the reviews here early on, but decided to try some control methods that I could get locally.  This trap was not one of those.<br />I used three of the Victor harpoon-style mole traps, and managed to get them triggered successfully, but the mole escaped.  The design is simply flawed--in pushing the harpoon downward, the trap tends to force itself out of the ground.  To help prevent this, the trap has very long stakes that need to be driven into the ground... if you have much gravel in your soil, like I do, this is nearly impossible.<br />Several states' university extensions have tested the relatively new gummy-worm style baits with reasonable success, so I decided to try them.  Because my moles "highway" tunnels were right next to my house under plastic, I was able to peel back the plastic and drop them right into the tunnels (the plastic made up the roof of the tunnels).  I checked them each day for two days and my mole was actually eating them.  I had to leave town for a week, and when I got back there had been no new mole activity, which was not normal for my busy guy. I figure the gummy worms did him in.<br />Unfortunately, another mole invaded about 2 weeks later--completely different habits, though--this one preferred the lawn over the landscaping beds.  I'd ordered these traps the same day I placed the gummy worms, so I set three Out O'Sight traps per the instructions given by other reviewers (NOT THE ONES PROVIDED).  In three days I had my new mole.<br />One additional method of locating active tunnels that I like to use is to poke a stick through the top of an existing tunnel that you suspect might be a "highway".  Place a stone over the hole to block out the light.  Check under the stone daily--if the hole is filled in, the mole has passed through again.  Set your trap there.<br />Given the choice, I prefer these traps over the baits for two reasons--no poisons in your yard to accidentally get your neighbor's cat, and there's a little mole body to confirm that you actually got him.  Just be prepared--the little critters are actually kinda cute.<br /><br />Familiarize yourself with their habits, follow the instructions given by the others here, and be patient, and you'll have your moles.
