I've always been a fan of Bumble Bee tuna and easy meals on the go. But this is just brilliant. The tuna salad is great alone. The peaches and cookie are a nice touch to round out the meal. I've been looking for these for a while and have been difficult to track down. This is a good price compared to other sites. A meal to go under $3.00 is a good bargain. Delicious!
