We purchased two of these for gifts and both recipients are absolutely delighted.  One is my elderly father-in-law and he mentions it every time we talk to him on the pnone.  He is an avid gardener and the Aerogarden has given him a lovely winter crop of lettuce for the last 2 months and is still going strong.  He said it is easy to set up and is a subject of conversation when people come to visit.  The second purchase was at the request of my father-in-law for my niece.  She is also in a cold climate and the Aerogarden is a bright spot of green in her kitchen with a fine crop of herbs growing that she enjoys using in cooking.  She also has 2 small children who are getting an education in aero-hydroponic gardening.  I am hoping that my husband buys me one for my birthday.
