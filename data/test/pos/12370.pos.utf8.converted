I started baking cookies using this mix as a base (to replace flour) about a year ago and I'm addicted!  I took the basic cookie recipe I found on the Adkins website and added more nuts (6 cups of walnuts, pecans and macadamia) chopped up sugar-free dark chocolate, dried fruit (mango, coconut and tart cherries) and seasonings (cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg).  I use butter and peanut butter and splenda for sugar and added some rolled oats, flax seed and baking soda to the recipe.  I have stopped buying the bars and candy because I like these cookies so much better.  They're very delicious and satisfy my desire for something sweet but not too sweet.  It takes time but baking is so enjoyable and I make enough to last for 3 weeks at a time, then store in the fridge.  I also use this mix as a basis for pancakes.  I had to put it on an automatic order so I don't run out.
