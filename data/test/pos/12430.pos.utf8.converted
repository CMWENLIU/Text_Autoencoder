This is our favorite cereal by far. It has a good amount of fiber, but does not have that cardboard-like texture of some other cereals. The flakes don't get soggy and the oatmeal clusters and raisins are very tasty.  This is hard to find locally and the few stores that carry it are often sold out.  It was amazing to find that I can get it through Amazon, at a better price than we had been paying.  I ordered two to qualify for the free shipping, and they arrived earlier than I expected.
