I love my morning coffee but am sensitive to caffeine and must, sadly, limit intake of same. So I start each day with a cup (or two) (or three) of this, with or without cream or flavored creamer, and am happy. This is the best decaf K-cup coffee I've found - it's satisfying and rich, with no bitterness. Compared to my favorite caffeinated coffee, it's probably a three- or four-star product. But compared to the other decafs I've tried, it's definitely right there at the top of the list with five stars. I like it enough to buy it monthly via Amazon's subscribe-and-save, and will keep buying it for as long as I need decaf and it's available. Timothy got this one right.
