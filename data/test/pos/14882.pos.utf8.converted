My first run-in with this product was nothing short of amazing.<br /><br />I had finished up my Blair's Death Sauce, which I found to be very pleasant on eggs, so I decided to crack open this bottle.  Usually I do a small taste test first before using the product, but I figured it would be fairly similar to Death Sauce in taste and intensity.  So, like I did with Death Sauce, I put it on my eggs as if it were ketchup.<br /><br />Big mistake.<br /><br />With that first bite, I knew I was doomed.  My lips swelled up (I used a lot of it), my glasses fogged over, and I had trouble breathing.  I actually almost called 911 because I feared my throat was going to swell shut.<br /><br />Yes, it's that good.<br /><br />I don't use nearly as much now.  I learned my lesson.  My tongue was destroyed for weeks after that, and I'm amazed I actually didn't have to go to the hospital.  It is as hot as it is delicious, and I couldn't recommend this more ... unless, of course, the hottest thing you can handle is Tabasco.  In that case, steer clear.
