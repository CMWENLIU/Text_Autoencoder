I am not new to this product and I must say it's great!  I have celiac disease and it's super for anything you use regular flour for.  Toll House chocolate chip cookies (recipe on back of bag) are probably my favorite--they taste just like they were made with real flour.  Delivery was prompt and accurate. Anyone gluten free will agree using this flour beats mixing your own!
