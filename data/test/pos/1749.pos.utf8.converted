I always enjoyed the cinnamon chip scones at Starbucks but since they have gone "no transfats" I think all their scones taste odd. I never had them very often but once and a while, I still want a cinnamon scone. I happen to see this mix while looking for cinnamon chips on the Amazon site. The mix is very easy to prepare and the scones are delicious, a nice treat.
