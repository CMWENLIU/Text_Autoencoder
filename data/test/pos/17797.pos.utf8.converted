I love Kewpie Mayonnaise!!!<br />It just tastes much better than other brands!<br /><br />One of the secrets for the rich taste comes from how they use eggs.<br />Kewpie only uses the yellow (this concentrates the taste of eggs)<br />while American brands like Kraft use both the yellow and white (this weakens the taste of eggs).<br /><br />If you try Kewpie and compare it with other brands,<br />you can tell the difference between Kewpie and other brands.<br />You will realize that you can actually identify the taste of eggs with Kewpie.<br />This is by far the best mayonnaise in the world!!
