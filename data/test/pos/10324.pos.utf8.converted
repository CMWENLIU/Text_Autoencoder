I have been hooked on Starbucks Frappucinos for years - when they recently changed the formula I was so upset. I do not like the new taste. I tried McDonalds Frappe's but didn't like the taste as much. I figured my Frappe days were over and that I would just start drinking iced mochas.<br />When I came on Amazon a couple of weeks ago, I somehow ended up seeing that there were MOCAFE Frappe's you can make at home. I first was wondering if they would taste good, and then would they be hard to make? The 3 pound tin was on sale so I decided it would be worth a try. I am so glad I did!<br />All you have to do is put 16 oz of ice in a blender (measurements are right on the blender), add 4 oz of coffee, milk or water, and then 2 scoops of the powder. My first try I used 4 oz of coffee - it tasted really good but had a very strong coffee taste. The next one I used milk and it was perfect! The other day I ran out of milk and used water and it tasted the same as when I used milk, so I figured it is a great way to save 60 calories or so.<br />It costs $20 for the can, and it makes about 15 servings that are 16oz. With that in mind I realized I save $40 by not going to Starbucks and making my own - each can! Also no gas expense going to the mocha stand. I drink one a day so the savings really add up!<br />I highly recommend you give this a try.
