I've been taking my one-year-old jack russell/basenji pup to dog classes and thus train with him pretty regularly. I've been trying out all kinds of treats to train him with and this one, by far, takes the cake. I call these bully sticks my "magic wands" because I practically control his every movement with the stick until he gets it. My pup will do ANYTHING to get one! I started with the smaller order (10 sticks) because I wasn't sure if he'd like them, but I have no hesitation about ordering them in the largest bulk I can now. And to top it all off, they're mess-free, unlike many other chews out there.
