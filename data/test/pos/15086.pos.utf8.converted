I happened to pick a jar of this up at Trader Joe's and when I went to the check out to buy it, one of the ladies began to tell me some of the many benefits of coconut oil. I bought it to try on my dry skin. What I didn't know was that it has many benefits. She told me her mother in-law suffers from Alzheimer's and she takes it and it helps her memory. She also told me it's good in coffee, on toast, scrambled eggs and can be used instead of normal cooking oil.<br /><br />When I put it on my face, the very next day, amazingly, the pores on my nose were smaller and almost invisible and I have large pores on my nose! I don't know how it did that, but it did. It also helped on my dry skin areas. I put in on my hair and just rubbed it in and left it and the next day when I took a shower, my hair was very soft.<br /><br />There are many uses for coconut oil and using it on your skin is only one of the things. The average daily recommendation is three tablespoons, but you should work your way up to that and not start with three because your body won't be used to it. Coconut oil helps aid good cholestrol and can help with memory loss and it has a lot of other amazing properties. Using this simple, inexpensive oil can really help with a lot of common problems and it tastes and smells really good.
