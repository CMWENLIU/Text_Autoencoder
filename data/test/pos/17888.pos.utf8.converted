I've been hoping to find gluten free instant oatmeal and Glutenfreeda's Instant Oatmeal is the perfect answer.  It tastes and feels like non-GF instant oatmeal and it cooks like non-GF oatmeal. I am so pleased. I hardly ever ate oatmeal any more because other GF oatmeals took too long to prepare.  To have the option of buying it in large quantities in order to keep the cost down really sold me.  I'll be a repeat customer many times over.
