I just received the Salmon, the Duck and the Chicken strips.<br />Our JRT is very fussy and horribly spoiled.<br />She turns up her nose and walks away from many treats I've tried.<br />Most of the "organic" or "healthy" treats I've tried haven't won her over.<br /><br />She just had one each of the Salmon, Duck and Chicken and LOVED all of them!<br /><br />I'm thrilled that they are made in the US and contain ingredients I approve of.<br />Thank you Plato and Amazon!
