This is an excellent high quality food for any dog. Dogs can be perfectly healthy on a vegetarian diet, and this food is a great option for vegetarian owners, or for dogs with allergies or issues with meat. Two of our dogs have been eating this for a few years now, and they are perfectly healthy and love it! They have very soft and shiny coats, are full of energy, and have nice stools. They had very soft stools when they were on another vegetarian dog food brand. Willi (border collie mix) used to be quite picky with his food, we sometimes had to sprinkle something on it so he'd eat it, but not with this food! He eats it up right away. I just wish our french bulldog could also eat it, but she has some sort of food allergies to it.
