When I first bit into this chocolate-wrapped peanut butter creme-filled cake called a "Funny Bone," I was only 7 years old and lived in Middletown, N.Y.  I was hooked from the first package that I ate.  I wanted more, but as a child you're only allowed so much sugar (as is the correct way to raise a child to eat).  Now that I'm old enough to eat more without going super-hyper, I can't find them.  It's been hard looking for them in my previous home of North Carolina, and even harder trying to find them in my current home of Virginia.  The only way to buy a box now would be to pay almost $30 for it!?  It would be unacceptable to mark a less-than-$4 product up that high (w/shipping combined) if these cakes didn't taste so damn good.  Drake's, if you can read this, stop playing and start creating more distribution points to sell these delicious (and normally affordable) cakes to more than just the great people of New York.
