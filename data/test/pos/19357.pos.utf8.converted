I love this oatmeal because it has the most protein of any oatmeal out there. I love the cinnamon flavor best, tho the others are great if you like banana bread and maple sugar.  I just wanted to get the cinnamon individually and this company provided it. Has been discontinued, I hear, but it's coming back--yea, Quaker.
