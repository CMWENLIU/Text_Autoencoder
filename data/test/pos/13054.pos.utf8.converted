These are really the best dried strawberries you can get.  They have no added sugar but they are extremely sweet and everyone enjoys them.  They are perfect to add to cereal in the morning or simply to eat as a snack (although eating as a snack gets a little expensive).  I only wish they were a little cheaper as I could justify buying more, other than that, they are terrific dried strawberries.
