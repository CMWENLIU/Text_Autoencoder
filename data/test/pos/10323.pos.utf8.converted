These woodears are top quality. They come pre-shredded, making them easy to add to soups and stir-fries. They swell A LOT when rehydrated. The texture is wonderfully hearty, the flavor exceptional. This company, Fungus Amongus, produces the highest quality products across the board. I've purchased dried mushrooms from many other companies, but their quality is the best. Should you have any inquiries, they also respond in a timely fashion. Also highly recommend the truffle salt and dried porcinis............best ever!!
