I have been using different brands of soy shakes for 7 months now.  Started with Herbalife (expensive, no fiber and too much sugar, then used Wholefood's brand (not enough fiber and again too much sugar).  I then found this product which is just soy protein, nothing else.  Now it's easy to adjust the amount of protein ( 5 grams per tablespoon), fiber (I use benefiber powder), sugar (I add none but any non-nutritive sweetener would do), vitamins (I use a liquid multi [...]).  I blend it up with soy milk, some ice and fruit. Sometimes I add extracts from my baking cabinet to add variety.  Great product if you are trying to cut back on the sugar present in the "ready to mix" soy shakes and don't mind adding a few other ingredients to make it complete.
