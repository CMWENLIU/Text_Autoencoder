I originally bought the smaller size, but went for this huge set of four 2 lb cans this time.<br />They are the european version, manufactured in Holland, so I guess EU laws apply<br />ie slightly more humanely treated cows, and no rBGH etc.  Much tastier than the nonfat organic<br />dry milk available, and dissolves much easier than the Organic Valley organic milk.  Also did<br />not really want nonfat for babies.
