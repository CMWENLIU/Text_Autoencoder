I don't know what Nature Valley has done. They have made a product that I have no self-control over. I will literally have three bars in one sitting and then have to punish myself by taking an extra trip to the gym for cardio. I am amazed of how delicious a granola type bar could possibly taste. It is the perfect balance of sweet and salty, and the buttery, maple-ish coating is to die for. Everyone I know loves them and I have greed issues when people ask me for one. I like to hide them and deny I eat them in fear of an intervention!!
