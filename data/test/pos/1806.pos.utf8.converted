This is my favorite tdisc, I love it......I have tried every flavor and this one is the best.  I have been a Gevalia junkie for sometime but I like this even better than buying the grinds/beans for my ole coffee pot (which btw, I have not used since buying my "tazz")  I love this machine and when you are busy, 1 push of the button and you have  perfect cup of coffee.  If you are a tea drinker try the Earl Grey, I don't drink much tea, but this tdisc is awesome, very full flavored very yummy.
