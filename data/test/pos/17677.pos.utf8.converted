Nutiva organic hempseeds are great in my morning smoothies along with flax, chia seeds, almond milk, Boku superfood, rice powder, fruits.  Delicious/nutritious way to start the day....and sustaining energy!  Years ago, i started buying hempseeds by one pound amounts from a bulk section and realized the air exposure may not be good to the product, so i found these 3# bags online....i get them auto-shipped and can be sure i never run out.  They arrive fresh every time....in addition, this is helping support the Hemp industry in general....by buying food, clothing, personal care products made from Hemp, we are voting!
