I have to say this is the best canned soup I have ever eaten. The fact that it is organic with no yucky processed stuff makes me even happier. You don't have to season this soup, at least I don't, it tastes great just heated out of the can. It flies off the organic foods shelf at my local grocery and this 12 pack is the only way to keep it in the pantry. I seldom find anything I am this happy about so try it you will love it!
