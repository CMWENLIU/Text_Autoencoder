Rodelle is my favorite vanilla ever! My grocery store must think that the only time people bake is at Christmas time, since that seems to be the only time they stock Rodelle vanilla. I can't imagine baking without it though and am so glad that I can order it here when I need to restock! And don't forget to check out the Vanilla beans!!
