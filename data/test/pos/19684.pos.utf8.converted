Crunchies are the absolute best candy bars.  Why they are not sold in the US is very puzzling to me.  With all the crap candy bars here in the states, it seems like Crunchie Bars would 'clean up'.  I'd never buy any other candy, except maybe Jaffas, another Cadbury product not sold in the US (I buy them in New Zealand).  Hey Cadbury, wake up, hellllooooooooooo  Are you there?  Anybody home???????????????  Please sell us your good candy here in the US, OK??
