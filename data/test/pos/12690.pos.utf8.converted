These chocolates are much better than 5 stars!<br /><br />We found a Leonidas' Shop during a visit to Brussels, Belgium earlier this year and brought home 4 of the "kilo" Assortment Ballotins.  I was ready to call directly to Brussels to place an order for more, but found them in New York City, so.........no need to search further.<br /><br />The quality is outstanding and as other have already stated, far superior to other brands and MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE.<br /><br />The shipment arrives overnight and each ballotin is protected in it's own styrofoam case.<br /><br />Try an assortment (the dark is unbelievably decadent) and you will not be disappointed!<br /><br />Enjoy
