Been chomping a lot on these yummy flax crackers lately... and they are really good aside from being good for you.  The only carbs in these are soluble fiber from the flax, which is soaked and then lo-temp dehydrated along with veggies and sea salt to form the final cracker.<br /><br />This flavour (Mexican Harvest) is the best I've tried so far... I've also tried the Italian, and that is far more subtle.  The texture is very crunchy and dry... it's good to drink a lot more water when eating these.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these crackers again, will get more Mexican and try the Maple next time as well.  Health-wise and taste-wise, can't beat 'em.
