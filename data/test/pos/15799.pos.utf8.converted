I grew up in the Caribbean (Trinidad) drinking coconut water often.  As a kid we'd look forward to going for a walk around the park where pickup trucks would be parked loaded with coconuts sitting on ice.  They'd slice off the top for you and give you a straw.  I now live in the US and thought I'd never taste that again.  That is... until I stumbled across A&B Coconut juice with pulp.<br /><br />Let me tell you... I've had all kinds of coconut juice in cans from the grocery store and online.  None of them ever really tasted like the real deal, but it was close enough to make me buy more every once in a while.<br /><br />BUT, A&B coconut juice with pulp IS the real deal people.  I swear the first time I opened a can, I stopped, looked at the can and said "OMG!  This tastes like a real coconut!"  Needless to say, I was hooked.  Got my fiance hooked.  Told him we need a separate A&B line item in the budget now.<br /><br />There's nothing like a cold A&B coconut juice with pulp after a workout in the morning.  Or with lunch.... or winding down for the night.  Hey, what can I say, I'm addicted.<br /><br />A&B, if you ever change the taste of this thing, I'll hunt you down!  LOL!  And folks, if you're looking for the real deal in coconut water (with NO sugar added!), I promise you THIS IS IT.  And I grew up in the Caribbean so I know when I hit the jackpot with the real coconut water taste.<br /><br />Now I do have to say that the one without pulp did not taste as much like a real coconut as the one with pulp did.  So get the one with pulp.  Caution - you may just get hooked.  Look for space in your budget to accommodate this new (and very healthy!!) habit.<br /><br />By the way, do an internet search for the nutritional value and benefits of coconut water. You won't be disappointed.  And to have it taste THIS good?  Wow!  I'd bet if you did a taste test between this and coconut juice straight out of a coconut, you won't be able to tell the difference.  I'm telling you, it's THAT good.<br /><br />I don't know how you pulled this off in a can A&B but THANK YOU!!
