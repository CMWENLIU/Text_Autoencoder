Living overseas makes it difficult to buy gifts for my family in the states.  After sending my parents various items I decided this Christmas to purchase this item for them. I could hardly wait to hear their reaction.  They were thrilled and overwhelmed with the quality and quantity.  They continue to rave about it.  I am buying one for my sister.
