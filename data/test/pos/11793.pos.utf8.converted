This is the original cheese that I liked as a kid. The Swiss gruyere or gretzer is a bit harder and less fragrant, I think. The French do great justice to this cheese, and it is versatile beyond calculation. Not only good alone on bread with an apple on the side, it is great in Fondue and superlative as a topping for cauliflower au gratin or any au gratin.
