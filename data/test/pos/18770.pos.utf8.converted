I got into various oolong teas from a great New York importer. They really know their teas!<br /><br />But this year, the Numi Ti Kuan Yin is available at quality and price that bests the experienced importer. I dunno, maybe they got lucky at an auction or somthing. But we've been enjoying this tea!<br /><br />You can spend 3 times as much and get better tea. But then it's too expensive to drink every day. Buy this!
