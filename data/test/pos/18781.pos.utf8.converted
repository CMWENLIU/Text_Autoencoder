The best cookies ever! I ordered them directly from the cookie company Joey's in New Jersey the second time, and saved a bundle of money. Cookies are of a cake-like consistency with chocolate icing on one half, vanilla on the other. Eat more than three of these large cookies at one sitting, and you might feel sick from the sugary rich ingredients! Far better tasting than Entenmann's you find at the grocery store! Highly recommend these cookies as gifts!
