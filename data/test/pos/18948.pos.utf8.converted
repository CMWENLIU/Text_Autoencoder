I was just two pounds shy of my Weight Watchers goal when I fell off the weight loss wagon and gained four additional pounds.  Life was busy, and I wanted a fuss-free way to lose those last pounds before swimsuit season.  Since I enjoy Special K products, I thought I'd put the Special K 2-Week Weight Loss Challenge to the test.  I ate Special K cereal for two meals, snacked on fruits and veggies (instead of the recommend Special K snack products) and made healthy dinner choices.  I didn't expect to lose 6 pounds as advertised, since my weight loss had slowed from months of dieting and I was near my goal weight.  To my surprise, I lost 6 pounds and have finally reached my goal weight!<br /><br />ABOUT THE DIET:<br /><br />It's convenient and doesn't require much planning.  However, it could get a little boring in the long run.  It could also be difficult to meet daily nutritional requirements.  Also, rapid weight loss could be difficult to maintain in the long run.  If you've been dieting and just can't lose those last few pounds, or if you need to lose a few pounds fast for a big event, give Special K a try.<br /><br />ABOUT THE CEREAL:<br /><br />One can usually find a box of Special K in my kitchen cabinet.  Most often, it is the Red Berries variety.  I enjoy the Fruit and Yogurt flavor, as well, but the serving size is 1/4 cup less.  The original flavor is also nice from time to time, but the Chocolatey Delight is just not a good idea, in my opinion.  But back to the Red Berries.  The cereal consists of the usual Special K flakes with dehydrated strawberries.  Once I pour on my Silk Light soy milk, the berries plump up to add lots of real strawberry flavor.  There are generous amounts of berries and the flakes stay crispy in milk.  All in all, this is an excellent cereal that I highly recommend.
