When you buy Natural Balance (Dick Van Patten's Brand from "Eight is Enough" -- who knew) you will discover that you are paying more than your regular Friskies, 9-Lives or regular store available brands.  In fact, sometimes this brand is hard to find ... but it's worth every penny.<br /><br />Our cats enjoy a mixture of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008VKBEQ">Wellness Healthy Weight Formula Dry Cat Food</a> and Natural Balance wet food.  I use the Indoor formula because they are indoor cats.  Our cats love this formula and chow it down like happy campers.  Their fur is soft as can be, their eyes are bright and they are in great health.<br /><br />You need to understand that in the world of cat food like so many other things, you really get what you pay for.  You will either spend more money on food, or eventually more money on litter materials because feeding a cat regular store bought food with a lot of "corn meal" filler creates the smelliest, and fullest litter box around.  Time has taught me this.<br /><br />Once you begin to understand that all cat foods are not created equal and where there is "corn meal" filler in the ingredient list (cheap for manufacturers and smelly for the household), you will have more cat waste and more litter to have to scoop and buy.<br /><br />With good foods like Natural Balance (if your cat tolerates it well), you will discover less cat "poop" in the litter box and a LOT less smell around the house.  Put good stuff in your cat, get more pleasant outcomes :)<br /><br />I've lived it and learned it.  We are a 5 cat household with ONE litterbox and do amazingly fine.  I use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUIP9Y">Nature's Logic Ponderosa Pine Cat Litter</a> and this keeps odors to an absolute minumum.  Some people wonder if we have cats!  I change our box twice a week.<br /><br />Good stuff in, good stuff out = happy cats and happy owners.
