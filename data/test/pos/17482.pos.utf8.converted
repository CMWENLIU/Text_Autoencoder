I used this apple butter in a few cake, granola and chicken recipes. My cakes came out nice and moist, my granola bars were delicious and my family loved this on chicken. I pounded chicken breasts very thin and coated them in apple butter and then rolled them in bread crumbs. I baked them for a half hour at 350 degrees. Delicious. This is a great natural apple butter with no high fructose corn syrup. I highly recommend it!
