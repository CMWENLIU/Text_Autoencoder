These are awesome.  Not knowing that this product existed, I've been trying to make my own ad-hoc pill pockets with wet cat food.  When the food is too soft, my cat licks it right off the pill.  When the food is too firm, my cat has figured out how to crumble it apart to leave the pill in the bowl.  But this product is perfect.  The material is pliable (almost like chicken flavored Play-Doh) but won't allow cats to lick it away or crumble it apart.  In fact, while he eats it, I've been listening for the "crunch" that indicates that he bit into the bitter pill, but so far he's been swallowing it silently and whole, so it seems like the softness makes him believe he doesn't have to chew it - this is great, since he has no idea what's inside.  Now my cat begs me for his "treat" each day, even though he's a really picky eater and has turned down other new cat treats numerous times in the past.  I was a bit shocked at the price, but I was at my wits end trying to pill my cat, so I am willing to pay for the peace of mind.
