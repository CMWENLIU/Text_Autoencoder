Do not make the mistake of ordering any other type of tea.  This is by far the best tea on this earth.  It will blow away any other tea brand that you could buy in the supermarket.  My wife and I are from the Northeast, and are lucky to live with a high population of Irish tea drinkers, so our supermarket stocks this product.  We can purchase Barry's when we need it.  If, on occasion, they are out of stock I will order this product on line.  If you are not fortunate enough to have a store close by, do not hesitate to purchase this product.  It is smooth, delicious, and you will want to squeeze every last drop from the bag.  Awesome!<br /><br />PS Great iced tea too.
