I am a dark-roast coffee drinker who appreciates beans that have been roasted according to generally accepted standards (nonetheless mindful of conflicting definitions of exactly what constitutes say, French v. Italian roast, from one area to another). Apart from very well-known, and might I add expensive, whole-bean coffees sold at Amazon that I have purchased, Coffee Bean Direct Italian Roast Espresso is the first that I have purchased that is, in fact, a true Italian roast. The beans, characteristically, are almost black and are glossy with a pronounced oily surface - as they should be. I brew these beans as "regular" coffee as well as Espresso and find that, in either case, they present me the precise dark-roast flavor that I seek. I must admit that my palate, whose acuity is mollified by Balkan pipe tobacco, cannot adequately distinguish the subtle differences amongst different varieties of beans. As a consequence, my singular focus is on the precision of the roasting. Coffee Bean Direct Italian Roast Espresso is spot on in that regard, producing an exquisite cup of coffee - if one prefers a very dark roast. Finally, at a little over $5 per pound, I dare say one is not likely to find a superior, similar roast, at twice the cost. At $27 for a five pound bag (and free shipping), I believe few would be disappointed with this roast as is. Furthermore, one could use this roast, blending it with "common" coffees found on local grocers' shelves to add body - and flavor. Well done, Amazon!
