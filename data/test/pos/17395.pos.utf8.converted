I have been using this product for about a month now for my dogs. It was recommended to me by a friend to help ease my dog's digestive troubles and ear problems. I give one teaspoon of coconut oil to 10 Lbs of body weight and it has done wonders for my dogs (warning if you use any type of coconut oil, start adding it slowly and over a long period of time otherwise the dog will have diarrea). my dog's digestive problems have gone away completly, her coat is so soft and shiny and her ear problems have gone away. I noticed a big improvement in her ears using the coconut oil as a digestive supplement but I also swab a small amount in her ears every week-it is anti fungal and anti bacterial. She used to have chronic ear infections and her ears are perfect now. Also the coconut oil helped to take away the "doggie" odor from her skin. I highly recommend this product. It shipped quickly, it has a great price and is very easy to use.
