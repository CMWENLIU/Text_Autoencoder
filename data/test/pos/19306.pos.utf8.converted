My dog is very picky to the extent that she will not eat anything if she doesn't like the food.  Then, of course. her hunger drives her to scrounge for food.  We lost a Thanksgiving turkey once...but that is another story.<br /><br />Anyway, she took to this food immediately and cleaned her bowl.  She is in good, trim shape, too.<br /><br />If your dog likes it, the food has awesome ingredients and is affordable, AND Amazon delivers it to your door, what more can a good owner need?
