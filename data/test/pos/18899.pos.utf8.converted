I don't like premade soups or powdered soups, but I found this at a local store on sale and I needed emergency food for the pantry. Running low on time this evening, I pulled this out of the pantry and hoped for the best.<br /><br />This soup was wonderful, beyond belief. I was stunned. Everyone loved it. Even my S.O. who hates peas, slurped down a large bowl of this stuff.<br /><br />After you get the water boiling, it only takes 15 minutes. The soup is thick and rich with an awesome sicilian flavor. This stuff tastes better than my homemade pea soup that I slave over.<br /><br />We enjoyed it so much, I'm now ordering a bunch from Amazon. Even the grocery store sale price isn't as good as the Amazon price. I'm thrilled to see it here.
