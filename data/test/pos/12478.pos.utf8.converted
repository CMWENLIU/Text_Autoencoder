I used to buy Lactose-free milk from the Supermarket and I can't handle the 'hard stuff'. I had tried Soy milk before but it was like drinking chalk mixed with water. What 'turned me' was Trader Joe's Original Soy milk which is just a perfect milk substitute; but they only sold it in 1/2 quart containers and the store was miles out of my way. Anyway, long story short I picked up a can of this stuff.<br />It's teriffic! Very easy to mix...can even do it with a spoon in a glass of water. Has a great taste and best of all it's a powder so it keeps pretty much forever. I'm trying to live more healthily and this stuff makes the pefect base for my morning smoothie, tastes exactly the same as when I made it using milk, even works ouit cheaper (and higher in protein...well, a bit).
