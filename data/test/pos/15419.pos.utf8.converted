If you follow the instructions on cooking boba/tapioca/bubble tea, the consistency and taste is amazing. The only downside is that the pearls tend to crumble in the bag and are generally fragile before they begin to cook and darken. Also, if the water is not hot enough in the beginning, you get the same problem of the pearls dissolving and things getting a bit messy and/or sticky. If you are patient and dedicated, these are the best choice, but if you want a simpler alternative, try the black minute pearls instead. Less delicate, easy to make, and just as tasty in the end, they are a lovely alternative. It's your choice, though. Either way, boba/tapioca pearls are a deliciously addictive addition to most iced drinks, especially milk teas, but also quite a few juices.<br /><br />As for the quantity, unless you own a store that makes boba, this would be too much, especially considering the crumbling that happens at the bottom of the bag. By the weight alone, you'll be left with a lot of powder in the bottom, especially if you handle it often.
