I'm not a connoisseur of fine teas.  But, I do enjoy my tea, and gunpowder green has been a favorite of mine.  A big problem, though, is trying to find it.  There is a tea store near by that is very expensive.  If you buy 2 oz or more, it's $4.00 an oz.  Too expensive.  I finally found a couple of health food stores where it ranges in price from about 70 to 85 cents an oz, but it is such a hassle to drive there; and too many times they're out.  I've found it on-line, but the shipping costs haven't made it such a good deal.<br /><br />Well, with the "subscription" purchase, this is a great deal.  It's cheaper than anywhere I've found it, at $10.20 a pound or less than 64 cents an oz.  And I love that 48 hrs after placing the order, the post office delivered it to my house.<br /><br />So, the big test, then, is how is the tea?  Well, like I said, I'm not a connoisseur, but I do enjoy Davidson's Gunpowder Green.  It's as good as any that I've bought.  Since the stores where I have been buying it are anywhere from 10 to 25 miles away, and not even near anywhere I normally go, I can say that I have found my new source for tea.  I would recommend it if you're looking for a great deal on a very good tea.
