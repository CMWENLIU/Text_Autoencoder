If your taste runs to dark chocolate without filling, then this is the bar for you.  It has a rich very "cacao" flavour with a nice snap and smooth  mouth feel. There's also  slight notes of fruitiness.<br /><br />This would actually be good for those on a diet. The flavour is so rich, intense and satisfying, that I can only eat a little at a time, whereas I can (and have) easily consume a entire milk chocolate bar in a manner of mere minutes.<br /><br />And, on that note- dark chocolate actually has health benefits!
