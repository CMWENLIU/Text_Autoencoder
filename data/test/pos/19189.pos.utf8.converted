Since my daughter was diagnosed with celiac disease 8 months ago I have tried so many different flour blends - both the kind I purchase pre-made and many I have made myself following various recipe blends. There is NO COMPARISON.  This flour is by far the best I have used.  I have recreated my old gluten containing recipes using the flour as the substitute and recipes come out perfectly.  I thought I would never be able to do that again!  Importantly, I find the my recipes using this flour are moist whereas with everything else I've tried, the recipes didn't have the same moistness, they were often very dry.  I have had friends and family who eat gluten eat recipes I've made with this flour comment that they would have had no idea that the recipe was gluten free if I hadn't told them.  It is so nice to not have to try to mix flours to come up with the right combo.  I use this flour exclusively for any recipe that I'm converting from gluten containing to gluten free.
