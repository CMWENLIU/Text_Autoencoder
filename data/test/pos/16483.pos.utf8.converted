Lord help me Jesus this could be my undoing! I can't make a jar last more than 3 days. I like it cold, straight up, on a spoon, no bread. I make myself put it back on the shelf at the grocery store, I try to avoid that isle, I win the battle 2 maybe 3 times and then I relapse. I console myself by noting that it has less sugar and fat than regular peanut butter, no hydrogenated oils. And doesn't dark chocolate have antioxidants in it? Everybody does it once in a while, right?
