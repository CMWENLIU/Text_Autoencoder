The Rapunzel Organic Dark Chocolate with Almonds Bars are my absolute favorite chocolate.  While not as high in antioxidants as a 70%+ dark chocolate, 55% cocoa is still much richer than a milk chocolate.  Rather than being creamy, the bars have a firm texture.  Being 55% cocoa, they have a strong chocolate taste without being bitter.<br /><br />Just looking at them, the bars seem to be about 1/4 to 1/3 almonds by volume and about 3/4 to 2/3 chocolate by volume.  The almonds are a tad larger than the almond slivers (not the thin slices) that you would buy in the store.  This is much better than having GIANT whole almonds sticking out of the chocolate like some brands.  You are guaranteed to taste almonds in every bite.<br /><br />The absolute best part about these bars is that they do not contain soy, dairy or wheat as ingredients. It is fairly easy to find chocolate without wheat, pretty hard to find chocolate without dairy, and almost impossible to find chocolate without Soy Lechithin in it. To find chocolate with none of those three is extraordinarily rare. And it tastes great!! So the Rapunzel Chocolate practically qualifies as a miracle.<br /><br />I also recommend the Rapunzel 70% Dark Chocolate for a change of flavor.
