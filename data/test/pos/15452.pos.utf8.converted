I have been baking with yeast for more than 25 years. I have tried other brands, but Red Star is by far the best one I have ever used. I don't use anything else. Use to buy it in the little packets at the grocery store, but they are way to expensive. I found it in a 1 lb package from a popular baking company and have been ordering it through them for many years. However the price of the shipping was almost as much as the yeast, but it was still cheaper then buying it in the packets. I was thrilled to see it on Amazon and to realize I could get two lbs for what I was paying for one and no shipping cost.<br /><br />Since it is such a large quantity I store it in the freezer and it last until I run out. No problems with dead yeast unless I kill it by making the liquid to hot. I would highly recommend  purchasing Red Star.<br /><br />I have read some reviews saying you can get it at some of the warehouse stores for less. I have never seen it in ours and not everyone has a membership or a warehouse near by. So if you like to bake with yeast this is a great deal.
