Mrs Balls is a South African staple. It's not only one of the best chutney's I've ever eaten with curry but it does double duty as a sweet/sour sauce or dip, turns regular old cheese sandwiches into a teatime delicacy and goes wonderfully with deli meats. We go through huge amounts of the stuff (as I imagine most south africans do) and I always take particular pleasure in introducing my american friends to its yumminess.<br /><br />Highly recommended by this particular ex-pat.
