Here's the real deal, best darn chili in the world!<br />I've lived in four different states and visited another 40, and each place I've visited I've tried their chili.<br /><br />"Wolf Brand Chili" is the best chili to be found, and should be in every kitchen. It's got a thick hearty body, full taste made for a real western fan, infact "Wolf Brand" is as western as John Wayne and Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />I don't care if your driving a cab in New York City, or cutting trees in the South Carolina pines you deserve to give yourself the best of the best.<br />So listen to a Texan who knows his chili, "You've got an empty kitchen if you don't have at least one can of Wolf Brand Chili."
