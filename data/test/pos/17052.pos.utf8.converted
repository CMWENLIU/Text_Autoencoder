Vegan. Organic. Raw. Economical 'refill' or family size. Great on vegan waffles and desserts. Cut or break your favorite vegan energy bar or dark chocolate bar into bite size pieces, add optional raspberries, blueberries or strawberry slices, arrange on a side plate, and swirl agave syrup for a beautiful vegan dessert with a great presentation.  Raw agave is a an alternative to high temp maple syrups. Organic natural alternative to processed corn syrups. Great flavor and consistency. Fantastic vegan substitute for honey. Great for tea.
