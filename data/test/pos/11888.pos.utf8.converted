Knowing I can never eat real matzah again really troubles me. No matzah balls, no fried matzah, no charoset/horseradish sammich. So I was ecstatic to find this at my local grocery store for only $3.99 a box.<br /><br />It doesn't taste like matzah. I think it actually tastes better...a bit potatoey, like Baked Lays, but hard and crispy. I used it to make matzah buttercrunch and it performed quite admirably. I've heard that it makes good fried matzah as well.<br />Great product. If you're Jewish and can't eat wheat matzah, buy this by the case.
