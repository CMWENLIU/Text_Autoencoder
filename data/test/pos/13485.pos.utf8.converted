I used one of these beans to make some fresh vanilla ice cream last Monday night.  The recipe came from Season #1 of "Good Eats", Churn Baby Churn.  2 cups of half & half, 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup sugar, a little pure fruit pectan, and one of these beans.  Heat the cream to 170 degrees, mix in your other ingredients well, then kill the heat.  You now have "ice cream batter".  Pour the batter in a sealed container, and place the container in the Frig for 6 hours.  After 6 hours, get out your ice cream maker and churn for about 30-35 minutes.  I find longer is better.<br /><br />Alton Brown put up a little notification prior to a commercial break stating that Madagascar beans are the most sought-after despite the fact that the Mexican beans are more flavorful. Regrettably, the only source of vanilla beans in my hood is Williams-Sonoma, and they only carry the Madagascar beans.  Those do make for a delicious vanilla ice cream, but I didn't want to pass on the opportunity for more flavor.  I decided to test Alton's claim by ordering some these beans.<br /><br />The results are pretty sensational.  I pretty much mopped up the floor with some house guests last.  They loved the beef bourguignon and the Paella I made, but the vanilla ice cream afterward knocked 'em dead.  Let's just say they were flabbergasted.<br /><br />Make some vanilla ice cream.  You will like the results.<br /><br />Is Alton correct about Mexican v Madagascar beans?  I don't know about that.  I think the Mexican bean is the far more familiar flavor.  If you are an American, you grew up on the flavor of the Mexican vanilla beans.  This flavor has the home field advantage.  The Madagascar bean is more exotic.  It has a coffee-vanilla kind of flavor.  I like them both.  I think I will cut half a Madagascar and half a Mexican bean on my next batch, and see what the combined flavor is like.
