I was afraid that my yeast was already dead, because the bread didn't seem to be rising very much.  I added a very ripe banana to the mix, and I left the bread on top of the oven while the oven was preheating.  It took awhile for it to rise, so then I opened the oven door.  Within an hour the dough rose beautifully and the bread was delicious.  I was so happy to have gluten free bread that actually had some flavor.
