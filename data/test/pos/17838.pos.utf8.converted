First of all lets clear one thing up, "these are NOT Whoppers" Whoppers are chocolate-coated malted milk balls produced by The Hershey Company, and are horrible, like most Hershey chocolate.<br />  "Maltesers", are manufactured by Mars, Inc. (who make excellent chocolate) and consist of a spherical malt honeycomb centre, surrounded by smooth milk chocolate. Very popular in UK since the 1930s These are my kids favorites (and mine) when we can get them.<br />  Try some this Christmas!
