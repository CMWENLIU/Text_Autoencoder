Well it's not made from fraises des bois at all!  Little Scarlet seems to be a specific variety of fruit that they grow only at Tiptree.<br /><br />This must be the most expensive preserve I've ever tried and it's way, way ahead of anything else I know of.  You can see the tiny individual berries suspended in a rich red jelly before you even open the jar.<br /><br />Under the lid, mine said "Peter Wilkin, chairman, is the great grandson of the founder".  Aren't family businesses just wonderful?<br /><br />I tried Little Scarlet with fresh croissants and it was quite simply the best!
