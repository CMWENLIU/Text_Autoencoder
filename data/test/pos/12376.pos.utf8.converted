There is no such thing as a bad Nutter Butter, DC. Even stale. Even wet. Even in crumb form. From the fine peanut form, to the oh-so-creamy and delectably sweet/salty center, to the vintage advertising (who doesn't want yet another Nutter Butter Peanut Butter Sandwich cookie?), the only other competition in the field is Oreos. And only if you replace the chocolate cookie with a peanut butter one. And the disgusting white stuff with peanut butter. And change the boring circular shape to something more reminiscent of an infinity symbol.
