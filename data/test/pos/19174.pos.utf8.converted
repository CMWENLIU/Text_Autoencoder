This is the real thing, folks -- oatmeal as it should be. If you watch "Good Eats" on the Food Network, you've seen Alton Brown praise steel-cut oats and dis rolled oats (the "Quaker Oatmeal" stuff). I personally love rolled oats, but if you don't, don't let that stop you from buying the McCann's. The texture, the taste, the "oomph" are nothing like your ordinary breakfast oats. Where rolled Quaker oats are a bit slippery and thin, these steel-cut oats are much firmer with a lot more tooth and a much heartier, nuttier flavor.<br /><br />Be aware that you have to invest a little time to cook this cereal -- half an hour on the stovetop. Or try boiling the water the previous night, turning off the heat, and then putting the oats in to sit overnight. Then finish cooking them in the morning for 10 minutes or so. There are other shortcuts, too -- try a Google search. Whichever way you try, you may be spoiled for other hot cereals forever.
