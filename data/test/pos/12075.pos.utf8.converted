I love cashews.  Watch out around the kids, a lot of kids are developing nut allergies these days so be careful.  But, if everyone's cool with the nuts, check out the Libman salad:<br /><br />You take some baby spinach or whatever greens you are into, 5 or 6 cups worth, and whatever else you like to throw in a salad, l'il bitty slices of celery, some carrots, cucumbers...  I'd throw in some sliced green onion and some sesame seeds too, but your call.<br /><br />Then, you throw in the honey roasted cashews.  You can even go with half a cup or more of these things.  Throw in some fresh berries.  You get crunchy, salty, and sweet all covered right there.  Now here's what you do:  Make your dressing with 1/2 cut vegetable oil, 4 tablespoons of sugar, 2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar, and 1 half teaspoon of pepper.  Seriously, it's good.  Try it, thank me later.  Goes well with Tanqueray, Sudoku, Gabby La La, dental floss, and poptarts.
