I have never taken a green tea supplement before this one, and my experience with it has been pretty good.  The good news is that I did not feel any negative side effects but I was taking this for weight loss and I did not lose very much weight at all while on this.  When I began taking raspberry ketones along with the green tea, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008HYRW6G">Green Tea Extract 60 Capsules (500mg) + FREE 25 Grams Raspberry Ketones Powder</a>, this is when I started to actually lose weight.<br /><br />I read an article that said taking them together created synergistic weight loss effects, and so far I have lost six pounds in the past 17 days compared to just a couple pounds when I took the green tea on its own.  There are a lot of good health benefits to be had by taking green tea on its own too but for energy and weight loss, adding raspberry ketones to the mix has been great.
