I've never ordered this type of product online before so I had a few reservations and concern for the quality. Eventually, however I decided to go ahead and I am very glad I did. The product arrived with a cool pack to avoid the chocolate from melting, and sure enough every single piece of candy was in perfect condition. The almonds had a great taste, and the chocolate was top quality. My only regret is that they do not offer a milk chocolate variety here on amazon(in 1lb bag). Too bad.<br /><br />If you like almonds, and dark chocolate I definitely recommend buying from Superior nut Company.
