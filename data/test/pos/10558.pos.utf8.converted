The fresh whole rabbits were an amazing addition to my Civil War battle recreations.  Complete with authentic Civil War-era fabric and little Army hats, General Hop Jump an Colonial Fuzzy Ears were particularly vigorous participants as they reenacted the Battle of Bull Run.  General Hop Jump led the Northern troops directly into the line of fire and came out victorious!  Colonial Fuzzy Ears, not to be outdone, soon took the stronghold of a South Carolina beach fort by leading his men, many no more than 18 years old, right to the front gates.  They were thwarted masterfully by Admiral Chompers, but Colonial Fuzzy Ears had won the bottle of will and mutual admiration.  Admiral Chompers then proceeded to eat his Civil War side burns made of fine great and white thread that had come unhinged of it's scotch tape backing.  The war came to a crashing halt when General Long Back Legs marched his brigade through the fields of Georgia, and my side yard, and burned every living thing until the South finally waved the white flag.  The fresh whole rabbits will take on new challenges such as The Battle of the Bulge and the War of 1812 where Wascally Wabbit will play the part of Napoleon complete with fine admiral blue attire, that funny little sideways hat, the arm and paw tucked into jacket, and all the trimmings.
