Bob's Red Mill Gluten Flour is perfect for making seitan.  Your success will depend on the recipe that you use.  An online search for "seitan recipes" will net you several, including videos showing the steps to success.  Here is my Chicken-ish Seitan Patties recipe.<br /><br />Chicken-ish Seitan Patties<br /><br />Dry Ingredients:<br />1 cup gluten flour<br />2 TBS garbanzo bean flour<br />2 TBS nutritional yeast<br />1/4 tsp thyme<br />1/2 tsp rosemary<br />1 tsp sage<br />1/2 tsp marjoram<br />1 tsp onion powder<br />Pepper to taste<br /><br />Wet ingredients:<br />2 TBS cashew butter<br />2 Edward & Sons Not-Chick'n Bouillon Cubes<br />1 +/- cup cold water<br /><br />Mix all of the dry ingredients and set aside. I used 4 turns of the pepper mill. I grind the rosemary and thyme with a pestle in a mortar before adding to the dry ingredients.<br /><br />Mix all of the wet ingredients. I put all of the wet ingredients into a personal blender and mixed it up. Add the blended wet ingredients to the dry and mix well. If necessary, add additional water. If the mixture is a bit sloshy at this point, you've added too much water. This can be fixed with the addition of a tiny bit of gluten. I also let the mixture set for a couple of minutes to let the water be absorbed.<br /><br />Measure out some aluminum foil squares approximately 8 inches wide. Measure out a heaping 1/4 cup of the mixture onto the middle of your foil. Pat the mixture down into a patty, then fold the aluminum foil making a tight pouch. Continue until all of the gluten mixture is used up. I believe that I got 6 patties out of the mixture.<br /><br />Place packets into a steamer and steam over boiling water for approximately 35 minutes. Remove from heat. The patties can be used at this point however you wish.<br /><br />Possible changes: Tahini can be used in place of the cashew butter. Obviously any kind of chicken bullion can be used.
