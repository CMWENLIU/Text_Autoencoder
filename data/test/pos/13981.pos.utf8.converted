This is the smoothest, most delicious, and richest tasting chocolate powder I've had so far. I love chocolate, so I'm always comparing. I thought Green & Black's was the best until I tasted this one. But Green & Blacks gave me a caffeine buzz that kept me up all night and this one did not. I learned there is a chemical difference between processed and raw chocolate. Raw chocolate is actually healthy... and FAR more healthy than processed cocolate. It's full of calcium, magnesium, and is actually a nutritionally complete food with little to no caffeine because it is not processed the same way as conventional chocolate or cacao powder. I love this raw organic cacao powder and am buying more today!
