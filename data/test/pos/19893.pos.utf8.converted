I think I've died and gone to heaven.  I have health concerns that keep me from being able to eat sugar/artificial sweetners/caffeine/gluten/some nuts and have had to give up a lot of my previous snacking favorites....hah....all of them, including my most favorite, chocolate.  This product, though, being naturally sugar-free and extremely low in caffeine, satisfies my urge for chocolate but doesn't create a feeding frenzy of wanting a lot at a time (no blood sugar surge).  It's quite bitter in a very pleasant way (I'd never liked really dark chocolate before because it wasn't sweet enough), and, I think, delicious right out of the bag (in a crunchy, at-first-weird way).
