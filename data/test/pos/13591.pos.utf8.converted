One of the easiest ways to finish that sauce in a truly professional manner. Where I used to make my own demi - lots of time and effort, now I simply use More than Gourmet products for a comparable result. They're also great for soups- check out the other varieties in the smaller sample sizes to see for yourself how good these products really are. Now, the caveat, you MUST start with good ingredients to create a good finished product, this is not a miracle worker for poor preparation or second rate ingredients, but used as intended it's an excellent time saver.
