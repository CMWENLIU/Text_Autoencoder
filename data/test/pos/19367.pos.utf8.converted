I have been eating this particular hot sauce for years now and I have to say, hands down, it is the best hot sauce for flavor plus heat. I am addicted and my cupboard always has an ample supply on hand.<br />This particular product is El Yucateco's hottest and, in my opinion, the tastiest. Other hot sauces may indeed be hot, but this one packs a whole lot of flavor that the others just plain lack. If you are (still) sensitive to this much heat, I would recommend their green habenero hot sauce. It's a little less potent and still quite flavorful.
