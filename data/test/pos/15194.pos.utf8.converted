Nice change of pace from broth-based noodles. The black been sauce comes in a powder form. Also included is a small pouch of oil and dried veggies (does not look like picture on package!). I find the sauce to be of good taste. I usually need to add some water to break up all the powder and to get it to a nice consistency. The veggies are okay. They add texture, but not much flavor. I like to add kimchi for extra flavors. Good, quick meal or snack! Price here is good too, last time I bought them at a local shop, they were $3 a pack!
