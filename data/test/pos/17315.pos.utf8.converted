I suffer from a bad stomach and have had ulcers in the past so I need to be careful what I eat and drink, that being said I cant go without my morning cup of coffee but found myself sometimes needing to take antacids and even prescription medications because it irritated my stomach. Then I found the Health Wise Coffee and I can now enjoy coffee again and not suffer any after effects, even my wife enjoys it because its very smooth and has no bitter after taste.
