You can't lie, you love vienna beef. And what the best way to make vienna beef avail? Cou can it and preserve it in gelatin (basically gel with not nutritional value). This is all beef. I use to be a fan of pork sausage/franks but the manufacturers often load it with loads of sodium. The manufacturers of beef franks however don't. I do like my franks with a snappy casing, but with beef franks, you can almost always make an exception.<br /><br />I like these prepared by boiling it in a pan or pot with the water meeting about half way and let it low boil. remember to give the can some air either by puncture or lifting the tab. 5-7 minutes is usually enough. I love these served with gravy. Any gravy will do. I also sometimes just throw these on a hot dog bun (about 3 so a can serves 2) add sauteed peppers, onions, sour kraut, slices of hot peppers, light chedder and a line of texas chili (no beans, remember texas chili has no beans! I only make an exception if the bean is skinned and split [ soaks flavor and imo enhances vital texture])
