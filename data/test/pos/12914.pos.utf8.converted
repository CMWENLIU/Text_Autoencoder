I love coffee, but I also love not having to be messing with the coffee maker sometimes. This instant espresso is one of the best I have tried. I rarely drink instant espresso plain; I mainly use it in iced coffee drinks, frappes or mochas.<br /><br />I also have the Medaglia D' Oro Instant Espresso in our pantry and it is wonderful as well, but with less bite that the Caffe D'Vita supplies.  I like to use the Caffe D'Vita when I want a pronounced java edge and the Medaglia D' Oro when a delicate espresso flavor is needed.<br /><br />Neither brand is acidic at all, I find that if I drink it on an empty stomach that I don't get a tummy ache like brewed coffee can sometimes induce.<br /><br />It dissolves quickly in hot water, is lightweight so it travels well (great for backpacking/camping) and both are very versatile to have around for cooking:<br /><br />-- Put a tsp. in a batch of brownies to deepen the dark chocolate flavor<br />-- Add a Tbs in a BIG batch of chili to compliment the spices and add extra richness<br />-- Sprinkle a bit to Mexican mole sauce for punch<br />-- I also put it in: chocolate icing, truffles, chai tea with milk for a java chai latte, coffee drink mixes for extra umph, etc.<br /><br />Both brands are over [...] bucks at supermarkets, when/if you can even find it, so it is nice to know they are cheaper at Amazon.  The Caffe D'Vita is even less costly with Subscribe & Save at amazon!
