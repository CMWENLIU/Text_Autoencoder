My 8 mo. old simply LOVES this stuff! It was his 1st official "finger food" so I think it's a combo of, "I can do it myself" plus it tastes good, and dissolves easy in the mouth- which is kind of important when you only have 6 teeth! Only other mom-comment here is that I wish they had a little MORE greens in it, as it's not even close to green in color, like they just waved some greens over the bowl when making it. Someone ought to sell this stuff in a mixed case...we go thru about one container every few days.
