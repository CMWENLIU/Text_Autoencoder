I love Italian food and wine.  Initially I purchased the Trapani Sea Salt on a whim.  After I completely embraced the pairing of regional Italian wines with the corresponding dishes moving to Italian sea salt seemed only natural.<br /><br />We have many different flavors of salt in our home.  I routinely cook with the following:<br /><br />1. Sicilian Trapani Sea Salt<br /><br />2. Hawaiian Red Salt<br /><br />3. French Grey Salt<br /><br />4. Celtic Salt<br /><br />5. Scandinavian Smoked Salt<br /><br />6. Kosher Salt<br /><br />A few years ago I would have thought anyone nuts if they told me they used six different types of salt.  Now I search for new types of sea salt with the same enthusiasm that used to be reserved for hunting for new Italian wines.  The next two salts on my list are Peruvian Pink and Oak Smoked Chardonnay.<br /><br />I have been struggling with how to describe the difference in taste.  Sadly, I have not figured out how to describe it other than to say it tastes like Italy.  What makes different salts taste different is the different mineral content within the crystal.  They all taste similar, but different.  It is like the difference between a Chianti from two different wineries.<br /><br />Can I really taste the difference in all these different salts?  No doubt about it, but isn't just me that can taste the difference.  The other members of my family that once thought this a ridiculous practice can also taste the difference.  If you love Italian food and wine, try the Sicilian Trapani Sea Salt.  We enjoy it at our house.
