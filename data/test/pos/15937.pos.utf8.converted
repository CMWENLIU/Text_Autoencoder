The Raisins & Spice flavor of Quaker Instant Oatmeal was a favorite of mine as a child, and I have not been able to find it at my local grocery stores. I was very happy to find it at Amazon.  I bought this four-pack concerned that I may not enjoy the flavor as much as I did when I was young (and then what would I do with four boxes of the stuff??), but not to worry -- I'm enjoying it immensely.  And I'm not sure if it's due to the added fiber content of the raisins or what, but it seems more filling than the other varieties, and it takes me longer to get hungry for lunch.  Did I mention it's delicious?  I find I reach for this flavor over the Maple & Brown Sugar which has been my favorite in my adult years...
