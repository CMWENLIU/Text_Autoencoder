It's actually pretty good particularly if you are comparing it to the cheap ramen found in most groceries. After reading reviews on all the Nong Shim varieties I was careful to add only half the flavor packet as I expected a full packet to produce something akin to liquid Habaneros. After the first taste I tossed the rest of the packet in and enjoyed a fairly tasty bowl of soup. Make no mistake, even if you're used to hot Asian or Southern foods your sinuses are likely to be fully cleared by the time you finish the last drop but it's nowhere near as bad as it's been made out to be. There are several sauces and peppers used in Asian cooking that can drop a careless user in their tracks. This is not even close to that level of spicy. It DOES have plenty of salt. A little much even for my taste and I'm a confirmed saltaholic.<br />Overall a very tasty and quick meal that should be even more enjoyable during the cold months. I am going to try adding ingredients to make it a little heartier. A few small frozen already cooked shrimp and a couple of spoonfuls of corn and peas ought to really flesh this soup out. One suggestion I would make is to follow the instructions for preparation exactly, at least the first couple of times you make it. Once you have a feel for how it's supposed to taste you can alter to suit your own preferences but at least you'll know whether or not you've made an improvement.
