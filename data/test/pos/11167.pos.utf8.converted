This is my first time purchasing this product. I've tried to make crepes before and they turned out so-so. These were insanely perfect. My ONLY complaint is that the directions are not for the whole box and it took a little math to do. Know that 16 tbsp equals 1 cup. That will help.<br /><br />I'm actually back to buy more and plan on having a crepe party in a few weeks.
