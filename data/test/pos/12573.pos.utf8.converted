I must concur that these little ginger chews are addictive!  I have not had any problem, thus far, with weird crumbly texture as another reviewer related; on the contrary, they are quite chewy, almost as chewy as the little red penny candies from the old days, if you are old enough to remember that!  If you are a ginger fan, go for them.  I buy them in 2 oz boxes at Target, for $1.09 a box..a deal!
