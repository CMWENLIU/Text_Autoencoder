We are cutting back on coffee at home for a variety of reasons and no longer brew an entire pot. We love coffee...tried all kinds of brewing, brands, and roasts and still plan to. For morning convenience, we tried instant, Starbucks VIA.  While wonderful, I found the price per serving to be only practical while traveling and not for everyday use. I stumbled across this coffee at the grocery and thought I'd give it a shot. Well, I am hooked. Tastes great and it is much easier to create a cup while still half sleepy.  Avid Amazon shopper, so I will get it here next time.  Did I mention that it only costs about 8 cents/cup?
