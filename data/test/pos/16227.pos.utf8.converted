This is my new favorite pasta sauce. I got a sample at Costco one day and decided to buy some.<br /><br />It's veggie and not oily at all. Very fresh tasting. Very full flavored so that you can eat it very plain. I love it best with the 5 cheese tortellini that they were giving out as samples. Just great!
