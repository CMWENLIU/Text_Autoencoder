I was recommended to this product by a nutritionist, and have been really happy with it. Make your own gelatin using hot water and fruit juice, no sugar, nothing artificial, tastes great and it's good for you.  Dissolve three tablespoons of gelatin powder in two cups of fruit juice, stir and let sit for a minute or two, add one cup of hot water, and put in a pan to cool for a few hours.  You can add some fresh fruit, walnuts, anything you like.  Yummy, especially with creme fraiche on top.
