I had purchased the Euro Cuisine Yogurt Maker about a year ago, then just recently noticed that Euro Cuisine came out with their own brand of starter. I have to say, that using the starter made the yogurt making process so much better, because the ingredients they use in the culture is so healthy and it makes the yogurt so much more delicious. I already fell in love with the Euro Cuisine Yogurt maker, now I have fallen in love with their starter as well.
