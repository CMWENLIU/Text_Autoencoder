I havent bought these from this seller, but I have had these crackers before. I have also tried the garlic and rosemary flavors. To me- this is by far the best. It has a delicious flavor, with great texture, and very fresh crunch. I gave some to my 5-year old niece and she liked them a lot. Tastes better than the other major brand (I wont say their name).  :)
