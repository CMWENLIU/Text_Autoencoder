I read about this in the Four Hour Body by Tim Ferriss, and though I doubted nut oil could be a winner with my salmon & scrambled eggs (I don't eat them together), he was right. This is great. Not only does it work great with eggs (as I already mentioned), the salmon doesn't stick to the pan!<br /><br />Go for it. Good stuff!
