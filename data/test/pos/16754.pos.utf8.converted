First off i was a bit weary due to other reviews sayin the cereal was expiring soon. My cereal came packed very well, 4 boxes of beautiful rice krispies treats cereal which didnt expire for about 8 months. opening the first box was epic...those first big chunks were huge! and despite shipping the cereal was in great condition. Now, as someone who eats cereal once maybe twice a week, i tell you this. all 4 boxes were gone in a week. This cereal is simply AMAZING. childhood memory lane. i ordered frankenberry and booberry afterwards too, but this cereal is 10x better then both. Fortunately, i found a specialty store which carries this cereal :) but had i not, i would be spending alot more money on amazon.
