I wanted to point out that these treats are different from the dog Greenies. Dog Greenies are chewy, cat Greenies are crunchy, like dry cat food. Because of this I don't know if they actually work (if they're the same texture what makes them different from cat food?) but I don't think they're dangerous, as a previous reviewer said. Canine Greenies have caused health problems, but from what I understand it is because the dog didn't chew it well (like most dogs) and because of the softer texture it swelled in the dogs stomach.<br /><br /> My cats love the salmon flavor, the package recommends six pieces three times a day, not to exceed 18 pieces a day. I give my cats about six a day, all at once. They don't always chew them though, which is the only problem I've had with the product, swallowing them whole doesn't bother my cats at all though. I have one cat, Garfield, who is very picky, but he loves these treats. So I think its probably safe to say that these shouldn't cause health problems like the canine Greenies can and also that your cat will really like them!
