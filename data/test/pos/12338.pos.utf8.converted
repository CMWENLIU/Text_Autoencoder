I have to start by saying I am a "picky" coffee drinker and instant coffee was never found in my home. I received an offer for a free sample and I thought oh what the heck so I tried it and actually found it to be very good.  It is the best tasting instant that I have ever had.  It is nice to have this in the house for those times you just don't want to make a whole pot, I grab one of my larger coffee cups and two packages of Taster's Choice and I enjoy a nice strong cup of coffee.
