This is the milk we use all the time.  It is superior to other milks that we tried because it has the added vitamins and minerals like the milk in the refrigerator section.  The taste of the milk is good for drinking.  My kids have no complaints about it.  We do take special care to make the milk well in advance of drinking it so it is cold.  This milk froths nicely when using it for making cappuccinos.  It is good for use in cooking though I have not used it as a dry ingredient in baking but I can assume it would be good that way also.
