This stuff is great!  Terrific flavor, great texture, and oh so many uses.<br /><br />It's wonderful on crackers, bruschetta, pita chips, etc.  I've also used it as a base for goat-cheese pizzas.<br /><br />The jars are on the small side -- 3 1/2 oz -- about 1/2 Cup -- but that's OK for me.  I don't usually use that much at one time (unless I'm doing pizza), so a jar can last awhile.<br /><br />I can't find this locally.  None of my local markets carry it -- they carry another type of sundried tomato "pesto"-type sauce, but this stuff is SO much better.  So I'll continue to order it online as long as it's available.
