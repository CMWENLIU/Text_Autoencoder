This is my favorite flavor of the primal strips, probably because it's drier and chewier than the other ones.  Some of them can be kind of soft, but the dried shitake gives it a nice chewy flavor, closer to real jerky.  Nice and spicy with a little sweet taste. I actually just finished eating one, so if you're looking for the nutritional info, here it is right off the label:<br /><br />Calories: 108<br />Protein: 6g<br />Fiber: 6g<br />Sugar: 3g<br />Sodium: 334mg<br />Total Fat: 4g, Sat fat: 1g<br /><br />Ingredients: shitake mushrooms, naturally brewed soy sauce, expeller pressed canola oil, licorice root, Non-GMO vital gluten, high fiber soy protein, sea salt, natural vegetarian spices, no MSG added
