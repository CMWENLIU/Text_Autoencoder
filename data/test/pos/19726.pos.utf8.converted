Switched to this food when my kitty was newly diagnosed as a Diabetic earlier this year; as I wanted a high-protein, no-carb diet for him without all the fillers & junk in most foods...especially since he already suffers from Inflammatory Bowel Disease & reacts poorly to most foods.  To my & the Vet's great surprise, at his first follow-up appointment, his blood sugar had normalized to the point that they took him off his insulin!  AND, within a couple of weeks on this diet exclusively, the frequent bouts of bloody diarrhea he'd been suffering stopped as well.  I'm keeping all my fingers & toes crossed, but so far, this food has been amazing.  I only wish I'd found it sooner!
