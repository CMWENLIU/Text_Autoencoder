I actually got this item as a gift and it's worked out great. I watered my can during the winter and kept it on south facing windowsill for a few months. The initial growth took about 6-8 weeks to show up for me. Eventually I had 13 sprouts show up, but most eventually died off and I was left with 3 pretty hardy plants. When the plant got to be about 4-5 inches tall, I repotted them and put them outside in direct sun once the weather got warmer. They grew quite well and as of this moment, one plant has about 7 ripe chiles on them while the other two are putting out green ones. They stay green for a long time it seems and then transition to red practically over night.<br /><br />I see quite a few negative reviews on this product and I'm pretty surprised since I've had GREAT results from mine. I'd imagine some if it might be user error (though we obviously never like admitting that) and some of it might be legitimate dud products. Results may vary of course.<br /><br />Also, since positive reviews amongst a sea of negatives are oftentimes greeted with a little skepticism, I've uploaded a few customer photos to show my results.
