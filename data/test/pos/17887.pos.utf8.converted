Here's the problem... after eating something of this caliber and deliciousness, how can I ever go back to gas station pork rinds? These are by far my favorite pork rinds. They are a bit fatty, but that's what pork rinds are supposed to be like. They are crunchy, but won't break your teeth. They're also mildly seasoned with salt, so you can add in your own spices and make something with it, too. All in all, I'll buy another box once I finish this box. Thank you :)
