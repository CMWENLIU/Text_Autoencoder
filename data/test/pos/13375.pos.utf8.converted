Okay so I ordered every flavor of these during the summer sale in June were most of the flavors $12, and if you signed up "Subscribe and Save" they were $10.50 each.  So, I will be putting up reviews as I open each box.  They have been in the fridge (keeps me from random snacking) and I opened Dark Chocolate, Chocolate Mudslide, and Mixed Nuts & White Chocolate last night.  I am 5'3" and 118 and I try to add some protein to my diet with bars like this.  My review will only be for the Dark Chocolate (others on the appropriate product pages.)  I will start with what EVERYONE really cares about: TASTE!  These bar tasted incredible to me!!!! Thick, rich, dark chocolate, chewy consistency, NO chemical taste, sweet but not too sweet. I read the nutrient profile and the ingredient list, and I am really pleased with the ingredient quality.  This is what attracted me to the product.  It is sugar free, gluten free, and wheat free.  This is great for those watching their waistline.  On the other hand, it has a pretty sizeable fat content.  This one has 7 grams of fat.  So just be aware of that when including in your diet, too many of these and you WILL gain weight!  The protein is excellent!!! (20 grams), as much as a small chicken breast.  (Although chicken breast doesn't have this much fat.)  The sodium isn't bad (125 mg).  There are 14 net carbs, which subtract out the fiber and sugar alcohols (the sugar alcohols are in debate as to whether your body burns them as calories or not.)  The calories, fat, protein, and carbs are equal to: a large plain green salad, 3 oz chicken breast, 3 cups broccoli, 1/2 tablespoon oil, and a cup of berries.  So I say that to illustrate that this is definitely a healthy MEAL REPLACEMENT for those on the go and really has TOO MANY calories for a full bar to be a snack.  If you plan on snacking, break it in half and eat half for an afternoon snack, and half for a nighttime snack.  If you do it this way, these bars are actually a very smart, thoughtfully balanced, and highly convenient, delicious snack.  That is the most effective way to use these bars.  They do not really have enough fiber to eat as a meal replacement because you will be hungry in less than four hours after eating.  If you do use as a meal replacement, add a broth soup and a large green salad with low-cal dressing, or veggies (most grocery stores sell washed broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots that you can eat on the go.)  Another way to incorporate these DELICIOUS bars into your routine is a breakfast.  Perfect for on the go and it's hard to eat more before lunch even if you do get hungry (which most people don't get very hungry before lunch.)  So in summary: EXCELLENT ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS; DELICIOUS, DECADENT FLAVOR (as good as a candy bar); CONVENIENT PACKAGING; GREAT VITAMIN & MINERAL PROFILE (you'll still need a comprehensive multivitamin daily); CONVENIENT SOURCE OF PROTEIN; GREAT SNACK (if you eat half as a snack or the other half later in the day as a snack.)  THE PRICE IS RIGHT too based on Amazon's deal vs. in store pricing on these bars.  They are very expensive in retail stores, Amazon is selling them almost 50% off.  Helpful hint: if you sign up for Subscribe & Save, you get the best price.  You can set your shipments to every six months, and even if you don't want them then, you can delay shipment.  The point is, you really never have to buy more later in order to get the best price now.  You can keep deferring shipment.  Not saying that to scam Amazon, just saying that may help more people be willing to try a delicious bar if the price is right.  I hope this review helped you make a purchasing decision, either for or against the product.  I know I hate to waste my money, and I wanted to give a honest review.
