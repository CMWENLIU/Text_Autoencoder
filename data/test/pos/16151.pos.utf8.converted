Wow.  Now that is a HUGE bag of popcorn!  I bought this for my mother at the same time as a Whirly-pop.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SU35">Wabash Valley Farms 25008 Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper</a>  She called me last night and told me that the popcorn was excellent, tasted good, and popped well in her new popper.  It was a little hard to lug around 12 lbs of popcorn on Christmas day but I wanted to make sure she could make as much as she wanted whenever she wanted to!
