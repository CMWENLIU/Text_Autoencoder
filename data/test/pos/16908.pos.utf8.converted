The Better Oats Dark Chocolate Oatmeal is a great oatmeal I feel good about eating.  It's not made with partially hydrogenated *anything* and doesn't look "chemically" when you pour it out of the pouch.  The oatmeal has flax seeds in it, and the chocolate taste is rich without being too overdone.  Initially I worried that the chocolate would have a greasy or strange aftertaste, but it has none of these things.  It really has a wonderful flavor.<br /><br />There are 5 long pouches per box.  On the back of each pouch is a measuring line for liquids, so once you pour your oats into a bowl you know exactly how much water to add to the mix.  Sometimes I also add a bit of 2% milk, which adds a nice creaminess to the oatmeal.<br /><br />Here are highlights from the box that may be helpful:<br />- Made with 100% whole grain oats and flax seeds<br />- 160 calories, 0g trans fat, 0mg cholesterol, 220mg sodium/serving<br />- 28 grams of whole grains/serving<br />- 170mg ALA OMEGA-3/serving<br /><br />I bought these on sale at my local grocery store for $1/box.  I'm hoping to see them on sale again!  It was a great impulse buy  :o)
