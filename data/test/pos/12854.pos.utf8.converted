Crystal Light as a whole is a spectacular product. Was a HUGE fan of the Peach Tea, but I wanted the benefits of the antioxidant and metabolic boosting power of green tea. Saw that Crystal Light had a green tea with a peach/mango combo so I figured I'd give it a shot.  I looked around at my local retail stores, but could ONLY find it available in the packets used in the 16 oz. bottles, gave them a shot to see if I liked it....BOY OH BOY, did I LIKE IT! But, unfortunately I could<br />not find the 10 quart size ANYWHERE. So checked around here on Amazon and low and behold, here is Peach/Mango GREEN TEA!!! This has everything you're gonna want in your antioxidant/metabolism boosting regimen and the TASTE: Superb, very potent peach with the aftertaste of the mango, IGNORE ANY reviews that say there is a bad aftertaste.....this stuff is TOP NOTCH!! I drink about 2 to 3 quarts a day, can't get enough! With super saver shipping from Amazon, you're paying about THE SAME that you would pay retail. What more could you want???
