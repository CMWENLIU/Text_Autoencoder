This was the first brand of San Marzanos I tried when I first heard of these tomatoes. I made the famed "butter sauce" and nearly fainted with amazement as they truly lived up to the hype.  Then I read that these weren't the "real" thing I tried two different brands (Cento and Bella Terra) thinking, "wow, these will surely be mind blowing!"  And while yes, they were good, I'm going back to these.  I'm cooking up another pot right now and instantly I can tell the difference (and it's not even done).  These interact with the butter SO well, there is a velvety creaminess that is out of this world.  The other brands didn't quite achieve that same level and I found myself wanting to add more butter.  With these tomatoes, I think I can get away with LESS (but wouldn't want to).  I don't know what they do to them, maybe it's the California soil.  I know some people are upset because the label is misleading but, did they try this sauce? THIS sauce?  If they did, they might pardon the error.  Maybe they should just rename these San Calzanos or Marzifornias so that the sticklers can relax. Or not. More for me.<br /><br />Marzifornia Butter Sauce: 1 28-oz. can of bogus, counterfeit deliciousness, 5 tbsp. butter, one medium yellow onion peeled and halved.  That's IT! Put all three ingredients in a pan, bring to a simmer on medium heat, then lower heat to maintain a continuous low bubbling simmer for 45 min.  Stir occasionally while crushing the tomatoes against the side of the pot.  Discard onion (or don't).  Serve on your choice of pasta and go to heaven.
