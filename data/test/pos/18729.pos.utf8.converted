I have been using Slap Ya Mama for the better half of two years. There is nothing comprable. The review that claims this is nothing more than a salt and pepper mix. Must be snorting this stuff. If they wanted something hotter they should have gotten the red pepper blend. You can use this stuff on everything, and no kidding this stuff is better than Christmas.... Visit there websight for all other products and great cajun recipies...
