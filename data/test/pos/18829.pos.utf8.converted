These things are the best.  I get them at my local grocery store, but if they ever stop carrying them I'd probably order from somewhere else like Amazon.  Where else can you get nearly 100% of your day's fiber by slapping two tortillas together and making a cheese quesadilla in the microwave?  One minute later and ka-bam!  I've now had a high fiber diet for that day!  Want even more fiber?  Toss some beans into that quesedilla!  Do they taste like a normal corn tortilla? NO...but they taste just fine (it's mostly a texture difference...these are smoother and not as granular/cake/flour like as a normal corn or flour tortilla) and will turn nearly any variety of unhealthy compliment (i.e. cheddar cheese, etc.) into something that's not too bad for you!  Looking at the ingredients, it looks like they're getting most of the fiber content from oat fiber, so that explains why these don't taste overly wheat-like.
