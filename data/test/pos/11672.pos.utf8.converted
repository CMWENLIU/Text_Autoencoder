Aspen Mulling Spices are delicious! What a fabulous find. We add a carton to a bottle of apple juice or apple cider, throw in a few slices of orange, and warm it on the stove. The aroma is delicious - it reminds the whole family of fall. A delicious treat any time of year, it's particularly good on a frosty night. I'm sure there are a million uses for this spice blend, but we're all hooked on the apple cider combination. And at this price, you can't go wrong. Purchased individually at the store, this pack of nine would cost over $45.00 - stock up and save a bundle!
