Being French, these have always been one of my favorites. The reviewer before me obviously didn't know how to cook these, so hear: You must bake them in the oven until they crack open, and even then, let them get slightly burnt. The crispy, blackened parts are always everyone's favorites!<br /><br />These sausages are very tasty and highly nutritious, while low-fat (compared to regular sausages), so give them a try!!<br /><br />The best side dish to go with these is either mashed potatoes, or un-sweetened fresh applesauce (delicieux!).<br /><br />Enjoy!
