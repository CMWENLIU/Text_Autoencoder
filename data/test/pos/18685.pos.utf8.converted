My Cat is coming up on his 13th year and suddenly when we are home he never stops yowling. There is nothing wrong with him medically, he just began demanding an insane amount of attention (he already gets more attention than most children) and begs for food even when he is not hungry because he wants you to come in the kitchen and pay attention to him. So as much as I love incessant meowing while I am trying to read, type, talk or think.....<br /><br />Anywho we didn't want to reward the yowling with treats or feeding him at times other than his normal meals but ignoring the behavior as per the vet and other people instructed simply did not work. After months of his crying we chalked it up to old age and wound up just giving him treats and snacks of his wet food so we could have a phone conversation without the person on the other line thinking we were killing our animal. He mostly ignored the extra food and would gobble up the treats but we knew it wasn't a perma fix. So we tried the cat milk. He loves it. Laps it up like me at a $2 martini happy hour. It appears to have a soothing effect on him because he stops meowing for a while after he gets it. Plus we feed him premium food and he was still a little flaky. (I think due to the dry heat in our home) The cat milk seems to help with the flakiness and his coat seems smoother. I would definitely limit it to a small serving once a day, I gave him a leetle too much when I first got it and I paid for it the next day when I was scooping the box. Other than the one incident it actually seems to help his poop. cheers!
