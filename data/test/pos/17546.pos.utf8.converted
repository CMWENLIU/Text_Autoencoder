We currently have 3 cats and have been feeding Taste of the Wild for almost a year.  My cats love this stuff.  They run to the bowl to eat.  The best is however the reaction on their coats.  No more problems with itchy skin and hair loss because of grains that are in most pet foods.  Outstanding product!!!!! The only wish is that it would be be in larger sizes
