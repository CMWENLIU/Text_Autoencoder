This coconut oil is sweet & delicious. I eat it straight out of the jar, use it as lotion, use it on my hair & I even put it on my dogs. They have skin issues & applying the oil topically as well as feeding it to them healed their skin in a matter of days. Using it on my face instead of lotion is clearing my combination skin up. It's like a miracle oil. Highly recommend it.
