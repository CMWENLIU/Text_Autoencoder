These peppercorns are exactly as advertised: sweet and fruity with a  tangy pepper overtone. I am still experimenting with which pepper to use with what dish, but I did try this on a lemon salmon and it was very good.<br /><br />I also want to note that the customer service from the company was excellent. I had a problem that I did not tell them about but I did put it in a review. A customer service representative contacted me and resolved the problem very quickly and at no cost to me. You can't beat that kind of service. I will be using Olive Nation again.
