I ate 2 cups of Grape-nuts this morning, on a bet that i couldnt, while wearing a St. Patricks day hat and fake beard.  My stretch goal was 10 minutes, though it took better than 20, and i was sabotaged by Dave who added more when i went to get water.  Realizing after the fact that this many Grape-nuts was representative of about 120% of my daily fiber and 360% Iron, not to mention 800 net calories or so pre-milk, i became slightly worried and have been slugging down water ever since.  I havent eaten Grape-nuts in a while, and must say, despite the extreme circumstances, i really enjoyed them, and will eat them again tomorrow assuming im hungry then.  They were tasty, slightly sweet, and not in need of any additives to enjoy.  Highly recommended.
