I'm one of those tea/coke/wine/milk/beer type people... basically, I just really don't like drinking water. It's more of a chore than anything, and 8-glasses?! who do they think they're kidding? but smartwater... it goes down easily and tastes good afterwards... crisp, cool even (how can something taste cool? i don't know.. just try it.. b/c it does!)<br /><br />That said, i may turn out to be one of those water-drinking people, after all.
