I bought this as an addition to add to my protein shakes that I make everyday. I use half whey protein, half soy protein (since the soy has a tendency to clump, not dissolve, or taste awful if used entirely) and this is just awesome.<br /><br />The taste is mild and milky, not artificial tasting at all. When used entirely it tastes more like a milkshake, not a protein shake. I add a teaspoon (more on some days) of Medaglia D' Oro Instant Espresso Coffee when I make my shakes and the taste of the whey protein totally disappears, so if you don't like the taste you can easily hide it by adding a wide range of flavors. Even adding a cup of vanilla yogurt hides the flavor.<br /><br />It dissolves very well in water, milk, and even soy milk, no clumping whatsoever!<br /><br />This is whey protein in it's simplest form with nothing added, so if you are like me and watch what you put into your body, this is a definite must have pantry item.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great taste (well at least I like it)<br />Dissolves well in a variety of liquids<br />Cooks well without adding any unwanted flavor<br />4g of protein per tablespoon<br /><br />Cons:<br />None!
