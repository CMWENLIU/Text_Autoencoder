I am a holistic health and nutrition counselor who helps clients move to a more whole foods based diet.  These crackers are great because they are made from 100% whole grains and not very processed at all ... and they still taste great!  I ordered a case and have given them away to family and friends (to help them be healthier) and keep them at home and at work ... Love them - and it's much cheaper to buy by the case from Amazon than it is to buy at Whole Foods Market or a health foods store.  Enjoy!
