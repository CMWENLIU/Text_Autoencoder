I like Hazelnut so I especially like the Hazelnut Teeccino. I cannot handle caffeine anymore.  Sometimes I use half Teeccino and half Decaf coffee for my morning coffee. The Teeccino gives it a richer, more full-bodied taste, which I like. If I want coffee mid-day I use only the Teeccino and make just the amount I want for a cup in a French Press pot - it is a special treat. I do wish Amazon would let you mix up the Teeccino flavors in their three packs.
