Facts:<br />As of the time of this writing, this product is available for free shipping with Amazon Prime, and is available for their subscribe and save discount, which makes it very affordable. Each box yields roughly one pound of hummus after water and olive oil are added. For my area, this results in the cost being roughly 1/3 of store bought ready-made hummus, which is the main reason I will continue to buy it. I eat a lot of hummus, (about a pound a week), and it gets expensive.  The ingredient list, as shown on box:<br />Garbanzo bean flour, sesame seed powder, salt, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, citric acid, lemon juice powder, sesame oil, lemon oil, rosemary extract.<br /><br />Opinions:<br />To me, this is well worth the savings, as the end result is a cheaper, better hummus than store-bought. As-is, the hummus is quite tasty, but still a little bland and a little lemony. (But don't let some of the reviews on here scare you - the lemon taste isn't that intense. Unless your experience with lemons is limited completely to cleaning products, it in no way tastes like "furniture polish" as one person commented on a review). I prefer to modify mine to enhance the flavor. My recommendation to reduce the lemon flavor by rounding out the flavor overall is to add garlic and shallots. Finely dice and saut&eacute; (2) cloves garlic and (1) large clove of shallots and stir them into the hummus when you first prepare it. This will enhance the flavor (not enough garlic in the box to my taste), and it feels more "homemade" this way, so you can be proud of your hummus creation. I also recommend experimenting. Maybe you like spicy hummus...dice up some jalape&ntilde;o! Maybe you like sweet hummus...dice up some ginger! It's cheap enough that even if you don't like your creation, it's not that big of a loss.<br /><br />If you don't agree with me on any of this, feel free to call me out...but try a box first. I bet you won't disagree with me after all.
