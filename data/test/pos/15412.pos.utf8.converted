"Rich Tea" are the quintessential English tea-time biscuit, to be served mid-afternoon with a fine cup of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3WS7K">English Tea</a> (taken with milk, not lemon). And McVitie make the finest "Rich Tea", having exactly the correct texture and firmness and delicate flavour which these biscuits should have. "Rich Tea" are also the ultimate dunking biscuits, for which purposes they must, of course, be entirely whole and not cracked even in the slightest, otherwise they will instantly fall in half and disappear to the bottom of the cup. Even whole, these biscuits present the maximum challenge to the dunker -- leave the biscuit in the tea just a fraction of a second too long and, again, you'll wonder where your biscuit went (and why you have blotting paper at the bottom of your cup).  [American readers please note that dunking is, of course, entirely frowned upon in English high society, as an activity undertaken only by the peasant classes. It is thus to be indulged in only when entirely alone and in the privacy of one's own home, when there is no danger of being observed by the servants.]<br /><br />Should your biscuits arrive broken, as may, unfortunately, be all too likely (as these are a fragile biscuit and McVitie's packaging consists of no more than a paper wrapper) do not despair; all is not lost. Simply tip a quantity of the broken biscuits into a bowl and pour hot milk over them. The result may look like soggy blotting paper, but the eating experience is exquisite!
