If I could give this product more than 5 stars, I would!  Our family has tried VitaCoco and Zico Coconut Water (both were good) but O.N.E. Coconut water is our favorite because it includes little extendable straws that can be used like a juice box.  The handy straw allows you to neatly poke a hole through the foil seal for a no-spill drink...perfect for car rides or letting kids carry their drink around the house.  We also drink coconut water when we are ill, instead of Pedialyte or Gatorade (much more healthy).  The straw is a great way to get fussy toddlers to drink the fluids they need when they're sick.<br /><br />I highly recommend coconut water.  The consistency can take some getting used to because it's thicker than water or juice, but the nutritional value can't be beat.  It is the perfect drink for kids and athletes: an all natural, whole food....slightly sweet with fewer natural sugars than most fruit juices, no artificial colors or flavors, won't stain, packed with potassium and electrolytes, and it actually contains calcium and a little protein!  Packaged in small, recyclable Tetra Pak containers (eco-friendly) that contain no PBA like some plastics.  You can easily take this coconut water with you anywhere- I always keep a couple in the car and often stick one in my purse (although coconut water tastes best cold).  If you have any reservations about trying this product, just go for it!  If you really don't like it, you can always sell the rest on craigslist :)
