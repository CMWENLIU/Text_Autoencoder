I have a Bernese Mountain Dog.  The food is good quality and my dog eats it as fast as possible.  His coat is shiny and he doesn't have any digestive issues.  Amazon is the best deal because of the free shipping.  Other sites are less expensive but you have shipping fees that put them over the price of the item on Amazon.
