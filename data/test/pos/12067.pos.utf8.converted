This stuff is the bomb!  Does list sugar as an ingredient.  As well as sulfur dioxide (preservative).  However, in a 1.5 oz serving, only 1 gram of sugar!  30 carbs and 14 grams of fiber.  Proceed w/ caution - it's addicting.  My children think it's candy.  It tastes like it.  It is mostly pretty soft & chewy w/ a very fine layer of sweet crunch on the surface.  Can be pulsed in a food processor and used instead of the syrupy, super sweet coconut flakes for baking.  Costco now sells it for $8.99/bag.  It's right next to the dried mango.  I buy several bags each trip.  Enjoy.
