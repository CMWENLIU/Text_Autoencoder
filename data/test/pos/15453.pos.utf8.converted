TOTALLY AGREE with the two previous reviewers. Have frozen about half of the content, and put the rest in 3 of 4oz jars and kept the two in the regular compartment of the refrigerator and one outside in room temperature. This BRAND works very well with my bread-making effort.  Fantastically MORE economical than buying in small packets in supermarkets. On the strength of the first reviewer I took a chance and appreciate her taking time to review -- so I'm doing the same.<br />Seller, please DO NOT RAISE PRICES ON THE STRENGTH OF OUR GOOD REVIEWS -- BRISK SELLING SHOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH REWARD. BOUGHT 2 POUNDS FOR $14.88 --JUST TO PUT THE SELLER ON NOTICE. HAVE OBSERVED IN THE PAST THAT AS SOON AS I BOUGHT ITEMS FOR MYSELF AS WELL AS FOR MY RELATIVES, SOON AFTER, THE PRICES HAVE RISEN CONSIDERABLY -- THIS HAS MADE ME WARY OF REVIEWING PRODUCTS WITH CONSIDERABLE ENTHUSIASM.
