I've used the product of some 50 years now. The bottle is basically the same except it is plastic now. It has somewhat of a browned flavor although there is no meat or meat products in it. Straight for the bottle it has about the same taste as Worcestershire Sauce without the vinegar and chili pepper taste. Sometimes I use both depending on the flavor I am after, Kitchen Bouguet being the milder and smoother of the two. Most stores carry the 4oz bottles but the quart bottle is my choice that way I hardly ever run out. It makes brown gravy quick and easy when poured over the meat before roasting. Then just add water, some salt and blend in your thickening agent...Gravy.
