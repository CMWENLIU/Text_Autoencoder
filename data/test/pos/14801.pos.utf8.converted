After about 6 months of cleaning up cat barf, lots of trips to the vet, changing litter 3 times and food about 8 times, I finally tried Science Diet Mature cat Hairball dry food for my 12 year-old Himalayans.  They had always eaten SD Sensitive Stomach, but my male big boy started throwing more than just hairballs...yellowish thin stuff that required lots of scrubbing on the carpets.<br /><br />This stuff really works!  I read lots of cat food labels and reviews before I tried this, but nothing worked and I was getting suggestions that I should put my precious Sherman down.<br /><br />Now he is happy and healthy again.  I don't know how this food works, but it surely did for my cat.<br /><br />Thank you, Science Diet!
