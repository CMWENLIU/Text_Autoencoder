This is an excellent product, second only to my Litter Robot.  Instead of inserting the sifter into the "in use" pan, I put it in the unused pan.  When time to sift, I just pour the litter from the "in use" pan into the empty pan with the sifter.  I lift the sifter, dump the sifted contents into the trash, pour the litter back into the "in use" pan, put the sifter back into the empty pan, and put the "in use" pan on top.  All this in less time than it would take me to scoop!  It is my opinion that the instructions would be better illustrated this way--no potential for clumps stuck to the sifter.  Hope this helps!
