I gave up coffee and have been drinking Chai Tea for almost a year now.  I've tried all different kinds of brands; numi, stash, celestial, tazo...etc.  Last one that I really liked was Numi.  I liked the subtle hint of spices that's not overwhelming, but nice and sophisticated.  However this India masala chai blew my mind.  It is the best chai i've ever had.  I should mention though that I usually take my chai w/ milk and honey.  What I do is I use 2 bags w/ 8oz boiling water, brew it for 3~4 min and put 1/2 cup of milk and 1 table spoon of honey.  If you drink your chai plain or if you like  mild chai this is not your brand, but if you like FULL & BOLD tasting Chai, this is your brand.  Besides it is amazing value!!!
