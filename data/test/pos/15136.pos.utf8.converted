I have osteoarthritis in one knee and it could use a  complete joint replacement. I take Glucosamine Chondrotin with Lubravite and MSN, Turmeric, Ginger, and Mobic (anti-inflammatory) for this but still had increasing pain in the joint for the last few months and was starting to get it in my other knee.<br /><br />I had used the Joint Comfort Tea for a few years and it worked well. I had no pain back then.But I used these other products also, so I wasn't sure which one helped the most.<br /><br /> Suddenly Whole Foods stopped carrying the tea. So I ordered it from Amazon for a three month supply. After that three month period, I was told Amazon was unable to obtain it!! I had a bad few months with increasing pain and discomfort, but didn't put two and two together about why!<br /><br />A few months later, they had it again and I got another three month supply. After 1 and 1/2 days of using this tea, my pain in both knees has just disappeared!! I have been pain free for a month now and am moving around much more.<br /><br /> I saw my orthopedic surgeon for the first time in 2 years last week. He said there is no reason to operate since my knee has not deteriorated at all in the 2 year span and especially, if I am not in pain now. He said when I am unable to straighten my knee completely and /or am in a lot of pain, then it's time to operate. So for now, I'm continuing my regimen and sipping that Joint Comfort Tea all day long!! Thanks Amazon for keeping me in supply - it means a lot to me!!
