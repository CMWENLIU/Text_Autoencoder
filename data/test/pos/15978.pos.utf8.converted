Mushrooms can add a lot of flavor to a dish.  Canned mushrooms are bland and boring and fresh mushrooms have a limited shelf life.  Dried mushrooms pack a lot of flavor and have a long shelf life (I believe they are good for up to 2 years).  A one ounce package of dried is the equivalent of a half pound of fresh.  They need to be soaked in warm water for about an hour to hydrate before using.  The water used for hydrating can be used in your dish for added flavor.  It can also be reduced to concentrate the flavor.  Once hydrated, the mushrooms can be used in any application that you would use fresh or canned.<br /><br />The Porcinis have a more bold earthy taste.  They go very well in soup, stews and pasta sauce (be sure to add the hydrating water to the pasta sauce, yummy!).<br /><br />The FungusAmongUs is a high quality brand that I highly recommend.
