I miss the shrimp & lobster sauce I ordered at restaurants when I lived in Maryland.  Moving to NC, the first place I ordered shrimp & lobster sauce at, I was so disappointed with the lack of flavor, a white bland sauce they call what is supposed to be this delicious dish.  So I did an online search for my recipe.  I remember black specks in the food I bought in MD saw that it was fermented black beans.  I purchased these to re-create the dish I missed so much.  These beans made the dish.  What I cooked looked & tasted almost exactly like what I used to order and am so happy that I can now make my own shrimp & lobster sauce at home.
