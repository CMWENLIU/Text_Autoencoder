I keep a jar of this truffle salt right next to my stove all the time. It gets used 3-4 times a week minimum, more than any other single seasoning I use. I love the flavor of truffles and this way, I can have it. Buying whole, fresh truffles is out of the question, and this salt offers an economical way to get that unmistakable essence of truffle in my food. Also, a jar of this salt makes a lovely hostess gift. I just gave one to a friend last week and she loved it.
