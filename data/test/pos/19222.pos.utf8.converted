I was a little hesitant to order these.  I was afraid of how they might taste.  But, I really wanted flower candy for a party.  So, I decided to give these a shot.  The pieces are a nice size, larger than a gummy bear.  And, the flavor is great.  They are rather addictive.  We used them in a dozen goody bags and still had half of the bag left.  This really is quality candy!
