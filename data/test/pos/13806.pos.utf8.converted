You know when you taste something you loved as a child, and it isn't half as good as you remember it? Mr. Kipling Cherry Bakewells are not like those things. They are forever delicious, forever exceedingly good, just as the package says. Other customers here would like you to skip purchasing these, so that they may have these all to themselves. Well, I am magnanimous. I would like you to try them, but I am hoping you have odd, malfunctioning tastebuds (possessed by demons perhaps) so that you hate them. Then I can freely purchase and eat more, without you standing in my way. Thank you for your time.
