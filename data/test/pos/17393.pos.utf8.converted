I am a cookie expert, I've tried them all. This is the best ever, you can eat a handfull  and you dont feel full or feel like you have sinned. I've tried the Rasberry and the Butterscotch and they are so good you would slap your Grandma if she tried to take them away from you.<br /> Yes I would recomend you buy them.<br />Danny B
