I have tried several of Fee Brother's Bitters and I am ordering the rest of them today. The Orange and Peach Bitters are the finest there is. I might be one of the few people that has actually compared different brands of bitters. If you want to have a complete battery of bitters for mixing drinks at home or at a bar, you need:<br /><br />Orange Bitters<br />Peach Bitters<br />Lemon Bitters<br />Old Fashioned (Angostura-type) Bitters<br />Peychaud's Bitters<br />Jaegermeister<br />Campari<br />Unicum<br /><br />I have used Fee's Brothers at my bar for over ten years, and you can't get some of these anywhere else in the world, if you like mixed drinks, you'll need to buy several of these from Fee Brother's, the complete 8 pack is great. The Old Fashioned Bitters you can get lots of places, and Angostura is quite good, but Fee Brothers is every bit as good. Fee Brother's Orange Bitters is far better than Angostura's Orange Bitters, so I think this set is the quintessential set you'll need. Go ahead, try to find peach or cherry bitters from another company. Get some Peychaud's and a few others and you're good to go.<br /><br />The idea of rhubarb bitters seems a little strange to me, but I haven't tried it, to be honest, and rhubarb might be a little overkill, so this six pack might be perfect for lemon, orange, peach and cherry bitters. Grapefruit sounds great, look forward to trying it.
