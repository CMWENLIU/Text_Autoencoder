This is my everyday coffee I have in the morning. It is equvalent to a regular brew of maxwell house or yuban, so If you are a hardcore starbucks style coffee drinker this wont suit you. The french vanilla flavor is subltle and not sweet. I compliment it with french vanilla creamer. I only wish Amazon had a better price for it. I can get it a Target of 4.49 each thats 8.98 compared to 13.92 amazon in currently charging. So you really are paying for the convenience of home delivery and the avoidance of ending up buy 100 bucks worth of stuff you dont need at Target.
