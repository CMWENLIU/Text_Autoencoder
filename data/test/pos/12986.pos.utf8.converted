This is the brand that Pampered Chef sells for an outrageous amount of money for a tiny amount. Cinnabon uses this type of cinnamon as well. This price is perfect, please don't raise it, and the flavor is phenomenal! My product arrived with an issue and the seller promptly (within 3 hours of sending my email to them) corrected it. I've never had service like that before from an internet purchase or otherwise. I will order again and try more of their products.<br /><br />I have Saigon cinnamon in my house that I'm finishing up and this is far more fragrant than the Saigon cinnamon or any other cinnamon I've ever tried. You won't regret buying this product or dealing with this seller.
