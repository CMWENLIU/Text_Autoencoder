I add 1/2 cup of the original Fiber One cereal to the 1 cup serving of the Fiber One Honey Clusters. I also add some dried cranberries (Craisins).  The taste is excellent and packs a full day of fiber.  Fiber One Honey Clusters has 13 grams of fiber and 160 calories. Fiber One Original contains 14 grams of fiber and just 60 calories. So for 220 calories in cereal, plus 110 calories in 1 cup skim milk and 25 calories for the 1 T. craisins you get 355 total calories and 28 grams fiber in one bowl!  Sure beats donuts and coffee and you're not hungry till lunch!
