I have a sensetive enough stomach that I can't always tolerate solid food and Carnation has become an absolute godsend. Unlike some meal replacement drinks (Boost and Ensure come to mind), Carnation really lacks any kind of synthetic taste. In fact, I love the taste to death instead of previous options I've tried which were just something I had to endure to avoid passing out from not eating.<br /><br />It's got a great mix of vitamins and minerals that really do make it a meal in a glass. Wonderful product and, from a practical standpoint, it makes you more likely to actually have breakfast since it's so easy to mix up a glass and you can drink it while you're doing other parts of your morning ritual.
