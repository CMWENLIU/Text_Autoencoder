This paste is the greatest invention since popcorn.  I use it in several of my recipes.......... veggies, soups, pasta, pizza, casseroles and the list goes on.  I always purchase 12 tubes at a time and even give them as hostess gifts to friends.  They love it also.  So convenient and you don't waste an entire can of tomato paste when you only need a tablespoon or two in a recipe.  Very concentrated and lots of flavor.
