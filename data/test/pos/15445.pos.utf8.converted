My daughter-in-law gave me a 2 pound bag of Red Star yeast last Christmas and it has lasted me 8 months, baking a loaf of bread almost everyday.  I take a small amount and put it in one of my old 4 ounce yeast jars and freeze the rest and it has kept very well. In my opinion Red Star is the best yeast out there, but not always available at my supermarket and you can't beat the price, 2 pounds for $14.88 sure beats $8.99 for a 4 ounce jar at the supermarket.
