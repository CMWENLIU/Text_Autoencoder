I ate a lot of Top Ramen in college, as every poor student does. But I actually liked it and continue to make it today. I had a bunch of it in my pantry. Then friends turned me on to this stuff.<br />If the only Ramen you know is what you had when you were broke, you MUST give this a try. It's unbelievably good.
