A great food for my little dog. He certainly likes it better than all other foods that I fed him before I discovered the Paul Newman Organics. It's healthy, nutritious, and certainly provides for good metabolism too. It's not cheap, but maybe in a long run it saves you some money on vet bills. Also, it's good to know that a good part of the price that you pay for it goes to animal shelters.
