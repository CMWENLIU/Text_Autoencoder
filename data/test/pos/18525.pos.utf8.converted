I've always been a loyal ZICO coconut water fan, and so was extremely excited to hear about the new packaging...and I have to say that I was MORE than pleased! The new blend that they use reminds me more of the Thai coconuts I grew up drinking and the bottles make it so convenient for me to carry around with me since I'm always on the go.<br /><br />The concentrate does not bother me at all, as after doing some research online, my negative opinion of the term has completely been changed. It doesn't mean that it's not natural or that anything is added - it simply means that they have taken the water out and shipped over just the goodness (which by the way, is WAY more environmentally friendly than shipping water across the world!!) and added back the water through reverse osmosis. Hey, if you're a POM or Sambazon fan - then you know that they are from concentrate too!<br /><br />The flavors are super yummy too! I'm in love with the Pomberry. Another thumbs up about the bottle? It's 100% recyclable!! YUP! 100% - including the cap! There aren't too many products out there where you can recylce the cap. Also, it's made from number 2 plastic which means that it's made from recylced materials. I used to find it hard to recylce the carton packaging, as not many facilities knew how to recycle it since it's made from so many different materials.<br /><br />Two thumbs up on the new packaging and the new taste profile!! Now only if they came out with more flavors...
