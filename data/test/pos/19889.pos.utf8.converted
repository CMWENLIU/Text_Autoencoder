I love chocolate, but not the added fat and sugar, so I couldn't wait to try these. They lived up to my expectations. Delicious. When I get the urge to eat a candy bar - I roll a banana into these cacao nibs for a delicious and healthy treat. For a yummy cocoa substitute in cookies and cakes - I put them in the coffee grinder until powdered. Or just a split second in the coffee grinder makes tiny "chocolate" chips for our smoothies. This is the best chocolate product I've found so far.
