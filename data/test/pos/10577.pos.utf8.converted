I have a 3 year old Jindo rescue who was skinny and had a poor coat when we got her. Since we started her on this food, her double coat is soft, shiny, and thick.  She's put on solid weight, muscle lean weight, not fat. And she loves this stuff!  The first few days we gave her the Science Diet the shelter gave us free. She wouldn't eat it. We got some of this, and she scarfed the bowl in seconds.  We even give it to her as little treats during the day.  I read online that Jindos can have issues with corn and I had another dog with corn allergies so Natural Balance is a perfect choice. Just read the ingredients. Nothing you should avoid.  And the price through Amazon with free shipping is less than at the local big box store.
