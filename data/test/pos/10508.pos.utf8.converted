This kit is in a very well contructed box self-contained "Showcased" deck of 78 cards and 48 pp book which explains the Major Arcana with both reversed with upright meanings. The Court Arcana and pip cards are only upright meanings so I made 4 pp of reversed meanings for the minor Arcana pasted in back of my book.  The meanings appear to be those of the authors since they wanted to differ apparently from the RWS standard.  The artwork is outstanding and very clean and the symbolism is well drawn. I recommend for Initiates/Journeyman levels....Blessings...
