This is my new favorite cereal. I had given up cereal when I cut way back on carbs. Plus, most of them were just full of sugar anyway. When I decided to add some healthier carbs back into my diet I was looking for a healthy cereal with protien and fiber, but without sugar. I love cutting up a banana and topping my cereal with it. That way I don't have to add any sugar or sugar substitutes. Ocassionally I use stevia if I don't have any bananas or other fruit.
