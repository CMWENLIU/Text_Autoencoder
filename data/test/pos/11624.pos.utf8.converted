I was very excited when my chocolate glazed donut k-cup started brewing for the first time because the first thing that hit me was an overwhelming aroma of donuts!  Almost over-powering and definitely doesn't help that I'm on a diet!  However I was kind of disappointed to discover that the taste did not come anywhere close to that amazing smell I had just got a whif of.  I tried equal packets and then later I even tried real sugar with no luck.  Then I tried stevia powder, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006QRU5ZQ">30 Grams (1.06 Oz) Stevia 95% Steviosides Bulk Powder</a> and this was the golden ticket!  If you get this flavor, use stevia as your sweetener.  It's literally the closest thing to actually eating a chocolate glazed donut!
