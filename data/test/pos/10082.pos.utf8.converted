This stuff is great - I usually eat it right out of the jar.<br /><br />My roommate picked some up in New york and I think it took us all of two weeks to run through the first jar.<br />It's great in smoothies, tea, with raw cheese (mmm!), and with peanut and almond butters. I feel totally fine giving it to my daughter as a sugar replacement because it has nutrients and isn't processed, and she likes it too.<br /><br />I'll also mention, anecdotelly, that I used to have some pretty severe food allergies. Now, there's some research that suggests that eating raw, local honey may help boost your immune system and reduce your allergies to natural plants in your area. I wouldn't put all that much stock into this concept, except that after I finished my first jar of this honey, I found that I could eat apples again! And Almonds! and raw veggies and even Hazelnuts, which I used to be REALLY allergic to! It had been over a decade since I had been able to eat these without itchiness, swelling, and nausea. It might be coincidence, but it happens to be the only thing I changed in my diet or lifestyle. Who knows?<br /><br />Regardless, this stuff tastes great and you should get it for the taste alone if nothing else.<br /><br />Enjoy!
