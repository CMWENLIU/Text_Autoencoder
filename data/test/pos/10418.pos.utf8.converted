Now here's the thing, I'm a huge fan of imported Italian hard salami. As a sandwich meat, a pizza topping or appetizer, there's not much better as far as I'm concerned. Now domestic brands are a different story. My experience with them had been uniformly bad, until now. This Bridgford Hard Salami is excellent. Not just OK, but stands up well compared to any of the imported Italian meats I've tried. If you like salami, this stuff is the real thing.
