I am utterly amazed. I had no idea beef jerky could be so good!. I purchased the Teriyaki flavored. The taste is great. It taste so pure. It's neither dry nor too oily. I feel good knowing the cattle are fed sweet grass that is also organic! All of the ingredients used to make the teriyaki sauce are also organic.<br /><br />Here is the list of ingredients:<br />Organic Beef, Water, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Soy Sauce (Water, Organic Soybeans, Salt, Organic Alcohol) Organic Pineapple Juice Concentrate, Organic Apple Cider Vinegar, Sea Salt, Organic Paprika, Natural Smoke Flavoring, Organic Black Pepper, Organic Onion Powder, Organic Garlic Powder.<br /><br />Best if consumed within three days after opening.<br />Allergen Declaration: Contains Soy Ingredients<br /><br />Also worth mentioning:<br />Gluten Free<br />Organic beef raised without added hormones and without antibiotics<br />Beef raised on organic feed<br />Cattle are never fed animal by-products<br />No artificial ingredients, no added MSG (Monosodium Glutamate)<br />No preservatives, No nitrite, No erythorbate<br /><br />High Protein/Low Fat - This is a snack I can enjoy, guilt free!<br /><br />The meat was mostly very tender. There was one or two pieces with gristle in them, but this IS beef jerky, after all. I highly recommend it.
