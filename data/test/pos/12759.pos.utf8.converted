I have struggled for over a year and a half in giving my cat a daily pill.  She foams and vomits easily and she and I both dread this daily torture. I have tried to bury the pill in every treat and delicious food I could think of, including raw liver, but as soon as she smelled the pill (which has a disgusting bitter taste, the vet says), she wouldn't try anything.  But this week I tried the chicken-flavored pill pocket, and my cat just about stood on my head to get it out of my hand so she could eat it.  She goes absolutely nuts for it and doesn't detect her pill at all.  The worst part of my cat's day (the worst part of my day, too) is now great! I recommend this stuff highly.<br /><br />Note: After a few weeks, my cat decided she no longer liked the chicken flavor, but continues to eat the salmon flavor one. But sometimes she won't eat it unless I wrap some small cat treats on it like a sandwich. You don't need to use the entire pill pocket for small pills - I pinch off what I need, and so the bag lasts a long longer than usual.
