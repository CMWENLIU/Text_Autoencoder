This marzipan is moist and delicious.  It tastes much better than the German brand ( in the red foil paper ).  I use it just as marzipan or in chocolate treats.  When rolling it out it is good to use a little bit of powder sugar to prevent it from sticking onto the rolling pin.  Because of it is not too dry you can re-roll it out if you are cutting out or needing to roll a thin layer for a cake.<br /><br />This is also the cheepest place to get the marzipan, it is about 5.50 to 6.50 a tube out in the market.
