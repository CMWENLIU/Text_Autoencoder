The website for this product calls it "The world's best tasting honey." I believe they have every right to claim that title. This does not taste like honey, nor like sugar. It is a light, mild, nectary, delicious substance unlike anything you're likely to have tasted often before, if ever. Mixed into herbal teas, it enhances the flavors and makes them sparkle. Absolutely a necessity for the tea addict or anyone who prefers natural sweeteners over processed sugars.
