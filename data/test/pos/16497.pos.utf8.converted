I bought the chef master food colorings because I am in charge of making hard tack candy at our church as a Christmas fund raiser.  I like this coloring because I can get a variety of colors and the colors are true.  McCormicks has a very limited selection of colors and we have to mix colors which aren't very accurate when we make more batches of the same color.  The generic food color avaible in the stores are never accurate and the colors arent clear.  I am thankful I fould the Chefmaster food colors.
