The package arrived on time and the orange blossom water was secured well. I have had things like this arrive broken and leaking all over the inside of the box. It has a very strong floral aroma with a little bitter kick. And just to clarify this doesn't contain any sugar, it is more of an extract. It went well in my Ramos Gin fizz cocktails which, I made all week for Christmas and new years entertaining family and friends. Only had to use a few drops or else you would be smelling orange blossom all night. I havn't baked anything with it yet, athough I think it would work well in many different pastries. There are may European recipies that call for it. Store in a dark cupboard away from other food beacuse it will start to flavor everything. Overall a very good product and it is what it claims to be, orange blossom water.
