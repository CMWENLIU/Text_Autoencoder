So I have tried all the Torani vanilla syrups and this one tastes the best to me by far. The french vanilla is too sweet and fake tasting, the plain vanilla is fine, but this one imparts a more intense vanilla flavor. I'm a huge fan. My kids mostly love it to flavor their milk, cold or hot. Hey, it doesn't stain like chocolate milk, so that's a plus. Also adds awesome flavor to cocoa. We're not coffee drinkers but I'm sure people use it for that, and I have also tasted ice cream flavored with this that was the best soft serve ice cream of my life. Also delicious made into Italian sodas, using club soda, 2 oz. of syrup, and some half and half. Be forewarned that the three-pack usually comes in plastic bottles, rather than glass. A plus for shipping, maybe not as pretty sitting on a shelf, and less recyclable. Just FYI.
