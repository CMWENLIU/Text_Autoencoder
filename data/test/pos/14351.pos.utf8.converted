I love Goji berries and often eat them after my weight work-outs. I also throw them in the following cereal (raw & vegan), they make a perfect harmony in this recipe as follows:<br /><br />Oatmeal Cereal Raw & Vegan - the Most Wholesome Cereal on Planet Earth: inspired to me by the Wonderful Magic Man, Peter Ragnar:<br /><br />1/4 to 1/2 cup whole Oat Groats these look like buff colored pieces of rice, you will need to sprout them in filtered water one to two nights beforehand. So they will be ready for you in the morning. I think two days of soaking is best.<br /><br />1/4 cup Goji Berries<br />3/4 cup blueberries<br />slices of banana and any other berry or fruit as you wish<br />1 cup refrigerated filtered water (trust me you want it cold..tastes good)<br />1/2 t vanilla extract<br />Himalayan Salt or Sea Salt<br />4 brazil nuts (soaking unnecessary because these don't have enzyme inhibitors)<br />2 T hemp seeds (Nutiva brand is good)<br />a bit of honey optional<br /><br />In good blender pour 1 cup water, salt to taste, vanilla extract, hemp, brazil buts and honey if you want it (I don't use it). Blend up really well until a smooth creamy milk forms - this is amazing milk folks!<br /><br />Now put all soaked oat groats, berries and whatnot in a cereal bowl. Pour over with the luscious milk you just made and eat slow, chew well because the stomach has no teeth :o) Add more a salt if needed.
