This is one of my favorite K-Cups out of the 20 or so we currently have on hand.<br />It just has a very satisfying flavor, not too strong, not too weak, not bitter.<br />I put about 1/3rd of a teaspoon of sugar and about 3 Teaspoons (one tablespoon) of 1/2 & 1/2 and its just perfect.<br /><br />I personally buy this from Bed Bath & Beyond because amazingly it is cheaper there.<br />I get 20% off coupons from them about every 3 weeks, in fact get 2 because I have my wife get them at her work also so we get 2 a month plus sometimes a $5 off of $15 coupon on top of that.<br />So I pay $8.15 (after tax) for a pack of 18, that works out to $24.45 for 3 packs (54 K-Cups) so much better deal than $38 for 48.
