I tried this, and liked it- now I am loving it!<br /><br />I have bought all the flavors, and prefer Fruit Punch, Strawberry, and Sweet Tea the most.  The flavor is not for the shy - a little goes a LONG way. In some ways, it IS similar to Crystal Light, which I have enjoyed for decades ( For those mature enough to remember, that product was launched with Linda Evans, at the time, Dynasty's "Krystal"... Crystal Light is also a KRAFT product).<br /><br />MiO is easier to use, and has better color, and is super-easy to transport- to the office, to the gym, where ever you might be. The fruit punch reminds me of a popsicle at a theme park ( in my case 60's and 70's!). Needless to say, a very positive memory!<br /><br />So far, I have used it in regular and sparkling water, and enjoyed it.  Have also used it with a SodaStream unit, with excellent results.  But the best is with crushed ice - much like a "Sno-Cone" -beyond GOOD!  Just put it in a personal, or regular size blender, add some ice, and 30 seconds later - a refreshing treat! PERFECT after a workout, a run, or just a long day.<br /><br />(okay, I admit, one could add a dash of vodka to that as well, for an evening event....yum!)
