These Made in Nature unsulfured organic Calimyrna figs are the BEST tasting dried figs I have ever eaten.  They are wonderfully sweet and make a fantastic after-dinner dessert for those with a sweet-tooth, like me.  They look a bit different color than the sulfured ones in the grocery store, but don't let that put you off.  They look like they have been dipped in powdery sugar, a bit . . . but one bite and you'll be hooked like me.
