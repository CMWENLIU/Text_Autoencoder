In my personal opinion, this butter is an excellent way to put essential fat into your diet, deliciously!  The value of good quality fat and oil in the diet is not only underrated, it is touted as 'bad' for you...that it will make you fat.  But it is far from the truth...the body needs good quality fat for proper functioning! It is the hydrogenated and heat processed fats that the body doesnt know what to do with so it is stored as 'fat'.  The movie "Lorenzo's Oil" had a profound effect on me regarding the healing power of natural oil, particularily in neurological conditions...and having a son with Asbergers (mild autism) again shows me how natural oil works in healing, though in his case it was with cold pressed Castor oil.  But less I digress further, let me just say this butter is wonderful!
