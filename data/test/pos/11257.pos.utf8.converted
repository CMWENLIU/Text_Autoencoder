OK, if I were to tell you that you could get pretty much all the goodness of peanut butter without the calories, this, my friends is it.<br /><br />I'm a physician, so I'm always conscious about whether a product is more hype than fact, but in this case, PB 2 does not fail. It's made from impeller pressed peanuts (essentially the waste product of producing peanut oil), and this "waste product" is nothing short of rich peanutty taste without any oil in it. As a result, it's only 45 calories/serving compared to 200 calories/serving in regular peanut butter.<br /><br />Making this into peanut butter by reconstitution with water is a little tricky though. For those true peanut butter afficionados, you'll instantly spot the difference. The flavor is certainly there, and if anything, PB2 is more peanutty than natural peanut butter. But what it has in flavor, it lacks in texture. If you like the "stick to the roof of my mouth" sensation of peanut butter, you maybe disappointed because its texture is a little more pleasing to your tongue. However, as another reviewer said, the key to this product is SMOOTHIES.. let me say it again... SMOOTHIES.<br /><br />Oh my god, I make smoothies with this and it is incredibly delicious. Ridiculously tasty with peanut taste, and ZERO guilt. I only wish we were sold what would otherwise have been a waste product of peanut oil manufacturing process for something less than the cost of real peanut butter -- but if that were the case, then this wouldn't be capitalism, now would it?
