Our cat received an Eek mouse for Xmas from a friend.  He loves it, even though he ignores his other catnip toys.  Unfortunately, our elderly toothless poodle also loves this toy, even though he has many others, and so there have been some squabbles over who gets to play.  Thus, we are buying more eek mouses to keep peace in the family.
