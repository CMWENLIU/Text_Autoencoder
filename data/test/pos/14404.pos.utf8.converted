Ohhhhh.... this is fabulous.  There's a recipe inside the wrapper for some sort of lovely-looking rice salad dish using this tapenade, but we may never get to it -- because the tapenade is so delightful all by itself with just crackers or crusty fresh bread.  I love it with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FSK58S">LU Herbes De Provence Flatbread Crackers, 4.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  Great to have both the tapenade and the crackers in the house for an instant appetizer when guests drop by unexpectedly for a meal or a drink.  These little green jars are almost worth their weight in gold (okay, that's an exaggeration, but not by much), and you'll be very glad to have them on your shelf.  Beware:  they won't last long!<br /><br />Shelf-stable until opened; then refrigerate if you're lucky enough to have any leftovers.  :)  Caution:  quite salty, because of the olives -- not appropriate for people medically advised to drastically reduce sodium, but probably acceptable in moderation for most people in combination with something such as the recommended flatbread crackers, which will help offset the salty olives and make the average sodium in the combined appetizer more reasonable.
