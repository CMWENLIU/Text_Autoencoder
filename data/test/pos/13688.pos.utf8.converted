Zico's taste is the best of all the pre-packaged young coconut water I've tried.  Nothing beats fresh young coconut water straight out of the coconut, but this comes close to the flavor.  Don't waste your time on canned coconunt water - it's awful IMO.  Zico has a lower sugar content than the other brands I've sampled (14gms/serving vs. 20gms/seving).  It is isotonic, high in potassium and rich in electrolytes.  You can practically live on it!  If you have an upset stomach, it settles it immediately.  I have an aunt who was hospitalized and unable to eat.  Her potassium levels were very low.  She was able to drink this and keep it down.  It helped improve her postassium levels and settled her nausea.  A friend of my  9 yrs. old son's had a "tummy" ache while we were at the state fair.  I happened to have a Zico in my purse and gave it to him.  He loved it.  His stomach ache ceased and we were able to enjoy our time at the fair.
