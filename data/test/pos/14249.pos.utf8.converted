Leonidas is a wonderful brand of chocolate and previously hard to get in the US if you didn't have a friend flying to Belgium every week. I found these on Amazon and now my daughter thinks I'm the best mom. They are made without preservatives so they need to be well cared for and not kept around too long. That is not a problem since they taste as great as they do. This package offers a variety of flavors and types to try as well. We really enjoyed having it around. Too bad it didn't last very long before it was gone.
