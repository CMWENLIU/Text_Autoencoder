I bought a mini buster cube for my miniature dachshund to help build up his rear leg muscles a few months after he had back surgery.  All I had to do was put a few pieces of his dry dog food in it and he figured it out quick.  It's 7 years later and it's still his favorite toy.  He can even pick it up with his mouth and carry it around the house.  He puts it in his dog house and bangs it around for hours.  He literally plays by himself and keeps busy all day in the yard too.  He doesn't even care that I stopped putting food in it years ago.  I had a few of these break after wear from the rocks in my last yard but I keep about 5 at a time in my house in case the company decides not to make them anymore.  I bought one for my friend's pomeranian and he doesn't stop playing with it either.  He now has two.
