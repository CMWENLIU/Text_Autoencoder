Dog A: 42lb male corgi/lab/border collie<br /><br />Dog B: 32lb female border collie/Godknowswhat<br /><br />Dog A will crunch and bash to shards anything that resists him.  Dog B will spend hours nibbling to bits anything that interests her.<br /><br />Kongs stuffed with peanut butter and frozen survive all this but provide only 15min or so of dog engagement.<br /><br />The Tug-a-jug is Dog A's favorite, but after a month he'd already managed to crack the thing in a bunch of places, after two months it was a miracle it was still in one piece, after three months it finally gave up.  Dog B not too interested in Tug-a-jug.<br /><br />The cube interests both, and neither has managed to do significant damage.  Biggest negative is that it's very noisy as they're pawing, nosing, batting it around the floor.
