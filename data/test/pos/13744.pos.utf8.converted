Although the large block is somewhat of a pain to break up for use, the taste and texture are worth it.  This chocolate is very smooth and velvety, with a rich creamy taste, no "nutty" overtones, no bitterness, just rich chocolate flavor.<br />I've used it in brownies, ganache, and truffles, and it worked well for all three.  It also makes a lovely medium thickness enrobing.
