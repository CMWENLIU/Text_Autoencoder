We like to smoke chicken and turkey and I always soak the birds for about 24 hours in a brine solution with quite a few spices, liquid smoke and Maple Flavoring. It gives the birds a wonderful flavor. I make Maple Nut Rings for special occasion breakfasts/brunchs which calls for Maple Flavoring. I also like to make my own pancake syrup so I use a lot of Maple Flavoring. It is so convenient to be able to buy these large bottles and always have it on hand. Thanks Amazon, you made my life a little easier.
