So I haven't tried EVERY coconut water available - but I do love Zico in the reclosable bottle.  It is from concentrate, yes...it does include coconuts from more than just Brazil, yes...it does kinda taste like milk at the bottom of your cereal bowl - Yes! I love it! I know that it tastes a little different from the Zico U get in the tetra pak, so maybe they should change the name of it - still a great beverage! I have it set to autoship monthly! Yummy...<br />I also like O.N.E. coconut water - the flavored ones are good, the plain natural flavor is still my best from them.<br />I also like Zico in Passion Fruit & I also like the natural Zico in the tetra pak.<br />No, I don't work for Zico!
