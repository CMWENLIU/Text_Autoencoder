My family first became hooked on Annie's products when we tried the delicious mac and cheese.  I've been on something of a crusade to eliminate high fructose corn syrup from our diets, as well as unsavory chemical preservatives.  My five-year-old has always been a big fan of fruit snacks but I normally hate giving them to her as they are no healthier than candy.<br /><br />While I won't claim that these are 100% healthy, I can say that they are completely free of all the artificial and highly processed junk that goes into their cheaper counterparts.  Yes, they are pricier than other "fruit" snacks on the market but the higher price tag on these comes along with higher quality.  I'm more than willing to shell out the extra cash if it means that my daughter will be ingesting fewer chemicals and less corn syrup.<br /><br />What's more, my daughter not only loves the taste of these, I do as well.  Other brands have a very artificial too-sweet flavor while these taste like real fruit juice.  I was surprised at how good they are as I normally avoid fruit snacks because of the taste.  I also like the texture of these.  They are chewy but smoother and will dissolve in your mouth if you suck on them.  They don't have that weird hardness or lumpy sort of quality that other fruit snacks do.
