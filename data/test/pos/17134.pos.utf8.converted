Let me just start by saying that I am the kind of gal who cooks for her family and tries very hard to either buy local grown or when those aren't available, organic products.  I tried the Really Raw Honey - OH MY GOSH!  Hands down - the BEST honey I have ever tasted!  When you open the jar, you notice it has a beautiful fragrance!  It tastes like honey and flowers - it is so smooth, flavorful, delightful!  No preservatives, no heating, no pesticides... Just like if you went out, took a knife and scraped a bee-hive.  Soooo GOOOOD!<br /><br />One reviewer had an issue with it not being "organic".  I would just like to say that the bees are local to where the manufacturer is.  They pollinate on flowers that have not been sprayed, harvested.... They are providing as pure and free-from-by-product honey as you can get on the market today.  And remember - organic, although better than off the shelf produce/meat/eggs... does not mean free-range, local grown.... That is a whole different topic that I could go on about.<br /><br />A note on the cappings (crust as some put it), that is a very important and enzyme dense feature.  It is to be eaten.  It is DELICIOUS!!!!!  When you take a bite, it is sweet - like the honey, and chewy like a yummy treat.  Then after that, it is chewy like gum - which is bits of wax from the honeycomb.  This is highly sought after and full of good stuff for your bodies.  So, don't throw it away - eat it!<br /><br />I recommend this honey A++!!  - And EAT THE CAPPINGS!!!
