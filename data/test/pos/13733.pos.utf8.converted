My daughter is 5 months old and has been struggling since the day she was born with constipation, gas, and reflux.  We've tried formula after formula after formula, nothing but vomit and severe constipation.  Finally we found a formula that helped with her constipation but she was still having problems with her reflux, even with added rice.  The drs however continued to say she was at a steady growing rate so there was nothing to worry about.  Well, one day I ran out of formula and ran to the store to pick up some more.  FORTUNATELY, the store was out of the Similac Alimentum.  Nearing her feeding time, I was in a rush, so I glanced over the other formulas to find one that would be the closest match.  I just happened to pick up Similac Sensitive R.S. Now not only is she not spitting up, she's staying full longer, sleeping through the whole night, and SHE'S NOT GASSY OR CONSTIPATED!!!  HURRAY!  Another minor pro is that it doesn't reek like the Alimentum does.  Kind of smells like Vanilla Flavored Ensure.  I called all my friends just days after buying the product and recommended it to everyone.  I couldn't be anymore grateful.
