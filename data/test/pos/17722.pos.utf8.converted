I was getting bitten up every night. I bought 2 of these units and put one on the floor by my bed and one under my living room couch. I was amazed to see how many flees ended up on the pad. I found the best results when I kept my door open letting cold air in my house. it was about 50 degrees and the traps became extremely congested with fleas in that one day.
