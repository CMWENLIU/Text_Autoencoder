My plants are only about 3" tall right now and I'm getting ready to repot them, but they've germinated and grown well so far!!  I've bought a lot from this company and have been very satisfied with each purchase!!  I do tend to repot the seedlings fairly early since it's difficult to tell how moist the soil is from the medium used and the fact that it's in a can, but every seedling that I've transplanted into a more typical container with media that I'm familiar with has done very well!!  I will definitey buy more from this company soon!!
