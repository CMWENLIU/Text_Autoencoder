The truth is, you almost always get what you are paying for. In the case of this line of teas, you are just a tiny little bit above the average 'value' curve. The Stash Premium teas are not my 'number one' white teas but they are a solid 'number two'. The kind I drink almost like I drink water, several cups a day.<br /><br />I drink the Green-White (this one) and the 'all-white' versions alternatively for a little variation. They are both good and this combination reminds me that I used to be an all-green tea drinker until some 2-3 years ago when I switched to all-white. Now... I'm in a more moderate mood :)<br /><br />Oh, I subscribed for one box delivered every other month - check the grocery section if you are interested and the option is not available on this page. This takes another 15% of the price and you get free shipping even when you are under the $25 limit. And you can cancel any time.
