<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00112GBO0">Dilmah Premium 100% Pure Ceylon Tea, Loose Leaf Tea, 4.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />Absolutely the best tea I've had in years.  I most often brew this tea in my Sunbeam Tea Drop machine using distilled water and it is suberb.  The aromaa is full and the taste is brilliant.<br /><br />I first came across this tea in a Singapore hotel room brewed in tea bags using tap water.  It is also very good in this form.  From my experience I think it would be difficult to get a bad cup!
