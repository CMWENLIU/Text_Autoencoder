I've always loved dark chocolate, so when I saw this I had to try it. It took a little getting used to-I don't cook with it, I just eat it, but once I got used to it, it was the most intense chocolate I had ever had. Dark chocolate is in the news these days-it has a lot of antioxidants and fiber and other compounds that are very beneficial. Chocolate is a plant food-it's just one that gets loaded up with sugar and milk and fat, so the health benefits are only to be found in the really dark stuff, like more than 70% cocoa. And what health benefits-preliminary studies are showing that dark chocolate can lower cholesterol and blood pressure and even increase insulin sensitivity, which can benefit diabetes and help a person lose weight. I was eating a little of this chocolate every day for my daily fix-it only has 70 calories a square, but now that it's not just an indulgence I get to feel good about eating it. And if you don't want to eat it, it's really good for baking-it's very smooth and melts and blends easily into whatever you're preparing.
