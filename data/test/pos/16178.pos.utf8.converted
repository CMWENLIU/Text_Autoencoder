I have tried Vita, Zico, One, Amy & Brian, and Nirvana coconut water is the closest to natural, no sugar added coconut juice. My parents have coconut trees and I'm used to coconut water straight from the coconut, with a straw! Not only is the packaging close to a real coconut, but the flavor is smooth, less processed-tasting, and very sweet without any added sugar. Coconut water is a very personal choice. People prefer one brand over the next for their own reasons, but give this one a shot. It has its own fresh taste and as close to cutting down a coconut as you're going to get.
