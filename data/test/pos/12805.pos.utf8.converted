First of all, these are delicious!  I love caramel and there is plenty of that on each lollipop. Then the green apple flavor in the center is tart.  A perfect combination!!  You get lots of these for the price and none of them come broken!<br /><br />I have noticed that when I nibble on these i don't get hungry and i don't have the munchies.  Any overhang at the top of my jeans disappears when I keep these around.  Each pop is only 60 calories.
