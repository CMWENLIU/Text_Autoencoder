I bought this product by accident at an Eastern European grocery store.  I thought I was buying instant coffee.  Once the surprise wore off, I decided to give it a try anyway and see if I like it, and, as an alternative for my guests who have given up on caffeine.<br /><br />I loved it!  It is smooth, and, as it combines with hot water, it makes a nice, cappuccino-like foam.  I use cream, no sugar, with it, and find its taste very pleasing, with just the right amount of bitterness, and no aftertaste.<br /><br />Inka is now a permanent coffee substitute in my home.  I like to drink it in the evening when I usually avoid caffeine, or as a treat any other time of the day. Great product!
