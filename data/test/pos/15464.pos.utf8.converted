I ordered this caramel, and in the beginning I made a huge mistake and gave it a 3 rating because even though I thought I was doing everything right-I wasn't. I have learned so much from practicing with my caramel apple maker. It deserves a 5 rating now that I've learned what to do.<br />For you novices: Use Fit fruit cleaner to get the wax off of the apples, then make a mixer of half lemon juice half water and wipe the apples off with it-allow to dry before dipping in caramel. This will help caramel to adhere. Also, do not dip the apples when the caramel is really hot. I believe the 'magic' number was to dip them when the caramel was approx 86 degrees. Place in fridge for 15 minutes after dipping and then take them out.  I do not like my caramel apples cold...but if you do, they can be left in the fridge.<br />This caramel is by far the best one sold on Amazon or any other site. It tastes just like Rocky Mountain Choc Factory Caramel, and theirs is homemade!<br />I give it a total 5 stars now!!
