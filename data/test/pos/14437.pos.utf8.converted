I feed my 3 boys only all natural foods (both dry and wet).  I will even cook for them on occasion.  One of my cats, however, is so incredibly picky, I have gone through countless types/brands of treats and everything to find something he likes but for the last 5 years he will only eat his dry food.  UNTIL NOW!! This is the first canned cat food that he absolutely savors.  I was amazed and pleased to see him get excited when I open the can and lick his bowl clean.  It makes it much easier to maintain a healthy feeding schedule with all of them and I am exceptionally pleased with the results thus far.  Thank you and PLEASE get more in stock!!
