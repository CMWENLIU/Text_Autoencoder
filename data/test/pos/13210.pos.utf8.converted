I have really been into Yogi tea and trying them all! I have all the green teas and after a month of testing them I conclude that this one tastes the best. Most say the Simply Green tastes the best but to me it was far too boring. I got used to all the special herbs and natural flavors and the Simply Green had none added. This one tastes great like a slight peachy lemon natural flavor. I do not like the artifical flavors at all nor do I like the artifical sweet taste added by too much stevia leaf. This tea is the perfect green tea flavor.<br /><br />The Super Anti-Oxidant variety of tea tastes good except for the licorice. The licorice is okay in the bedtime and calming teas but does not taste right in green tea. The Kombusha tea is also great but it has a berry taste, which is good and natural, but I prefer the lemon flavor of this tea. The Slim Life tea is also very good but it does have a blueberry flavor to it, but it is worlds better then the Fasting tea, which tastes the worst of all the Yogi teas. I just love the Yogi tea positive messages don't you?<br /><br />Wise quotes from Yogi Tea by Yogi Bhajan<br /><br />"The universe is the stage on which you dance, guided by your heart."<br /><br />"The purpose of life is to enjoy every moment."<br /><br />"Delight the world with compassion, kindness and grace."<br /><br />"Laugh because that is your purpose in life."<br /><br />Happiness is every human beings birthright."<br /><br />"Be happy so long as breath is in you."<br /><br />"Real happiness lies in that which never comes nor goes, but simply is."<br /><br />"Travel light, live light, spread the light, be the light."<br /><br />"Your greatness is not what you have, it's what you give."<br /><br />"Practice kindness, mercy and forgiveness."<br /><br />"Bliss cannot be disturbed by gain or loss."<br /><br />"Compassion has no limit.
