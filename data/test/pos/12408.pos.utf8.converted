I agree that this product may cost more from Amazon, but that's not a deal breaker for me.  The reason I buy from here is because my wife has 18 months of a 2 year tour in Afghanistan left to go and Amazon will ship certain food items directly to her APO address.  This is less expensive than me buying cases of the stuff and having to re-wrap and mail via USPS (neither Fedex nor UPS ship to APO addresses).  Even where she is, she has access to a microwave and bottled water, so these make a nice snack for when she has some down time and needs to eat.  Way to go Amazon!  I'm a Desert Storm veteran, and there isn't much better than getting care packages from home.  My wife took care of me when I was overseas.  Now it's my turn.
