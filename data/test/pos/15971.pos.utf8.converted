I've been trying to reorient my diet such that I eat much less animal products and much more fresh fruits, dried fruits,  fresh vegetables and nuts. My goal is to eat much less refined sugars. trans-fats, animal fats and cholesterol. Supposedly, this should help my health in a number of ways. So far the only noticeable things are a drop in weight and blood pressure. That's a start, a good start.<br /><br />One of the items I'm increasing is nuts and seeds. I find a good place to get these items in bulk quantity is Costco, particularly with their Kirkland Signature brand. Of course, a lot of people don't live anywhere near a Costco, but the branded items are still easily available online.<br /><br />Yesterday, I picked up a big bag (3 pounds or 48 ounces) of almonds. The almonds are fresh and tasty and unsalted. I actually, prefer salted nuts, but I'm also trying to cut the intake of salt so it's good to find these unsalted ones. The quality is excellent. About the only negative I can note is that the bag doesn't hold up well after being opened so I'll have to transfer the contents to a large zip-lock bag to attempt to maintain freshness. We use these nuts for meals and snacks, plus our three-year-old toddler enjoys them with his meals. It's a good product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
