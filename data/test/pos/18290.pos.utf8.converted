My cat enjoys feeding balls, and my dog loves his big Kong Wobbler so I decided to see if Nugget could manage this toy as a food dispenser. He is very interested in it and periodically bats at it to see if food will come out, but so far he hasn't mastered the necessary technique. We show him how it works by pulling on the attached attractant at the top to spill food out for him. That always gets his interest, but he just hasn't figured it out for himself yet. We haven't given up and are still hopeful that a light will suddenly come on. The concept is fine and the interest is there, but the motivation may not be high enough for a cat. I like the idea of my animals "working" for their dinner because it adds interest to their lives. It's what they are meant to do. We will keep trying with this toy and I'll update this review if we are successful. However, at least for my cat who is used to feeding toys and clicker training, this toy requires input from the human(s) in the family. That's not a bad thing. It's too easy to put the food in a bowl and walk away. Interaction is something we should encourage with our animals and the Kong Cat Wobbler requires that in our situation so far.<br /><br />(UPDATE) Nugget has mastered the Cat Wobbler at last and loves it! This took several months with us helping him spill food from it. At some point recently , he got the idea that food would come out if he just pushed it around enough. He uses the plume to pull it over. I love this toy for him because it is a real challenge. Nugget has cerebellar hypoplasia with moderate motor problems. He cannot jump or climb vertically, and he has an uneven gait. For him, any new skill or accomplishment builds confidence and makes him happy. I give him the Cat Wobbler with pellets (not filled because it would be too much food for him) several times a week when we go to bed. I hear him working with it throughout the night; he has emptied it by morning. It was worth the time showing him how to use it because it gives him something interesting to do for several hours at a time.
