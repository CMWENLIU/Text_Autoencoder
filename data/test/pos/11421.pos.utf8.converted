I have reviewed these macadamias several years ago and I am updating my review based on recent frequent purchases. I have purchased macadamias from literally every growing region on the globe, including South Africa (Planter's), Costa Rica , Australia (Trader Joe's) and Hawaii.  Nothing, and I do mean nothing, has the fresh, intense, buttery and unique aroma of Mauna Loa macadamia nuts. Other macs all taste mealy, bland, tasteless or rancid, including most generic store brands. The rich, volcanic soil of Hawaii continues to produce the finest macadamias on the globe in my opinion. If you are a distinguishing connoisseur and aficionado of the nut, you must have them or face serious withdrawal symptoms.<br /><br />Unfortunately, despite the purchase of Mauna Loa by Hershey Chocolate Corp. in 2004, the availability of Mauna Loa products, particularly on the East Coast of the U.S. remains challenging. This is because of increasing global market demand, shelf space limitations and slotting fees charged to supermarkets and other retailers to stock the items and recent unfavorable climate conditions on the Big Island.<br /><br />Mauna Loa has had significant price increases since 2010, particularly with the 4.5oz canned nut products. However, these nuts are still worth every penny if you purchase them fresh. I have since switched from purchasing these in the 4.5 oz. "6-pack", to 11 oz. pouches with Amazon's "Subscribe and Save" Subscription, because they are a bit cheaper and there is no additional charge for shipping.  Mauna Loa has finally embraced putting easy to read Best Buy ("BB") dates on its products and this makes it easy to insure that you are getting fresh product. I hope I have made this an easy nut to crack!  Happy Munching.
