This is the best honey in the world. The taste is above anything you could buy at the grocery store.  The buttery golden taste is wonderful with pears, cheese and crackers.  It is a fast "throw together" platter when you have un-expected company that is sure to wow your guests.<br /><br />And their related body care line is fantastic!  Made with the best all-natural ingredients, my skin had a noticeable glow and lips felt smooth and silky.
