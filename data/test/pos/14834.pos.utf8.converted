<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FA15EK">Honey Maid Grahams, Cinnamon Crackers, 14.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>Arrived packed much better than usual from Amazon. Opened box and found crispy, fresh crackers, couldn't see any badly broken ones in first package. Have 6 months left until "sell by" date but will be sharing with friends, family and coworkers and will freeze them until wanted so this will be a non issue for me. Another clearance sale so I feel I got good value for my money.
