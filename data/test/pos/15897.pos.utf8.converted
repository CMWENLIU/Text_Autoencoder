I checked the Mayo clinic website, and vegetable juice is an acceptable way of getting one's vegetables. These 48 cans cost about 56 cents each with subscribe and save, and there are only 30 calories per can and 80mg of sodium (3% RDA). Each can is a serving of vegetables. They taste very good too.
