The other flavors of Amazing Meal sound rather yummy but they contain "Natural Flavors"  this is the only version that does not.  I even went to their website to make sure.  The addition of natural flavors is the only reason why I chose their Original over the others.<br /><br />I find the flavor is somewhat bland & absolutley is grassy!  Lately I've been mixing it with organic coconut water.  The quality of the coconut water affects just how tasty my "meal" turns out.  Sometimes I will add a few drops of organic liquid Stevia.<br /><br />I'm not sure what it is about this product that keeps me coming back for more.  I use Amazon's Subscribe & Save for it!  I'm not nuts about it, yet here I am drinking another glass!<br /><br />It is a quick & convenient way to get something nourishing into my body.  I find it is very refreshing.  I have never used it in a smoothie but when I do, I think it will be out of this world!  I have also mixed this with organic almond milk, organic rice milk & organic coconut milk.  The rice milk tasted the best probably because it was the sweetest.  The coconut milk was so so.  For now, I plan on sticking with the coconut water because I think it is the healthiest option & it tastes good enough for me.<br /><br />Overall this is a great way to get your greens & more in one quick "meal" though snack would be more appropriate as I don't find it filling for long.  Usually I pour a small amount of my liquid of choice into a glass, add a scoop of this (scoop is included), use a fork to stir it really good.  Then I add the rest of my liquid of choice & do lots more stirring.  I leave the fork in the glass & stir as needed because the fiber bits tend to settle on the bottom rather quickly.  Thankfully the amount that settles is substantially less than other mixes I've had.  I had a Organic Hemp protein shake that I flat out thought was disgusting & nearly all of it would settle on the bottom of the glass so fast I couldn't help but waste it! I'm sticking to Amazing Meal from now on.  Lesson learned!<br /><br />If you want to do something healthy & want to avoid all sugars & artificial sweeteners this mix is the way to go!  All Organic & GMO free!  If you are one of those sugar junkies who gets those "fast food" smoothies thinking it's healthy when it's just a sugar bomb you will surely hate this stuff.  For the rest of you health nuts lets raise a glass in good health!
