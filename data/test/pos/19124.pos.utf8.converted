Best catsup-ketchup product ever made. My maternal grandmother would buy it and I remember like it was yesterday(43 years ago) first trying a bologna sandwich with that catsup. The flavors were so much bolder it was quite a revelation for a kid who had never eaten food before that was remotely spicy.<br /><br />It's fun to have this again. Please never stop making it.<br /><br />I also love brooks' other products as well.
