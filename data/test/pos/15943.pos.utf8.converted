Now first let me start off by saying I am not a big chocolate fan. That being, the taste I percieve as being "great" may be different from yours. If your looking for that rich chocolate flavor then this beverage may not be what your looking for. This is by no means "chocolate flavored water." Its got flavor (as long as you stay with the first two size settings) and is so easy to make why bother with anything else. The bottom line: If your looking for a cup of hot chocolate with a powerful chocolate flavor, these k cups are not for you. If you are looking for a cup of hot chocolate with a moderate amount of flavor then give these a try.<br />When trying these k-cups I did not add anything else before serving (ex: marshmellows) I hope you enjoy and dont let the low review scores point you away from enjoying the easiest cup of hot chocolate you have ever had.
