Searching for a low-sugar wheat-free puff to offer my baby girls, I discovered Plum Organics with much joy. Clearly superior to all other major brands of baby puffs for digestive health, who's better than Plum for my family? I've successfully battled to contain a serious digestive disorder called Ulcerative Colitis for over a decade in part by special attention to diet. In that time I've learned even moderate amounts of wheat causes problems by creating an overgrowth of Candida yeast in my system. Some know this as a sensitivity to gluten or sugars, others suffer without realizing as so many foods contain wheat or high amounts of sugar. For me it's cumulative folks, a little in nearly everything really piles up. I notice my body getting too much as soon as I begin to heavily crave breads or sugars.  Before you know it, that gummy gluten renders me 90% incapable of absorbing nutrition altogether.<br /><br />Back to the Puffs... wheat is high in gluten, but the oat and rice based Puff offered by Plum Organics stands out with ingredients more gentle on digestive function. This is in addition to providing all the stuff HappyBaby remains conscious of, like sugar and vitamin content. Rice is gluten-free and minimally processed oat may be too, but many still leave it off the list of gluten-free foods due to typical cross-contamination issues with lots of wheat growing and processed alongside oats. Small amounts are ok with me anyway -- I'm looking for regulation rather than elimination here. So I'm happy to introduce all these foods to my daughters at healthy levels.<br /><br />How about the sugar content? Super low, and only natural organic fruit, vegetable or cane juice is used (not corn-syrup as another reviewer erroneously reported -- [...]). And can we really get upset about a little blueberry or sweet potato juice temporarily staining a cloth when you account for their health properties? Regulate, read the labels for yourself and take joy in offering your kids a simple, low sugar, high vitamin, low gluten snack.<br /><br />Oh and must say, I love that they're mainly just puffed air with a fantastic balance of nutrients. 1/2 cup or about 75 pieces per serving keeps my little dears engaged in motor development and feeding skills for a while without concern for dietary imbalance.<br /><br />Bunch of facts, all packed up to help someone out there enjoy a little extra peace next time they offer Plum Puffs to their kids.  Live well!
