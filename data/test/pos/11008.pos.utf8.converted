This is one of the best 20-year balsamic vinegars for the price.  I'm American-Italian with a fussy palate inherited from my Dad, and this sweet, syrupy balsamic is amazing on salads, fruits, vegetables ..... just about anything you can think of.  I don't use it in cooking or marinating because it seems wasteful to me.<br />Try it - I think you'll enjoy it!<br />Ciao Tutti !!<br /><br />Update: 07/01/11<br />Unfortunately, I have not purchased the La Piana for several months now. The flavor and texture has changed dramatically, in my opinion.  Also, the labeling is different from my earlier purchases.
