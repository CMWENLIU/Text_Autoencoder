I know you have heard it before, if you want movie theater popcorn you need this Coconut oil, this really is the secret to great tasting popcorn, I use it in my mini bambino (which looks like a movie theaters popcorn maker but really small) for me and not recommend unless you watch it when you cook it, but I use my measuring scoopers that came with the popcorn popper, this Oil (Its funny when its hot, it is a liquid, when it us under 75-80 degrees it is a solid, but no matter, just scoop it out (I have made about 10-14 poppings and it has only went down about a little over a inch in the tub  again for me, I use the 1 scoop of oil (no need to make it a liquid as some people say, when you dump it in, the heat of the pan makes it liquid) then I pour in the scoop of popcorn (Orvil redinbocer (sorry bad spelling) from walmart $4 jar) 1 Tablespoon of butter, a little salt and let it pop, for me it not only smells like th theater, but the taste is great, I pop extra, put it in ziplock bags and take it with me, friends ask for a taste, and before you know it, its gone.  Good deal, this tub will last months if not a year.
