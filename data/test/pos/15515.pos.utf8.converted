If you've ever had freshly caught tuna in a restaurant, it can be very disappointing to come home to a can of chicken of the sea. ;)<br /><br />Of course this American Tuna can't quite be as good as a nice seafood restaurant, but it's the best you're going to find in a can.<br /><br />It has more than twice as much Omega 3's as the nearest competition and less sodium too.<br />The great thing about this tuna is it doesn't have that metallic taste the Wild Planet Vietnamese Tuna. This tuna is pole caught in/near the USA, and packaged in the USA as well. But you can read that in the description.<br />Something else that is accurate in the description is the fact that you don't have to drain. You can eat it right out of the can, and there will only be a very small amount of fish oil in the bottom when you're done.<br /><br />If I were to say anything negative it would be that there is slightly too much salt for my taste, but they do have a non-salted version.<br />And of course the price is a bit hard to swallow, unlike the yummy tuna.<br /><br />I hope Amazon carries this soon as the seller (American Tuna) is a bit slow on shipping compared to Amazon. (Who isn't though?)
