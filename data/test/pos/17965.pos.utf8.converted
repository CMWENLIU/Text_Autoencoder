So what am I, who rarely drink coffee, doing reviewing a coffee brewer?  Most of my friends and in-laws are avid coffee drinkers, and when  they plaintively asked for coffee, the routine was:  find coffee maker in basement, rinse carafe, locate fresh coffee and filters, and, eventually, get a pot of coffee.  Then I tried a cold-brew coffee process; it's excellent coffee, but you have to plan ahead, because steeping takes several hours.  Not good for drop-in guests.  And people who wanted decaf at the same time were out of luck.<br /><br />Then I saw Keurigs in use in my office, and even being used to brew coffee and hot cocoa to order at a museum cafe.  I buy Gevalia coffee to serve the aforementioned friends and in-laws (and to give at Christmas), but Gevalia only makes the pods for the Tassimo machines.  Unfortunately, the selections available for the Tassimo are very limited, and it seems a little fiddly to use.  As one blogger put it,the Tassimo/Keurig rivalry is like Beta and VHS, and Keurig is clearly winning.  But I read review after review that blasted the Keurig home machines for breaking down after a few months, and, for a machine that costs over a hundred bucks minimum, that's unacceptable.  Then I found out about the Office Pro.  I went to our local Staples and saw an Office Pro and a home machine side by side on the shelf, and it was no contest; the Office Pro was much more sturdily built.  I, too, had a Staples coupon, and I was able to get the machine for $116, including tax.<br /><br />It's very easy to set up; I had no difficulty priming it, and I was making coffee for my husband right away.  Helpful hint:  the removable water tank had a strong plastic smell; it didn't seem to affect the coffee, but it did affect the tea.  I ran the tank through a short dishwasher cycle, using only a small amount of detergent, then rinsed it repeatedly after it came out.  Problem solved.  Helpful hint two: use filtered water or bottled water for the best taste.<br /><br />The brewer is incredibly fast; it takes a couple of minutes to heat up, then it's ready to go. There are something like 200 varieties of coffee, tea, cocoa, and even hot cider K cups made, and there always seem to be good deals on K cups somewhere.  Dunkin Donuts even makes K cups now!  The My K Cup will not fit the Office Pro, but the Ekobrew fill-your-own cup does, so my Gevalia won't go to waste.<br /><br />Now, everyone is happy.  When my band comes over to rehearse, everyone can have what he or she wants.  If I want tea or cocoa, it takes less than a minute.<br /><br />For some reason., Keurig really discourages commercial machines in a home setting, which is really shortsighted.  Yes, it's briefly noisy when the pump is going, but my commercial fridge and freezer make a lot more noise.  But this machine, unlike some of their home models, is built to last, and that's really what matters.
