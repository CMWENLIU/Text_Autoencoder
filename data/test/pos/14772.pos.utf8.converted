Get a tall mug, fill it 1/4 full with milk. Microwave till it is very hot.  Add 1 extra heaping teaspoon of Droste.  Mix till it dissolves completely - be sure to get the sides and bottom.  Add a strong pinch of stevia for sweetening.  Fill the rest with milk and heat.  You can also use a pot to heat in if you want to share.<br /><br />You can add sugar instead of stevia if you want, but why not save the calories for a second cup?
