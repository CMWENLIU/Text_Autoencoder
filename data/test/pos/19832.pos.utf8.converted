I found Carmelina's after researching tomatoes for pizza sauce, spaghetti sauce, etc., and first tried them after picking up various brands at Whole Foods and other local markets & delis in my area. I can now say these are my definite favorites of all the kinds I've tried, be it DOP certified or non DOP certified. I also like that they have no basil or citric acid added, just tomatoes in puree. I can always add the other flavors when or if I choose.<br /><br />  Price wise, Amazon can't be beat. Average price I paid locally was $1.70 per can, (plus my time and gas to get there), compared with Amazon's price of approximately $1.20 a can. The free super saver shipping was an added attraction, and after placing my order, was pleasantly surprised to receive them in 4 days. Now that's what I call service!!!<br /><br />  They came packed in a Carmelina box from Italy, which was then put into an Amazon box in which some brown craft paper was wadded up on top to fill the space. As a previous poster has said, I also received 9 dented cans, but not so bad that I can't use them. Also on the plus side was the fact that the expiration date was months if not a year better than cans I picked up around town.<br /><br />  All in all, I'm very happy with the service provide by Amazon, and the product provided by Carmelina's, and will be a repeat customer in the future.
