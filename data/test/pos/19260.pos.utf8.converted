I love this little device - it doesn't take up too much space in the cabinet and is so easy to use and clean up after. I read the other reviews so I knew to start making food before my little one was ready for solids. This turned out to be perfect - whenever I see fruits and veggies on sale (over ripe organic bananas .35 / lb) or we have more than we need in the fridge I just turn it in to baby food. One batch in the Beaba fills an ice cube tray, which keeps me from making too much of any one thing. That way in the future if I want to serve chicken & rice with apples, I just thaw a cube of each and mix. If I had to steam everything in one set of pans, then get the big blender dirty I would give up on making my own baby food in a hurry! I love knowing exactly what is in my baby's food and being able to offer a much larger variety than what you can get in the jars - bell peppers, asparagus, mango, etc.<br /><br />Skip the specialty storage containers - ice cube trays are perfect. Cover with plastic wrap, freeze, dump in to a Ziploc bag. Also skip the cookbooks - no need to create fancy mixes ahead of time and you'll start feeling like you are spending longer on baby food than dinner. I was disappointed that the Beaba did not come with basic instructions for categories of fruits, veggies, meats (just a few sample combo recipes), but I found this great website that has all the basics, fancier recipes, nutritional info - without paying anything or giving them your email address: [...].<br /><br />Haven't encountered any of the "brown film" issues - being careful to take the lid off the steam compartment immediately and leave it off when it is put away.
