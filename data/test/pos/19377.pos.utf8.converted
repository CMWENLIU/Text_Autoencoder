I love this dog food. I was looking for something that was higher is protein to help my dogs fur and one that had higher quality ingredients with no by products. This works well for my dogs ( Maltese/ Yorkie mis and a Maltese/poodle mix). I had read reviews that higher protein was not good for smaller dogs so I called my vet and was assured that it would be good for them. My Morkie has always had stinky breath but I have noticed a slight increase in it but that is taken care of mostly with teeth brushing and puppy breath strips. My Maltipoo's breath is unaffected and fine. The only downside to the food is the cost and being able to find it. We currently order it online but are trying to get a local private pet store to carry it.
