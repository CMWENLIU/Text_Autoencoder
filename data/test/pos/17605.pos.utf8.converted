You won't believe this is instant coffee!  It is rich, dark and smooth - no bitter taste, no watery brown stuff like you're used to with instant coffee. We also grind our own (imported Italian) beans and use a high end stainless steel coffee maker, and Mount Hagen Instant is the best shortcut to a good cup of coffee we've ever found. Just boil the water and mix in a teaspoon full. It's also great for stirring into hot cocoa, using for recipes and making a great Irish Coffee!
