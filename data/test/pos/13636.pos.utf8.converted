At the time of this writing, Amazon does not carry this product.  I previously had been able to obtain the Yakisoba Cheddar from a local store, but they no longer carry them.  Just finished the last carefully hoarded tray tonight, and signed up with Amazon to be notified if they are stocked.  Now I'm out, and VERY VERY SAD, because these noodles are FABULOUS.<br /><br />It's unbelievable, and in all honesty I can't imagine how Maruchan does it.  No butter or milk added, made in a microwave, and they're the best cheesy pasta product you can buy!?  How??  Yet, it's totally true.  Puts anything from Kraft or Velveeta to shame.  Great flavor, great texture, and so easy!  My only complaint might be that one tray is really more food than one person ought to be eating... and yet, it's hard to share. :)<br /><br />If someday soon Amazon does carry these, I highly recommend trying them.  Just leave me some too, k?
