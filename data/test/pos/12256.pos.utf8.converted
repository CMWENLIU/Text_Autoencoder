This peanut butter is so good! It goes directly from jar to spoon to mouth. If you're used to eating JIF or Skippy, this will be a different experience. First off, when you first open a jar, you'll have to stir it a little. I find that I only stir it one upon opening, and I don't have to stir it again... until I pop open a new jar. This peanut butter is smooth, creamy, perfectly sweet, and totally delicious. You can really taste the honey!!! And the peanut flavor is so fresh. I made a sandwich for my fiance who has been using Skippy for years. He said that you can't really compare the two. It's like comparing McDonalds to gourmet food. But this tastes more natural and somehow... healthier. I'm doing to keep using this. Maybe I'll bake with it some day. For now, I'm happy to eat it from the jar or if I'm feeling "fancy" I'll make a PB&J sandwich.
