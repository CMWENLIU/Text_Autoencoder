I have tried many olive oils and this olive oil is absolutely the best olive oil I have ever tasted.  More and more while watching food/cooking programs that are actually filmed in Italy, and especially Sicily, it is this olive oil I see on the table.<br /><br />The other reviewers are correct when they state Mario Batali uses it, as I have seen him use this oil on many occasions.<br /><br />The price is a little higher than some, but when used on fresh bread, or a little over Minestrone, or poured over fresh pasta dishes will make you a believer too.
