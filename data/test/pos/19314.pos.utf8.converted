This is a great sugar-free lemonade, and it's a great way to save money while still enjoying a flavored, calorie-free beverage.<br /><br />I looked everywhere, trying to find a product like this that is made with Splenda, and Arizona is the only one on the market that does not have Aspertame (that I know of).<br /><br />I actually use one packet for 32 ounces of water since I don't like a strong, overly-sweet beverage.  It works equally well at full-strength.<br /><br />I just wish Arizona would market more non-tea mixes.  I try to avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evenings and, as far as I know, all the other Arizona mixes contain caffeine (in the form of tea).
