This tuna makes all others seem like flavorless moist sawdust.  The texture and flavor of both the fish and the oil is exceptional.  I don't waste even a drop of the oil.<br /><br />After eating this tuna my husband was inspired to try to preserve tuna in a jar.  Despite having high quality tuna and a good recipe, the homemade version was inedible in comparison to the Ortiz jar of tuna.  I don't know how they make it or where all the wonderful flavor comes from, but this is the only tuna I am willing to buy now.
