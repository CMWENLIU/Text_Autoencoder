Sumatra is a dark, fragrant coffee with hints of chocolate. It has a subtle aftertaste and is as tasty with desert as it is served black. I'm not a big fan of most Starbucks' beans, but this one breaks that trend. My wife and I find ourselves going back to this bean as our staple coffee bean of choice. If you enjoy a darker cup of coffee with some subtlety, this is a great option.
