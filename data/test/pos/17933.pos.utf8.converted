I used to purchase the Stevia Plus product.  However, I found it to sometimes get clumpy and hard in the packets, making it hard to mix in my tea.<br /><br />I saw this product advertised, so I tried it.  It tastes great and I have so far had none of the issues I experienced with the Stevia Plus product.  I highly recommend Simply Stevia.
