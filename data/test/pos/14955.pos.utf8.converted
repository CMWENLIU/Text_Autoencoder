This is by far the best manuka honey that I have used. We have been using it on a very bad rattlesnake bite on our dog, the vet said if she survived she would probably lose her leg or have to have skin grafts, it has been 32 days and it is close to healed and so far don't see any scarring and all hair is growing back. This was a very large wound and very deep when all the dead flesh fell off.
