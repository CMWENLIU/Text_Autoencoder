Providing you haven't been permanently indoctrinated by the food police and medical researchers (who change their recommendations every 5-10 years without so much as an apology for their previous now-proved-incorrect recommendation) against the use of all fats and butterfat in particular, this can be a very useful, convenient, and I suspect healthy product. There is no end to the ways one might profitably use this product - - - as a coffee creamer, in preparation of hot cocoa, mashed potatoes, to fortify non-fat yogurt with the fat that was supposed to be there in the first place but was removed by the powers-that-be, etc., etc., etc. The secret to using it successfully so that it mixes well in liquids is this: place the amount of powder you wish to dissolve in a cup, glass, or other container, then add a VERY small quantity of liquid (milk, soy milk, hemp milk, rice milk, etc. all work well) and stir briskly with a spoon (plastic does the trick) until dissolved. This takes only a few seconds. The important thing is to resist the temptation to add more liquid than required initially - - - the amount of liquid should be less than required to cover the powder. After stirring well for a few seconds you will have a very serviceable liquid cream to which you can then add the amount of total liquid you wish to use, stirring again as you do so. I find it works better as a coffee creamer if the liquid cream is stirred well with somewhere between 2 oz and 6 oz of milk, soy milk, hemp milk, etc. before using. Otherwise it has a very strong cow's milk taste which some may find unpleasant. This method of preparation works well also for mashed potatoes. When using in something with the consistency of yogurt, just add a spoonful or so straight, without prior dissolving, and stir well for a moment. With proper use this product is so convenient, tastes so good, and improves the consistency and texture of certain foods so much you will not want to do without it once you try it. Oh, and if you are hesitating because of the price, keep in mind that a little bit goes a long, long way and the product has a long shelf life without requiring refrigeration.
