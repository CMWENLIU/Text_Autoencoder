Pro Tip: For a stronger, tastier soup, use a 1 cup measuring cup (the pyrex style) but fill beyond one cup to the rim. (If I had to guess, I'd say about 1.25 cups) Pour in sauce pan, bring to boil, add soup packet. Leave at rolling boil for 2-3 minutes (depending on how firm you like the noodles) then pour into bowl and eat. -- Absolutely awesome this way.
