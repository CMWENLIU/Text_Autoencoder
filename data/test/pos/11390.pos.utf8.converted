After using an "all-natural" gum (that contained cane sugar) and getting my first cavity in 12 years after 6 months of use, I knew I needed a switch. I heard about Xylitol from a naturopathic student, that basically, the bad bacteria in your mouth feed on Xylitol but they can't digest it, and the good bacteria can eat it, so they proliferate. I thought I had tried other Xylitol gums in the past and didn't like them, but I decided to give this another chance because I want a gum to chew after meals that is actually good for my teeth. I was pleasantly surprised at the Spry gum! It has a great flavor (which goes away pretty soon after chewing, but it's a nice shot of good taste), but the best part is that the gum itself has a great texture to it and continues to be fun to chew for as long as you want. It doesn't even turn hard after drinking water like most gums do. I am a medical student so I did a search of the research literature and the claims of Xylitol are more than proven. However, all of the literature and research studies explain that you need 4-12 g of Xylitol a day (no need to get more than 15), but the average piece of gum has .75-1 g, so you'll need to chew at least 4-5 pieces a day to get the dental benefits (chewing it only sporadically, i.e. once a day, did NOT show any dental benefits). No problem for me, I chew one after every meal (I have 5-6 a day), and love having the fresh clean feeling as well as knowing that I'm doing something great for my teeth.
