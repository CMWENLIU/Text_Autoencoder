Ok I know what your thinking...soy milk...gag!<br /><br />I thought that way for a long time, but I really wanted to get off the cow juice for many health reasons.  So I started to try the various products out there and came away with a bad surprise - they were sweet!<br /><br />I guess in a attempt to deal with a perceived aftertaste many of the manufacturers have decided to add sugar.  Now I don't know about you but to me cow milk does NOT taste sweet - especially the 2% or 1% variety I was drinking previous to this product - so I didn't want my soy milk alternative to taste sweet either.<br /><br />I almost gave up the search until I tried this product.  I have purchased both the already prepared version of this product as well as the dry mix you just add water to and both versions DO NOT TASTE SWEET.  They are the closest thing you are going to find to the taste of real milk - especially when well chilled.<br /><br />I have tried the Silk Brand Unsweetened and there is just something too rich and creamy about it, the texture is wrong.  I can't quite nail it down - it just seems like something I would pour into coffee, not over my breakfast cereal.<br /><br />This is the better product - give it a try, I don't think you will be disappointed.
