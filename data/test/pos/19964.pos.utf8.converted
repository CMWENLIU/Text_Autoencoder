After using the high-priced brand of Sucanat, I was a little reluctant to take a chance on this product. I wondered if this would be a case of "getting what you pay for."  Well, NO WORRIES!  This NOW Foods brand Sucanat is actually superior, in my opinion.  In side by side taste, smell and texture comparisons, this product comes out ahead in all ways.  Compared to this NOW Foods Sucanat, the other brand had a slightly "off" taste and smell.  It's hard to describe the difference, but the expensive brand had a bit of a "chemical" taste - at least the two bags that I compared.  Contrary to another review, I found that this product is slightly finer in structure and granular size - very consistent with no clumping in the bag.  The aroma and taste are rich, strongly redolent of regular brown sugar. It dissolves and blends easily.  I can't tolerate refined sugar, and this product works great for me in my favorite banana bread recipe as a brown sugar substitute.  It works much better than my substitution of honey for brown sugar. Being slightly less sweet than regular brown sugar, I do increase the recipe amount by 10 or 15 percent of what is called for as brown sugar. I'm anxious to try to develop a cinammon roll recipe using this Sucanat - what with cinammon rolls being my other favorite baked food - one that I haven't been able to eat for a long time.  This product is a great value, and I plan to reorder several more packages to stock my pantry.
