Once you try, you are hooked.  While your supply lasts you will find this to be an enjoyable addition to and diversion from the blandness that is life.  Once the warmth and spice from your last chunk wears off will soon find the world less-colorful, mundane...flavorless.  Do not run out.  This is hard to find and you will not be satisfied by other brands. Learn from my mistake and enjoy, but be sure to maintain a surplus. You won't forget twice.
