recently, my husband brought home one can of salt-free sardines in water (can't remember they type, but none of the brands listed here).  i had been watching the BBC Blue Planet series recently, and all that footage of sardine feasting by the various ocean predators must have lodged somewhere in my subconsciousness, because i eyed his can of sardines for 2 days before i could take it no longer, and i just wolfed it down by myself (so selfish- i know).  Even though i have always liked canned sardines, i just had stopped eating them years ago due to my unfounded fears about mercury levels (turns out sardines have among the lowest levels in the ocean for an omega-3 rich fish), and just plain laziness/ life getting in the way/ other things to eat....anyway, i digress.<br /><br />i looked on amazon and found a case of reese skinless boneless saltless in water (my husband is on a health kick), and roland skinless boneless saltless in water--both the cheapest on subscribe and save.  after ordering these two cases, i thought, well- i actually like oil packed. As an accommodation to my salt-avoiding husband, i also ordered the crown prince brisling oil/no salt.  BUT, just to round out my midnight sardine buying spree  (that one can- or maybe the Blue Planet series- really wet my appetite, i guess), i also ordered these Viga oily, salted, skin and bone fish for myself.<br /><br />ok. well.  i've eaten nearly (my husband stole some of one can as i was scarfing) 4 cans of the viga since yesterday when i got the shipment..... i know it's not good to have too many omega-3s, so i'll try to control myself now.  But,  YUUUUUUMMMMMM!!!!!!  i went back on-line today, and ordered what turns out to be the last case... sorry folks.  i'm really hoping Amazon brings these back.  i can't believe how delicious these Viga lemon are.  the slice of lemon (in the can, as noted by one reviewer) is similar to the moroccan preserved lemon (i love moroccan food)-very soft, very mild, nearly sweet lemon slice.  the flavor of the fish is a thing wonderously oily and richly satisfying- as only skin and bone can add, i believe.  Although I also liked all the other sardines i bought, the no oil, no salt, no skin and no bones....well, it's a health thing i guess- but i prefer those with hot sauce or onions or mustard, etc.... the reese and roland also tasted like tuna in a can- not bad for that kinda thing- i was thinking i'd need to actually mix them with mayo for a sardine-fish sandwich - again, not bad- still feels good after eating, but not something quite i'm craving-- unlike this viga with lemon.  i think i could eat this everyday, easily.  quite delicious.  Re: the brisling crown prince variety, i think those who like the size/shape and lightly smoked "traditional" flavor will like the crown prince.<br /><br />I enjoyed one review (can't remember which sardines) from a guy who mentioned that he started his cat on sardines, and that his cat is like a "new cat."  I love these so much--- i wonder if i'll become like a new cat?<br /><br />anyway, if you like, as another reviewer said, "the real thing,"  i would highly recommend these.  Since i'm not an expert on spanish sardines, i just don't really know if these are not as complex as yet another reviewer noted (see other non-lemon Viga reviews)-  but, all my Viga cans and boxes were clean with expiration dates (unlike the reese) and, i thought they were just super scrumptious fabutastic.  if these are the less flavorful /less complex types of spanish sardines, i really will make an effort to try other varieties!
