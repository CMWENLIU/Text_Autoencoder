This order came practically before I finished paying for it!  The coffee flavor is delicious, and the fact that it makes an 8 oz. cup rather than a 4 oz. is even better!  The pods are individually sealed in foil, which keeps them fresher.  Just a helpful hint, though...I wasted a couple of pods by putting it in the 'double pod' Senseo holder...it came out watery...thought there was something wrong with the coffee maker.  Then I put it in the 'single pod' holder, and it was perfect!
