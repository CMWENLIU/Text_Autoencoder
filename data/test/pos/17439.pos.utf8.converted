I had a problem with my order for dry curry leaves (they shipped fresh ones), which was resolved the next day by this supplier, to my complete satisfaction.  They gave me a full refund for the inconvenience!  The fresh leaves are better anyway, and I can dry them myself in the fridge.  They also gave me some advice on cooking with curry leaves.  I will be buying from this supplier again, as they are very helpful!
