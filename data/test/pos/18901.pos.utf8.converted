Excellent product. Hard to believe such a good soup comes from a pkg. This is not Campbell's Smoky Ham and Pea Soup with lots of little pea chunks.  Rather, expect a smoother, European flavor and a few small tasty noodles. Just right on saltiness; don't believe other cmts that it's too salty.  Molto bene!
