My cat was recently diagnosed with diabetes. I searched everywhere and talked to everyone about food. This food stood out from all the rest. So, I bought it. He loves it and has gained about two pounds - a good thing as he'd gotten too skinny. But, the good news is, he's coming off the insulin. Today the vet took him from three units to two and said he's probably going to be able to come off because of this diet.<br /><br />So I can and do highly recommend this to you for your cat. If you're lucky enough to have a non-diabetic cat, do feed it to your fur babies. Diabetes is a horrible thing and expensive to treat as well as frustrating and hard on the pet parent and the pet. If you feed this food, it's likely your pet will never get diabetes.<br /><br />I generally buy it at PetSmart of PetCo. You can get a coupon for $5 off on the Blue Buffalo website. But wherever you get it, get it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Today my vet said I could take the cat off insulin. And I thank this great food for that. Hopefully he won't get it again. Be sure and tell your vet if your cat is on this food and it has diabetes because it may change the amount of insulin it is given and how its monitored.<br /><br />-- Susanna K. Hutcheson
