I love these special dark chocolate pieces!  I use them in cookies, and to make my truffles.  Take 8 oz of chocolate pieces and melt it ( I do it in my microwave at 50% power-60 sec then 30 more until melted you have to stir between heating times), I use my mixer to combine the ingredients. Combine 1/3 cup heavy cream and 2 tablespoons of honey Or Agave or Maple Syrup and heat the combination until bubbly.(I use my microwave for about 1 to 2 minutes) Mix it in with the melted chocolate and add 2 tablespoons of room temp unsalted butter.  I pour this into a loaf sized pan lined with parchment paper and refrigerate.  Then I cut them into small squares and dip them into bittersweet dipping chocolate.  People don't like these, they LOVE these!<br />Enjoy, Mary
