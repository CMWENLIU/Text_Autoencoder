I got these chips during one of my exertions into my local Asian food store and have continued to purchase them as they were a huge hit in my family.  The crunchy corn twists have just a hint of sweetness to add a delightful interest to this fast food experience.  No overwhelming flavors, and I couldn't detect a distinct honey flavor - but I didn't miss it either.  Highly recommended.
