Got this for our 4 month old Frenchie and she loves it!  I only let her chew it for 15-20 min per day.  I noticed if she chews it longer than that she doesn't seem to enjoy it anymore (like a kid that gets unlimited candy on Halloween, they'll keep eating it, even if it's making them sick).  It also gives her bad gas :  But she loves it so much, so I deal with it.  Each piece lasts about 2 weeks when I give it to her on a limited basis.<br /><br />One complaint - small pieces flake off sometimes, making a mess on my rug.  I always put a sheet down before I give it to her.  Oh the things you do for your dog...<br /><br />You can find this for less on other websites.
