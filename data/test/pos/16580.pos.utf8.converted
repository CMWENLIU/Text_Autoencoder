I tried this product after researching menopausal heart palpitations and internal tremors on www.power-surge.com.  The relief was immediate!  What surprised me was the improvement in many other aspects of my health.<br />No more headaches that feel like a tight cap binding my scalp.  Reduction of my migraines. No more nightmares (brought on by hormone fluctuations).  No more "internal earthquakes" or buggy-crawling sensations on my skin.  Less anxiety (formerly triggered by hormonal changes). No more weak nails.  Monthly acid reflux greatly reduced, sometimes none at all. Greatly reduced frequency of colds, flus and sinusitus.<br />I chose the Calm with Calcium since I am dairy allergic.  My body assimilates it well, much better than calcium & magnesium pills, which had little to no effect on the above-mentioned problems (in ANY ratio).<br />Overall, I feel much calmer & more energetic.  Not a cure-all, but definitely has raised the quality of my life.<br />I highly recommend this product!
