I breastfed my daughter for her first month of life, but she had severe problems with gas, bloating, and constipation.  We switched to a milk based formula, but the problem continued.  We then tried lactose free formula.  The problem lessened, but did not cease.  By her second bottle of Alimentum, she was using the bathroom without stimulation, her stomach was no longer hard and bloated, and she actually lays around smiling (without needing to be constantly held).  This was important as I have 3 other children.  My only regret is that she was 2 months old before we figured out how to keep her little tummy from hurting.
