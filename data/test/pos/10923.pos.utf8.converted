If you are west indian you know that this product is a must have for your kitchen... am a tnt chic and it beats having to buy a dry coconut and not sure if its even useable or not and having to crack it open to grate .... love it .. love it .. love it .. it disolves perfectly without leaving any lumps with warm water
