Bob's Red Mill powdered non fat milk is far suprior to the supermarket brand.  Perhaps it has more milk solids.<br /><br />I like it.  I prepare a drink with  2/3rds cup of water, 3 tablespoons of powdered milk, 3 tablespoons of no calorie vanilla syrup, and five ice cubes.  Put it in my Hamilton Beech mixer and come up with a thick shake.  Good source of calcium.  My latest bone density test showed an improvement over the one I had done three years ago.  I will continue to purchase this item.
