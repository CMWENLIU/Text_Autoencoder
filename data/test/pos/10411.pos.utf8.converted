As a vegetarian, I have enjoyed Worthington's Super Links for years.  Last summer (2008), they became very difficult to find in ANY local stores and I got nowhere with the company when I tried to find a place to buy/order them.  One day, I tried a search on Amazon, found them listed and before I could order, they were out of stock, much to my disappointment.  However, Amazon was wonderful as they sent me an email to let me know they were back in stock, at which time I ordered a case.  THANKS, Amazon!!!<br />As for the product, we enjoy them broiled or grilled.  They are simply the best tasting hot dog substitute on the market.
