This halvah is from the old New York City days.<br /><br />The package dripped oil.  I didn't care.  It was a glut of halvah.  I didn't care.  My arteries crackled as I cackled.  I didn't care. (They are using some partially hydrogenated oils now unfortunately.  But death comes to all of us, so eat.)<br /><br />This stuff, if you like it, is so addictive, you can use it for a tranquilizer.  I used to buy this brand by the chunk in New York at the deli counter of the supermarket.  It still tastes the same.<br /><br />The price is definitely right.<br /><br />It was great.  Amazon, you little devil, what did you do with my waisteline, or shouldn't we mention that?<br /><br />Counting calories?  Lock the stuff away and only allow one really caring friend to feed it to you at decent intervals.  Otherwise, chomp on!  It really doesn't get much better than this.
