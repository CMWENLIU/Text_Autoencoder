I have my 3 boys on a Gluten/Casein Free Diet!  I used to buy three different kinds of GF/CF milk.  They each liked a different kind.  Then I read about Better Than Milk Rice Milk in the; Special Diets for Special Kids book and gave it a try.  All three of my boys love it! I don't have to lug heavy cartons of milk home anymore.  The only tip I have it to make it in the blender, the powder mixes in better that way.  We are hooked now!
