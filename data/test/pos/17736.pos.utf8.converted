I'm a big coffee drinker but had had enough coffee for the day when my wife and I went out to dinner with friends last night.  My wife orders tea fairly frequently when we go out.  I selected the only bag of Bigelow Vanilla Chai Tea and prepared my tea as my wife was helping my son choose his dinner.  I enjoyed the aroma right away and suggested my wife try it.  She enjoyed it enough that she asked the waiter to bring another bag of this selection for her to use.  It is not very spicey, which the other reviewer apparently did not like about it.  I don't believe I would have enjoyed it if it was very spicey as I was looking for something that was mellow and relaxing.  We both enjoyed it enough that I went online to buy some.
