I bought a three-pack of 16-ounce containers. They are in plastic bottles with a flip-top, which I like, you can easily drip in a few drops of food coloring versus the tiny glass bottles from the market which get expensive fast when you're using this to mix up hummingbird food (1:4 sugar to water, so 1/4 cup for 1 cup of water, etc). I understand that the hummingbirds don't care about the red dye, but I like to see what the level in the feeder is. And it just looks good. This dye seems perfect for the job, and compared to the supermarket price for the red dye in the little glass bottle this was a STEAL.
