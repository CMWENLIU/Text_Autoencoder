I am in agreement with some of the reviewers about the taste of this bread.  This is a wonderful food, especially for those of us who are watching their carb intake.  It is worth the price because you can't find this type of bread in a grocery store.  Actually, I couldn't find anything similar in a health food store.  Each slice is a little smaller than a regular slice of bread.  It does have a firmer texture than white bread.  If you are overly sensitive to some foods, double check these ingredients to be on the safe side.  Ingredients are:  almond flour; soy flour; bran flour; whole wheat flour; oat flour; sesame flour; unbleached flour; vital flour wheat; wheat germ; salt; anise seeds; maltisweet; cream of tartar; egg whites; soybean oil; dry yeast; soy protein; water; fiber gum; sesame seeds; dehydrated onions; dehydrated garlic; rye seeds; and poppy seeds.  I highly recommend this product.
