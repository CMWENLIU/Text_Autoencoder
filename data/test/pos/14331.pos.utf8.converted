Garbanzo beans as a snack? Who would have though they'd make a great snack? The makers of the Good Bean have accomplished making a relatively healthy snack that taste good. When I first tried some I did have a reaction of "this is a bit chalky." But after a couple bites I got used to the texture. These are not similar to peanuts or tree nuts in texture. I like all four flavors although the Smokey/Chili could be spicier and have more lime flavor for my taste. The cinnamon is my least favorite but it is still a tasty treat. I really like mixing the pepper and sea salt together. The only downside in my view of the Good Bean is the sodium content. 7% daily sodium is higher than I'd like (each packet is 2 servings so one packet has a lot of sodium (over 300 mg). Nevertheless, as a snack these are a great, low-fat, high-fiber option.
