I tried this on a whim, it was the organic label + no salt that caught my eye. Delish in meatballs or braised lamb chops - then finish off in the oven; or as a rub or sprinkled on anything cooked - especially roasted vegetables, such as a mix of potatoes, beets and carrots and lots of onion. Or Potatoes, Butternut Squash and Carrots and lots of onion(add a little fast fry teryaki beef strips to the pot once finished cooking, and you have yourself a tasty meal). Robust flavor.
