This is a great product. Not only is it as satisfying as wheat lasagna, it actually has a more tender quality  - more like hand made pasta. One caveat, however. Use it as you would no-boil lasagna and just increase the amount of sauce you use. I pre-boiled it the first time I used it and it fell apart. The second time, I used it right from the box and it was perfect. Cover it with foil and bake at 350 for an hour and a half. Then uncover & add cheese and bake for 10 minutes until the cheese melts. Yum!
