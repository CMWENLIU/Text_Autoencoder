I literally  spent a month reading reviews and doing research about Camu Camu powder . I finally made my purchase about a month ago and I'm beyond satisfisfied! Before using this organic/all natural vitamin C I wasn't really taking any other vitamins either. I would usually just make do with whatever comes in my vegan protein powder but then my allergies didn't get any better. Barely a day after using Navitas Naturals Camu Camu powder, my allergies started diminishing....now, it's like a different me! Watery eyes, stuffed up nose, itchy throat and ears all gone! And I don't use but  a quarter of a teaspoon in my water, that's a dash and a dash is all it takes. This vitamin C is potent in many ways than one. Pricey but excellent, a tad bitter but add any juice of your choice and problem solved! I personally prefer water.<br />Highly recommend!!!
