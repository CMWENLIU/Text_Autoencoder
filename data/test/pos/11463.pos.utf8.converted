On a scale of one to ten this one rates an 11.  You won't believe how many red rasberries there are in the MYLAR package. There is one for every spoonfull you eat.  It makes a fiber snack actually enjoyable.  German food regulations also severely limit the use of pesticides which is NOT the case for U.S. regulations.  Don't worry about it going stale and soggy as the mylar packaging keeps it fresh until it is gone. The package shelf life is longer than it will be in your home!  Enjoy.
