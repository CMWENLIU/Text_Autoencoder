I just wanted to submit a review about the actual drink, as the other two reviews are about the packaging/price and thus gives the product a low review, and I know that many people read Amazon reviews to read about the product itself, not just the sellers of the product.<br /><br />The product tastes great!  I'm not much for spicy things, but I feel this is just the right amount of spice for someone like myself who likes a little kick.  It kind of reminds me of a non-alcoholic Bloody Mary!
