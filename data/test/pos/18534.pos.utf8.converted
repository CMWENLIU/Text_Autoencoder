Tender, not too sweet or salty or BBQ flavored, and best of all no nitrates (for those like me who have a sensitivity to them). Better flavor and texture than any beef jerky I've ever had. I love this stuff... unfortunately I've only been able to find it at one convenience store so far, and it's nowhere near my house! Not very convenient. Irony?<br /><br />Anyway, I hope Amazon and/or some grocery stores near me start carrying this stuff soon. It's freakin' amazing!
