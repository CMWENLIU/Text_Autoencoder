The Benecol caramels taste very good and they work surprisingly well.<br />My cholesterol has been high for years and I couldn't take the statins because<br />of side effects.  I took three caramels a day with meals for only two months and<br />tested my cholesterol.  It went from 260 to 210 mostly because of a lower LDL which<br />is my basic problem and no side effects.  I highly recommend this product.
