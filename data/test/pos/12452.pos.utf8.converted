I was initially leery because the bottle needs to be refrigerated after opening, but the benefit of this consistency over hard cubes is hard to overstate.  You can use exactly as much or as little as you need; it can be dissolved easily in cold liquids; and the flavor is just excellent.  I've used it in everything from risotto to aash-e reshteh, and it hasn't disappointed me yet.
