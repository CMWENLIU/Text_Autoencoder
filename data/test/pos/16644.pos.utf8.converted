You will get a "bitter" espresso if your grind is too fine.  It seems many people grind beans at the wrong setting.  Using my burr grinder I set at medium to get a "sugar grain" size grind for the first test.  My grinder has 3 settings for medium.  I use the smallest medium setting.  Next I move up to the middle medium setting to test again for taste.  I can go down to the highest fine setting but I don't find that setting as tasty as the medium setting.<br /><br />Crema is easy to get so testing for flavor is the my procedure.  Crema is more plentiful at my medium settings using my pump espresso machine.  This the best bean I've used in 3 years of pump espresso experience.  Best taste.  Best crema.  I don't use sugar or any sweetner.  Mostly black (cafe noir) but I do use half-and-half (cafe au creme) or 3% milk (cafe au lait) as well.  I can make a chocolate coffee by adding real chocolte syrup.<br /><br />Your grinder may be different.  So may be your taste.<br /><br />If you grind too fine the shot is bitter, crema is less, and water flow may be poor even seeming to stop as though something is wrong with the machine.  You can test with a grind too fine if you like and the results may be as I've written here.<br /><br />Your espresso machine may be better.<br /><br />This Italian roast espresso works as drip (coarse grind), French press (coarsest grind), and espresso as described above.  It's an all-around bean.  Iced coffee is good.<br /><br />The fine, even very fine powdery grind, should make a turkish well enough but I regret to state I've not tried to make turkish.
