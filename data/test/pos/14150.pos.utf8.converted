With an annual output of more than 1,500,000 lbs., the north-eastern Indian state of Assam - situated across the border from the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan - is the world's single largest tea-producing region. Similar to Darjeeling, Assam tea is picked in a first and second harvest or "flush." While leaves from the first flush produce a full, refreshing aroma, Assam tea is particularly known for its malty second flush, whose cream- or gold-colored tips (or even entire leaves) lessen the tea's natural bitterness, thus giving it a softer, gentler note.<br /><br />Among the best commercially available Assam teas is Taylors' single-estate Special Rare Tippy Assam, which has a rich, powerful aroma, is made exclusively from tips, and is very refreshing both when enjoyed in the morning and in the afternoon.
