I've been using this in my Gaggia espresso maker for the last couple years and it has always been good, but not quite as good as Illy.  The last batch of four cans I got, however, seems to have a slightly finer grind than previous batches. In my machine it now produces an incredible crema layer on top of a truly first rate shot. I no longer lust after Illy; Lavazza is my espresso of choice.
