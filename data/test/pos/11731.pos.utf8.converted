All the reviews are right on and thanks for sharing your creative uses w/this wonderful soup.  Here's another way to use it:  with left-over chicken or fish: saute onions, a bit of garlic and mushrooms, add chicken or fish, add broth to make it somewhat or very soupy depending on your taste, add some fat-free sour cream and serve over brown rice or pasta.<br /><br />My supermarket stopped stocking this product and College Inn's White Wine and Herbs chicken stock.  They are looking for shelf space turnover and that apparently wasn't happening.  I'm SOO glad Amazon is going to have it available.<br />Can't wait!
