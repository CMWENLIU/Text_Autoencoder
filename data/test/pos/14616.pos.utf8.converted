Each pack has 10 3"x3" (approx.) squares.  If you try to eat these dry, you will most likely gag.  But, try it with anything moist (mayo, mustard, PB, etc) and savory, and it's pretty good.  My favorite is light mayo on two squares, extra thin cold cut and sprouts as a sandwich.  Just that and a big glass of water, and you'll feel full.  They keep their crispiness very well, and they don't fall apart when you bite into them.  They're very effective in terms of keeping me regular and work pretty fast in that way! I ordered from Amazon the 15-pack carton, and they came within the week in perfect condition -- not a single one appears to be broken.
