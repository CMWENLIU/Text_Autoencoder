I (and my two daughters) are celiacs and one thing the girls really miss are Goldfish crackers.  We found these at a local Safeway store and have been so pleased with the flavor, texture and everything about these crackers!  I would recommend them to anyone looking for a tasty gluten free cheese cracker and am excited to see that they can soon be purchased on Amazon!
