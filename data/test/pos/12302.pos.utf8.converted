To compare with other orange bitters: these are more aromatic-tasting and have more of a "real" orange zest flavor than Fee's orange, which are more of a "candy" orange flavor, though they differ from Angostura orange, which taste more like Angostura aromatic bitters mixed with Fee's orange bitters. This is not to say that it is better; different cocktails work better with the other two. I find that a dash of these ones turns an otherwise decent sidecar into an incredible one.
