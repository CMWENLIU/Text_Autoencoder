This 96 count box of pure deliciousness is incredible and at a great price. I started ordering these over the summer of 2010. I wanted to start speeding up my metabolism by eating 5 times a day, but was worried about eating 5 MEALS a day canceling out all of the exercising I was doing. I ate one for breakfast, brunch, and dunch (dinner-lunch). I ate regularly (full healthy meals) for lunch and dinner. I ended up losing 30 lbs. over about 4 months and was back to a weight I hadn't seen since High School. I've continued to buy this box ever since and probably will keep buying it. If anyone out there is looking for a light, healthy, filling snack BUY THIS NOW!!!
