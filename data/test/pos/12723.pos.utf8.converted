My husband and I love to make pizza and we used to either get the frozen Pillsbury dough (which always tastes like their biscuits to me and not really like pizza) or a Boboli crust. Both of those options were pricier than this and this tastes far better. You can find this dough in the baking aisle of the supermarket (with the muffin mixes usually). The prep is extremely simple and the crust is delicious, better even than the ready made dough that you can purchase. The best part is that it doesn't go bad so you can just leave one in the closet and always have it for when the pizza mood strikes. Even since we found this crust mix we have recommended it to just about everyone we know and they have loved it as well. It is just a quality product that allows you to make fresh dough for cheaper and faster than you could do it yourself from scratch.
