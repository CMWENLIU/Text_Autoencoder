We have had an ongoing gopher problem in our yard since we neighbor a large hillside. Our nicely landscaped yard and moist soil is a buffet for gophers.<br /><br />We have tried the following with a mediocre success rate:<br /><br />1) Ultrasonic repellants (battery or solar powered stakes) - This may keep them from creating a burrow under your yard, but it doesn't keep them from eating your grass at night. Waste of money.<br /><br />2) Castor oil pellets and spray (Sweeney's) - Seems to deter them if your grass is freshly sprayed. A hungry gopher will still find roots to eat and will still tear up your yard in the process. It also is an ongoing process to apply this stuff and doesn't make your yard smell to good. For the price and effort, not recommended.<br /><br />3) Smoke bombs (Giant Destroyer) - These work if you catch the gopher red-handed and quickly insert the smoke bomb in the active hole. Also, If you have a network of tunnels in your yard and find a main runway you may kill some gophers as well. The problem is that a gopher will instinctively 'plug up' the tunnel and return to it's burrow. However, I still keep these on hand in case the situation calls for it.<br /><br />4) Flooding - this may work in some cases you can drown the gopher or it will dig its way out and catch the end of your shovel. For a gopher invading your yard it will only slow it down and cause it to dig in other spots. Gophers design their tunnels in a way that their burrow is protected against flooding. You also make a big muddy mess in most cases.<br /><br />5) Rototiller - This is a sure way to evict gophers if you are starting from ground zero. be sure to keep a shovel handy since they will run for cover. This is good for new yards since it will break down any existing tunnel system. If you are planting sod be sure to lay chicken wire a few inches below the sod. Gophers love grass roots.<br /><br />Once you have an established landscape that is being compromised by gophers - the best thing to use is:<br /><br />6) TRAPS! -  If you dig up a gopher mound and find a tunnel, the gopher will instinctively 'plug up' the opening or push dirt out as it continues to dig up your yard. By placing this trap IN an active open tunnel you will catch the gopher as it pushes dirt out. This is the best solution I have found.<br />A few tips:<br />  a) Tie a string or wire to the trap and the other end to a stick or some sort of anchor. This way you can pull the gopher out since it will try to retreat when it's trapped.<br />  b) cover the hole with a bucket or box to block the light. Gophers are sensitive to light and it may choose to plug up the tunnel and not approach the trap.<br />  c) I have a low tolerance for dead rodents and choose to throw the trap away with the dead gopher. Considering the time and money I spend on my garden, $5 for a dead gopher is a small price to pay.<br /><br />We are currently enjoying a gopher free garden without poisons and smelly repellents. I highly recommend this or other similar wire traps.
