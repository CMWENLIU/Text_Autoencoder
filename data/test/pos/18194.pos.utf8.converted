Like most good things (unpasteurized dairy, unpasteurized almonds, medical advice not sponsored by drug companies, gold and silver coin as tender in payment of debt, a government that follows the Constitution etc), hemp seeds are almost illegal and hard to get.  Thank God for Amazon!  These are the best hemp seeds you are going to get, short of growing your own, which, as we all know, would be illegal in the land of the free.
