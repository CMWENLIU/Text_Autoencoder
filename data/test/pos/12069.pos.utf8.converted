This is hands down the best honey I have ever put in my mouth. In fact, it's so good that I give it annually for Christmas gifts. Watch out, though - this will spoil you for that stuff sold in the bear-shaped bottles! There is simply no comparison between this and the product carried in grocery stores. Because it's expensive, I don't cook with it. But I love it on toast or muffins, in tea, or anywhere that the honey flavor really comes through.
