When I was an exchange student living in Spain almost 10 years ago, I fell in love with the food there, most especially the chorizo. When I got back to the US, all I could find was mexican chorizo which is *not* the same as and is *completely* different than spanish chorizo. I eventually found some US-made spanish-style chorizos but none of them was quite like what I had in Spain. This is the real deal. This is exacly what I remember from Spain. And the funny thing is, that much of the chorizo I had in Spain was homemade chorizo in central/southern Spain (Ciudad Real to be exact) but this brand comes from northern Spain. This is definitely the best chorizo I've had in the US and is perfect for making any spanish dish that calls for chorizo, including lentejas (lentil stew), paella, and migas (fried bread crumbs with various meats served on the side). It is also outstanding to eat as is--I know I could eat a whole chorizo in one sitting if it wasn't so expensive but that's the price of imported gourmet foods.
