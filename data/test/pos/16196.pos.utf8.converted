Me and my husband are always looking for responsible, healthy, by-product free treats for our sweet dog, but the problem we usually come across it lack of flavor and lack of excitement on our dogs part. These treats REALLY shocked us! The first time we gave it to her, she took it and bolted under the bed. The second time we gave one to her, she knew exactly what the treat was and did literally EVERY trick she knew, frantically one right after another! She is crazy about these things, so we will definitely be buying more! I would highly recommend these treats.
