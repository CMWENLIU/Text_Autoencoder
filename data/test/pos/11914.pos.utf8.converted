I bought this SoyaJoy maker 5 years ago from a friend in Houston. I have been using it since then. It is a reliable great product, very easy to use. I am extremely satisfied with this product. Unfortunately, I lost the plug cable during my recent moving. So I checked Amazon thinking to buy a new maker. I was so excited when I saw the same product is now listed on Amazon. So I e-mailed the custom cervice asking if I can get a plug cable from them. I got a quik response and they will send it out to me the very next day.<br />It is a great, reliable product. I strongly recommend this product.
