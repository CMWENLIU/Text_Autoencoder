I LOVE this soda.  It is made from real cola nuts and sugar and you can taste the difference.  To be fair, I don't drink much soda and feel fairly guilty when I do.  Soda is just one of the top ten worst things you can consume on a regular basis, let's be honest.  So when I do get an occasional craving for it, I try to at least moderate the badness of the choice.  I started drinking this soda whenever I'd stop into a local pizza place, until I started craving the soda more than the pizza.  At almost $2 a can elsewhere, I decided to spring for a case on Amazon.<br /><br />Is this Coke or Pepsi?  NO!  If you love those brands, you may not like this and as it is the more expensive of the choices, you're probably better off sticking with those chemical and corn syrup-laden options.  However, if you are like me and eat mostly natural, organic and healthy fare (or want to), this is a delicious occasional indulgence.  It is unusual in taste... it is almost more carbonation than flavor, if that makes any sense, but it is very appealing to me.  While I hope the 24 cans I ordered last a long while, I will probably order more when they run out.
