I got hooked on the green tea lattes at Starbucks a couple of years ago when I was looking for an alternative to all the caffeine and acid in their coffees.  But, while I loved the taste, I was hating the fat and sugar in them.  I began experimenting when I'd go in by asking for nonfat versions.  Didn't take me long to adjust to the lower fat and then I started asking for substitution of the various sugar-free syrups for the melon syrup.  Eventually found that the sugar free caramel was the right combo for me and reduced the calories.  The cost is still prohibitive for a daily treat and I started exploring the options for green tea matcha online.  Kind of strange that you can buy the sugar free caramel in big bottles from Starbucks, but you can't outright purchase the matcha.  Finally found this green tea frappuccino mix from Island Teas and it's been a great substitute for my morning ritual.  I take a large mug of nonfat milk and microwave it for 2 minutes, add two to three tablespoons of the frappuccino/latte mix plus three pumps of the Starbucks caramel sugar free syrup and then whisk and I'm set to go!  I'm purchasing my fourth 2.2 pound bag today and it lasts me about three months.<br /><br />Try having Starbucks making you a nonfat greent tea latte with sugar free caramel syrup instead of the regular and if you like it, try my mix at home.
