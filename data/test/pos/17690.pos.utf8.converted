My wife and I are hooked on Caribou Blend K Cup coffee.  We have tried all the others and this blend was without a doubt out favorite.  Great taste and a wonderful after taste.  I would highly recommend everyone at least try this brand.  Now, the price here is high compared to several other places.  I would recommend taking a look at the Keurig site.  They carry all brands, free shipping and a nice discount on 4 boxes or more ordered.
