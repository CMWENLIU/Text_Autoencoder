When you buy food items over the internet, sometimes the items arrived either melted or damaged during shipping. Not this. The box was shipped with three packs of ice in another larger box with inserts to prevent leaking. The Reese's miniatures chocolate was refresh and delicious. There are about 17 pieces in each bag (150g).
