I bought this salt for the first time a few months ago. Let me just say its the best salt for a ribeye steak. I don't use it as a finishing salt. I put the salt on the steak about 30 minutes before i'm ready to cook it..all you need is this salt, pepper, and a nice thick ribeye. My fiance and daughter that they had to have A1 and bbq sauce with steak, not anymore. Once you try it you'll love it..lol..
