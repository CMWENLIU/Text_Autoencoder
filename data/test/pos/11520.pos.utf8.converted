My almost-11-year-old lab (who still believes he is a puppy) struggles with a food allergies and hip dysplasia. We've tried every premium dog food under the sun and just found Innova EVO about a month ago. In that month, his energy is up, his hips seem to be stronger, his coat has become thick and shiny and he no longer scratches... at all! This stuff is amazing! He used to have redness on his stomach and in his ears and that's all gone too. I am thrilled with the results - our sweet boy is feeling good and happy again and I love knowing we've found something that works so well for him. Thanks Innova!
