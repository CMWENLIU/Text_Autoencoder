I have been buying Jus Poulet Lie Gold for more than ten years.  It is  excellent for cooking when either chicken broth or demi glace is called for.  I am convinced that it is more economical and better quality than anything you can buy in a can or in the form of powder.  It keeps on the shelf unopened almost indefinitely and the same in the refrigerator after it is opened.
