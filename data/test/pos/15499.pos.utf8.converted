These cookie-cakes are pretty darn good and chocolatey. A bit too sweet for my taste because of the marshmellow layer doesn't prevent me from scarfing down a few, and I do so guilt-free. Kids should love these since they taste like pure junk food, and I mean that as a compliment. Hard to believe they have zero fat.
