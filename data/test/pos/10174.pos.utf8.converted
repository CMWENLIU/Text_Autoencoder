As a kid I grew up enjoying Lyle's Golden Syrup.  Our family had it as a special treat and to help medicine go down!  It has been difficult to find here in America, especially at a reasonable price, so I was very happy to find it at Amazon.  I have ordered it twice now and will continue to order it in the future.  I like the bottles it comes in, they are so much easier to use than the traditional tin cans.  The only problem I have had is with our second order.  The bottles were not packed very securely in the box and a couple of them burst open during shipping.  When we opened the box there was syrup all over the interior, a gooey mess.  When we informed Amazon of the problem they immediately sent a replacement order which arrived in a timely fashion.  I was very pleased with their response although a little worried since the packing of the second box didn't look much more secure than the first.  It did make if safely though.
