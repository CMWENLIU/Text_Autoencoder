I bought this for my parent's anniversary. I ordered it on a Tuesday and received it by Friday. Considering that the shipping is free, that is great service. It came with a pretty serving plate and had a nice assortment. The food all tasted fresh, and my parents really enjoyed it. As far as I'm concerned that makes this a great basket.
