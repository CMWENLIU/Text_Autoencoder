The first time I had a Terry's Chocolate Orange was during Christmas, when our local "Superstore USA" stocked them.  I love chocolate.  And orange-flavored things are among my favorite flavors.  I never once imagined that combining the two flavors would yield one of my favorite desserts in the world!<br /><br />The folks in England got it right when they began to make Terry's Chocolate Oranges!  Buying these in bulk are totally worth the price you pay for them - they are meant to be savored.  One orange can last you a month if you really, really try - but they can also disappear in just a few hours, if you aren't careful!<br /><br />They might look like they're pretty delicate, but trust the label when you read "Whack and Unwrap!"  Take the ball in your hand and turn the orange so the bottom of it is facing downward, find a sturdy surface like a kitchen countertop, then raise the orange up high, and whack it down hard onto the flat surface.  You'll feel the individual "slices" form, and then you can unwrap, pick out a slice, and savor its delicacies!<br /><br />Buy them today, so this can remain a staple in Amazon's food store!  I don't want them to disappear anytime soon!  I'm going to order another case in a few weeks!<br />1,000,000,000,000,000 Stars, if possible!!!
