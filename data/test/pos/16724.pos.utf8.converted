I bought this for my son who has food allergies because all the ingredients were identified in the label, and it had none that he couldn't eat.  It has now become the favorite granola for my family.  I love the fact that it tastes so good, but has no fat.  Believe me, you won't miss it at all.  The same with the minimal sugar content.  It makes you wonder why all that other granola that is sold in boxes in the grocery store needs to have all those extraneous ingredients added you can't pronounce, or why they needs are so much more unhealthy in terms of added sugar and fat (and I am not talking about the fat that may come from nuts added to some granolas). This Bob's Red Mill granola is great straight, for baking, in yogurt, or with milk.
