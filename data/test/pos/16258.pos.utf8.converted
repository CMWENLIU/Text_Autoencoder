Caribou Daybreak Morning Blend coffee is one of my favorite blends.  I don't like a strong coffee, and this one is a little less than medium strength but has a really smooth rich coffee taste, it's excellent.  If you are a lover of the Starbucks strength coffee, this probably would not be one you would enjoy.
