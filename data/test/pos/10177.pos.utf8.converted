I was told by my NATURE PATH that this tea is BEST for me since I have a YEAST problem.  This tea is a BLOOD CLEANSER so I believe it would be good for all and if I have my information correct the PAU D'ARCO is the only tree in the RAIN FOREST that does not get FUNGUS hence good for CANDIDA YEAST.  You might want to check this information.  This tea is soothing and has a very different flavor, and I find it relaxing I do so enjoy the taste I also believe that knowing it is good for my BLOOD is another reason why I enjoy this tea so much.  The price was excellent and the product arrived on time and packaged well I would recommend this product HIGHLY
