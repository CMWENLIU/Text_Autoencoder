As soon as I opened this very large can, I WAS IMPRESSED!! THE INSIDE OF THE CAN COMPLETELY LINED WITH A VERY SPECIAL "BAKED ON" WHITE  ENAMEL OR TEFLON FINISH!! The cherries<br />looked terrific, almost completely filled the can, and I was prepared with 6 New Strilized Canning Jars!  In<br />order to very carefully remove the medium viscosity syrup, I DID THE FOLLOWING: 1. USING A ;LARGE<br />TEFLON draining spoon, I carefully scooped up  over 1/2 cup of cherries, and permitted the syrup to quickly drain into a very clean container! 2. I then placed the drained cherries into  one of the new Canning One Pint<br />Jars. 3.When I reached 1 cup of cherries, ( not "packed" in the Jar, I carefully added sufficient syrup to cover. 4. I the added 2 tsp. (measuring teaspoons of Peter Herring Cherry Liqueur, followed by less than 1/2<br />tablespoon (measure carefully) of either VS Cognac or Quality US Brandy-(I alternately used either the VS<br />Cognac, or EJ XO Brandy ($13.50 for 750ml)  5. I continued by carefully filling the jar with 1 additional cup<br />of drained cherries and then proceded with all of the steps I had done in "STEP 4." After EVERYTHING HAD BEEN ADDED, I sealed the Jar with the 2-part Canning Lids, after which I carefully inverted the Jar several times, (4 or 5).  6. I then placed Jar 1 into a very cold Refrigerator, and left undisturbed for a week! Actually, I would use the inversion technique I described!----REMEMBER, after seven days, open and SMELL! Also taste both syrup and cherries; they will change slightly for at least 3 weeks. At this time, if you feel that a small amount of Brandy is needed, you may add several teaspoons, "OR" instead 1 scant measured Tablespoon, BUT, it is always best to add less than you would like!  Now, after sealing the Jar, continue with about 5 careful rotations!<br />After several weeks, only occasional rotations are needed-perhaps every 4 days. The small amount of added alcohol should make each Jar last a very long time in the refrigerator!<br />You should have more than enough syrup and cherries to loosely fill all 6 Jars.  The cherries are really delicious!  The Luxardo Marasca  Cherries are actually a somewhat different cherry, but also delicious!<br />However, its syrup is much, much thicker; therefore, before I added the same 2 "liquors", I first carefully diluted its syrup, very gently stirring until the proper viscosity was achieved! Then I proceeded<br />to very carefully experiment with liquors. ALWAYS USE A SPECIAL CANNING JAR WITH 2-PIECE LIDS! THE Luxardo Cherries are smaller and delicate, but intensely flavorful!!
