Green Mountain Coffee has lots of excellent k-cups to choose from. I find this to be just a tad stronger than Nantucket and just a smidge weaker that Lake and Lodge. All three are great, but this is my fave of the three. I would describe it as a bit stronger flavored than your typical medium roast, but not enough to turn you off if you dislike "bold" flavors.
