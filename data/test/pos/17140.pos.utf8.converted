I've purchased 2 cases now.  The 1st one was dented like crazy, but no damage to the product.  The 2nd one was perfectly fine.  I love the convenience of the can and it's a really good strong tea.  I've even got some of my friends drinking it now.  When I can't brew my own at home, this stuff is great on the go.  It's pure japanese green tea, no other fillers, additives, sugar, etc.  It's provides you energy, but it's not bogus energy that turns into a crash.
