I really like this soup. It's simple to make, just add boiling water, give it a stir, and let it sit for a few minutes.<br /><br />It's also very tasty. It has a fish broth, but to me it doesn't really taste fishy, just slightly salty. If you don't like the salt taste, you can make it less intense by adding more water, which is what I do. The seaweed in this soup has a nice texture, it's not rubbery or anything like that. Just pleasant. The smell might remind you of the sea, but I don't think that's a big surprise. Once you taste it, you get over the smell.<br /><br />It's also conveniant, because I can usually find this soup in the Asian foods aisle of almost any grocery store.
