This is a lovely flavorful oil..has the fresh Meyer Lemon scent...great drizzled on fish, crusty breads, asparagus...salads..over hot pasta with chopped basil, parsley, and freshly ground sea salt and pepper is fantastic! Used it making pannini sandwiches...WOW! I am ordering more for holiday gifts. Large plastic bottles arrive bubble wrapped so not a lot of weight...am trying the basil flavored next....ENJOY!!!!!!
