<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ZBZLPI">San Francisco Bay Coffee Decaf OneCup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast, 12-Count (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />Excellent, great, wonderful, tasty and full of all that coffee goodness, at a reasonable price per cup.<br /><br />Bold, very dark, strong smoky aroma and taste expected from a good French Roast. This definitely is not your store bought French Roast in the blue plastic container. If you don't like STRONG coffee, don't buy this.<br /><br />Very unique K-Cup alternative filter dispensing system that gives a better cup of brew in my opinion. I found this filter very easy to clean and reuse with K-Saver snap-on tops that I bought here at Amazon too.<br /><br />Yep, this is on my Subscribe and Save list.
