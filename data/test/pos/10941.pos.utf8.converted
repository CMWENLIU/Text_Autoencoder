I originally purchased this product at my local Giant super market.  However, the store remodeled and discontinued this product.  I went to my local Acme super market, Genuardi's super market, Trader Joe's, and an Italian store - none of these places carried this product.  That's when I decided to go on line to see if I could find it.  I found success with Amazon.com.  I ordered 3 jars of Ferrara Espresso Instant Coffee 2 oz. and received it within 3 days.  I'm so very pleased.  And when I run out, I will again order Ferrara Espresso Instant Coffee from Amazon.com.  Thank you.
