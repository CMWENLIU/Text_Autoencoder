I am surprised nobody has reviewed this item yet. It's SO GOOD. I love pistachios and when I saw these at my local store I had to get them. I love how they are shelled for you, so you can pop them into your mouth already. They are ROASTED, and you can tell! Some of them remind me of roasted and salted pumpkin seeds. I recommend them for sure.
