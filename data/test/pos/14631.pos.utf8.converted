If you've never cooked with whole wheat pastry flour, you're in for a treat.  We are all familar with the heaviness and "wheaty-ness" that regular whole wheat flour imparts to baked goods.  But whole wheat pastry flour has been milled finer and amazingly, works wonderfully in baked goods like chocolate chip cookies.  Most recipes out there will call for half whole wheat flour and half regular flour; I've found I can do that and no one can detect any "wheaty-ness".  Allrecipes.com has a whole wheat chocolate chip cookie recipe that is one of my favorites.  This product is not always easy to find on your supermarket shelves (look in specialty flour section, not regular flour section) so might be worth ordering online.
