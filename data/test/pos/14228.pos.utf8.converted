My superdwarf banana plants arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  Each plant had about a six leaves on it with minimal shipping damage. I re-potted them immediately and they suffered no transplant shock.  They're now thriving in a sunny window.<br /><br />Another word on re-pottng.  The plants are packed and potted for shipping in shallow, light-soiled, 4" containers, which means that you'll want to re-pot them into a bigger pot immediately.  I can't stress that enough. I honestly wouldn't wait more than a day to re-pot, as in the warmer months the plant could dry out very quickly.
