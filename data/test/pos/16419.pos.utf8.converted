Our lab is a picky eater to the point that she was about 10% underweight just eating barely enough to keep her alive.  That was on Lg Breed Puppy Eukanuba (sp?).  Then, I ignorantly switched her to Purina Puppy Chow before I knew how bad corn is for dogs, the number one ingredient of that awful formula. She didn't really like that, either, thankfully.  Then, I switched her to Large Breed Puppy EVO.  She liked that a bit better, and it didn't have corn.  But, I still had to put a bit of hot water on it and essentially drag her to the bowl.  She did gain weight, though.<br /><br />Then, EUREKA, we found Taste of the Wild.  NO GRAIN!!  All the nutrition she needs - I think she eats better than we do with this stuff.  I guessed that being a bird dog she'd like the Roasted Fowl flavor.  I opened the bag in the store and she wolfed it down like nothing else I'd ever seen.<br /><br />Since then she's eaten the amount of food she's supposed to for her age and weight with no water added or cajoling into into eating.  Granted, she's still not a huge eater, but by the end of the day her allotment is eaten.  Her weight is perfect, and she really does like the food.  I'm glad I don't have to add water so her teeth stay clean - it's nice and crunchy.  Her coat is gorgeous and her muscles rippling (we exercise her a lot).  She's got an amazing physique, and her dry skin/dandruff seems to be markedly reduced.<br /><br />Taste of the Wild is worth every penny, and I believe in my heart that she'll live a longer, healthier life (possibly years longer) for our having found it.  Thank God for Taste of the Wild.  We love her so much and this is the best dog food out there.
