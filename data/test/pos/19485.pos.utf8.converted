Mmmmmmmm ... Pasta Sides! Now this is what my mother called "stick-to-your-ribs" food. It's filling and delicious!<br /><br />I enjoy all the Sides, but this Stroganoff with "fettuccine in sour cream and mushroom sauce flecked with parsley" is my favorite, with Alfredo/Broccoli running a close second.<br /><br />Served with a fresh garden salad and a cup of green tea ... Ah-hhh a quick, healthy feast ... fit for a Queen ... or even a writer. ;-)<br /><br />The entire meal, including salad prep, takes less than fifteen minutes.  What could be easier? Now dig in, kids, and enjoy ... I wouldn't steer you wrong.<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008<br />author of 1106 Grand Boulevard
