Although the tomatoes were delicious, I might hesitate to order again, since it appeared that the cans were either dented en route, or were taken off the shelf that way. They were also sort of dirty and old looking, so I have a feeling these are items which maybe don't move often enough, and I may have gotten the last of what was on the shelf, dented or not. Otherwise shipping was prompt. Could have been packed better.
