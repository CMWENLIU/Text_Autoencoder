Let me start this by saying that I have tried multiple flavors of MIO in varying concentrations, and while the taste is somewhat bearable, I'm just not a fan of its aftertaste and artificial flavor.  I'm writing a review to let potential buyers know of its alternative use!<br /><br />When I moved into my new home about 6 months ago my husband and I were disappointed to find that the kitchen sink was badly stained.  It was made of white porcelain and appeared as though someone had poured blue ink or dye down the drain.  It coated the sides and pooled at the bottom and left a ring around the drain.  It was quite unsightly.  For the first month we tried several cleaners, including bleach, peroxide, magic erasers, comet, goo gone, paint thinner, ammonia, CLR, and tile cleaners.  We planned on replacing the sink entirely, mostly due to the chips on its surface and our preference for stainless steel, but the blue stain did play a part.<br /><br />As if by magic the solution came to us.  One afternoon I discovered that a bottle of MIO in my pantry was leaking.  I removed the bottle and placed it in the sink til I could check to see where the problem was coming from.  I cleaned up the mess on the shelf with little problems, amazed that a concentrate like that didn't stain the shelving!  When I returned to the sink and lifted the busted bottle I discovered that an oval MIO shape had been formed in the blue stain.  It was like applying a Crest white strip to my sink!  I then began to pour the concentrate all over the sink.  No scrubbing, no pain, no effort.  I simply turned on my faucet and watch MIO strip away the blue ink that had plagued me for 3 months as I rinsed it down the drain.  I contemplated how or why this worked.  Citric Acid? Malic Acid? Propylene Glycol?  Which chemical was to blame for its magical dye stripping properties?<br /><br />Beats me!  But to be honest.. I certainly don't want to drink it any more.  It can bleach porcelain better than.. well bleach.  So why on earth would I put it in my body?<br /><br />Hope this saves you from chemical cleaning of your digestive tract, or if you need a great spot remover... give it a whirl.
