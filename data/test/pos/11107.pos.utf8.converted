When I thought about buying these seeds there was only one other review. It was a good review so I decided to take a chance and buy the seeds. I am so glad I did. First of all they gave me a bonus package of seeds! And not one of the herbs that was already included in the set. The individual seed packets look exactly like the picture. They all have directions for planting the seeds, watering and sunlight exposure. All of my seeds have sprouted. There were no dead seeds. They certainly delivered the goods! and now it is all up to me. I would highly recommend Seed Needs for their herb seed packets. Great stuff!
