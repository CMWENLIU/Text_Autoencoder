I will start by saying that I feel all hemp protein is gritty, and a bit hard to swallow. I was really happy with the Vanilla spice. It has been the best hemp powder I have tried to date. It has a wonderful sweet vanilla flavor, and is finely ground, so it's not as chalky as others. I usually buy Nutiva(which is also good) but to me this is much better. I mix it in a glass of soy or almond milk with breakfast. I would not recommend mixing this product with plain water. I love the benefits of hemp protein. I have already placed an order for my second container!
