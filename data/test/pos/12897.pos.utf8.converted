If you like the taste of mate, Cruz de Malta is a staple, and so is Rosamonte. Both brands deliver although Rosamonte is bit bolder in flavor, perhaps because there is more fine powder in the mix than Cruz, but that doesn't mean Cruz is any less of a mate, just different. I have Rosamonte at my desk at work for every weekday and Cruz on my counter at home for the weekends. Just my preference. Anyhow if you are in the market for good mate, you should at least try two different kinds brewed then chilled to get a basis of comparison (it's cheap at hell to buy anyway), and I believe these are the top sellers in South America, home of the mate.
