The first three ingredients of any kibble pet food should be meat, and meat that is relevant to the animal eating it.  And this food delivers that, with no repeats:  Deboned Duck, Chicken Meal, and Turkey Meal.  While the last two products are "Meal" meaning that they may contain bones, feathers, feet, or egg shells, however a whole pressure cooked chicken is much better than the corn and gluten based food that most out there are.  Right now we have six cats in the house ranging from 3 months to ten years old (four are fosters), and all of them eat and love the Blue Wilderness Duck cat food. And another plus; for all six of our cats it has almost eliminated cat box odor created by fecal matter.<br /><br />I highly recommend this food.
