Either you like it or you do not. We do, so it is 5 stars.<br /><br />At the time we bought it Amazon was less expensive  than our supermarkets in quantities qualifying for free shipping.<br /><br />Amazon - keep competetive prices coming (not yet common enough) on quality products (frequent) and we will be sold. Ease of ordering and shipping generally excellent. Choice of packaging sometimes bizzare and wasteful, such as a box many times bigger than necessary with loose boxes of tea and crumpled paper filler.
