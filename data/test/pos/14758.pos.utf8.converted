My Yorkshire Terrier had some skin problems when I had him on dog food brands I bought at local stores. I did some online research about possible causes and found food quaity and ingredients could be the cause. Wellness Core was recommended by several people as a good alternative. I started Charlie on Wellness and within a month no more skin issues and he actually like the food. It's dry food so helps with his teeth as well.
