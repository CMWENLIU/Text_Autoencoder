This is really a best turkish coffee I've had so far. I'm from Gerogia and we all drink Turkish coffee there, also I know the real flavor of Turkish coffee (At least I thought so).<br />I love the flavor of (Megmet Efendi Turkish Coffee), it really has an authentic taste.<br />I bought 8.8 Oz can thinking I'd reorder in case I liked it, and so did I.<br />Now I ordered 3 of them.<br />Buy smallest coffee can first, try it and then buy as much as you want to, but beliave me you will.
