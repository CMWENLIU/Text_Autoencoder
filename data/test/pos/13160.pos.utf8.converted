Many European tortes and cookies use ground hazelnuts as the major ingredient, replacing flour. Some examples are Christmas star cookies from Germany which are small iced nut cakes that have a baked-on icing (Zimtsterne.) Tortes frequently use hazelnut flour as the main ingredient. Rather than having to rub off the skins and grind your own, you can buy Bob's Red Mill hazelnut meal instead. Keep it in the freezer or fridge as it can go rancid if you don't use it all up.<br /><br />ZIMTSTERNE (Cinnamon Stars)<br /><br />1 1/2 cups (about 8 ounces) hazelnuts or blanched almonds, finely ground<br /><br />1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br /><br />3/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest<br /><br />1/4 cup egg whites (about 2 large)<br /><br />Pinch of salt<br /><br />1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar<br /><br />About 1/2 cup additional confectioners' sugar for rolling<br /><br />1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil.<br /><br />2. Combine the nuts, cinnamon, and zest. Beat the egg whites on low speed until foamy, about 30 seconds. Add the salt, increase the speed to medium-high, and beat until soft peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar and beat until stiff and glossy, 5 to 8 minutes. Reserve one-third of the meringue (about 1/3 cup) and fold the nut mixture into the remaining meringue.<br /><br />3. Place a large piece of waxed paper on a flat surface and sprinkle with additional confectioners' sugar. Place the nut mixture on the sugar, lightly sprinkle with more confectioners' sugar, top with a second piece of waxed paper, and roll out 1/4 inch thick. Remove the top piece of waxed paper. Using a cookie cutter dipped in water, cut into 2-inch star shapes or use a sharp knife to cut into diamonds. Reroll and cut any scraps. Place on the prepared baking sheet.<br /><br />4. Bake until set, 10 to 12 minutes. Spread the reserved meringue over the top of the cookies and bake until the tops are lightly colored, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool.  These cookies set up and dry out over 1 day, so let them alone overnight AT LEAST and keep in a tin to store. If they last...which in our house they don't. They are horribly addictive.<br /><br />Approximately 3 dozen cookies.
