i, probably like most people reading this page about this product, thought there was no way it would provide the benefits the package says. relief from headaches, appetite suppressant, wakefulness, feeling of wellbeing are all said to come about by drinking the tea.<br />i brewed up tea in near boiling water with 2 teabags, and let it steep for over and hour to cool down. i then poured the tea in a glass with ice, so in effect it was ice tea.<br />a pleasant taste not unlike green tea, and i'll be darned if my mouth felt numb! i was thirsty so i drank it rather quick, and pretty soon, my daily afternoon caffeine crash was lifted with my headache and just felt like it was a very nice day. went to my cubicle and got to work and time seemed to fly. it was like a very strong espresso but without the jittery effects of the caffiene.<br />my friend made some with 4 teabags, with a larger amount of water so he could make 2 cups. he wound up drining it himself over the course of the afternoon and he was, in his words 'feeling great, able to concentrate, focus, and it made normally bad parts of work just fly by'...<br /><br />i hear you can chew the leaves too for a stronger effect but you have to use baking soda to release the alkaloids. however, there is very little, to such a small amount of cocaine (less than .08%). not sure were the energy seems to come from.<br />but i would take this over a 64oz MT.dew, or a double/triple espresso anyday. no sugar crash, no headaches, and it doesn't make you stay up all nite, or kill your apatite.<br /><br />this is a great tasting tea that is definitely something people should try if they are allergic or otherwise avoid caffeine.
