We have tried many GF breads ... both prepared and mixes.  None of them were acceptable substitutes for "real" bread.  This bread is a keeper. Rises well. Slices easily.  Tastes great.  My son loves it so much that we put it on auto order.  My husband got into it and didn't realize that it was GF.<br /><br />Hint 1:  This makes a 2 pound loaf.  It WILL rise enough to overflow a 1.5 loaf bread machine.  I use the bread machine just to mix the batter and then let it rise on the counter and cook it in the oven.<br /><br />Hint 2:  No preservatives.  The bread stores best if you let it cool, slice the entire loaf, and store in the freezer.<br /><br />Hint 3:  This bread mix is NOT casein-free.  Milk is ingredient #4.  Whey is #5.
