I eat popcorn almost every night. I don't care for yellow and I got tired of buying the crappy storebrand of white. So I came on Amazon and found Wabash valley farms. I've bought about 30lbs of popcorn so far from them and I have been very happy with it. It's almost hull less which saves you from having to pick popcorn out of your teeth an hour after you've eatin it. It Has a nice light crunch and a nice sweet flavor. I would recommend to any popcorn lover.
