This was not available in any local stores, so I got  the 18 boxes , planning to share it with friends. I tried making the Jello  with pineapple juice as the cold liquid and adding pineapple chunks after it started to harden. YUMMY! It actually tastes like pineapple and coconut. The colada Jello is a slightly different texture than regular Jello --less "gelatiny" and more creamy. Made with just plain water,  this still tastes of coconut and pineapple. I understand you can make it with bottled pina colada mix --that would be fun for a party, especially if it had a few maraschino cherries and a bit of rum .
