I have been drinking Postum my whole life and now (gasp) I'm in my 60's.  Herb tea doesn't do it for me, and neither does anything else.  Only Postum (the<br />name was never its biggest selling point) was just perfect for after dinner.  The hot, unique flavor experience I enjoyed  every evening is gone --<br />damn you Kraft Foods!  I wish some other  company would manufacure this wonderful retro product. It was more than a memory, it was almost an<br />addiction, and I sure miss it!!
