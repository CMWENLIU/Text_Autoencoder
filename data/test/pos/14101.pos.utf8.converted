Anyone who grew up in South Africa loves Mrs. Balls Chutney. I have been living in the USA for twenty years and have tried many chutneys, including many from local Indian Groceries and home-made varieties from speciality stores. Nothing quite beats the taste of this brand. I know many recipes that use this chutney to make a wonderful marinade, or sauce for chicken dishes as well. These recipes can be found on line. I was delighted to find that Amazon had listed this incredible product. I bought six bottles and as soon as they are finished, I know where I can find them again. Either the Regular or the Peach varieties are a family favorite, even amongst my American born children. Thank you Amazon.
