When I was a young boy growing up in Italy, I would grab a spoon and eat this hazelnut spread right out of the bottle. Of course that's not the correct way to eat it and my mother would scold me for it.<br /><br />Today, I eat it occasionally, spread on a slice of bread and of course one teaspoon straight out of the jar now and then can't hurt since I don't eat much sugar.<br /><br />For anyone like me, having a jar of this in the refrigerator and being able to make a sandwich dessert I highly recommend it, if you have not already done so.
