I am very particular about the type of tomatoes I will use for my sauce.  The recipe I use came from my mother in law, who was born and raised in Northern Italy.  Believe me, the tomatoes are important.  These are about half the price I pay in the grocery store for similar items, provided I can find them in the first place!  I would definitely recommend these to a friend.
