These are the small BB-sized blueberries you've been looking for.. great for pancakes and baking. Plus, your cook friends will appreciate a can or two from your stash.<br /><br />Note: the date on the bottom of each can is the packing date; Deb at Highland Sugarworks kindly told me that the bluberries should be good out to three years from that date.<br /><br />Yum!!
