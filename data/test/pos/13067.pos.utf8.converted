There are no trans fats in these chips, so consuming a bag may make you feel guilty, but it will only enlarge your butt, not your heart. They are thicker than traditional potato chips, but not too thick - they are just right and salted perfectly. These are also a great item for entertaining to put in a decorative bowl - a pop of color - a true conversation piece that is edible!
