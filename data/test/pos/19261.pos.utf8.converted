I will not repeat the many positive reviews of this appliance.  I love it for the same reasons everybody else who loves it does:  one small appliance, no pots and pans, a few pieces into the dishwasher, no timing, no recipes, easy peasy.  I actually like that it makes a small amount of food.  If something is rejected, I don't have a gallon ziplock of useless food cubes taking up room in the freezer.  I'd rather have variety than bulk.  Plus, it's super easy to incorporate leftover meat or fish or rice with your fresh veggies and reheat/cook and puree together.<br /><br />I wanted to share, though, a little bit of research I did to make it even easier to use.  I like to make a couple of batches in a row so I can do combinations or single-veg purees with the same small group of ingredients.  What do you do when your already-peeled potatoes don't all fit?  Mix them with some zucchini or cauliflower and do a second mixed batch!  There are two logistical problems with this:  there is no information on the steamer basket's capacity so you can't chop the second or third batch in advance, and the "measures" of water are also not defined.  Since the mixing bowl is also the water measuring bowl, you would have to wash it out really carefully between uses to avoid getting food particles in the reservoir.  Other than protecting the cleanliness of the reservoir, it does not seem necessary to do more than a quick rinse if you're doing two vegetables in a row.  So I did a little "science" and found:  "one measure" of water is about 1/4 cup, 2 measures 1/2 cup, 3 measures 3/4 cup.  Also, the description says that the bowl has a 2.5 cup capacity.  Not so.  It is the *steamer basket* that has a 2.5 cup capacity.
