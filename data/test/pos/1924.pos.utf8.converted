I discovered this years ago when I was looking for a way to get my Starbucks mochas everyday, but cut the cost of getting them from an actual Starbucks store.  I brew my own espresso in my drip coffee maker (must be Starbucks brand to get close to the taste) and then make the same syrup they use in the stores using this powder.  I have the say that the taste is extremely close to the real deal.  There is something about coffee going through a $2000 machine that makes it taste awesome, however, if you are tired of paying $4.40 per mocha, get this and make at home for a fraction of that cost!
