I tried this with 2% milk, 1% milk, fat free, and lastly with goats milk I bought by the quart at Walmart, it is the richest most delicious yogurt ever (my husband is the one I make it for) I add a lg teaspoon of honey, mix it up and there is nothing better, the tartness blends with the sweet. I let the machine work for 8 hours and it is custard like. Excellent
