I was growing tired of my regular oatmeal routine, and saw this on my grocer's shelf yesterday while shopping.<br /><br />I LOVE chocolate, but generally steer clear of most instant oatmeals because they lack that chewy, whole oat texture and are typically loaded up with things I'd prefer to not eat.<br /><br />This oatmeal has it all... a great texture, perfectly balanced dark chocolate flavor (with real chocolate morsels), an ingenious self-measuring pouch (for the water), and a terrific price point.<br /><br />I'm hoping Amazon will carry it soon, as I am already addicted to this delicious product!
