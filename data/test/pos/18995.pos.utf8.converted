I love this product! I usually mix it with shea butter and olive oil and apply it to my hair over my conditioner to seal in the moisure. I works great because I have been retaining hair length and I rarely experience any breakage. The smell is okay and its texture is good. I also use this same mixture as a skin moisturizer and also to wash my face using a oil cleansing method. I haven't had any new breakout since I starting using it. Overall, its a good buy!
