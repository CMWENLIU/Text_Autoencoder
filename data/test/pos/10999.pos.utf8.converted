I would never have dreamed that the plant would arrive in such pristine condtion!  I had this Jade Tree delivered to work so that it would be a surprise for my husband's birthday.  It raises a lot of curiosity when "Live Plant" is printed on a sealed box...especially when I was out of the office on the day it arrived.  NO one could believe how bright green and beautifully formed the plant was.  The fact that it had spent a few days in a sealed box was doubly mystifying!  This birthday present was paraded up an down the halls of our office building before it ever made it home to my husband.  Everyone was amazed.  Thank you for a great birthday surprise.  I hope we can take as good care of this gem as you did getting it to me.
