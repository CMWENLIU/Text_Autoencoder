"There is a garden overlooking the Yangtze River gorge where an elderly man contemplates his life while sipping a cup of Green Ginger. Perhaps you would like to join him." ~on each tea packet<br /><br />A friend sent me this tea and I've been in love with the slightly bitter flavor. It is quite exotic and fragrant. The ingredients are green teas, natural flavors, ginger and lemongrass.<br /><br />This tea begs to be blended with orange blossom honey.<br /><br />I've tasted many teas and this is by far the most exotic tea I've tried yet. This is pear ginger bliss.<br /><br />For more information on the myseries of Tazo Tea, read the review for the Tazo Assorted Teas.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
