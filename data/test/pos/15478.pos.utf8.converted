I recently made the switch over to wood pellets from clay-based litters.  In doing so, I needed to buy some new litter boxes, and the Van Ness sifting pans seemed to fit the bill.<br /><br />I've been using them for two weeks now and love how easy they are to use.  I don't know how well they would work with clay-based litters - I never really liked the sifting litter boxes I had used when I used to use clay.<br /><br />However, for wood pellets (which are biodegradable, odor absorbing, cheaper, and last longer) it works great.  The sifting slots are big enough to let all of the sawdust fall through, but the solid pellets and solid waste remain on top.  It's also nice that they give you an extra bottom pan to swap out when cleaning.  The boxes themselves easily fit my cats (one is rather large at around 15 lbs.) and they had no problem adjusting to them from the XL Booda Domes we used to use.<br /><br />I purchased 3 of these (one for each cat), and I would definitely recommend them to anyone else using wood pellets for litter.
