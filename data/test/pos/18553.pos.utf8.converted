I consider this litter easy because it lasts about 2 weeks for two of my cats. I only have to rake it during those two weeks, then I clean the entire box with detergent, get out the new bag of litter, and I'm done!  The other important part of this litter is that I can flush the poop in the toliet.  Ultra Pearls cat litter is the only crystal, long lasting, litter out there where you can do that--vs. having to put it in a trashbag where it can get awfully stinky!  Anything that makes my life easier, and less smelly is a great thing!
