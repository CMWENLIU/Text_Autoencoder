This is a comfort snack for me. These cookies have a great, simple taste-exactly what you expect animal crackers to taste like. Not exactly health food but low in fat and not excessively sugary. Better than the "brand name" animal crackers/cookies.<br /><br />You may want to try a small bag first before getting this huge tub but I love em.
