I have always loved the pudding...especially the chocolate.  My Mother always loved the chocolate too.  I always brought her a supply when I came to visit.  As she got older, I noticed she quit eatting them.  She told me they were too difficult for her to open.<br /><br />Now that I am getting older and having problems with my hands, I am having a problem opening the top of the pudding too.  I wish you could make the product easier for older customers to open with different packaging.  I know that before too long I will no longer be able to open the pudding.<br /><br />I made the mistake of trying to cut a hole in the top a few days ago, and I cut my finger.  I am still wearing a bandaid...but the pudding was great!<br /><br />Barbara in Texas
