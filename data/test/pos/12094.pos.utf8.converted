I'd encountered these before, when ordering ca phe sua da (Vietnamese iced coffee) at better pho-houses, and I decided to pick one up as a possible single-cup coffee solution (the coffee at my office is hideous, and I prefer to make my own).  Having only had coffee brewed in this sort of filter in the aforementioned situation, I really didn't have an opinion on the quality of the brew (sweetened condensed milk will cover a lot of sins).  After a few tries to get the brewing procedure down just right, I can say this makes one of the best cups of black coffee I've ever had.  The brew is somewhat between that of a French press and a standard drip filter; it's as strong as a strong pot of French press, and as aromatic, but has the more balanced flavor profile of a well-brewed cup of drip coffee.  I've only had the chance to use middle-of-the-line grocery store beans in the thing, but I'm looking forward to brewing up some top-end coffee in this; with the well-balanced extraction it offers, I expect it to be a treat.<br /><br />Clean-up is a breeze, limited moving parts and the grounds rinse right off, much quicker than fine-mesh filter cones or french press.  I picked up two, one for work and one for home, and I have a feeling they will both get plenty of use.
