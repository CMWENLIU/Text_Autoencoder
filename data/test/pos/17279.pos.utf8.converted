This is awesome popcorn. I still prefer air popped popcorn but this is the closest microwave version that I have found, and it's organic. Now, come on and think, if you're looking to tons of butter and salt why would you purchase a 94% fat free unsalted food item. The cool thing is. since it is a fairly plain popcorn (not flavorless just plain) and you want extra flavor you can add just what flavor you're looking for... buttery, cheesy, sweet, spicy or salty. It's a very versatile popcorn.
