The biggest pain to making authentic hummus from dried chick peas is removing the chick peas' skins after they've been cooked, after hours of soaking the dried beans, prior to cooking. Bob's Red Mill Chana Dal Beans removes the real work. While not exactly garbanzos, Bob's chana dal split beans are a very close cousin. Soak a pound for a couple of hours, rinse, then cook until softened, and run them through the food processor with a little cooking water, tahini, lemon, garlic, cumin, salt, and a smidgeon of turmeric and pepper flakes. One pound dry will make about three pounds of delicious hummus.
