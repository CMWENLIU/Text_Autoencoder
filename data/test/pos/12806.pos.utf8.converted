I was delighted to find pine nuts at such a great price but even more delighted when they arrived! The taste is fresh, with that slight resinous touch and the creamy sweetness and nutiness that a good pine nut should have.<br /><br />I did have to re-package them into smaller bags as the whole 5 lbs. arrives in one large bag (in a box as shown) and I could not fit it into my freezer "as is", but that was no trouble and took all of five minutes to do. (BTW, you folks "do" know that freezing nuts of any kind prolongs their useable life, right? Refrigerate or freeze your nut oils as well for the same reason; they can be re-frozen without any problems.)<br /><br />I don't use pine nuts all the time but when I do use them in a dish, I like to be a bit "heavy-handed" with them because I really like their flavor, so having this much on hand is a real boon!<br /><br />I hope that Amazon will continue to carry this product in the future at this price. I highly recommend this product so I am given it 5 STARS. Be smart when you buy them, order a little something else to bring the price up to "super saver" level and you won't even have to pay to have them shipped! Happy cooking, everyone!
