I have been struggling for years to find a cat food that would relieve a stubborn skin allergy on one of my cats.  Finally after reading on a website (I'm sorry I don't remember which one), someone mentioned this food and I found it at my local Farm and Home Store (like a Southern States feed store).  I was really skeptical that this would work, but I was hopeful because the front of the bag said no wheat, corn or soy, plus it contains Omega 3 fatty acids.  Imagine my surprise when after one bag of this food, my cat's long-time allergy where he licked all the hair off his belly and caused little sores all over began to clear up.  For the first time since he was a kitten he has hair on his belly that is not the result of me breaking down and taking him to the vet for a cortisone shot - something I tried not to do often because it is not good for cats and can cause diabetes.  In addition to my main concern for getting my poor kitty feeling better, I was paying so much money for Prescription ZD diet from the vet's office and with five cats I had to isolate one cat to feed him while the others got the less expensive store brand.  Anyway - I'm just saying - after trying EVERYTHING I could think of - homepathic remedies, $$$ trips to vet, $$$ trips to cat dermatologist, and many $65 bags of ZD diet, this wonderful food has stopped the allergy and its lower cost means I can allow all five of my cats to eat it.  I know all allergies are different, but this belly licking behavior seems to be very common if the websites and comments I saw while research the problem are any indication.  Try this food - give it at least a full month before deciding if it works.  I am so thankful to have found this food.
