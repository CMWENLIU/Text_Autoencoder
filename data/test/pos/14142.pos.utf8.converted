When I got back from Paris I thought I would be able to find some good goat cheese at specialty shops, but all I could find was the tubs of goat cheese that haven't been aged and basically just tasted a little different than cream cheese.<br /><br />This goat cheese really reminded me of the stuff I could get in paris.  Leave it out for 30 minutes and put it on some toasted baguette and it makes a great snack, or even a meal with a salad, tomatoes, and wine.  You can really tell it has been aged by the flavor especially near the white rind.  I got the presidente stuff in paris that was in little log shapes with a white rind, which was really good, but I think this is even better.  Bon appetit!
