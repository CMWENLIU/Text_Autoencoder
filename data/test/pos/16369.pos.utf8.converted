The Hormel Beef Tamales are are an old standby on the pantry shelf. They are not highly spiced, in fact they are on the bland side. They work great as a foil for refried beans, cheese, chipotle, salsa, sour cream, you name it. Check out this ingredient list: "Water, Beef, Tomatoes (Water, Tomato Paste), Corn Meal, Corn Flour, Masa Harina, Salt, Chili Powder (Chili Peppers, Flavoring), Modified Food Starch, Paprika, Spice." For a meal in a can, this is an outstanding lineup of stuff. No chemicals, additives or preservatives. Truth is, aside from a little fat and salt, these are not that unhealthy or high in calories. So enjoy.
