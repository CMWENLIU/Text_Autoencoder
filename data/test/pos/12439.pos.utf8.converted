I acknowledge all the things said about this dinner by the previous reviewer.  However, my interpretation is different-- I loved it.  For one thing, I suspected it had MSG.  Why?  Because it was so delicious.  I love MSG, no matter how bad a rap it's gotten over the past few years.<br /><br />This is comfort food, plain and simple.  No, it's not healthy.  If you're sensitive to salt or heavy preservatives, leave it on the shelf.  I suspect there's really no way for them to make something that doesn't need refrigeration without preservatives anyway.  Bottom live, I adored this and the chicken noodle variety, and avidly look forward to trying some of the other chicken varieties (I don't do beef or pork).
