I l0ve Tulsi tea! This is the very same brand I used when we lived in India, which is where it is imported from. I am SO happy to find it here in the States!! Tulsi, also known as "holy basil" is a delicious herb, related to the basil plant, but tastes more along the lines of mint. It is an antioxidant, and a powerful tea to detox, or just to relax. Plus it tastes great. No caffeine, so drink it day or night.
