This Coconut Cream has a bit of a grainy texture, which is not bad, as the cream melts easily in the mouth and leaves a strong coconut flavor. You can use it for curry dishes perfectly - just heat up the cream and blend in the spices.<br /><br />Yet, another good idea is to mix it with cacao powder and sweeten it a bit and cool it down in the fridge. You will get a chocolate with an exotic flair.<br /><br />I used to buy Coconut oil but Let's Do Organic Coconut Cream is much better for you. The latter has not only the good, healthy fats but also a lot of fiber, protein, and minerals, which the oil does not have.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they don't offer this cream in bulk or Food Service Size for the moment. As I use a lot, it would be more economical for me. I hope it will be available in bulk size again soon.
