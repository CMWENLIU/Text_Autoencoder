I love making nut milk!  I'll make nut milk everyday if I could.  Maybe even three or four times a day, but who has energy?  It is just, the best feeling.  When you've worked so hard and want to relax.  There really is nothing as centering as making nut milk.  It makes me feel good knowing I'm making plenty of healthy and low calorie nut milk to drink later.<br /><br />I used a strainer and cheese cloth but it was just to messy.  I searched the internets looking for a solution and found these nut milk bags.  They are great.  The whole process is allot less of a hassle to clean up and it's reusable.  Unlike the cheese cloth.  I can fit the entire bag, nuts and all into a one gallon tupperware and just let it sit.  I wrap the edge of the bag around the rim of the tuppper and put a rubber band around it.  Then loosely put the cover on.  It does everything else.
