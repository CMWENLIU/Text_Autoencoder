This toy is my dogs absolute favorite. He goes nuts whenever we take it out. I put an entire meal inside and it keep him occupied for at least 20 minutes. The hard plastic has a potential to do a number on your wood furniture and floors. My dog figured out if he drops it down the stairs, the food comes out faster. On the other hand, the hard plastic is what makes this so durable. I have a STRONG chewer. Very few toys last around our mutt but this lasted a couple years with frequesnt use. Yes it's hard to clean but at that point, wear and tear required a new one anyways. We are on our second and it remains a favorite in our house.
