Me? I think it's overpriced---funny tasting salt, and since I don't use salt, probably something I could do without. But the wife, who happened to see this or a similar product on the Food Network, just had to have some. I bought it. She likes it.<br /><br />So now I'm a household hero, as least this weekend. I'd give it six stars if it would kept her quiet for the entire week.
