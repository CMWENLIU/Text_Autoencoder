If you love pineapple, you won't be disappointed by this item. About half the can is sweet pinapple juice, the other half, nice bite sized chunks to eat. Even my cat liked these, because he would lick at them in my hand and eat them.<br /><br />Stay away from the "crushed" variety though, which isn't crushed at all, and is more like a disguisting slush. But this "chunks" variety is absolutely delicious and highly recommended.
