I had never cooked with fermented black beans before but I had seen them in several Thai and Chinese recipes.  For this price, I thought I'd give it a try.  Now I won't be without it.  It lasts forever, a little goes a long way, and combined with Sichuan peppercorns, really packs a flavor punch.  Highly recommend for stir fries.  Use your food processor to grind up a teaspoon or two then toss with garlic into your oiled wok before adding anything else.  Yum.
