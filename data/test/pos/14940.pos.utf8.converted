Wedderspoon Raw Organic Organic Manuka Honey Active 16+, 17.6-Ounce Jar<br /><br />Just opening the jar, before I even tasted it; I knew that this was Heaven on Earth.  The Bible often refers to heaven as the land of milk and honey.  This too me always seemed rather blah and not much of an incentive, until I smelled this honey.  Then, one taste and I was there. (Thank you Weederspoon for illuminating the Bible.)<br /><br />I bought it for my health.  I did not know, that it would make my taste buds sing "hallelujah!". I felt physically better in less that 24 hours. It is the best honey product on this Earth. The aroma is intoxicating. I put the honey in my tea, but I also ate a spoonful for an instant health kick. (Be fore-warned; you will want to eat the entire jar.)<br /><br />It can be used on skin eruptions, pimples, ulcers etc.  It can possibly save diabetics an amputation if their wounds are treated with this honey instead of endless rounds of antibiotics that are not working.) I would use it sooner than later.  (There is a tendency to only try alternatives as a last resort.)<br /><br />If you are just a gourmet and not a health-nut: this is the honey for you. I never want to see a different honey product again.  Only Weederspoon Raw Organic Manuka Honey Active 16+ will do it for me.
