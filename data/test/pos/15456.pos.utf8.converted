Came across this coffee in a hotel in Kazakhstan during a business visit. Really enjoyed it ,but it is not available in Australia to the consumer. Found it on Amazon, and now have it every morning.If you like coffee with real "guts" and a bit of flavour but none of that bitterness, this is the one.
