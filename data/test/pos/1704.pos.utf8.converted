I am a founding member of a secret society that is solely responsible for the fishstick industry. We invented and perfected what everyone has come to recognize as the de facto texture and shape of fine fish. Some people will tell you that Lee Martinez is the founder of the modern fishstick, but they are misinformed. Lee was my pupil. He is a glory hound who was banned from the society when he boldly renounced the word "zest" when describing processed meat goods.<br /><br />When I am searching for a flavor to perfectly compliment the woodsy zing of a fresh stick of fish, these olives are the finest.
