I hate poo. I really hate smelling it from litter boxes. I tried all types of the natural litters (except the cedar kind, how it clumps worried me) I will not use clay because of the health risks to my cats. Green tea litter works the best! My house no longer smells like cats live there, it also has very minimal tracking (I use the modKat litter box). I absolutely love it, I was so frustrated with finding the right litter until I stumbled onto this one.<br />I try to scoop the litter boxes daily (longest I go is 2 days, but only when I'm ridiculously busy)<br /><br />PROS:<br />clumps well<br />low - no odor<br />tracks very little<br />flush-able (but not in large quantities)<br />Light enough to walk home from the store with<br />doesn't stick to my cats fur<br /><br />CONS:<br />sometimes my cats bat around a pellet or two on the floor<br />dusty out of the bag and while scooping<br /><br />OTHER BRANDS:<br />*The Sweatscoop litter tracked everywhere and attracted little bugs (I noticed them mainly in new boxes!) Urine would cause big clumps to stick to the bottom of the litter pan and scraping them off incited terror that chunks would fly up and hit me in the face (I had to use so much force that yes, chunks occasionally would fly, it was gross)<br />*The corn worlds best litter smelled so weird right out of the bag that I could not put up with it for more than a day! It clumped well, but tracked everywhere because it was so light, and also would get all over my kittens fur, not cool. The smell is the worst part though,The memory of it still makes me cringe when I think about it.<br />*Good mews recycled paper smelled horrible out of the bag, was heavy, looked gross in the box, and was not flush-able. It only started to smell worse once my cats used it.
