This is the best mass market hot sauce available. It's a tad more expensive than the big players such as Frank's or Tabasco, but the flavor is far superior and not overwhelmed by excessive heat.  There are hundreds of specialty hot sauces out there to choose from. Most are sold on the heat or the packaging but are rarely sold on the flavor.  My husband uses this sauce constantly and it works at every meal (even scrambled eggs).  He also uses it in his chilis and his spaghetti sauce.<br /><br />Here's a hint: In my husband's superb spaghetti sauce, he goes for intense garlic and basil.  He adds ground black pepper for a standard heat-- but just a hint.  He also adds a tablespoon of Cholula, too.  The Cholula lends just a slight touch of heat but adds a lot of complexity to the flavor, so the sauce remains an Italian spaghetti sauce, but certainly is tweaked so that there is no other sauce like it and few better!<br /><br />The packaging is beautiful and the wooden top is a nice touch.  When compared with any Tabasco, Cholula is superior!
