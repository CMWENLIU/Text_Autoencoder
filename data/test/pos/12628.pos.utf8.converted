Otherwise known as prunes, dried plums are one of the very  best foods there are, for anti-oxidant value.  These are very tasty, and you don't have to worry about any undesirable or even unintentioned bad things being in there.  Even my wife, who is a junk food junkie if there ever was one, likes them!  Having 6 oz.re-sealable bags mean they stay fresh (vs. using 16 Oz. box).  There is no down side here.  Even as a very severe diabetic, I have no problem with them.
