You know they are Starbucks coffee when you walk into the kitchen and smell just like you are in Starbucks. French Roast coffee is one of our favorites. Some new brands I try, I don't always get the perfect cup of Joe all the time. But with Starbucks, they never disappoints me everytime I turn my coffee pot on.
