I am very happy with this garden so happy I am ordering a 2nd one.  I planted salad greens just a week ago and the plants are growing so quick you can see the difference each day.  I work a day time job so I have the light come on about the time I get home and stay on all night - that way it is almost like a second lamp and I can look and admire my plants as much as I want.  It is fun watching them grow and I can't wait to harvest them.  The salad green kit said that you can start harvesting in about 2.5 weeks, and at the rate these plants are growing  I believe that to be true.  I have tried growing fruits and vegatables indoors before but I never had much luck.  The thought of being able to eat freshly picked food is enough to make me buy another garden.  I can't wait for them to come out with the Strawberry seed pods (I will probably need a 3rd garden then).<br /><br />I now had my first salad with the salad greens; it was so good I made a 2nd larger salad.  I am very happy with this garden.
