I just found this huge gallon jug of red coconut oil.  I've been using it for weeks now and it tastes and handles just like the movie theater.  It is semi solid at room temperature.<br /><br />A friend I know has owned a movie theater for over 20 years.  He told me the industry secret.<br />You know that old popcorn smell at the movie theater?  That sweet smell that reassures you and lets you know you've arrived in the cool air conditioned retreat of your favorite movie house?  That smell is red coconut oil cooking over high heat.  Sadly the health conscious has abandoned this, but still today in most theater's red coconut oil is used.  I've found a couple products I really like but they come in tiny containers.  That's no good.  This is a gallon.  Bring on the popcorn!  This will be enough to serve an entire crowd at a high school football game.  You only need a tablespoon and a half for an 1/4 cup of uncooked popcorn.<br /><br />Next get Flavorcol.  This is the seasoned salt that is used.<br /><br />Don't use butter.  It won't turn out right.  Use butter flavored topping.<br />Good Luck!
