Scharffen Berger Chocolate is one of the best premium chocolate bars out there. When they were based in Berkeley, I had taken a tour of the factory and was able to taste many of their bars. Of all the different Scharffen Berger bars there are, the Sea Salted Almond bar is definitely my favorite. This particular flavor  is so hard to find in stores that I'm excited that Amazon carries this flavor.<br /><br />The Sea Salted Almond bar is labeled as milk chocolate. However, it contains 41% Cocoa which makes it a "darker" chocolate than most milk chocolate bars out there. The higher cocoa content gives the chocolate the quality of a semi-sweet chocolate. Despite the higher cocoa content, the bar still has the smooth mouth feel of milk chocolate. The smooth texture of the chocolate contrasts nicely with the slight saltiness from the sea salt and crunchiness from the tiny almond pieces. This chocolate is everything you expect from a high quality chocolate bar: not too sweet, complex chocolate flavor, and a nice balance of flavor and texture from the added ingredients.
