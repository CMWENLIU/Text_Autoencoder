Izze all natural sparkling juice (Clementine) is a very delicious drink.  They come in real nifty 8 ounce cans (for the conscious calorie watcher) that are great for those who want a quick treat without feeling guilty.  Unlike other juice drinks, this one is refreshing, tasty and not to syrupy sweet.  The drink reminded me of an Italian soda.  I would strongly recommend this beverage.  You can't go wrong with picking up a case of this good stuff.<br />I'm hooked and a future customer.  The juice is lightly fortified with a few vitamins for your good health.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
