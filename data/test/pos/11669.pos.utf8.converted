These work exactly as you imagine those little grocery store bottles of food coloring SHOULD but don't. The gel form of these beauties makes them super concentrated and the colors are VERY clear and bright. I'm never using the cheapie kind again. These are little plastic squeeze bottles so you can get exactly the amount you need.<br /><br />I made rainbow colors for my cupcakes and they were awesome.
