These are so yummy!  My whole family loves them!  My daughter and I eat them straight from the container while my husband, who is dieting, loves them mixed in with his yogurt.  My son won't eat his Rice Krispies or Cheerios without sprinkling these over the top.  You can't imagine how addicting these little strawberries are!!!
