I am so grateful to Zevia for this product.  I couldn't drink anything but water.  As a diabetic, no sugar and I have an allergy to 'man-made substitute sugar', probably a very good thing.  Coffee and Tea upset my stomach (I'm getting up there in years).  And then I stumbled upon the Zevia site.  YES!!!<br /><br />I was already using Stevia (the natural sugar that is actually so harmless it is GOOD for diabetics!!  And here was a drink I could actually have and pop!  I hadn't had a pop in years!!  How absolutely delightful!<br /><br />I purchased some to try, hoping I would like it, as it turned out I love the taste of it.  I cannot do a comparison by taste since I haven't had regular soda's in forever but Zevia Rootbeer is way, way too sweet for me (considering I haven't been able to have granulated sugar).  I worried at first that I couldn't have the rootbeer flavor  because it like all 'rootbeers' may have licorice root which raises blood pressure...HA!  Zevia rootbeer is made with ginger root and tastes exactly as I remembered rootbeer.  I have some but keep it for times when I have an upset stomach or dizziness.<br /><br />I drink the cola and Twist all the time and as yet haven't had a chance to try the Orange, but I'm looking forward to it.  Diabetics with a sweet tooth can drink this and it will cut down their craving for sugar.<br /><br />I drive quite a ways to get it because the shipping is bit steep on the Net but I manage to keep plenty in my pantry.  I've become a very big fan of Zevia!!!<br /><br />I really hope more and more people learn of Zevia and will begin to drink it, because once your health is damaged there may be no return to good health.  Life becomes "What if" and "If only".  So if you get a chance to try Zevia go for it.  To your good health!
