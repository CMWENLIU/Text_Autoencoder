I was really disappointed when the WalGreens and grocery stores around me stopped carrying these. They have been my favorite lollipops since I was about twelve years old.<br /><br />For those buying blind, let me just clarify once and for all: THESE LOLLIPOPS ARE FLAT! THEY ARE NOT ROUNDED LIKE A TOOTSIE POP OR A DUM-DUM.<br /><br />The actual hard candy part of the lollipop is a delicious granny smith apple flavor unlike any other candy out there, with a very satisfying, crisp tartness. On the outside, the Tootsie Roll company has slopped a generous spoonful of sweet caramel, and yes, this does tend to make the shape of the lollipop undulate a little bit. The shape of one pop isn't going to be consistent to the next.<br /><br />If that bothers you, well... I'll be honest, I find that a really weird thing to hold against a lollipop. Either way, the real draw here is the taste. These things are so good that, despite them not being available in my area anymore, I am willing to online and spend shipping & handling to get them. That should say something.
