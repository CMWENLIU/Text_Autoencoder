My favorite cacao for a hot chocolate.<br /><br />recipe for a nice hot chocolate:<br /><br />50% skimmed milk (1,5%)<br />50% milk (3,5%)<br />heat milk, then add<br />2 large spoons of cacao (size of spoons depends on amount of milk)<br />1 smaller spoon of unrefined brown sugar.<br />Stir, and you're done.<br />color should be dark brown - if not dark enough, add more to your taste.<br />Better than any ready made hot chocolate
