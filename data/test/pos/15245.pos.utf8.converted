I've been eating these on and off for the past three weeks as part of a healthy eating plan my doctor recommended.  While they do not contain any flavor, they really do take on the taste of the foods they are cooked with.  Make sure to rinse them very, very, very well before adding them to your meal.  I have found the "rice" is a great addition to soups, especially chicken soup.  I made the mistake of freezing my soup twice and thawing them in the microwave.  Both the noodles and rice shriveled up and looked really weird.  Haven't tried to freeze/thaw again.  Make everything fresh.  These aren't bad and I think I will incorporate them into my everyday cooking for my family when the diet is finished.  :)
