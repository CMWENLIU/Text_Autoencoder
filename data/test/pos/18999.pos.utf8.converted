I love this coconut oil, I ordered 4 quantities and all of them were super fresh and tasted very delicious. The texture was great and it's a joyous treat to use every time. Coconut oil has many uses, but I use it mainly as a dietary supplement. I use it to cook my morning eggs or sauteing vegetables with the omelet, add some to my oatmeal every morning, put a little in my tea or coffee, add some to my protein or fruit shakes, or just take it by the spoonful which is melt in your mouth deliciousness.<br />I am a very active person and a health nut, and I follow a low-carb diet and way of life, so I put great emphasis on consuming lots of quality oils and fats in my diet. Coconut oil makes the perfect addition. I am 100% satisfied with the quality of this coconut oil.<br /><br />However, having said all of this, one thing that I wish was different about the product was the package. The jar is plastic and my limited knowledge in chemistry points me to the old knowledge that "like dissolves like"... and since oils and plastics are both derived from nonpolar substances, this leads me to worry that there will be plastic leaking into the oil. Albeit this is a tremendously slow process, nonetheless it still makes me second guess coming back to this product and purchasing a brand that uses glass jars instead. If they change their packaging methods, I will have no problem purchasing this brand again. Although, I did not take off any stars for this reason because most coconut oil packages these days seem to come in plastic containers, so it wouldn't be fair to rate this brand less than others.<br /><br />One thing that I have done to lessen my worry is to refrigerate the oil so that it solidifies. My rationale behind this is that less oil is in contact with the plastic container when the oil is solidified because only the edges touch as opposed to a liquid form, which is constantly mixing and makes more surface area contact. I actually like to take my coconut oil when solidified because I like how it melts slowly when eaten and you can savor the taste better.<br /><br />I hope this helped others.
