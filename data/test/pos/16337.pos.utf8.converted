The AeroGarden was easy to put together, the directions were clear and so far it is performing as expected.  It seems like it does grow pretty fast and you don't have to do much but watch it grow and explain it to your friends (people are very interested in this thing).  I had to reset the light timer because at first it was on all night and off in the day, but that was easy and now it comes on in the morning and goes off around bedtime.  I already have little yellow flowers on my tomatoes and I don't think it's been growing even a month!
