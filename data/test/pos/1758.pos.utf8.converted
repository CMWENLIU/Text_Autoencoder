Tastes good & is good for him!<br /><br />My Dalmatian (11 years old) has had problems with bladder stones caused by purines (the same amino acid that causes gout). If he's forming the stones, he will start bleeding slightly after he has peed (bladder stone are a real danger for Dalmatians and sometimes their urinary tracts get completely clogged like his once did, requiring emergency surgery).<br /><br />Dick Van Patten's Vegetarian Natural Balance has not caused any purine related problems. I would recommend it for Dalmatians. I think because it is vegetarian, it has fewer purines than meat based dog foods.<br /><br />He likes it too!
