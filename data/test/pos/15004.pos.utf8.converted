I can only give this a 5-star review. Sure it's expensive, but the aroma and taste of this salt is amazing, and happily stronger than I expected. I recently bought a truffle oil that had hardly any aroma at all and was very disappointed. Just a pinch of this salt fills your dish with complexity and depth. It's amazing what just a little pinch will do in an omelet, or on top of saut&eacute;ed vegetables. Right after I submit this review i'm going to buy a 2nd one as a gift for a friend.
