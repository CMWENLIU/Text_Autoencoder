I love this tea. I tried it initially at P.F changs restaurant and ordered it immediately after I found out what brand and flavor it was. It truly needs no sugar added just the wedge of a lemon. Trust me I'm a 24 year old who loves soda and sugar and I'm telling you this tea is perfect with just a wedge of lemon. Not only is it delicious but I've found that I lost a couple pounds because I'm drinking much less soda.<br /><br />Since the product description is lacking here is mine:::<br />Be aware that this tea is lose leaf and doesn't come in tea bags. After doing some research on the web I found that the best way to brew the tea is as follows. Each plastic bag inside the box has 3/4 ounce of tea. This should make 3/4 gallon or 96 ounces. So all you need to do is bring to a boil half the amount or 48 ounces in a pot. Then let it sit off the burner for 2 minutes. Then add the pouch of loose leaf tea [3/4 ounce in total] and let it steep or brew for 7 minutes.... 10 minutes is too long and 5 minutes is too short. So set a timer it's important.<br />After 7 minutes strain the water through a strainer with a paper towel layed in it. *** Make sure the bowl is beneath the strainer ***. Then put the strained liquid into a pitcher and add the remaining 48 ounces of tap water. Refridgerate and in an hour so should be good to go.<br /><br />In each of these boxes there are 24 3/4 ounces packages which will make a total of 18 gallons of iced tea.
