I love these puffs. They're crunchy and delicious and sooo flavorful. My local health food store is always out of these, so I'm delighted to find them here.<br /><br />I was just reading that Barbara's Bakery participates in the non-GMO project, so that's a huge plus. I hope that means that this product is non-GMO.<br /><br />They also don't have any MSG (under that name or any other name that I can spot). That stuff is a cheap flavor enhancer, but this brand uses real food to enhance the flavor. What a novel idea!  They don't have any artificial food coloring, either.<br /><br />I guess there is a difference between snack food and junk food, and this actually tastes better than the stuff I grew up eating!
