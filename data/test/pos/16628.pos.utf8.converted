Like the first reviewer, I thought it wasn't working for the first two days, so much so that the "fly trap report" became a family joke.  Turns out the "lure" material had to have a little time to work itself up to smelling like--um--like something that flies would like? Goes without saying that this isn't a smell we humans would like, so don't hang it near or in your house.  We have ours in the garbage area, where it works wonderfully. It isn't a strong smell, but it is noticable if you are within, say, three feet.  And occasionally I get a whiff of it on the breeze.  I'm happy to live with that minor inconvenience for the number of flies it collects, literally hundreds in a short time.
