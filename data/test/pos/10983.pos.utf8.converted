We like trying new flours for our home made bread (mostly sourdough).  Spelt works very well with sourdough starter.  Gives the bread a subtle nut like flavor and fine texture.  Plus, it doesn't affect the rise very much (we do add gluten to assist the sourdough rise).  Of amaranth, teff, and spelt, we like spelt the best.
