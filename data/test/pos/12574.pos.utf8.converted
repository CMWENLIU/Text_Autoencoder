The texture reminds me somewhat of Turkish Delight (a bit chewier), sans nuts, and obviously not at all delicate in flavor. These little evil chewy bites pack a nice, hot, gingery punch that I'm addicted to.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it's the flavor, the texture or a bit of both that propelled this candy to the top of my 'favorites' list, but they're there to stay!<br /><br />I will add that these are also great if you've got a bit of an upset tummy, too. I wish I had these when I was pregnant with both of my children.<br /><br />At least now I can enjoy them without needing a reason to! :P<br /><br />(I'd be in deep trouble if they made these things in cinnamon!)
