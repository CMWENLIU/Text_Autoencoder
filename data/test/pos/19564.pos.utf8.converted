This is the third flavor of this brand we tried and it, like the other two, have been a huge hit with our cat. We follow a primarily raw food diet for him and sometimes get cans as a treat (or if we get a little lazy). This brand is high quality and really does seem safe for human consumption. Amazon offers an amazing deal so we're back to stock up before the cost goes up. Delivery was a dream, as usual. For less than twenty cents more per can than some horrible by-product laden generic cat food, our little beast (and we) are satisfied. Marbella Paella was a huge hit!
