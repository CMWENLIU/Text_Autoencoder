I've grown to enjoy this coconut water even though I do not like coconuts. I used to be an active basketball player and wanted something to drink that was a healthy nutritional beverage. An associate kept pestering me about this coconut water saying it's the next super drink. He told me that they used coconut water to replace blood plasma in World War II. Eventually I succumbed and tried to stuff.  During strenuous activity I like the way it settles in my stomach before games and the energy it gave me.
