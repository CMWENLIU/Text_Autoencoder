REMEMBER THE OLD WAY OF STIRRING PEANUT BUTTER?<br /><br />I think you've all experienced trying to stir a fresh jar of viscous separated peanut butter before. You stick a knife in and stir and stir and stir. In about a minute your hand starts to cramp so you try to use more of your arm. That's when you get clumsy and the oil starts to spill over the sides. The jar gets slippery making it difficult to grab onto its side; plus you've left a mess on the countertop. 10 minutes later you're still stuck with big clumps of peanut and a pool of sludge on the top.<br /><br />THE NEW WAY:<br /><br />This gadget eliminates the mess and gets the job done in about 5 minutes.<br /><br />SOME TIPS:<br /><br />- Place the jar on a oven mit when stirring so that it doesn't slip.<br /><br />- After the peanut butter is mixed (and of course after you've taken the stirrer+lid out) just store it in the fridge to prevent separation. To use the peanut butter just nuke in microwave  (without the lid of course) for about 30 seconds.<br /><br />- If you typically buy the larger peanut butter jars, go to Witmer's web site and order the larger stirrer. The deluxe kit comes with lids of both sizes.
