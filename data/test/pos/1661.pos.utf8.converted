I have used the noodle in several recipes and truly impressed with the versatility.<br />  I started with stir fry and was satisfied with the taste but found the leftovers fantastic.  The flavor of the sauce soaked into the noodle and wow.<br /><br />  I used them in a chicken Tetrazzini and again they took in the light flavor of the sauce and very satisfying.<br /><br />  The most appreciated (by my sister) was as an extention to spaghetti noodles.  She has been just been classed as Diabetic and a 1/2cup of pasta just does not look right so used the noodle as an extender.  I did soak the noodle in flavored water(powdered garlic,onion and water) while making the sauce just to bump the flavor and it worked very well.<br /><br />  So I guess you could say five stars is just fine with me.
