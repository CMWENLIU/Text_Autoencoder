I bought enough of these so I got free shipping, which made the price even more excellent compared to the grocery store where the same brand was selling  in one pound sacks for $6-7 / lb.  So this is  a great deal.  It looks and tastes just like sugar (I am not exaggerating!) though it is not actually sugar but a sugar alcohol.  It is perhaps slightly sweeter, tends to lump up a little more, but the lumps break up easily with stirring.  Though it is not lower calorie, it is low glycemic index which means that it is converted to sugars more slowly and therefore does not cause insulin levels to spike (a factor in fatty weight gain), and actually protects against tooth decay!  Your recipies convert spoon per spoon of sugar or cup per cup so it's easy to use.  It cooks up like sugar too.<br /><br />We really love this product.  Buy enough to get free shipping and really save!
