My toddler has been enjoying these for a year now.  They are very expensive in stores for just small containers.  The larger Amazon pack is great and much more economical.  Be sure to put the container in a larger ziploc bag after opening to be sure they don't get moist.  The container itself doesn't reseal well enough after opening.<br /><br />These are the only banana chips I've found that are only banana.  Most other brands contain extra sugar plus oil.  These do stick to your teeth when eating dry, but less so than candy and are a much healthier snack for kids.
