It wasn't until a few months ago that I introduced my cat to Bonito flakes. The fact that it's all natural is a big plus. I had previously purchased Cat-Man-Doo Extra Large Bonito Flakes and he went nuts over it. The 4oz. bag lasted a little over 2 months. I was going to order another bag but the price has gone up $10, so I decided to try Bellyrubs instead. Even though you get .5oz less with Bellyrubs there seems to be less dusting and small flakes. The flakes also seem to be softer and the ziploc bag is a little more robust. My 6 yr. old black cat loves this stuff and gives it two paws up.<br /><br />Food for thought: Bonita means "pretty" in Spanish, and Bonito is the correct spelling of the fish.
