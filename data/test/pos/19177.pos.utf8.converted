McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal has the best flavor & texture of any oatmeal available.  However, it takes a little experimenting with all the methods of cooking to find the cooking method that is right for your individual taste.  I invested in a small (6 cup) microwave rice cooker and use the following recipe:  Bring 1 cup of water to a rolling boil in an uncovered microwave rice cooker.  Stir in 1/4 cup oatmeal, cover and lock rice cooker lid and allow to sit overnight.  The next morning place rice cooker in microwave and cook for approximately 12 minutes at 40% power (Using reduced power keeps the rice cooker from overflowing).  Remove from microwave and let sit for 7-10 minutes.  Remove lid and add toppings of your choice (brown sugar, butter, milk, dried fruit, stir & enjoy. Makes 1 serving.
