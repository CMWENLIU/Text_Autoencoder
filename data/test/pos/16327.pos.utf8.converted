Of course, a huge amount of technique is required!  My son-in-law uses it to thicken his wonderful chili.  He gave me the recipe, which I placed in Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook.  He's such a nice son-in-law.  He would not want me to tell you this, but he is a great cook.<br /><br />Maseca Corn Flour is made from ground, dried corn. It can be used to make masa harina (dough) for "tortillas, sopes and empanadas, enchiladas, pupusas, guaraches, arepas and atole," the manufacturer says. It is gluten free.<br /><br />The manufacturer (the Gruma) company has been making this fine corn flour for over 50 years.
