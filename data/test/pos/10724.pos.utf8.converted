When we got our lab puppy I did a lot of comparing different brands of dog food including cost. This is a great deal. A lot of dog foods boast chicken or another meat as the first ingredient but the list is based on weights. If it says chicken followed by a grain of some sort, the grain is probably the most abundant ingredient because the chicken loses around 60% of its weight when cooked. This has chicken-meal as the first ingredient (after chicken) which is cooked and dried when weighed. It doesn't have any corn or wheat products. We used Blue Buffalo at first but it was more expensive and our puppy never had firm stools. We don't have that problem with this. We also tried Castor & Pollux Natural Ultramix but she didn't like it. Organix is a great deal on subscribe and save on Amazon, our puppy loves it, and it is good for her. Now if only I fed myself as healthy as I feed her =)<br />As a side note: the Organix dog cookies were not a hit. For training I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0ZJHW">Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals Dog Treats, 16 Ounces</a>, all 3 flavors are a big hit, and they're the perfect size.
