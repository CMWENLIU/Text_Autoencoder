I ordered this oil just before the holidays. Unfortunately, the bottle sent to me leaked during shipment. When I contacted Italian Products, they were courteous and apologetic and told me to discard the bottle, that they would replace it. Well, they did -- with two bottles! One was sent as a generous apology/thank you gift. These people want your business!<br /><br />Did I mention the oil? It's cold pressed and unfiltered (you can tell -- it's cloudy), young, fresh, and fruity with hints of grassiness. It  warms a little in your throat...it's delicious drizzled on greens or over soup. I haven't had it with pasta yet, but I'm sure it will be wonderful. It's a rich, assertive oil if that's what you like.<br /><br />I tell you this with great trepidation because I want to be able to keep ordering it!
