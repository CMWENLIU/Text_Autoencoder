This, along with the dry food, is the only thing I feed my 2 Miniature Poodles...there are so many BAD foods out there that contain NOTHING of value or nutrition for my dog..this was a no brainer. I did my homework and research of all available food and Chicken Soup was always #1 or #2 in what I was looking for.<br />Being able to order from Amazon is just another BONUS<br /><br />9/1/2011just got another shipement - what is going on!!!!  The food is NOT in the original case--it's almost loose and of the case 14 of the cans are DENTED  what is happening to AMAZON ?????
