Nuttzo is amazing!!! My only complaint is that I can't stop eating it!  I am used to skipping breakfasts, which I know is not a good habit... I started eating Nuttzo on my favorite health bread and it is so satisfying and energizing.  My kids also love it which is so rare to find a food we all can eat!  This is unlike any nut butter I've ever had and there are so many different ways to encorporate it into your day to  give you a healthy energy boost.  It is one of those things you want at home, at work, on the go because you know that you are getting quality, healthy food so if its right there you'll be so happy you ate that instead of whatever else may be tempting!  I will definitely keep this as a regular item in my house.
