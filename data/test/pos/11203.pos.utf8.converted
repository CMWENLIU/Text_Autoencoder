Delicious!  Amazon is the only place I've been able to find grade B maple syrup in reasonably small containers.  It has considerably more intense maple flavor than grade A.  The usual assumption is that grade A is better than grade B but unlike eggs or meat, the grade refers to when the syrup is harvested, grade B being the more intensely flavored.  Makes pancakes and waffles worth getting up for!
