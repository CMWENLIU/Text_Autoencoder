Polar Kipper Snacks.<br />These were (briefly) stocked by my local Supermarket chain (acme)  They are very superior to the flavor of the competitive products.  Perhaps it's because they are a German product, while the others are Canadian and U.S. sources.  Although this is a small purchase, the price, including the shipping, is worth it, especially since 18 cans should last me a few months.  A healthful and nutricious snack for fish-eaters like me.
