I just purchased a Tassimo coffee and drink maker (from Amazon, of course), and the Cappucino and Latte pods to use with it. I love the Cappucino and Latte, they are wonderful treats in the AM, or anytime, for that matter, but I wanted to flavor my drinks with something more. The Torani Syrups are wonderful, because they can be used for flavoring coffee, tea, even ice cream, and I get the full coffee house experience without leaving my home! Great...and really good, too.
