This is quite possibly one of the best chocolate you can buy. As a Ritter Sport fan I have to say the butter biscuit ("Butterkeks")edition is simply unbelievably good.<br />TIP: put this in the fridge (in the butter section of your fridge, not too cold please!).<br />You will absolutely DIE with pleasure eating this.<br />LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!<br /><br />Remember, the way you open any Ritter Sport is to break it in the middle. If you do it right the package will open properly in the middle of the back of the package. Enjoy!<br /><br />PS: I'm a guy. I usually don't get that excited about anything. So this should tell ya something...
