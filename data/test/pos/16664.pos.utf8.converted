After several attempts at making a small batch of wine, which ended with stuck fermentations, I elected to try this strain for fermenting a small batch (35 lbs of clusters) of Cabernet Savignon.  Damn this yeast went straight to zero residual sugar. As a result it's my new favorite home-made wine yeast.<br /><br />My home-made Cab here in Boise is labeled Chateau Bonnier de La Chapelle after a hero of the French resistance.
