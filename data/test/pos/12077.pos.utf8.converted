This is one of the best Hamburger Helper products of the line, and it's REALLY difficult to find, for some reason.  Perhaps because it's such a relatively simple and 'unsophisticated' flavor line, compared to their more fancy names and flavors.  It's a simple 10"-12" skillet meal, so if you want something exotic or 'fancier', you may think this 'beneath' you (and you'd be wrong) but the spaghetti texture and taste is excellent, and the sauce taste has the same great, satisfying taste.  For our family, I always use about twice the ground beef they recommend, but that's because my family prefers more meat.  I've always been quite picky about prepackaged pasta sauces and meal kits, and this is really the only one that we all love.  It's quite simply great tasting, easy, and very satisfying -- something adults and kids both will enjoy.<br /><br />Because it is so hard to find in local stores, I was thrilled to find this here, and am ordering a couple of the 12-packs.
