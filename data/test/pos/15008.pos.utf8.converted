Back in the early '60's my family would take several road trips a year from our home in NYC to the Boston area to visit my grandparents. We'd always stop at a Howard Johnsons restaurant where, in the days before "kids meals", I'd always order the traditional hot dogs, B&M boston baked beans and brown bread. You can't find B&M brown bread where I live in Va....it was just as I remembered...and it's a great price. Highly recommended (especially with dogs and beans)
