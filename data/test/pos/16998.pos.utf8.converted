I had a chance to try these chocolates while in Holland. I only bought a few because I wasn't sure what they were (the sales person and I couldn't communicate past a few English words). Well, I am home now and I want more. I finally found them here... at a decent price and just this kind instead of a mixed box(which I am sure would be fine, but I want these and only these!)<br /><br />If you like almonds and hazelnut, buy them, they are better than anything I have had from Godiva and that is saying a lot!
