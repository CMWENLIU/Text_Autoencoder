The AeroGarden had been so fun to use, and the Salad Chef Pack is especially gratifying in that I can just pluck a few leaves and put it on a sandwich or make a small salad.  The grandkids think this is just the best idea ever.  I purchased the AeroGarden for my father who has been a gardener for years.  He still loves the outdoor activity of his garden (at 92) but is having a good time with this as well.  He shows his great granddaughters how it works, shows them when the plants start growing, has them help harvest, and makes tasty treats for them.  Now, how much more fun could you want?
