Who doesn't love Kellogg's Rice Krispie Treats? I know that I love them way, way too much -- so I really have to try to limit myself. When they're in the house, I swear I can hear them calling my name!<br /><br />When I had a bunch of folks in the house for a movie night, I put them on the coffee table, and you'd think I had offered them the finest pastry in the world!<br /><br />Free shipping makes this an offer you can't resist.
