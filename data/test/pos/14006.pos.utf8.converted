I am a Barista at my local Indianapolis Starbucks, so I am very picky about the coffee I drink. It is rare that I will ever drink anything but the best that we provide at Starbucks, but every once in a while I step out of my realm and try something new. The original Folgers just doesn't do it for me. I can taste what your money is worth in it. But in this Brazilian Blend by Folgers, you cant tell a difference between it and the Starbucks Brazil Seasonal Blend. It is a great way to get that smooth Brazilian bean flavor year round.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you haven't had it you are missing out. Give it a shot and you won't regret it. Goodluck finding it at your local grocery. Get it here at Amazon and it comes fast and fresh.
