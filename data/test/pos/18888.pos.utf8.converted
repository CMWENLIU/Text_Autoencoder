I have always given my standard poodles "cookies".  They have never turned their noses up at any treats, but, their reaction to the Blue Dog biscuits was, and continues to be, extraordinary.<br /><br />Their reaction to the Soft Treats convinces me that they must contain heroin.  My wife gives them one each at bedtime.  She has their undivided attention, while she gets ready for bed.  The only downside is they tend to drool whilst waiting.
