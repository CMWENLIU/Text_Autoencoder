I've had my Keurig for four years, and have always liked the convenience. But honestly, I found myself almost always using it for tea because all the coffees I tried just didn't do it for me. I was in Target this morning and saw these Caribou Blend K-Cups and decided to give them a try. I'm in the middle of a huge deadline and need coffee way more than tea. So I brewed my first cup, not expecting much, and was completely blown away by the flavor, the smoothness and the lack of aftertaste. Now, for the first time in four years, I don't just like my Keurig. I love it. Best COFFEE K-Cups by a mile.
