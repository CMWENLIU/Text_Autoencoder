I think switching formulas is becoming a popular past-time of new parents these days, and when I look back on our experience with our first baby I'm almost ashamed at how frantically we switched her formulas around, searching for an answer to her gassy, colicky behavior. I think in total we tried 7 or 8, from powder to ready-to-feed, hoping that one would be a magical formula that eased her tummy (and our eardrums) during her fussy evening hours.<br /><br />Unfortunately, none of those formulas worked magic. It ended up being that our daughter's belly really did just need to grow & mature before she could readily digest formula, and even the hypo-allergenic ones made little difference in her spit-up or tummy achin' behavior.<br /><br />However, Similac Sensitive was always our fall-back formula because it seemed to cause the least amount of stomach upset, didn't smell as horrible as some of the others, and with the coupons they send out (from StrongMoms) - it was surprisingly affordable for the most part. Strangely, our daughter would only drink ready-to-feed and would never finish a powder-prepared bottle and did seem more gassy after those. So we had to bite our bottom lips and put out the extra money for the liquid, which though expensive, was also very handy on trips and during late night feedings.<br /><br />Similac Sensitive still has a small amount of lactose in it, but it's broken down more than Similac Advance so it's easier to digest. And since it's already sterilized in the bottle, there are none of those new-parent worries over your powdered formula being contaminated or washing your hands before every bottle you make/feed. Trust me, when you're running on 2 hours of sleep, these "simple pleasures" can really make a big difference. I also called Similac's customer service on several occasions to ask questions and they were polite and helpful, and even sent coupons!<br /><br />We used Similac Sensitive until our daughter was ready to transition to cow's milk, and although we tried cheaper versions and many other formulas in an attempt to save money, we could never find anything our baby would take as easily as Similac Sensitive, so we stuck by it and would do so with the next baby should the need arise.<br /><br />**********UPDATE**********<br />We just had our second child and immediately skipped all other formulas and went straight to Similac Sensitive. This has saved so much trouble from the first time around! Baby #2 is doing great on this formula, however, he has been diagnosed with Acid Reflux. This means feedings are very difficult and painful. The only alternative to try from this formula is Nutramigen, but its too expensive. We are giving baby #2 Zantac prescribed from his pediatrictian and it seems to be helping.<br /><br />It wasn't mentioned before, but if your baby is taking Similac Sensitive, but still having a lot of spit up or acts differently on the powder vs RTF. This is probably because the RTF is much thicker and babies are able to handle it better. The RTF is also much easier to digest than the powdered version because the nutrients have been fully dissolved 100% into liquid. However, with the powder, baby's belly may have to work a little harder to process the powder. Because our children have acid reflux, powder is not an option. The less spit up, the better because stomach acid is brought back up into the esophagus the more they spit up.
