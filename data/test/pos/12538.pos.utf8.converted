I had to search long and hard to find canned salmon that was both extremely low in salt and wild-caught (i.e., with far fewer PCBs than farmed salmon).  I'm grateful to have found Crown Prince Natural Alaskan Pink Salmon. For anyone concerned about the bones -- They are extremely soft/crumbling, so there's no need to remove them.  They are also an excellent source of calcium.
