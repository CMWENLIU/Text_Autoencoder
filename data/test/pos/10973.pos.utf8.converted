I've always struggled with excessive fatigue, taking an hour nap everyday, constantly yawning about 10-30 times in the morning and I was about to go to the doctor to find out what was wrong. Then I came across the frs energy drink site and tried out the free trial. The results were amazing. As soon as I drank it, I felt the fatigue in the morning that felt like a heavy backpack completely disappear and I had no urge to take my everyday nap. I had a high level of energy that lasted the entire day. Even as I'm typing this at night, I am still feeling it. And even more amazingly, with all this, there were NO side effects whatsoever. I'm taking it everyday since and I strongly recommend it to anyone who struggles with fatigue.
