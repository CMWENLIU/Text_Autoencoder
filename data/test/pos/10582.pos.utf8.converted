These muffins are the best!  I, too, was paying +$5.00 for 4 muffin tops at the store and was thrilled when I found them on Amazon.com.  Like the previous review, I thought the temperature was too high for baking, so I bake them at 325 degrees.  I use 3/4 c. liquid egg substitute for the 3 egg whites, put 7 chocolate chips on each muffin top (I use Vitalicious silicone muffin top pans), and bake them about 20 - 22 minutes.  With the Super Saver Shipping option, stock up...I did!
