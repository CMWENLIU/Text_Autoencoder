My cat is extremely picky when it comes to treats, so I was leery about whether she would eat these or not.  I fed her a couple of her regular treats, then one of these, then a couple of hers, then one of these in order to trick her into trying them.  She likes them!<br /><br />After doing this for several different days, I put a pill in one of them.  She is little, so when I put the pill in one treat she chewed it, which is not what I wanted her to do, since she also chewed the pill.  She takes Prednisolone, which apparently has an awful, bitter taste.  So the next time I put the pill in the pocket, closed it and squeezed off all the excess Greenie treat until I got a little ball.  I fed her a couple of her regular treats, then snuck the pill treat in.  When she started to chew I put another treat in front of her quickly which made her swallow the pill treat whole so that she could eat the next treat.<br /><br />These work great for me!  No more having to sit on top of her, holding her down as she fights me, prying open her mouth and shoving the little pill to the back of her throat, just to have her spit it out so that I have to start the whole process all over again.  I'm sold, and I will be using these from now on.
