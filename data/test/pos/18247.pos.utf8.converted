Saffron lasts a long time and you only need a small amount to flavor most recipes. While it seems expensive, it goes a long way and is not expensive in the long term. This glass bottle of saffron is perfect and will last for what seems like years. I have tried a few varieties over the years and this saffron seems to last a long time and is always flavorful.<br /><br />I use Kashmir and Spanish saffron in many of my dishes, but for bread, I prefer the Spanish Saffron threads. Many recipes call for saffron powder, but using the threads in this recipe is much more effective and the flavor seeps out into the warmed milk. You can also use saffron threads in cream soups to give them a more delicious almost buttery flavor.<br /><br />The purple saffron crocuses must be picked at dawn and then the three red threads must be stripped from each flower. It takes about one hour to strip 1,000 crocus flowers. Saffron can cost thousands of dollars per pound and must be harvested from about 70,000 flowers.<br /><br />Here is my favorite recipe for using these honey-like, intoxicating saffron threads.<br /><br />Saffron Rolls<br /><br />3/4 c. fat-free milk, warmed to 110 degrees<br /><br />8 saffron threads<br /><br />1 pkg. rapid-rise active dry yeast<br /><br />1/4 c. clover honey<br /><br />2 lg. eggs<br /><br />2 T. canola oil<br /><br />1 1/4 tsp. salt<br /><br />4 c. all-purpose flour<br /><br />Oil for bowl<br /><br />This dough may be made in a bread machine or by hand. Bread machine method: After heating the milk, steep saffron for 10 minutes. Strain milk into the bread machine pan along with yeast, honey, eggs, oil, salt and flour. Set on sweet, dough, large cycle. When complete form rolls.<br /><br />Hand method: After heating milk, steep the saffron for 10 minutes. Strain milk into a large bowl. Add yeast and honey. Beat in eggs, oil and salt. Stir in enough flour to make a soft dough, then turn out onto a floured board. Knead until the dough is smooth and elastic. Set in an oiled bowl, turn once to coat with oil.<br /><br />Turn oven on to 200 degrees. When you can feel the heat on your hand, turn the oven off. Cover dough and let rise until double, about 1 hour. Punch dough down and cut into 12 pieces. Form rolls by turning each piece of dough inside out to form smooth rolls. Place on a baking sheet. Brush rolls with melted butter and set back in the warm oven until the rolls have doubled or for about 45 minutes.<br /><br />Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven 25 minutes. Serve with butter and jam. Makes 12 rolls.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
