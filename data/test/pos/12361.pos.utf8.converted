Sometimes you want a decaffeinated or no-caffeine hot drink, and this fits the bill. This isn't really a tea, but it tastes great nonetheless. It's got a light brew that's smooth. The mint and chocolate flavors are very slight; the aftertaste is more minty than the actual sip. This probably won't satisfy a chocolate craving - but it does have a delectable chocolate aroma. I had never tried rooibos tea before this blend, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The brew is sweet & a bit nutty, and is complemented well by the chocolate. A nice change from traditional teas. This brew is *very light* so those of you who are looking for strong mint or chocolate look elsewhere. For those who want a hot smooth non-caffeinated drink, try this out. And if you don't like it, please send the rest to me. ;)
