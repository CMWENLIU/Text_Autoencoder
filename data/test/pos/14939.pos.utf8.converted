I found the taste of this honey to be almost medicinal, but so were the effects.  I had had the honey around for a couple of weeks when I came down with a sore throat and decided to take the honey for a test drive, so to speak.  I used the honey 3 times in one day (1 tsp each time)...and the next morning I felt 100% back to normal.  Would I have recovered that fast anyway from whatever was causing the sore throat?  I don't know, but I do know that I went from feeling bad to feeling normal overnight.  I am a big fan of Manuka honey now.
