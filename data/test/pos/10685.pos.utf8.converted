I had to put my cat on a strict diet because he was having problems with bowel disease.  I switched from meow mix to this and my cats devoured it!  Although, they did not like the (Holistic Select Duck and Chicken Canned Cat Food ), they just nibbled that one and walked away.  After switching foods my cats symptoms started clearing up.  I highly recommend this food and I'm sure your cats will love the taste!
