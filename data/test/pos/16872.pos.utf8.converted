i was able to try this from my friend... i tasted youndoo before i cook and it was lil salty and sweet. i recenlty gave birth to baby and i asked my mom to add youndoo on soup and it tasted really good! i made steamed egg with youndoo,i loved it! we also used on many side dishes. we dont even have to add salt on sided ish because youndoo has right amount saltiness. also this is good for dipping sauce, my family ate grandma's mandoo and it was better than just dipping on soy sauce. resturant should use this instead of msg!!! this is really a true flavor enhancer!<br /><br />im so happy that they are selling online!!
