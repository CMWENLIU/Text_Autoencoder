I have occasionally joked that this is drinkable heroin. When a really good "malted" is served to me, my eyes tend to cross as my lips embrace the straw and I will sometimes not stop sucking on the straw until that awful slurp at  the bottom sounds off indicating my fix is ended. I have used Horlicks in the past and it's quite good, but I still consider Carnation as the real thing. I've had some "no-name" syrups and I believe another brand used to be available in the US, but they were useless.<br /><br />I do think there's something genetic about my love of malt (just as I despise okra or green peppers). With this apparent withdrawal of Carnations from the supermarket shelves, it's obvious that the malted thing needs to be revitalized. Young versions of "ME" who have this genetic preference are waiting for this ultimate "comfort food" be a popular item once again.
