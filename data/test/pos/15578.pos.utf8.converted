This is a great product, very convenient and very healthful as well! The only other way to have fresh flax seed is to grind it in a coffee grinder and then store it in the frig.<br />It cost a little more to do it this way, but it gives you good portion control and is much more convenient. By the way the price is much cheaper through Amazon and even less if you use subscribe and save! I love it on steel cut oats and on soy yogurt! I'm sure there are lots of other uses I have yet to discover.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LQRC3K">Carrington Farms Organic Ground Milled Flax Seed, 12-Count Easy Serve Packets (Pack of 3)</a>
