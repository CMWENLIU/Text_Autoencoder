Very impressed coffee junkie here. What coffee should be, but seldom is. Beautiful, dark oily beans with a grand aroma. Roasted perfectly. NO burned beans - (unlike the leading brand :O). The sealed can kept them very fresh. Brews a great cup with a buzz-producing caffeine content. Best coffee I have had in years. Will be buying again.
