Steel cut oats take much longer to cook but provide a nutritious breakfast meal particularly with added nuts and dried fruits.<br />As other reviewers mentioned, keep in mind that you will need more than 30 minutes to cook and then let it stand for some more time before eating. I usually buy a box containing 6 canisters. The price is reasonable comparable in weight to what one gets at a supermarket for rolled oats. Of course the same weight in rolled oats takes much more volume, therefore this 30-ounce canister looks small, but as you cook them they expand a lot more. A good product and I will keep on buying.
