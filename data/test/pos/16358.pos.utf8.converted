CBD Orange Pekoe was a pleasant surprise.  I've been a drinker of Lipton Yellow Label, which Amazon was out of stock on the size I normally bought, so I figured this would hold me over until the Yellow Label came in.  They are both pure Orange Pekoe teas, and I like them both. However, after drinking this tea, the Coffee Bean Direct is better.  They are different cuts or grade, the CBD is a whole leaf grade, while the Lipton Yellow Label is cut or broken but not ground or dust like tea bags.  They are both good teas, but the CBD clearly stands out as the winner.  Its nice to see quality teas like these available on Amazon.<br />For the record Orange Pekoe is a grade of tea leaf, its not orange flavor, or made with oranges or oranges, orange oils etc.  Its generally considered to be a higher than average quality tea leaf.  There are many different kinds of Orange Pekoe (OP), ranging from mid level teas, to the very best or most expensive teas.<br /><br />The bottom line for this product, if you like a good cup of hot tea, or glass of iced tea, it's hard to go wrong with this tea.  At $12.43 for 2 lbs its a great price for a very good tea, the only thing that could go wrong would be if Amazon or CBD increased their price.<br /><br />Their Earl Grey is also an Excellent product.  I frequently blend some with this OP for a milder Earl Grey, or richer OP.
