I have bad reflux and have been on PPI's for years.  It's to the point that I can't take even a sip of anything acidic, yet it was difficult for me to give up morning coffee.  I tried this totally on a whim, and didn't have high expectations for it, but now I'm totally hooked.  It is not TEA.  It makes a dark cup, identical to coffee.  It's delicious with a coffee creamer.  It's 18 calories per cup because there is carob in it (which also gives it some substance and a slight choco flavor).  It is truly non-acidic and non-caffeine (no problem lying down and sleeping after drinking).
