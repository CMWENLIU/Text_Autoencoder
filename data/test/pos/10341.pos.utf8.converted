Just wanted to add my vote for this as the best extreme dark chocolate I've tried. It really isn't for those who are expecting sweet dark chocolate. Like those who posted 1-star reviews of "Yuk!", I made the mistake the first time of snapping off a row and chomping down on a piece... what a shock to the tastebuds! But there was -something- there, so I didn't throw it out. I simply nibbled on the rest of it, and what a difference! It was suddenly just sweet enough, with an intense, very satisfying chocolate flavor. The "extreme" in the bar's name isn't there for exaggeration! So if you want something more like a nice glass of wine to be savored slowly rather than a glass of grape juice to be chugged, give this bar a try.
