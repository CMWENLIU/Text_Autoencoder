This is a very good rosewater with a fresh, true rose scent. The scent of Cortas is a little brighter than the brand I previously used, but it's still a beautiful fragrance, and a great value for the price. I bought mine from MinosImports (through Amazon), shipping was very quick and the glass bottles were securely packaged in bubble wrap.<br /><br />I use the rosewater to moisturize my hair...it calms my frizy hair and does a much better job of moisturizing than plain water. :)
