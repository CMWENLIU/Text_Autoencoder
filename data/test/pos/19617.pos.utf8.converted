Canned chipotles are smoked, pickled jalapeno chiles.  Different brands taste slightly different because each company uses its own pickling mixture.<br /><br />Herdez chipotles taste distinctly better than the more commonly found Embasa or La Costena brands.  The Herdez brand is worth seeking out- their salsas are good too.<br /><br />The easiest way to use canned chipotles is to puree the entire can and transfer the puree to a jar.  You can then add smaller quantities of the puree to your recipes- soups, dips, sauces, spice rubs for grilling, etc.<br /><br />Drizzle a thin layer of oil on top of remaining puree, and keep the jar in your refridgerator.  It should keep for a few weeks.
