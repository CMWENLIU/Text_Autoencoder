We used to purchase this companies Orange Cappacinno Coffee until they stopped making it.  We have now found that by mixing one can of the Orange coffee with one can of the traditional Cappaccino Coffee we get very close to the original product that we love.  Unfortunatley, our local stores do not carry this flavor - but Amazon.Com to the rescue.
