Trying to find non-GMO masa harina for homemade tortillas and chips is really hard.  Organic corn ships and taco shells are expensive and usually stale tasting.  Red Bobs tastes great and we have made some awesome tacos and chips since we bought Red Bobs masa harina and a cast iron tortilla press off of Amazon.  The price beats my local Krogers by a little bit and we are using it up as fast I I can re-order it.  If you haven't yet, read up on GMO foods.  Its scary and I don't want my kids eating foods that are basically a chemical experiment. With Red Bob's masa harina, you have a non-GMO product that is really getting us to experiement with Mexican good again.
