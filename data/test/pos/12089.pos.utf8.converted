I have sampled many Dijon mustards, and I must say that this is, in my opinion, the very best tasting Dijon mustard available.  While all mustards have a characteristic "heat" to them, many mustards rely solely on that heat to get them by.  This mustard has a robust flavor, reflecting a combination of flavorful mustard seeds with a flavorful wine base.  In essence, mustard, any mustard, is a combination of ground mustard seed and vinegar.  Other spices may be added, and different vinegars may be used, but this mustard from Fallot has what I consider to be the optimal combination of the two main ingredients with no other non-mustard flavors to detract from the primary flavor profile, namely Dijon mustard.  This mustard leans more towards the mild side of the heat spectrum, so those seeking a mustard burn on the palate will be disappointed.  I have also sampled some of the other fallot mustards with the various additives (i.e. basil, raspberry, honey, etc.) and they are all nice, too, if a bit limited in their usefulness (raspberry Dijon only works with so many dishes).  However, this mustard, the plain, original Fallot Dijon, can blend seamlessly into the background of so many dishes.  For those of you who seek a proof of these claims, just put this mustard to the simplest and most telling moutarde test there is: vinaigrette.  mix a spoonful of this Fallot Dijon with a few teaspoons of wine vinegar, some salt, pepper, and herbs (fresh thyme is always reliable), and about a 1/2 cup of olive oil and you will understand the sublime versatility of this excellent Dijon mustard!
