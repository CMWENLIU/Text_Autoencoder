My dog has to take seizure pills and after 2 months of shoving them down her throat and finding the pills around the house, I saw Pill Pockets at the vet. She likes them, the pills don't get spit out, and I don't get growled at, it's great! The pills are tiny, so I split one pill pocket up and can wrap four pills up. I put the extras in an empty pill bottle to keep them fresh. She doesn't mind the smaller size. They do leave your hands kind of greasy though.
