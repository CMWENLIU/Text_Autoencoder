I have remained unimpressed with all of the rice spaghettis on the market -- even Tinkyada. While other shapes of rice pasta cook up just fine, spaghetti is just harder to cook "just right" and the rice noodles tend to stick together and clump.<br />I have much better luck using corn pasta when I want spaghetti. Unfortunately, Mrs. Leeper's spaghetti is just too expensive (as is Tinkyada). I can buy rice pasta from Trader Joe's at a reasonable price, but I pretty much gave up on having spaghetti as a regular part of our family menu.<br />Then one day Amazon started carrying the Sam's Mills corn spaghetti! I had used the other shapes of Sam's Mills pastas before, and knew they were good. I was excited to try this because I liked the Mrs. Leeper's corn spaghetti, but couldn't justify the expense when I could make do with other shapes of pasta from Trader Joe's for half the price.<br />I couldn't be happier with the product. I only wish I'd ordered more because now Amazon is out of stock! But I got a large case and it should last me a while. Thanks, Amazon, for carrying this great gluten-free pasta. Our family is enjoying "spaghetti night" once again!
