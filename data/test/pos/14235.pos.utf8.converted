It is a huge breakthrough for a pet food manufacturer to develop a nutritionally balanced dry cat food formula that is high in protein and very low in carbohydrates.  The best part is that all five of my cats love it.  Thank you, Nature's Variety!<br /><br />After treating one of my cats for diabetes for several years, I learned the hard way about proper feline nutrition.  It turns out that the grain-based dry cat food I had been feeding my beloved pet was actually killing him.<br /><br />Cats are true obligate carnivores.  Their digestive systems were never designed to process grains or any other high carbohydrate food. A cat's pancreas can't keep up with the insulin demands placed on it by high carbohydrate dry food.  Once the pancreas is compromised, the cat develops diabetes and becomes insulin dependent.<br /><br />Due to their ease and convenience, dry kibble-type cat foods are very popular with pet owners, and cats can become addicted to it.  Feeding your cat a grain-based dry cat food is the equivalent of feeding your child sugary pastries and donuts for every meal!  It may taste good, but it sure isn't good for them.<br /><br />Although my cats still eat low-carbohydrate canned cat food for the majority of their meals, the Raw Instinct Grain Free Chicken Dry Cat Food is a perfect addition to their diet, and it's great for when I have to be away overnight.
