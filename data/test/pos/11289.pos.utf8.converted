This is DELICIOUS.  The first night I opened the jar, I found myself looking for something-anything- to spread this on.  There's nothing artificial in it, but it's not "healthy", and it's not a peanut butter substitute- it is sugary sweet and definitely a dessert spread.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it is awfully pricey online, and even if someone is reselling it, is it necessary to charge over 3x the price?  It's not like it's being imported from overseas' they're just picking it up at the local TJ's.
