I bought these from Think Geek instead of Amazon, and they're amazing.  However, I've seen several reviews with low ratings claiming that they never grew, so I thought I'd add my review with a few tips and tricks to growing these mind-blowing peppers.<br /><br />1) Ghost Chili's require hot temperatures to grow in.  More specifically, these pepper seeds will not germinate in soil that is under around 75 degrees Fahrenheit.  This means you need to grow them starting in late spring or even early summer if you don't want to use artificial means, to make sure its hot enough for them to sprout.  If you want to grow them earlier or in the winter, you may need to heat the soil yourself.  A simple heating pad wrapped around the pot set on low is typically sufficient.  Ideally they like 75-95 degree temperatures.<br /><br />2) You can affect how hot the peppers will be based on how you care for them.  The more stressed the plant is, the hotter the peppers will be.  Make sure you plant and feed your peppers while growing, but once they start producing fruit, cutting back on their water from time to time will make them hotter.  Also, if you cut back on the fertilizer (Nitrogen, specifically) while they are fruiting, you'll get hotter peppers as well.  Humidity also affects heat.  The higher the humidity, the hotter the pepper (good news for people in the South!).  And finally, the air temperature when the chili's ripen affect how hot they are as well, hotter it is outside, the hotter the peppers will be on the inside!  If you keep them unstressed and in a dry climate, the peppers will end up being sweeter.  They'll still be the hottest thing you ever put in your mouth though, so if you're not used to stressing plants without actually hurting them, its better to be kind to them than try to maximize their heat.  Its not like your tongue will know the difference between 850k and 1 mil scovilles anyway.<br /><br />3) Ghost Chili's like neutral to slightly acidic soil.  A PH of 5-6 is ideal, but your standard 6.5 potting soil will be just fine.  If you're not experienced with mixing your own soil, don't try it (you'll just kill the plants), use whats in the can and get regular mix from Walmart when you're ready to transplant.<br /><br />4) Don't grow these in the can.  Not that there's anything wrong with the can per say, it is rather small (picture looks like its coke can sized, its not, its maybe half that size).  You'll need to transfer the peppers to something bigger sooner than later, and they'll be rather young when they start to outgrow the can.  Moving them at that age is stressful, better to avoid it altogether by just starting with a larger pot to begin with.<br /><br />Ghost Chili's can be a little particular when sprouting, but they grow very well once started and they provide you with a once in a lifetime experience (because you'll never be dumb enough to bite into one a second time!).  For $10, you can't go wrong with these things.  And on the up side, after slipping a few of these into your cooking, you'll never be pressured to bring a side dish to a dinner ever again! ;)
