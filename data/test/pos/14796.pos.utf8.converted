I have never really thought much of substitute coffee.  Actually I am pretty picky even with real coffee, unless it's really good fresh roasted organic espresso.  But the Ayurvedic Roast is something else.  It has a rich round flavor that is significantly better than anything else i have tried.<br /><br />Thanks for creating such a great product
