Unlike most whole wheat flours that do not bake well, this one does and most recopies using all-purpose white flour will work. This is a really high quality product. It makes home-made bread even better, and healthier. it is very expensive though, but in the end it is comparable to factory-made-bread in cost with superior flavor and nutrition.
