I love Brach's regular Lemon Drops, but, needed to cut back on calories and sugar. I came by the Brach's Sugar-Free Lemon Drops at our local drug store advertised as "new" and gave them a try. They are just about as good as the regular, sugar lemon drops only with a cleaner, fresher, lemon flavor and a textured, rather than, sugar coating. Each drop is individually wrapped and easy to drop a few in my pocket to enjoy throughout the day. I also did not notice any problems with my stomach after eating about 4-5 of these. I really have to thank the Brach's folks for making these!
