I had used this product for quite a few years and then it disappeared from my grocers shelf. I've tried all the other honey mustards out there, but since I like a sweet honey mustard and all I could find was the spicer mustards.<br /><br />I couldn't believe my luck when Amazon started selling groceries and they had my favorite mustard. I bought 6 bottles at one time. It's great on baked ham, on crackers with a sharp cheese and I love it in my baked beans. If you like a sweet honey mustard then this is just the product for you.
