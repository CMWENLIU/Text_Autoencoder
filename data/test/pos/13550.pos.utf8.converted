I tried this olive oil out of curiosity and I really am happy with it. Olio Santo, "the oil of saints"<br /><br />It has a delicious flavor, great for cooking, salads, drizzled on bread,etc.<br /><br />I don't mind paying a little more for great taste and quality.<br /><br />I recommend you give it a try or one of the other olive oils from Stonehouse Olive oil, made right here in the U.S.
