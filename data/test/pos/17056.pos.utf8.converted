My wife and I have been using agave nectar in the place of sugar for over a year now and we absolutely love it.  We typically use it in our coffee and tea, and it truly have a great flavor and is very sweet, which is great as it doesn't take very much to sweeten things...<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who uses sugar and would like to try an alternative to table sugar.
