I was raised on this brand of fish sauce. To me, Tiparos is the greatest brand. You can't get any better than this. Add a couple squirts to raw eggs, then scramble them in a pan, and eat with fresh, hot, white rice. That's quick and delicious. We use fish sauce to cook all of our Thai meals and marinate beef and chicken for various dishes. For me, there is no other.
