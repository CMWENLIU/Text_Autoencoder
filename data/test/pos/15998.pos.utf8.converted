i'm virtually never enthusiastic enough about a product to seek out where to post a review about it, but i LOVE these! i really don't like gumdrops or gummy bears/worms/whatever, so i was a little skeptical. but having all-natural products, no artificial flavors, sweeteners, or other additives is really important to me--i'm not a hippie, just someone who feels better when i steer clear of those things and knows that some, for instance, trigger some health problems. so i bought a bottle of these and am WOWed. they are super tasty, smooth and not overly gummy, no fake aftertaste, just yummy citrusy not-too-sweet flavor. these are my new multivites of choice, and i'm now going to seek out other products by nordic naturals.
