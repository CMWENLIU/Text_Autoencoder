I tried 20 different dog foods for my Maltese that are prone to allergies.<br />With this food they get to eat less and maintain their optimum weight.<br />The Maltese stopped scratching and biting himself. I have read on many web sites that the Evo diet is the best in the world. My Maltese and my Golden Retriever maintained there ideal weight and their coats were beautiful.<br />The food is a bit more expensive than the junk food with all the fillers but my dogs are worth it. With a little research you can find it at great prices.<br />The main thing is if you have any dog with allergies this will cure it.<br />Good luck<br />Mike Griffin
