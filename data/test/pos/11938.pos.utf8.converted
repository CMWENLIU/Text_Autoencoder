I lived in Germany for 8 years and became addicted to Haribo Gummi Bears.  Haribo and only Haribo.  All the other brands have a different texture and consistency, not to mention taste.  I returned stateside and found that World Market sold them in 5 lb bags.  I was thrilled!  Unfortunately, once the bag is open, I can't seem to stop eating them.  I would hate for them to go stale.  So these individual bags allow me to eat an entire bag at a time without the guilt.  The packaging is perfect for helping you assert your self control.  That's not to say that I haven't sat down and ate 6 bags (or more) at a time, but I figure with all the opening of the little bags, I am burning off almost as many calories as I am ingesting.  Anyway, shipping was quick, packaging was great and the gummi bears inside are delicious as ever.
