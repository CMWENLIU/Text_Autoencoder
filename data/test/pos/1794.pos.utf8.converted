Currently I'm on my second jar of this fantastic rice, it completely seduced me with its nutty and totally buttery aroma - raw in the jar it smells just like that, but the taste is equally impressive.<br />My favorite way of making it starts with saut&eacute;ing two shallots or some onion with a bit of olive oil or butter, then to that I add whatever herbs I have around, usually rosemary or thyme, then I add the uncooked rice and dry saut&eacute; it until lightly toasted, at the end I throw in a handful of golden raisins and two cups of chicken broth, 20 minutes on a slow simmer and a tasty side is ready.<br /><br />I have burned my share of rice in the past or was forced to throw out the overly wet batches, but this one comes out perfect every time. Whether I make it plain or fancy it up, it always tastes delicious.<br /><br />This brand of rice is great at creating wonderful hybrids for all kinds of dishes, highly recommended.<br /><br />- Kasia S.
