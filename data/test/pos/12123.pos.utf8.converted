This is a great way to buy spices that you use often.  I say "use often" because these are nice big containers that last a year or more for most people.  I use a lot of dill weed in my cooking and for salads, so we go through it pretty quickly.  And the price here as opposed to buying in in those little bottles that are mostly glass is the supermarket for several dollars each, is a big savings, even with the shipping costs.  The product arrived just a few days after I ordered and it was fresh enough that I could smell it outside the plastic container.<br /><br />This is a good deal for a good product.  I plan to buy more of these in the future.
