I LOVE these noodles. They remind me of cellophane noodles without the carbs and calories. They definitely absorb the flavors of whatever you cook with them and they fill you up. The initial smell of the noodles after opening did not bother me. The smell reminds me of fish sauce but as soon as you rinse them the smell goes away. I am doing Atkins and this works well with my food plan....HOORAY. NoOodle will be a staple in my home.
