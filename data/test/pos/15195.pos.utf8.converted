a local gourmet shop sells these for $3.50 each and just can't keep them on the shelves so I have to visit that store every week in hopes I catch the day he gets fresh stock.  since these sell on the web for over $5 each, I was thrilled when Amazon had them for almost $2 each when you buy a 12-pack carton.  I have only tried a half a dozen nutty flavors thus far, with my favorite being the Pumpkin.  However I stocked up on the Almond because they are very dense in healthy high fiber toasty almonds, just a hint of sweet and coconut, and you need only a few of these 1-2cm almond cubes as a snack to tide you over between meals.
