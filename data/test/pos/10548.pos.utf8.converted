Easter? This item comes up when you search for Easter? Well of course it comes up when you search for Easter. I got one for Easter. That and a lamb. Anyway, back to Easter. This rabbit was excellent, and it came with the liver intact (the liver is the best part).<br /><br />My children enjoyed it as well, and even put on a little puppet show with it before I cut it up into pieces and threw it into the pot.<br /><br />Goes good with roasted taters.
