I was skeptical if tart cherry juice would work, but I've read about it many times in different articles, so I thought, give it a try...after 5 days I had noticed that the stiffness in my knees was definitely much less and GONE in 2 weeks! I'm 56 yrs. old and in excellent health and did not want to admit to myself that my athletic knees were getting stiff...I can squat down easily without any discomfort at all...I'm on my second bottle and will continue to buy more...it lasts longer than a month...I think it says 32 oz. last a month, but with 2 tblsp. a serving, it's lasted much longer...also, the price is right!
