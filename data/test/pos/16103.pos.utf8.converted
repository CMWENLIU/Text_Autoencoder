I can't really judge the quality of this paste versus others since it ends up in sauces, stews etc, but it seems ok . I bought it because it seemed to be the best value among the tube pastes and I was tired of opening a can for a tbs or 2, then watching the rest of the can go bad in the fridge. Glad I bought this and will buy again.
