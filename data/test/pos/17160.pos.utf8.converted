When Bob's Red Mill went up, I decided to give this one a try, and I'm glad I did. Bob's is good, but not so much for drinking straight. I haven't enjoyed a glass of ice cold milk in a while, it was great.<br /><br />Comes in one big bag inside of a big box, so I transferred some to another container.
