For most of my life I have had a hard time getting to sleep at night. It takes me hours some nights. I sit up and think about crap at work, people I went to school with as a child and all other kinds of random stuff. But I can honestly say this stuff does the trick. I've bought countless supplements over the years and none of it has really worked on helping me get to sleep but this stuff is the real deal. Overall I kind of feel more relaxed in general on it. Kind of at peace and stuff does not piss me off as much as usual. Give it a try. This stuff is legit. Start off slow on it at first. Your stomach needs a week or so to get use to it.
