As a child born in the 80s and growing up in the 90's this was always my favorite lunchbox snack. The flavors are delicious and the texture isn't like some gummies that get stuck in your teeth or gummies that are too soft. Everyone seems to favor the white "mystery" flavor sharks, but grape will always be my personal favorite. I continue to buy these now that I'm adult. I only wish they made "adult size" pouches, because now that I am older, the pouches seem like they've gotten smaller!
