If you used to eat Heartland in the 70's/80's like I did, you'll be happy to know this one tastes exactly the same!  Unlike almost all otther cereals, which have been heavily cheapened to the point that the name is the only recognizable feature, the current mfg. of Heartland has decided to keep the same level of quality it always had (THANKS!).  I can't get some of the other varieties mentioned on the back of the box; if the mfg. and Amazon would put together a variety pack (one box of each), I'd love to give them a try.  After being unavailable for well over a decade, it's now available at most grocery store chains. Amazon has the best price, and since it goes so fast, the 6-pack is no problem!  My son and I really love this stuff with fresh blueberries; AWESOME!
