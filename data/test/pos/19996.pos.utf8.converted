Seriously, this (& the other donut house coffees) are simply the best. The chocolate flavor is there but not overbearing and no weird chemical taste that some flavored coffees have. Way better than Timothy's "german chocolate cake". All of Timothy's coffees have a bit of a weird chemical aftertaste to me. Gloria Jean's "swiss chocolate" isn't bad but it doesn't compare to this coffee. If you like chocolate and like flavored coffee, you'll love this coffee!
