I buy this 2.5 oz size at a large local supermarket for 76-cents each -- that's the price for either the chicken & broth or turkey & broth. So I suspect there's an error in charging c. $30 for only a dozen jars!<br /><br />The product, however, is excellent -- far superior to Gerbers, which includes cornstarch along with chicken and water (and costs more too -- between $.97-.99/jar). Why would anyone put cornstarch in baby food? Makes no sense. Both firms provide the same amount of protein but Beechnut uses only chicken and broth (from water), no fattening cornstarch.<br /><br />I use the food for my cat, btw, not a baby. Twice a day, I mix a T.  with Green Magma and Solid Gold Seameal. It's a super-healthy combo for an older cat. He seems to prefer the Beechnut as he cleans up the plate better. There's also less waste from the jar because every bit comes out cleanly (with Gerbers, the cornstarch makes it "gooey" and there's always some left behind).
