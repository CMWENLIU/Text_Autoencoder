As a New Yorker, I know what Italian sausages are supposed to taste like.  In the last few years, I haven't been able to find good breakfast or sweet dinner sausages in the supermarket.  I don't have access to a regular butcher shop so I started looking online.<br /><br />I bought some from several places & the only ones that caught my attention were Espositos.  They have 2 sizes of breakfast sausages, the little links & some fat ones, the kind they sell at Ihop.  Both are far superior than any others.  Their cheese sausages are wonderful.  I mix them w/ ground beef for meatballs.  It's a great time-saver since all the spices & cheese are already in there.  Very flavorful meatballs indeed.<br /><br />The customer service at Espositos is wonderful.  One time, I ordered the wrong style & emailed them.  Someone answered instantly & corrected my order.  Another time, I wrote for best cooking instructions which were supplied right away.<br /><br />There's always a little something extra in my order.  They sent a cute, little reusable insulated bag which held 4 pkgs sausages in the last one.  This will come in handy in the summer.  Another time, they sent a pkg of hot sausages for me to try since I didn't order that style.<br /><br />Esposito sausages are the best on the Web.  It is well worth the shipping price to stock my freezer every few months.  I highly recommend.
