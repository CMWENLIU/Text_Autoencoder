I never thought I'd get this excited over a candy bar, but when I found out that Snickers Almond Bars are very similar to the old Mars Bar (which is no longer available)... well, I bought a 24 pack. After just a month, I ordered another box! This is a great product and much cheaper than buying at the grocery store check-out line.<br /><br />March Update: Good news! While it's true that the Mars Bar *was* discontinued, it was relaunched in January 2010 and is initially being sold on an exclusive basis through Walmart. I just bought one today for the first time in nearly 10 years! Even so, I am now quite used to Snicker's Almond and I like them both!
