I LOVE Hint waters.  There are some flavors that are definately better than the others but Watermelon is one of my favorites.  It has no artificial sweetners or chemicals.  It doesn't have any nasty aftertaste and is so refreshing!  I find it hard to drink plain water and with Hint, it gives it just that, a Hint of sweetness and makes it super easy to drink alot of water!  How I wish some grocery stores or Club Warehouse stores would carry it!!!!!!!
