The product was good.  I was surprised that such a tiny amount could actually flavor and sweeten 16 ounces.  Not too sweet and not bitter, just a great, refreshing drink.  It does take a while to dissolve, but trust me, I have had other stevia and stevia drinks from elsewhere that dissolve instantly and taste horrible.  You will not be disappointed with this product.
