I'm not certain a taste for Marmite can be acquired.  You may have to grow up with it.  Not only is it good (spread thinly) on bread and toast, but it is a wonderful savory flavoring for soups and stews.  It can also be dissolved in hot water for an enjoyable drink.  Once appreciated, it is difficult to live without, and, fortunately, I can find the small jars quite easily and only wish people would stock the larger ones.
