I bought this first in an Amazon promotion - I'm a total cheapy, not as involved with tea as some of my friends.  I roast my own coffee, and only think of tea as sort of a break from espresso.....<br />That said:  this is lovely black tea.  the flavor is exquisite, cleaner and less muddy than other brands I've tried.  The silk tea bags are so luxurious,but the tea inside tastes much better than the gift store silk triangle teas.<br />It's so good, I think I'll have to pay full price and check out some of the other estate teas!
