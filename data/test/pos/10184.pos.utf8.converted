Bay's are so good, it's not fair to compare them to any other brand.  They are in a class by themselves.  Buying them here by the case is a smart choice if you have the freezer room.  They will stay fresh for well over 6 months - not that they will be around that long because you will have eaten them all before then.  Plus, even with the shipping cost they are a good deal.  No other brand is allowed in my house.
