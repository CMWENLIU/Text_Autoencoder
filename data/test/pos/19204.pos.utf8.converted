Only 3 were past or very close to their Best Used Before Date. I plan on buying this deal again.<br /><br />The Kcups were packaged in a brown paper bag with the top rolled down and stapled and then that bag was placed inside a plastic bag which was so helpfully labeled that the plastic bag is not a toy. ;) My box was rained on before I could retrieve it from my doorstep, so I do appreciate the protection of the plastic and don't resent the waste.<br /><br />I haven't sampled any yet, so I can't comment on the flavors yet, but wanted to get this review out the same day I received my package so that customers can see what they will most likely receive. No old, holiday clearance bin Kcups in this assortment!  :)
