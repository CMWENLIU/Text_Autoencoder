I absolutely love Zico coconut water. This stuff is amazing and totally hydrates you. I have it every morning in a smoothie. Great way to flavor a smoothie without adding too much sugar or having to add milk. Best recipe: 1/4 cup vanilla greek yogurt, 1 banana, 1/2 cup frozen mango chunks and 1/2 cup of Zico coconut water, 7 ice cubes.
