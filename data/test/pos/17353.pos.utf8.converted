I am always looking for new brands of decaf tea, to me they all taste hot water with a little color added to it!!  Recently I found Barry's Decaf and gave it a try.  Barry's decaf has an incredible taste for a decaf tea!  It is full body, very flavorful, and brews a good strong cup of tea.  It is hard to believe it is really decaf. A bit pricey but well worth the cost for anyone who enjoys a good cup of tea.
