In my opinion Twinings Irish breakfast tea is absolutely the best brewed tea around. It has a very robust flavor that is certain to wake you up. If you aren't a coffee drinker , this will become your "coffee" of choice. Excellent tea!! The price is also much less expensive than my local grocery store. If your looking for tea with a strong kick and excellent flavor, you gotta try this. Delicious!
