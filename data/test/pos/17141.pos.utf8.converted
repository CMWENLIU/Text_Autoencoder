I can't say enough good things about this product. I shop at whole foods and when they run out which is quite often I always get upset. I am not saying this is a weight loss product but I always drink my sencha when I want to take off a few pounds. It never fails I always feel great and look great when I incorporate this product in my daily life. The other green teas on the market have all kinds of junk in them and this is just refreshing green tea.
