I bought this as I had read it may help the body get rid of H. Pylori.Since I have not been tested again I can't vouch for that but I did experience its healing power recently when my husband fell and received a bad gash on his forehead.  I smeared the wound with Manuka honey for 2 or 3 days and it healed quickly and completely without a scar.
