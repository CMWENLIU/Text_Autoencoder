I am addicted to steel cut oats!  Bob's Red Mill Organic Oats are very tasty and quite the deal here on Amazon, price-wise.  I just made them this morning for breakfast.  With the cooler temps our Upper Midwest September brings, they are a perfect beginning to the day!<br /><br />My method is to cook them over night on low in my little crock pot.  You wake up in the morning to a yummy, hearty breakfast that carries you through until lunch time.  Recommend!!
