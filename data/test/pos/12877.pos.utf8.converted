I got this for my wife the other day. There is a large variety of "tastes" available and the on-line price is very reasonable as compared to purchasing it at "Whole Foods" or some other natural food store. The sardines are not "fishy" tasting and they are fresh. Other pluses to this product is the fact that they are sustainably caught. My wife particularly likes that they offer the Olive oil and Lemon option. I would recommend this product anytime.
