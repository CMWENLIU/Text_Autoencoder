I got a few packages of these... used some for my daughter (for the Omega-3 fatty acids, as they help with brain function... she is speech impaired) and for my grandpa (who has high blood pressure & had a stroke.)<br /><br />You simply add a few spoonfuls to your oatmeal... my grandpa's cholesterol went down 50 points in one month. (None of his medication had been able to do that.)<br /><br />My 5 y.o. daughter didn't notice this in her oatmeal... I tried it, and there is no added taste, just health benefits :)<br /><br />Great product. We always have it at our house.
