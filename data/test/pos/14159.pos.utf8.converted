No longer anywhere to be found in the grocery stores, these little Chiclets are just perfect in taste and size. Every year my sister requests them as her birthday gift. She and I agree, they're the greatest. Whenever I visit my grandchildren they want to know if I have Chiclets, and of course I do. They never see them anywhere except when Grammy comes to visit. A special treat.
