When I saw Ribena on Amazon I knew that the internet now has everything.<br /><br />Ribena is a concentrate, you must mix it with water before drinking it. I guess this saves on shipping and space since instead of buying 600ml, you're buying 5400ml (since they ask you to mix it with 8 parts water.) This type of packaging seems to have fallen out of favor since it isn't that popular anymore.<br /><br />What it is: It's a blackcurrant drink. Blackcurrant seems to be a berry particular to the British since no other nation sells this type of drink that I know of. On researching it, I found that it became popular in Britain during WW2 because there were few other sources of vitamin C available to British children during the war and this berry was suitable for growing in the UK climate.<br /><br />It's hard to describe the taste of blackcurrant to anyone who hasn't tasted it, only that it's a little like grape juice but without any tartness or aftertaste and quite sweet. I can't really compare it with anything else since it just simply taste better than any time of grape or berry juice that I've ever had. I can only say that it's great tasting and you must try it. On top of this flavorful goodness, blackcurrants are also rich in vitamins and anti-oxidants; it's almost like hamburgers which are good for you, or cigarettes which prolong your life, something too good to be true! You can drink it cooled in the fridge or hot with hot water and it tastes good both ways!<br /><br />When I was a kid I used to drink shots of it in a shot glass mixed with only 2-3 parts of water, ahh the memories... and the abuse my pancreas must have taken... As I see from other reviews, most Americans who love this love it for nostalgia's sake having had it as a child overseas. Well, it really is as good as nostalgia and I'm glad I can find it through Amazon today.
