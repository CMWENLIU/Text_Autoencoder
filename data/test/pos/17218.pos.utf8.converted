These coarse crystals have the minerals intact, which is vital to the salt benefit and function.<br /><br />I don't know when or why purveyors of salt began removing the natural mineral content, but that action involved a frightening ignorance.<br /><br />For certain types of specific health issues (see below), the minerals in the sea salt crystals seem to work better for me in their crystalline (or coarse) form, than when I grind the salt, as I do for cooking or table usage salt.<br /><br />As others have noted, mineral-rich, coarse-sea-salt freshly grinded onto food is much crisper in its culinary effect, more satisfying to the taste buds, than pre-granulated, plain table salt (which has the minerals removed, minerals found naturally in sea salt and which enhance both health benefits and flavor bursts).<br /><br />Also, old style, granulated table salt has an added disadvantage from the fairly recent addition of a variety of anti-caking chemicals, some of which contain aluminum (silicoaluminate)... which I'm concerned may be a brain cell deteriorative, possibly at baseline cause for Alzheimer's.<br /><br />If I take a pinch of salt crystals (coarse sea salt contains crystals) 2 or sometimes 4 times per day, and place them in my mouth, moving them around to dissolve the salt in saliva on my teeth and gums, I find that both teeth and gums retain a much higher degree of health.  I had begun having minor tooth aches periodically, and this practice has alleviated that.<br /><br />As noted above, I'm 60-years-old; and with a debilitating liver ailment since I was 9, I find that when I have an attack of severe abdominal and back muscle cramps (which I get fairly frequently), a pinch of sea salt crystals in my mouth will stop those cramps.  In fact, when I take small amounts of sea salt crystals regularly enough, I don't get those cramps at all.  The cause and effect is immediate and direct, so I know this works for me.  From my experience, plain table salt, or even sea salt without the mineral content will not give this beneficial effect.  (I'm guessing it's the magnesium content which works here, though, it might be the wholeness of the natural balance of the particular mineral group within unadulterated salt).<br /><br />Of course, I also drink one, preferably two glasses of water along with the salt crystals, ingesting the water before, after, or both.<br /><br />I learned about the many benefits of sea salt crystals (with the natural mineral content not having been leached away in well meaning ignorance) from Dr. Batmanghelidj's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0970245823">Obesity Cancer & Depression: Their Common Cause & Natural Cure</a>.  I recommend that book very highly and hope to be able to review it also.<br /><br />Dr Batman's books explain how, when, why, and how much water the body needs for optimum health, and sea salt crystals are a vital part of that program.<br /><br />Note that in this book he explains also how, when, and why a person can take too much salt and water. I suppose I'm "lucky" that I have a barometer for sea salt crystal needs.  When I'm not taking enough the cramps return.  During hot weather (or under other dehydrating conditions) when the body loses more salt and water, I have to increase the intake of both.<br /><br />As far as I recall, Dr. Batman hadn't mentioned the connection of sea salt to alleviate regular large muscle cramping.  That I discovered this on my own after I had been taking the sea salt regularly, due to reading Dr. Batman's book.<br /><br />Bless this man for standing up to so many medical fallacies which are literally creating diseases, then causing addiction to high cost medications which do NOT cure the ailment, but add several other ailments into a complex medical condition which piles prescriptions on top of prescriptions.<br /><br />My thanks to Amazon for providing a variety of excellent sea salt products in coarse, crystalline form.<br /><br />With Respect for the maverick M.D.'s who actually apply and teach true healing,<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several books on KINDLE and Amazon Shorts
