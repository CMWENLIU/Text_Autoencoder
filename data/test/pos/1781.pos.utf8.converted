I was very suprised when I received my pack of 6, 25-ounce cans of hash. I mis-read the order and thought the cans were smaller. My husband did not know about the order, so when he opened the package he said,"WoW these can are big". He thought it was a great buy because we could not buy a 25 ounce can at our regular shopping store for under 2.00 dollars. I hope I remembered to have this product sent every 3mos.<br />A lot of people complain about Amazon, however I have only praise for them. I buy a lot online and I research before buying. I can always count on Amazon for a deal and comparative pricing. Whenever there has been a problem Amazon keeps their word and deals with it in a timely fashion. Keep up the good work Amazon. I LOVE SHOPPING WITH YOU'.<br />Thank You, Lynda Kalesnick and husband David Dowling.
