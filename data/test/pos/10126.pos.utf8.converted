This tea works!.  While it seems expensive it is cheaper than medication and it has no unpleasant side effects.  I keep a supply in the refrigerator and drink a cup a day.  It is not perfect - it does not eliminate the problem totally - but it does reduce "accidents" by about 90% which is a dramatic improvement in quality of life. It is a little bit of a pain to make because you have to boil it, let is steep then strain and store it, but it is well worth the trouble.
