I've been driving 30 minutes and paying full retail to buy this mild, satisfying, low sodium soup.  Since it's not full of salt, the flavor is much more mild than regular miso so everyone might not appreciate the taste. It's perfect for my health concerns and I like the flavor.<br /><br />It's a great sprinkle on seasoning and nice warm snack for the afternoon.  Thank you very much for carrying it.
