When I received my starter I followed the instructions and placed the sourdough in a canning jar. As a precaution, I opened the plastic envelope with a wooden spoon and added some flour/water "feed" and left that as a second chance to successfully start a sourdough.  Both were active and alive, but the smaller plastic envelope I kneeded and mixed after feeding was off to a bubbling start that could not be mistaken.  I now have two containers of very active sourdough and have baked bread, and sourdough pancakes.<br />I formally had a sourdough from a start a local bakery had given me.  This sourdough is an excellent active yeast, but also departs a great flavor to bread dough if retarted overnight in the refer before baking the second day.
