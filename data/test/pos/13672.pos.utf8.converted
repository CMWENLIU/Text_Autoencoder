Don't know why Hansen's isn't promoting this drink more. It's hard to find. There was only one store that had it in my area and they stopped carrying it. So I had to buy 3 cases from Amazon.<br /><br />It tastes like Mountain Dew, has the right ingredients. Yeah, there's sugar but no high fructose corn syrup. Gives a nice lift in the morning without a crash later. I drink it instead of coffee.
