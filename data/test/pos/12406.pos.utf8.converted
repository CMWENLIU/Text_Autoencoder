Espresso, chocolate, and, PROTEIN, 15 grams in one serving.  It can be made hot or cold, I tried it both ways about eight times now, and I love it.  (You know I don't just throw that out there, I am a tough cookie.)<br /><br />For the sake of a simple review, I tasted it AS THE PACKAGE DIRECTED and it was just perfect.<br /><br />I prepared it cold, and look, I sucked this down, and then I cleaned the bathroom in a single bound, I did!<br /><br />As a hot drink, it's also delightful - you literally just mix it as you would any hot powdered drink like a cocoa.  I highly suggest a whisk, and do it well, and you get the best results.  This mix really has a smooth mocha flavor.<br /><br />I've been drinking it hot in my morning cappuccino - I whisk one or two scoop into some hot water to mix, then a shot of espresso and then top it off with steamed unsweetened soy milk, and it makes an AMAZING morning cup.<br /><br />I've already thrown it into protein shake concoctions in the blender, and it's OMG!? DELICIOUS with blended ice and additional flavors.  (THINK ABOUT THE OPTIONS HERE PEOPLE!)<br /><br />The nutrition:<br /><br />  * 2 scoops contain:<br />  * 120 calories<br />  * 1.5 grams of fat<br />  * 115 mg sodium<br />  * 290 mg potassium<br />  * 12 carbohydrate<br />  * 1 fiber<br />  * 7 sugar (fructose)<br />  * 15 protein<br /><br />Overall, I am very impressed with Click Protein.  There is NO telltale protein-y taste, you that icky tongue-feel and after taste you might get with other protein products?  I don't know how it's possible, but it's true - you cannot tell that this is a protein drink by any stretch.<br /><br />Add that to the fact that it contains my two main food groups, espresso and chocolate?  It's a clear winner, and my new thing.<br /><br />[...]
