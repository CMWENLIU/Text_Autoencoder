Prior to finding Melissa's Corn Husks, I was limited to making tamales in the summertime when our sweet corn crop was harvested.  These dried husks cut down dramatically on prep time and labor!  The husks were larger than I expected, making the assembly of the tamales go quickly.  Soaking and cleaning them was easily accomplished as the directions indicated.  I also liked the authentic recipies included on the inner packaging.  Previously, I had surfed the net and tried several recipies for tamales before finding one that most reminded me of the homemade treats my friend's grandma used to make, and one of the recipes Melissa's suggested was almost a dead match for my favorite.  Plan on 2-3 hours to prep and cook a big batch, but the good news is that tamales freeze well and can be ready for a future dinner or side dish with a quick reheat in some foil.
