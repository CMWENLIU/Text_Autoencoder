Growing up in a British Colony, I have been an avid tea drinker and I love my tea English Style. None of the dip a tea bag in hot water nonsense for me. I like my tea with two sugars and a dab of milk. This is probably one of the best black teas I've ever had. It's a delight on the palate, has a fantastic after taste and releases just the right amount of endorphins. The twinnings Ceylon tea was what I used to drink/order from amazon, and then one day when I was out of twinings, my eyes fell on this in a Whole foods. They're both pretty good, but I think this one is a touch better. I highly recommend that you try this...but do it the the right way...with two sugars and a dab of milk.
