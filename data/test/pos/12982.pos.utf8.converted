I personally love Xylitol - I have no digestive ill effects from it at all, though I do from many other sugar alcohols. I think a lot of that depends on your own personal body chemistry, so if you need a sugar replacement you should try a lot of small amounts of the different sugar alcohols. For me, maltitol and sorbitol are awful, but xylitol is just fine. Of all the sugar replacements I have tried, I think xylitol tastes the most like sugar. It has a nice, grainy texture like sugar does, which makes it appealing for applications like sprinkling it on fruit, and it isn't overly-sweet the way I find most sugar replacements are. If anything, I would say measure for measure it is slightly less sweet than sugar, which I actually like as I'm trying to reduce my sweet tooth in general.<br /><br />HOWEVER, EVERYONE WHO OWNS A DOG NEEDS TO BE AWARE THAT XYLITOL IS DEADLY TO DOGS. I am not some weirdo posting rumors - please google xylitol dogs and the very first entry is from Snopes.com stating that this is true. As little as 3 grams can kill a 65 pound dog.<br /><br />I still use XyloSweet all the time; I am just very, very careful when I use it when my dog is around because he's a floor-licking sort of guy. And while I never give him people-food, I know others often do and you obviously can't do that with anything you've made with Xylitol.<br /><br />Please, please upvote this review if you can - I'm concerned that no warning appears on the bag or in the company's copy and that none of the highly-voted reviews discuss this issue. It is very easy to prevent what could be a deadly accident for your dog!
