All of the Corazonas Oatmeal Squares are good, but this one is my favorite. It's not overly sweet like most regular brownies, and the oatmeal and nuts provide just the right texture. If you microwave it for 10-15 seconds (after you take it out of the wrapper) it's much improved, like it just came out of the oven.
