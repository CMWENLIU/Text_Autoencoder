This really is a very good Parmigiano Regiano and the great thing about this large block is that it can be eaten the way it is supposed to be.  Broadly shave or cut it into irregular pieces and just nibble on it with a fine red wine.  That wonderful "gritty" quality is amazing.<br />By all means use it for all your grating needs as well, but first and foremost it is to be savored in small chunks with a fine red Super Tuscan!
