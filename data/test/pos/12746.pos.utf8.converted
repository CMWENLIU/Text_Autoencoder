Grape Nuts is the only cereal i have found (and believe me, i've searched) that contains NO sugar and yet tastes delicious. Oatmeal's pretty close but it takes preparation and needs at least a little butter and some added honey or maple syrup to be that good. But not Grape Nuts. I love them with just milk. They are beyond delicious and i love them i love them i love them. Sometimes, i even eat them for lunch, too. They satisfy my appetite and make me feel great. Look up their history on Wikipedia, it's interesting. YAY!!! for Grape Nuts. I hope they never become unavailable.
