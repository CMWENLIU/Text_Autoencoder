I was skeptical about buying this product as I've had clotted cream before that was truly hideous, but this clotted cream was exceptional!  I served it with scones and strawberry jam for our 'Royal Wedding' breakfast and the only complaint I have is that I didn't buy more than one jar.  I'm from Britain and have found very difficult to find a good cream tea here in the US, but those days are behind me.  Now I just need to get my hands on some of this stuff and I'm good to go!
