I ordered the Heartland Blueberry Waffle Mix, the Heartland Malted Vanilla and the Carbon's Malted Original. This is by far better than the Carbon's in my opinion. The batter tastes like cake batter. I was expecting the waffle to be sweet like cake, but it was just a really good waffle. My 15 year old and I liked the Blueberry mix the best. My 11 year old and 17 year old liked the Vanilla better. I know others have mentioned liking the Vanilla better so you are just going to have to try them both.<br /><br />The mix could not have been simpler. 3 parts mix to 2 parts cold water. Mix. Let sit for 15 minutes. One thing that I've seen mentioned here and it bears repeating. After it sits for 15 minutes, you are going to have to add a bit of water to the mix as it sets up too stiff. Just a tablespoon or so should get it to waffle consistency. Another thing mentioned is that your go to ladle is probably going to put too much on the waffle iron. My first waffle spilled out of the iron. (That is when I tasted the batter.) The next waffle, I was careful to put a few tablespoons less on the iron and I got a perfect waffle.<br /><br />3 cups of mix yielded two Belgian waffles.<br /><br />I am using the Waring Waffle Maker Pro. Setting 3 1/2. Cook until only the faintest wisp of steam is coming from the iron. You don't want to leave too much moisture in the waffle in case you want to freeze them. Moisture creates water crystals that damage the waffle.
