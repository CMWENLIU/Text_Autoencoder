I adopted a kitten last year, and from at the start, he had a sensitive stomach.  I feed all my cats high quality food, and tried a couple different kids, but nothing seemed to work.  Everything ended up in the litter box in a extremely less than solid form and smelled like toxic waste.  I finally tried Natural Balance Green Pea and Chicken, and got amazing results.  I tried the Green Pea and Duck kind, and things regressed, but as I switched back to the Green Pea and Chicken we were good again.  I'm never going to feed him anything else!
