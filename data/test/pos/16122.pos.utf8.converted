This fence was purchased about 3 years ago to protect my Koi pond from possums, and herons. It has been in continuous opperation since then with no loss of fish since it was installed.  Today I had to replace the woven perimiter cord because of continuity breaks due to rust at the cotter pin holders.<br />April 2010,  An update, I changed the cotter pin attachments to nylon zip connectors and resolved the rusting problem.<br /><br />Very succesful and a great product.<br /><br /> April 2010. An update on this product.  2 more years have gone by and the unit still works as new.  The  perimiter cord does need to be changed every year or two to keep the unit working at peak performance.  I bought a bulk roll of electric fence cord and keep it on hand.
