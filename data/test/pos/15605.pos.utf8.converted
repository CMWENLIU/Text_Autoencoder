I love this product. Cooking a single serving of rice is too much of pain, but with this product, problem solved. A serving of brown rice whenever I want it.<br /><br />Also, since it does not require refrigeration and has a fairly long shelf life its great for taking to the office. I cook it, combine it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007R9L4M">Tasty Bite Entree, Madras Lentils, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> in a large bowl, nuke for 2 more minutes and I've got a tasty filling low fat high fiber meal for at the office.<br /><br />From a Weight watchers standpoint, the rice and the lentals add up to 10 points total, but its filling enough that I often split it in 1/2 for 2 meals.<br /><br />ALSO, I live across the street from a whole foods, and buying it from Amazon with super saving shipping is a money saving option.
