When the Chef behind Julia Child, Simone Beck came to America, she went nuts for Macadamias, sorry.  The important thing is that besides loving the texture, which is unique among nuts, she boosts the flavor with a little toasting.  It works.  Furthermore, it is what makes this pancake mix special.<br /><br />I do not use other mixes.  I am happy to do pancakes by hand from scratch.  But it is nice to have on hand.  And I do not always have Macadamia on hand.  Best of all, it travels with me for no fuss away from my familiar kitchen.  The results are superior.  And another thing Simone Beck taught me, these nuts go with maple syrup especially well.  Not cheap, but this is a three pack.
