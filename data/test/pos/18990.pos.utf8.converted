I don't want to ever be without this coconut oil. I have been using it for quite some time now, and am 69 yrs of age.  I went to see my doctor for my six mths check up,  and she was amazed at my colostrol levels.  She said they were perfect, and wondered what my secret was.  I didn't tell her my secret,  but I do stay away from fatty foods,  and use this cooking oil for frying,  and also baking,  and it gives my food a wonderful flavor.  Tasting this oil alone,  has a delicious coconut taste,  but that same taste doesn't show up in the foods that I use it in, and I don't think one can beat this price anywhere.  I was paying twice as much as this from another company,  plus shipping and handling, but this is a super deal,  no postage,  and half the price.  I just hope Natures Way will never stop having this coconut oil available, I also like the fact that it is organic.  I will continue ordering this oil as long as it is available.
