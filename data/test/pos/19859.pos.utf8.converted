As Celiac survivor's mom I've also tried a lot of mixes. This is the best: makes a nice loaf, easy to slice and store in the freezer, microwave or toast slices before use, does not stink yeast, makes very good sandwiches (sweet or not). Add cinnamon and raisins - perfect for some sweet-tooth. School/trip/munch-on-the-go/bed-time snack... you name it!<br />Do not expect the mix be a complete resemblance of the famous French bread, though. Set your expectations to the limited possibilities of copying and enjoy the good versatile loaf :-))
