This tea has become the staple in our house. The flavor is bold enough, but never bitter. It stands up well to double brewing. In fact, my husband drinks mostly the 1st brew, and I drink the 2nd brew, with less caffeine, but it tastes great. We have tried double brewing at least 5 other varieties of tea, but they don't hold up- they come out flavorless and watery.<br /><br />The other nice thing about this Yunnan variety tea, is that it tastes great black (husband's preference) or with milk and honey (my preference).<br /><br />I highly recommend this tea. It is our all around favorite for everyday (we don't regularly drink coffee).
