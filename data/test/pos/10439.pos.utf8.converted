great for the afternoon when i don't like to drink real coffee. amazon has the best deal on pero! our local grocery store charges almost $12 for one container....i make a "gourmet pero", one heaped tea spoon pero in a large mug, boiling water....add foamed whole milk (shake milk in jar that" all it takes) sprinkle some sugar and cinnamon on top, stir....voila.....better than starbucks!
