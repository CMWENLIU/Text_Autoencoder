I got the 1 ounce bags which are quite large actually and have around 130 calories.  Texture and consistency is a cross between rice cake, popcorn, and styrofoam packing peanuts, but good flavor and an all around nice snack and good alternative to chips or other high fat / high calorie type snacks.  You get a lot of snack for the calories and I would buy again.
