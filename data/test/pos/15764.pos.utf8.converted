This product has much more health value than the regular old-fashioned rolled oats with a much better taste.  The only drawback is the time it takes to cook on the stove.  I have tried to microwave it but it still is crunchy or overflows even in large containers.  This is definitely work the time though to cook on the stove.  High in fiber!
