My kids and the kids at the party raved about the Lego candies! They absolutely LOVED them! Not only do they look like the real thing, but you can actually snap them together and they taste great! They taste just like sweet tarts. I only ordered 1 lb bag of them, because it was my first time ordering them. I would suggest going for the 3 lb bag, because they went over so well. :) I definitely give these 5 stars!!
