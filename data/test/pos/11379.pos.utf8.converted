The only thing I use Gum Arabic for is for making Gomme Syrup. For this purpose, this item works great.<br /><br />Gomme syrup is a sugar syrup thickened by adding gum arabic. It was often called for in cocktail recipes from the 1860's forward. Gomme syrup makes amazing Old Fashioneds and Sazeracs, with the gum arabic contributing an extra-luscious mouth feel.<br /><br />Gomme syrup is pretty easy to make following the instructions that can be found at [...]<br /><br />Actually its easier to make than the article makes it sound. The short version:<br />1. combine 2 oz gum arabic powder with 2 oz water, whisk or stir to combine. it won't completely integrate as the starch needs to hyrdate. While you could leave it alone for a day, I only waited about 20-30 minutes. it wasn't completed lump-free, but that didn't cause any problems.<br />2. combine 8 oz raw sugar, such as demerrara or turbanado, and 4 oz of water in sauce pan. bring to a boil to dissolve the sugar.<br />3. once the sugar is fully dissolved, add the gum arabic slurry.<br />4. return to a boil, and strain off any scuzz (protein) with a spoon.<br />5. strain (I didn't bother), and bottle.<br /><br />2:1 simple syrups are common in many craft cocktails, and adding the gum arabic just contributes to a sublime mouthfeel. It's easy to make and keeps in the fridge indefinitely.<br /><br />I would certainly buy this particular item again. I don't need to make more than 1 or 2 batches at a time, and this is plenty of gum arabic for that purpose.
