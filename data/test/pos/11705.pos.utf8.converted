I bought this product and the USPS smashed the lid during shipping. The seller was very quick to send out a replacement pronto. I received it in no time flat. Shipper knows and gives EXCELLENT customer service and I would highly recommend anything sold by him! This is a quality product and the aroma of melting chocolate is ALWAYS a winner in my book. Since it is BUTTER its going to be greasy. It was pretty tasty frying up french toast in it!
