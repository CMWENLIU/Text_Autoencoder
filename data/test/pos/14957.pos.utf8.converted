I have been through it all...Athletic 34 year old 6'3 180...competitive cyclist/triathloner....Could not understand why all the sudden I have acid indegestion and major heartburn after drinking even water.  Tried to just live with it for 2 months.  Woke up every morning with this weird acidic feeling in my stomach. Ended up in the hospital, thought I was having a heart attack one night.  Went to GI doctor, did endoscopy found nothing.  Said probably irritable bowl syndrome. I basically got to the point of a month of eating toast, bananas, white rice, nothing but water.  I am serious, I did nothing but bland stuff and it didn't matter.  So, I tried Prilosec for 28 days straight, and ate about 50% of what I used to eat (tacos, spicy food, milkshake here and there, and felt a little better, probably because I was enjoying my food again... but still felt constipated.  Stopped Prilosec (after 28 days) completely and did a Zantac 150 if I couldn't take the bloating/hurt feeling.  Looked online for help, someone said try Zypan digestive enzymes and another said Manuka Honey.  I bought them both from Amazon and decided to try the honey first to see how it did.  Well, I have been taking a Table spoon on a half piece of white bread before breakfast and an hour before bed for about 5 days now and I feel 90% better.  I am having more frequent movements also, so I assume that the honey is healing intestines as well as stomach lining.  This past weekend, my wife and I shared a cheesesteak stromboli with marinara sauce, etc. for dinner.  Before bed, I did the tablespoon of honey and was fine all night and the next morning.  If you are suffering, give it a shot, I'm super glad I did.  I hope to get to the point, where I just do it once in the morning.  No clue how it works, or if I'm just healing slowly on my own?  But, I really don't care as I feel better.  Good luck, I have not even bothered to try the digestive enzymes, because this honey is doing something for me!
