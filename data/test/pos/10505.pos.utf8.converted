I was very pleasantly surprised! Not too oily, with plenty of bergamot flavor, I drink this tea every morning. If you drink other earl grey's, you know that some will leave an oily residue around the rim. Not so with this tea. Its not bitter either like some. Over all I was quite pleased. It does come packaged loose in a cardboard box, so if you have a place for such things that's good,
