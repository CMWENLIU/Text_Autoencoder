I wanted to try this after I saw it won an America's Test Kitchen taste test, then I had a blind taste test for my boyfriend with some plain bread. He noticed a huge difference in taste and fragrance - this one compared to a supermarket brand I usually use, Bertolli, was much fruitier and actually tasted great, and the Bertolli has a slight but unpleasant aftertaste, and not much olive flavor. I was surprised how much we noticed the differences in flavor, this Columela was easily so much better.<br /><br />It was impossible to find in any store, so I'm very happy that Amazon has it, and it arrived quickly and very well-packaged.
