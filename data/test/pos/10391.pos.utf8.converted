I recently discovered these cookies in my large area supermarket. For 79 cents, I thought I couldn't go wrong. I love them! They are not too sweet and have a nice crunch to them without being too hard. They remind me a lot of Social Teas. For a treat, allow some ice cream to soften. Put a tablespoon of ice cream on one cracker and put another cracker over the top to make a "sandwich". Freeze in foil or wax paper. Yum! And not very high in calories or fat, depending on which ice cream you use. I think Goya could give Nabisco a run for its money, based on taste and price of these lovely crackers.
