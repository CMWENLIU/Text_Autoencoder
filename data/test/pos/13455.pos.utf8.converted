Besides being a great tasting cup of coffee, I like the idea that's it's organic as well as a fair-trade product. It was also a great price and ends up costing only 39 1/2 cents per cup.  You certainly won't get anything at the big "S" for that price! My husband and I both like this one and have received our second shipment.  We've had our Keurig/Breville coffee maker (which we just love!) for about 6 weeks now and have been ordering all varieties of coffee.  Coffee People's Tree Hugger, Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, along with Paul Newman's Extra Bold, are all at the top of our favorite's list so far. Try it, I'm sure you'll like it!
