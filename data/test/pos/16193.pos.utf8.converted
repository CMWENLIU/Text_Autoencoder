...it is so good!  Whoa! was my first response when I first had some of this granola.  I already eat other Kashi cereals, so I knew when I saw this it was going to be good.  But I had no idea it would be this good.  It is now a daily requirement for me.  I had stopped eating granola cereal for a long time, but then Kashi put out this one and I figured I would take a shot and try it.  Well, I have already made my opinion clear.  I would almost guarantee you that if you buy a box, you are going to like it too.
