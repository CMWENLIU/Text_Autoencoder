Their coffee shops smell of brewing coffee as refined classical music plays.<br /><br />Cafe Domingo has a nice, smoky flavor. It's got vigor and depth. Starbucks tends to taste burnt... but with Peet's, it's smoky. Cafe Domingo has an amazing depth of flavor and smokiness. A perfect way to jumpstart the day!
