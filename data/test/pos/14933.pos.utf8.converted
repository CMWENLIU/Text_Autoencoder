I started using Manuka Honey to see if I could finally get off Prilosec that I have been taking everyday for 8-9 months now for acid reflux.  Everytime I would stop taking it the heartburn would come back within 24 hours.  It didn't matter what I ate it would just come back, so I tried Manuka Honey (1 teaspoon in the morning) .  I have been Prilosec free for 2 weeks now and the only other thing I do is take a table spoon of a fiber supplement (Citrucel) also in the morning. I have been taking Manuka honey for about 1 1/2 months.  No heartburn, no pills for 2 weeks now and I eat whatever the hell I want.  Coincidence? Hum.......
