This is an awesome product. I've used it for years and wouldn't make my soups with anything else--it is the closest thing to homemade stock that comes in a jar. I would even go so far as to say better than homemade because it makes a more flavorful broth than I can get from using two chickens. Having said all that, this pricing is awful. I buy BTB at my local grocery store (and most carry it now, although that wasn't always the case) for about 5.39. I came to Amazon hoping for a quantity break but no such luck. My advice is to check your own grocery stores first before you pay twice too much.
