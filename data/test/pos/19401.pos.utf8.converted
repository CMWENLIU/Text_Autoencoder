I opened up the cat scratcher, spread a little nip on and my cat went to town on it. He barely gave me a chance to set it up. He has used incline scratchers before so this was something he was familiar with.<br /><br />I would recommend trying to weigh down the scratcher if your cat is over 7 lbs. I just stuck a little 10lb weight inside the little hole in the back. They are more apt to use the scratcher if it doesn't move around on them while they are scratching away.<br /><br />I bought this online because the price was so much better. I bought the incline scratcher and 2 packages of refills for what it would have cost for just the incline scratcher at a local pet store.<br /><br />If you're cat doesn't take to it you can't really blame the scratcher. Cats are persnickety creatures. My cat loves the incline scratcher but will not go near the pole with the rope for scratching.<br /><br />The cat is happy, I'm happy and my furniture is spared.
