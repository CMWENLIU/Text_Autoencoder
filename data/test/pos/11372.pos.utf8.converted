I've used a dozen different sculpting goos, gels, pomades, etc. over the years. I probably have $200 worth of half used and abandoned hair products ranging from Chi all the way up to Bumble & Bumble Sumotech. I was at Walmart the other day and they had it for $6 so I grabbed one for the heck of it. I have to say I was absolutely blown away. I had already decided that it would be the standard store-junk thinking that anything non-salon was terrible. I used this glop one time and the Sumotech went right into the drawer of dead hair-products. I couldn't believe how refined this product was! The smell was pleasant and I didn't feel like I was dipping my fingers into old, sticky Crisco. The texture is more like a soft face cream. I ride my bike to work every day in the Florida heat and when I get there my hair is still intact with no sticky crud running into my eyes. It's also non sticky to the touch so you don't feel like you need to run to wash your hands every time you touch your head.<br /><br />Give this stuff a shot. What do you have to lose besides $6? I bet you'll be surprised, too.
