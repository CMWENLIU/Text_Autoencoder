I usually hate diet soda - ones with natural sweeteners, ones with artificial - anything diet.  This is the first soda with 0 calories that I have tried and loved!  Their root beer flavor is fantastic as well!  Don't expect this to taste like Coke or Pepsi though - it is definitely more in line with a cola flavor you would get from Big Sky, Knudsen's or another natural brand.  I also like that it has a clean sweet sort of flavor - not a sickly sweet or with any sort of metallic aftertaste you get with other kinds of diet drinks.<br /><br />The only con I would say is that it is very carbonated - unless you really really like carbonation, I would recommend not drinking this straight from the can - pour it over ice.  The positive to this though is that if you don't finish a whole can, you can put it into the fridge and come back later and it is still fizzy.  I have left an open one in the fridge with no lid or covering only to come back the next day and find that it was still drinkable and not totally flat.<br /><br />Great product!  Glad Amazon has finally started carrying at least one flavor!
