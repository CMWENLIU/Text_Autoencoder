Saying I love this tea is a huge understatement. I have been drinking it exclusively for about eight years. The taste of this tea is rich in cinnamon with a hint of orange. Some people find it so sweet that no sweetening is needed even if you like your tea sweet. Surprisingly, there's no sugar or artificial sweeteners in it.<br /><br />I once called the company to find out what is in the tea that makes it so sweet and was told that the ingredients are a proprietary blend of the herbs listed in the package ingredients, plus some artificial flavor. One might expect to see stevia among the ingredients since it's a sweet tasting herb, but it's not there so we are left to ponder the mystery of what makes this tea so sweet.<br /><br />If caffeine is an ingredient you want, or want to avoid, be aware that this tea is available with or without it, and the packages look similar. The main difference in the appearance of the packages is that the caffeinated tea has some printing in grey whereas the herbal blend package is printed almost entirely  in brown. It's fairly easy to mistake them, so if you want the herbal blend you need to look for the words "Caffeine Free" and "Herbal" on the package or in the product description. Both the herbal and herbal blend say "Original" on the packages.<br /><br />A few years ago I started adding a splash of soy milk to my tea which cools it and gives it a slightly creamy taste. When I serve it to friends for the first time, they invariably ask what it is. When I take it with me in an insulated cup, people nearby often ask what I'm drinking that smells so good!
