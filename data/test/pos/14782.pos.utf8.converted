If you like the traditional Beefaroni, as I do, you will love this product.<br /><br />The whole wheat noodles are a bit more 'al dente' than the white noodles of the regular issue Beefaroni.  Good texture and a great, familiar taste.  Great buy, too, relative to the price in most grocery stores.<br /><br />Comfort food.
