I was instructed to increase my amount of protein daily and I am not a real meat eater.  I tried different protein drinks and was not satisfied because they made me feel full and I was not trying to suppress my appetite, plus many of them had ingredients that didn't appear natural or had added flavoring and sugar and I am trying to stick with natural products.  I was already eating egg white straight from the egg but was getting tired of that and decided to give this product a try.  I now use this everyday, I put it in my freshly juiced vegetable juices, I add it to my freshly juiced smoothies and it is great.  I even put it in my oatmeal and bake it for a real treat adding agave nectar as a sweetner. I am very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone trying to increase their protein intake and not trying to suppress their appetite.  I would also recommend it for anyone just looking for a cleaner way to crack an egg and use just the egg whites.
