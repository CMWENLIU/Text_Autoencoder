An Asian friend of mine introduced these Nong Shim Spicy noodles (beef flavor) to me and I was hooked from day 1.<br />I love spicy and these are SPICY.<br />You get 2 bags of condiments: one is the red Cayenne, beef flavor  and spice mix (contains MSG, fyi) and the other is dried chopped vegetables (including chinese mushroom flakes that sweel in the cooking cycle).<br /><br />Preparation: Boil water (determine how watery you want it), add condiments, and noodles (round shape, perfectly fits a small pan). Before the noodles get soft switch off the heat and let it sit for 2 minutes and enjoy.<br /><br />That is not how we eat it though: when not in the mood to cook a big meal or when we have left over meat or vegetables we will boil them into this (peas, cauliflower, chicken... hotdogs..) Sky is the limit.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Famous Nong Shim noodles taste great (we always have a box in the house)<br />- You can turn it into a full meal with leftovers<br />- Plenty spicy<br />- Not the thin ramen but Korean style thicker ones. Great mouth feel if not cooked too soft.<br />- Nice chopped vegetables in the condiments<br />- Larger per meal than the regular icky ramen that people buy for 30c a piece (ewww)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Contains MSG<br />- Some people become gassy from these (Amazon has good deals on Beano)<br />- The Seafood and other versions of these are HORRIBLE tasting. Make sure you get the red box beef flavored spicy ones.
