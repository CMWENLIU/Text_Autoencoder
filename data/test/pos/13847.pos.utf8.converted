Remember the old creamers when you were a kid? (only baby boomers will remember this). We used to eat the powered creamer by the spoon becasue it was so good. And then researchers mistakenly said that "dairy" was bad for the heart and everything went to chemicals? The new chemical creamers are yucky--but if you want to return to the good old days--this is it!!!
