I used to purchase Swedish Fish at the CVS Pharmacy for many years, but the store switched to the smaller fish, which are not nearly as good in texture. When evaluating a Swedish fish, the most important thing is freshness. You want fish that are as fresh as possible, i.e., furthest away from their expiration date (you can check the expiration code through the manufacturer Cadbury Adams). Well, Candy Depot just delivered the freshest Swedish fish I ever had -- just the right chewiness and bursting with flavor that no other gummy candy can match. Older Swedish fish get a bit stiff and are harder to chew. The intensity of the flavor diminishes as well. The assorted fish flavors are lemon (yellow), lime (green), orange (orange), and berry (red). Many people prefer only the red Swedish Fish because its flavor is sublime and difficult to describe; some people think the flavor is strawberry, others cherry, and even loganberry. No matter what, the Red Swedish Fish are the Holy Grail of non-chocolate candy. Although you can purchase a bag with just red fish, I prefer the assorted variety because I like the contrast in flavors, and you can progress in taste up to the red. When eating a Swedish Fish, no filleting is required; however, there is an art to it. Personally, I like to nip off the tail and then eat the body. Sometimes, I will roll up the fish from the tail end and eat it like a miniature jelly roll. But my special technique is reserved for a pair of red fish. I sandwich the two fish belly-to-belly, then I bite off the double tail, then I pop the double body into my mouth for a full burst of flavor. Delicious. Yes, I may seem strange, but I come from a competitive family where we used to have jelly bean wars. We would pair up the jelly beans, then we would "go to war" by holding each jelly bean between each forefinger and thumb, then smash the two together until one end of the losing jelly bean would cave in. These battles would continue in a single elimination tournament until one bean emerged victorious. I hope you enjoyed this review and your Swedish Fish from Amazon.
