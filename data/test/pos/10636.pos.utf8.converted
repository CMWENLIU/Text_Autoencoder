My mother sent me these when I was in Iraq. They made my day. What could be better than going into the chow hall with a couple of these gems in your cargo pockets? Everyone is sitting down to breakfast and you pull a packet of Nutella out and calmly spread it over a croissant and eat it. Everyone is now staring at you in slack-jawed envy. What are you eating?? Nutella. Got it in a care package. :D<br /><br />These are seriously perfect for care packages. Double bag them of course in case the whole package gets squashed, but even in hot weather, they should arrive fine and be no worse for the high temperatures, since Nutella is supposed to be semi-liquid anyways. If you have a loved one overseas, or if you are involved in a group that sends troops care packages, I highly recommend you throw in a pack of these. They will make a young GI's day, like they did mine once.
