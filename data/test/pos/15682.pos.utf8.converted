My husband loves Tangerine Orange Zinger tea, but it is hard to find.  I used to buy 2 to 4 boxes a week from a local grocery, but they decided not to carry it, and did not respond to my request to bring it back.  Other local stores charge $1.50 more per box, so I decided to look elsewhere.<br /><br />I found several places on the web that sell this tea, but I would have had to buy 24 boxes to get the price I wanted, AND pay shipping charges.  In the end Amazon offered the lowest price ($2.17/box), and no shipping cost when I bought $25+ worth of product.  That was only 12 boxes which may seem like a lot, but the tea is cellophane sealed, and won't go bad.  If you drink lots of tea buying from Amazon will likely be your best value.
