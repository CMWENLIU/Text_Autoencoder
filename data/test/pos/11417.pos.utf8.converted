Great source of Potassium too. No kidding a candy bar that is good for you.<br />It's the nuts and raisens of course.<br /><br />Anyway thumbs up this is clearly a two pack set or two packs of 24 bars for total of 48.<br />But beware of the 5 ounce sized add for larger sized bars. It states two also on the picture<br />but doesn't send 48 only the pack of 24. They need to correct this error in adverstisement<br />ASAP. Not clear if Candy comes from same vendor or not. Amazon needs to review this problem.<br /><br />Candy for some reason is difficult to find in stores these days. Actually for the past 15 years no<br />kidding. The fact it's still available at all must have to do with it's basic fans. I loved the<br />small bite size ones you could get in the bags at Halloween once upon a time too...way back in 93-94<br />era. Bring it on back....<br /><br />For those who may remember back in the 60-70's when these first came out there were two flavor mixes. That would be neat....if Nestles is listening.....develop a new campaign about the healthy benefits of<br />these bars and just maybe they would catch on again.
