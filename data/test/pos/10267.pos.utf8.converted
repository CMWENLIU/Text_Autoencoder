This paste is wonderful - bought at our local Inidan grocer for $4.99 so this is a good deal on Amazon for anyone not in a Indian grocery store area.  You can save tons of time not having to get out all your spices, morter and pestle, etc.  We find that if we just stir-fry with a little extra oil, some onions, maybe a little slice of fresh ginger, then mix in vegetables and meat (chicken needs to be cooked/browned separately however), some water if necessary for veges, and you soon have a dish you swear someone from India prepared for you.  Tonight we had this sauce cooked with beef, mixed in cauliflower, diced up idaho potatoes, carrots slices, onions, and it was delicous.  Served with some frozen naan from Trader Joes that heats up in toaster oven in just a few minutes, along with basmati rice - browned first then add 3 cups of water to 1 cup of basmati rice and cover for 25 minutes or until scattered holes.  What a great meal and this paste is an amazing time saver.  This is the way to go.  I was just thinking of how I wished I had discovered this paste when I first discovered that I loved Indian food when I lived in NYC in my early 20's in grad school.  If only I had know the tricks such as using a paste like this, I would be making indian food at my apartment all the time.  Back then I lived in the east village and walked over (just 4 blocks away) to the famous 6th street Indian restaurants of the several times per week.  When I moved to SF, I lived luckily just a block from Shalimar for many years and was a regular customer.  Now, I'm in suburbs with kids so for indian cooking, I now use 1,000 Indian Recipes by Neelam Batra - which I call my "Joy of Cooking for Indian Food" - it has everything.  Buy this paste, along with the Vindaloo and Biryani sauce, and you'll be glad you did.  My 3 year old girl just looked at me, eating some of the cut up beef cooked in this sauce, announcing "This is good"!  Now that's a winner.
