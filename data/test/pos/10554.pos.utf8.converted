Ted Nugent turned me on to this years ago.  We were having roast marmoset with duck-stuffed hog, when he brought out this tasty treat.  Sun-dried and salt-cured, it makes the absolute quintessential backpack snack for those long excursions when one needs to hide in the forest for extended periods of time.  The bonus in all of this is that there is absolutely no buckshot to pick out of the meat, which makes it a huge time saver!  I think they would probably do well to include the tail and maybe the entire pelt as an extra bonus treat, in case one of the kids wants a really cool hat to show off at school.  All in all, it beats having to trap or shoot), kill and skin your own rabbit, unless you're into that sort of thing.  Or if you're Elmer Fudd.
