I LOVE this cookie.  I have been eating these since I was a little baby!  I was so sad when they were hard to find in the U.S. for a few years... but VERY excited when I saw them for sale at a grocery store a week ago!!!  As for it being "bad" for you - honestly, you don't need to eat a whole bag!  I have two and am content.  There is no point being greedy - you're only hurting yourself.<br />I think they taste better than Gnutella, and MUCH better than Hersheys  crunchy wafers.  These have a unique and fluffy taste, and whenever I am eating them, I am reminded of patisseries found overseas.  They are especially tasty out of the fridge and without filling melting on your hands.<br /><br />*Update January 25, 2008:<br />I finally bought the 25 package deal and they took a week to get to my front door (but it came along with the newly released HP#5 ).  I used to munch on these as a little kid and then they went MIA for about a decade.  The chocolate has a slightly different taste than what my taste buds are used to now but that's because they're not American, they're German cookies... obviously they're a bit different!!  And as for nutritious value... come on now, they are cookies not fruit.  All in all, I am very happy with them and will probably buy them again - you can't beat the $.40/packet price!
