Looking for a cheaper gluten-free flour?  Look no further.  They don't mill wheat, so it's gluten-free with no chance of cross-contamination--unlike virtually every other brand of corn flour out there, except Publix, which is only available in four U.S. states.<br /><br />However, this is masa harina, not corn flour, so you can make tortillas, arepas, tamales and skillet corn bread with it...and not much else.<br /><br />Edit:  Masa Harina Socca<br /><br />(With many thanks to Mark Bittman.)  One and 1/2 cup water to one cup masa harina--let sit for several hours, covered.  Preheat oven to 450.  Find a flat cast-iron skillet without sides--like a flat fajita grill.  (A regular cast iron pan with sides will concentrate the heat too much on the edges and burn the edges before the center gets cooked.)<br /><br />Pour enough canola oil into the pan that it sloshes a little. Spoon the dough into the pan.  Finally, put the pan into the preheated oven. Leave for an hour to an hour and a half.  Flip halfway through.  L'Chaim.
