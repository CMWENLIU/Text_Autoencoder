I am a vegan, and it is hard to find a good cocoa that is vegan.  This sipping chocolate is delicious made with soymilk!  You can follow the directions on the package for a 4 oz. thick, rich and robust sipping chocolate, or add more milk to make more of a hot chocolate/cocoa consistency.  Either way, it is delicious!  It melts very well into the milk, it is not bitter or chalky as other cocoas tend to be.  Top quality and yummy!
