I use this mix on a regular basis.  Both my daughter and I are gluten intolerant so we are always on the lookout for great tasting GF products.  This mix makes a great sugar cookie,in fact, when I brought some for a party at my daughter's school, kids preferred my cookies to the other sugar cookies brought.  This also makes an excellent chocolate chip cookie.
