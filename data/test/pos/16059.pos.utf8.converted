This is our second Salt Block, the first was defective, but we couldn't live without having one, so....food is fabulous on it, we have done Elk Backstrap, chicken, Mahi Mahi, vegtables are incredible. Mahi Mahi is really our favorite, and don't think we could ever order it in a 5 star restaurant and have it any better!Clean-up easier that stated.
