I started using Steviva Blend because my blood glucose was elevated. My naturopathic dr suggested I eliminate sugar and grains from my diet... and NEVER use artificial sweeteners. I use this every day in my coffee with full fat half & half.  At first it took some time to figure out how much to use, but it is a dream come true to me.  It's all natural and has the same consistency as granulated sugar. The ingredients are erythritol and stevia. One tablespoon = 2.4 cal, 0 fat, 0 sodium, 0 carbs, 0 sugars.  No more gagging on unsweetened coffee!  (FYI: The photo shows the product as packets but is actually a bulk 1 lb bag.)
