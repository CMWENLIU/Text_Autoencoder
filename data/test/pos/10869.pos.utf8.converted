I've been eating oat bran every morning religiously for about a year now, and this is by far the best oat bran I have tasted! Not only is it super creamy and delicious, but it is also the lowest calorie oat bran I have seen, which is a huge plus! This is also much cheaper than buying it at the store, and I love not having to run to the grocery store every time I run out. Thank you bergin nut company!!
