I have purchased the St. Dalfour brand of preserves almost exclusively for the last ten years? Why? Because once you taste them it is very hard to enjoy anything else. They are made with very fresh, ripe, flavorful fruit, no corn syrup, usually no sweetening whatsoever other than fruit juice. Very basic recipe. Great taste, attractive glass jars. These small items would make great gifts or additions to a fruit basket or breakfast tray of hot rolls. The only brand I find is equal is Frog Hollow Farm - an enterprise in Northern California.
