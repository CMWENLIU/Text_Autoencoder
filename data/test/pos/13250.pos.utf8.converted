I never bought or ate wasabi flavored seaweed snacks before so I had no idea what they would be like. They are light, crispy, medium-hot spicy chips. Although they look light and flaky, they explode with flavor when you munch them. They also taste great in sandwiches and crumbled into salads. I paid around $10 for a pack of 12, using the coupon code ANNIECH8 plus the subscription discount.
