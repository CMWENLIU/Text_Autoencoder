my dad is on a no salt diet and I've used the Kirkland No Salt Seasoning to season his meats, vegetables, eggs, potatoes, everything! and he loves it.  He likes the flavor of the food even though he's a die hard salt fan.  I used it along with fresh garlic to make his favorite oxtails, broccoli, and used the broth from the oxtails (remove fat) to season his rice.  He loved it and so did the salt eaters!  Great product. Blessings
