I first bought the Cherry Pistacio from Meijer and really liked it but when I went back for more they were sold out of that flavor. I then tried the Berry and the Apple and liked those too. I went to two other stores but haven't been able to find it anywhere else. I was happy to find them at Amazon and ordered a dozen in each flavor including the Peach.  I do have to say that at least for me, the cooking directions need tweaking.  I add more water and increase the microwave time or it doesn't seem to be cooked enough and is too thick. Having said that, I think they taste great.  They're not mushy and have lots of texture, not to mention the convenience of having it all in it's own bowl.  Great to take to work since I'm always on the run. It's true that the price is a bit more from Amazon but at least I can find it when I run out so I'm okay with that.
