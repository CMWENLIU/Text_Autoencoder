I look forward to this cup of Chai tea every evening.  It's PERFECT.  I actually like it better than what I previously paid 4 dollars for at THE coffeehouse.  It is creamy, sweet, and tasty.  I do recommend using a smaller keurig setting with it so it doesn't taste watered-down, but otherwise, it's seriously perfect.
