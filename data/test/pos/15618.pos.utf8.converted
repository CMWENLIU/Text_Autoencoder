This salt tastes great. Yes, it's salty, but there's almost a hint of sweetness to it. The black coloring made me think it would be smoky or strong, but that's absolutely not the case. They crystals are fairly large, like pretzel salt, and you don't need a lot of it to dress up your food. One warning though: the color will come off on your fingers if they're wet (and other things, too), so don't get it on your clothes. I've managed to not wear any, so I don't know if it stains fabrics permanently, but take care. A little bit of this finishing salt goes a long way, so the price isn't as steep as it may seem. And the container is plastic with a plastic lid, so it won't rust from the salt.
