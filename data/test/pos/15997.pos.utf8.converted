My 4 year-old daughter is very picky when it comes to multivitamins.  First, she tried the Metagenics children's, but couldn't stand the orange flavor.  We had tried another mango multivitamin that she liked, but when they changed the flavor to lemon, she wouldn't eat them.  We tried another juice-type multivitamin, but it made her gag.  Finally, we tried these, she LOVES them.  And she thinks they are extra fun because they look like candy gumdrops.<br /><br />The only warning...make sure they stay out of the reach of children in case they would think they are candy and overdose.  Yes, the bottles have childproof caps, but that doesn't guarantee anything.
