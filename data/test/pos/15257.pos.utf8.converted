We LOVE Tinkyada pastas! I can't say enough about them! We use them exclusively now because we always get great results! The first few brands we tried turned to much BEFORE the recommended cooking time was up! Tinkyada can stand up to some overcooking and still be great! No funky taste OR texture! Ahhhhhh... my lasagna is BACK!!
