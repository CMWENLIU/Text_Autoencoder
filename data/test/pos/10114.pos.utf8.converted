In my opinion, Intensive/Extra Dry Skin is the only formula of Cream Oil lotion that Dove needs to make! I've tried the Shea Butter and Pro Age, and this has them both beat! The Pro Age has a hideous odor. The Shea Butter smells a little better than Pro Age, but still not as nice as the Intensive/Extra Dry Skin formula. It's not thick or heavy-just the right consistency with the slightest hint of oil-not greasy. Please Dove, don't change anything about it!!!
