This product was recommended to me by a physician - it was presented as a tasty and heathful way to lower cholesterol and weight - sooooooo nothing ventured....<br />I have been very pleased with Salba - I most frequently add it to yogurt and it provides a pleasant crunch not unlike the granola that I used to mix in -<br />It has a mild flavor and can be added to any foodstuff without altering the taste- It can be used in baking and/or cooking but it does then lose the crunch factor.<br />I plan to make it a regular part of my diet.
