From a doctor's health advice column, I was encouraged to try the combination of pectin and grape juice for relief of arthritis symtoms.  I am happy to report it has worked very well for me and countess friends/relatives who have also tried it.  It doesn't work for everyone, but because it is a natural food there is no harm in trying it.  And, adding to that fantastic news is that Amazon sells it for a fraction of the cost over grocery stores.<br /><br />Please correct spelling of countless from countess.  Thanks.  M. Ortiz
