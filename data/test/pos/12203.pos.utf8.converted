I use this on boneless skinless chicken thighs mostly.  They come out fabulous.  I have asked my Husband if he wanted them cooked another way, and he always says NO.<br /><br />I have also added this to spice up veggies, homefries, popcorn.<br /><br />Great blend and not overly salty, unlike most seasoning products on the market.
