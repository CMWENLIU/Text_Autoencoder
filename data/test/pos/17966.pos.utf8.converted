I decided to simplify my coffee consumption habits by getting a K-cup brewing system. I did a lot of research on the various models and found an alarmingly high number of pump problems with most home models. I made the same decision others made and purchased a small office (commercial rugged) system for home use.<br /><br />It shipped quickly and set up easily. After priming it I made a cup of coffee and about a minute after pressing brew I had a fresh cup of coffee. Simple, clean and easy, what more could a person ask for? BTW, this unit makes a little bit of noise, buzzes some and you can hear the pump and air but it is not loud or alarming. The whole brewing process takes a minute and the noises last for 30 seconds or so.<br /><br />The included K-cup selection is nice and I enjoy the variety of choices for coffee, tea and hot chocolate offered in many stores.<br /><br />This brewer will accommodate 20oz travel mug, brewing straight into my mug.  This seems to be a solid unit and I recommend this to others.
