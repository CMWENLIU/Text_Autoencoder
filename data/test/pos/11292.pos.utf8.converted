As soon as I saw the box I went, WOAH that's small, but it was densely packed and very misleading. Each caramel was so rich, buttery and smooth. Simply delectable! That wasn't the only thing though, the amazing unique taste of the Fleur de sel was tantalizing and made my entire mouth salivate to capture each and every changing flavor of this wonderfully surprising caramel. To call this a "candy" would be an understatement and a shame. I will ever eat another caramel and forever compare it to this product, and I'm sure it will fall short.<br /><br />I purchased the Lavender (spelled incorrectly on Amazon as Laveneder) and the subtle honey lavender made for warm tingly sensations. I felt that these caramels were not too sweet as they were offset by the salt hints. Will definitely buy again, and they included samples! How wonderful! (My toddler had the first piece out of the box, and I have never seen him enjoy something so much with all the lipsmacking sounds he made!)
