I have cooked red curry chicken and red curry shrimp and this curry paste made my entrees delicious.  I simmered the paste with meat and vegetables and then added some lite coconut milk to create a rich and flavorful curry sauce.  Yum!<br /><br />A word of advice.. I once tried to use Thai Kitchen Brand Red Curry as a substitue and I bascially ended up with 4 lbs of bland over-salty shrimp.  I highly recommend Patak's Curry, Hot.  It is the best red curry paste I have ever used.<br /><br />Feel free to send me a message if you want to talk about Thai and Indian recipes.<br /><br />Greg
