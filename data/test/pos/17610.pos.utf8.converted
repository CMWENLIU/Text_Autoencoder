This product is Awesome and Helpful for anyone with asthma and or breathing difficulties. I have dealt with for years and keep coming back to this item; because it seems to work so good with honey -and sometimes a drop or two of fresh lemon.  I add chamomile tea bag with one of these at bed time; and it really works very good for my lungs seem to be eased.  I do notice though that if the product is close to expiring it does not seem to be as effective-and would advise not buying anything near expired when it comes to all-nature products that probably don't have all that many additives or preservatives to begin with.
