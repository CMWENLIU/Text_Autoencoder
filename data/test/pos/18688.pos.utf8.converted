I first tried one of these bars after finding it on clearance at a local Target store. OMG! The dark chocolate has just the right amount of sweetness to it, and the mousse center melts on your tongue. It is a wonderful taste experience! In my opinion, this tops all the other dark chocolates I have tried (and I try everything I can get my hands on, so I consider myself quite the dark choc. connoisseur). I haven't been able to find it locally, so am ordering it off the web, because I HAVE TO HAVE IT!!!
