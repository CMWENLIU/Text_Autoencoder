Hapi's Hot Wasabi Green Peas are a terrific replacement for granola! I eat a bowlful every morning with ketchup, green tea and scallions. Yummy! I tried rolling up the peas in an omlet and served it to my wife on our 75th anniversary. This was just my way of expressing my affection for her. Somehow she missed my sincere intentions and barfed all over my grandmother's antique quilt. Then our Irish Wolfhound jumped up on the bed, licked up the disgusting mess and yelped so loud that 3 of my goldfish jumped out of their bowl and were eaten by my cat. At least someone got a good meal from all my hard work.<br /><br />I had some small success passing out single peas to the neighborhood kids, telling them that they were a new flavor of M&Ms. Their parents really have no gripe with me, but I explained it all to the police. They could not find any violation of law, so I was released without charges.<br /><br />I did feel a bit ripped off by the 9.9 oz. packaging as I had expected a full 10 oz. bottle. After carefully counting all the peas I determined that 4 additional peas would make up the missing 1/10 ounce (yes, I did the math). So I called customer service, told them how unhappy I was and asked them to send me 4 additional peas. She was polite, but said no, claiming that they wouldn't have a pod to pea in. Whatever. These are really nice peas -- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
