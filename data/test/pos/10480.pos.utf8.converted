The shipping policies of this seller state:<br />"All in-stock items will arrive your doorstep Tuesday through Saturday "Fed Ex Standard Overnight" by 4:30 p.m., one business day after receipt of your order, following our ordering guidelines."<br />According to my mother who received a bunch of flowers now for the second time from this seller, the flowers are awesome and long lasting, but the delivery took approximately 2 days took longer than the shipping policies stated although these were supposedly in stock when I ordered.<br />Same happened last year when I ordered over this company, so when you order here, take a longer delivery time into account! When you do that, then the flowers are bound to please!
