I bought this assortment of Ghirardelli Intense Dark chocolate.  It's a combination of 60%, 72% and 86%--anything above 60% is recommended by nutritionists as being positive for health benefits. An ounce a day is great.  It's a non-guilty pleasure.  As a friend said, "Chocolate is a vegetable--it's a bean!"  These are not too bitter for my taste and silky and smooth.  I'm quite satisfied with a small amount after dinner as the flavor is intense and lasts.  This chocolate is an affordable, healthy and daily treat.
