I love this product, but I also love the original as well. I don't eat sugar so I didn't have a problem with the taste of either product.  To make this product super delicious, add ice, half an organic banana and a half teaspoon of almond butter, and water--it is like desert.  I only take one scoop. Two scoops is too much. I take another scoop in the late afternoon as my dinner substitute.<br /><br />This product doesn't help loose weight per se, depending on your current nutrition, but it does help tighten the body, i.e you will loose inches.<br /><br />Also, it gives you tremendous energy.  You feel so great--even after the first day.<br /><br />I go through two of these tubs in a month. Been taking it since Jan and I love it.
