I discovered Prince of Peace Honey Ginger tea when I was pregnant with my first child and fell in love. It is great to settle an uneasy stomach or first thing in the morning for morning sickness ( my husband brings it to me before I get out of bed).<br />I am now pregnant for the second time and find this to be an invaluable part of my morning sickness kit.<br /><br />The vendor shipped in a timely manner and the packaging was great.
