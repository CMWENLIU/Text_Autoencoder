Vegan. Natural. Kosher. Beautiful, classic yellow dal. Dal means lentils which have been split in half, similar to split peas and split pea soup. Yellow dal is a staple of Indian meals (thalis.) Not spicy, but very rich and flavorful. In addition to serving with or over rice, great with bread or toast. Jodhpur is a city in Rajastan, India located southeast of New Delhi. Raja means king. Rajastan is also well known for the high percentage of orthodox Hindu vegetarians living there. Made with lentils, sunflower oil, salt, tomatoes, garlic, cumin, tumeric, and chilis. Easy-open foil pouch. Approx 220 calories, 12g protein, 5g fat per pouch. Labeled vegan on the back of the box. By using only vegetable oils, this wonderful treat also lets Ama Gai [mother cow] save her milk for her own babies. Although freshly and locally made is always better, this Tasty Bite dish is a fantastic tribute to the cuisine of Rajastan and a great choice for everyone to enjoy the wonders of this wonderful Indian cuisine at home. Product of India. Highly recommended.
