I've been buying this in little 1.6 oz packages for a long time now, so I was delighted to find this larger size available here.  It adds just the right body and gloss to any chicken sauce or glaze.  It will make a fabulous sauce for a sauteed chicken breast in minutes.  Deglaze the pan with a bit of wine, toss in a dollop of the demi-glace, and simmer until it melts.  Adjust your seasonings, and you have an instant, silky sauce. It can make a quick weeknight meal look like a gourmet endeavor.<br /><br />I agree with the others here that it will keep in the fridge for a long time, but it does dry out.  when I get this large size, I will portion it out in tablespoon dollops, freeze them on a cookie sheet, then bag them in the freezer.  This stuff lasts forever in the freezer.
