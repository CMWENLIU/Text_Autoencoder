I'm buying 2 new sproutbags today, and I prefer this kit to getting just the bag for about the same cost. I wouldn't even be in the market, but I ruined the bag I've had for 3 years by soaking it in a rusty metal tin on accident. My bad! I used to have a Sproutmaster 3-Tray system, but I gave it away because this sproutbag is all I need. It's sturdy and works like a charm every time. After three years of use mine was looking pretty dingy, but that's what happens to things when nature has touched them. Solid product.
