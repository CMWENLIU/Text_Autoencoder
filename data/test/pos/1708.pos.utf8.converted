Both my best friend and I LOVE this tea.  Embarrassingly, we are quasi-tea snobs each in our own way.  We have tried all forms, brands, etc including the very pricey varieties, and we agreed that for a white/green blend this is perfect.  It is not too mild or smooth, nor is it too astringent or bitter.  It is a nice golden color with a tempting, soothing aroma.  It has good mouth feel - light but not too light.  It is very good plain or with some honey.<br />It contains white, green blend (Chinese, Japanese, Darjeeling and Assam from India, and organic green from Sri Lanka).  It is really a very nice tea.  Please note that of the teas that are blended into each sachet, only one is organic.
