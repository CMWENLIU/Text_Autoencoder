I can't live without bread, pancake, rice, and etc. However, I'm also health conscious. Therefore, for me, the best alternative is to buy organic groceries and to introduce a lot of fibers in my diet. So far, I found that Bob's Red Mill Organic products offer good qualities without sacrificing tastes.<br />I live in Oregon but too lazy to drive to Bob's Red Mill store. Most grocery stores don't carry all the stuff I want. I found it's a steal with Amazon's sale price plus its free shipping.<br />I wish Amazon would also carry Bob's Red Mill's Wheat Germ.
