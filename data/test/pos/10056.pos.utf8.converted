I discovered this bar in a local supermarket once and absolutely loved it. It is not available at all Supermarket outlets. I tried the Hemp Bar made by Nature's path which was also delicious, but because of allergies to some ingredients, this was the first treat that I have been able to enjoy without worry. I spoke to the company and although the bar does not say it is gluten free, and I am gluten sensitive, this bar is absolutely fine for me. Some people cannot tolerate oats, but I have had a lucky break with the oats in this bar. It is a staple grab bar in my home. My teenage kids absolutely love them and that pleases me as it really is so nutritious. I have bulk ordered this twice already through Amazon, and will be back when the cupboard is bare. Enjoy this. I know some people find it not sweet enough. I find it has enough sweetness and fabulous texture. (I normally don't even enjoy bars of any sort). It is a wholesome treat. Try it with a cup of green tea on an afternoon and you will be pleasantly surprized as to how an ordinary day can feel like a gift.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E4C2MQ">Nature's Path Organic Granola Bars, Pumpkin FlaxPlus, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>
