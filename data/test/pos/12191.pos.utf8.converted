This box filled w/ wonderous treats from the past was a really BIG hit for my spouse's birthday recently.<br />We both couldn't believe how much candy (and other things) were packed into this very nice sized box!<br />Worth every penny!!!! The products brought back happy memories.<br />If you're looking for chocolate, this isn't for you.<br />This is more of the "candy" of the era type box. Penny and nickel candy and gum and suckers and and and and... Yum! Fun! Surprising! Happy!<br />Very nice gift. I will buy again for others I know and love!!!!!!!!
