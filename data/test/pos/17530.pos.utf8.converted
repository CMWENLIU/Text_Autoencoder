These are fresh and tasty.  I really have no idea how fresh the ingredients are, but they smell, look, and (especially) taste very fresh.  If you've ever gotten infused oil products before ...you know that sometimes (especially with garlic, IMO-it can really be stinky) the product tastes heavy and the aroma is also. Sometimes that may be a freshness issue-sometimes ingredients are just not good...but I have encountered that several times before. This is light on my tongue, not overpowering as an herb or a spice... and I have been using it for pastas the past several days. Two friends of mine already noticed it on pasta in the last three days and asked about it. Very handy for a cook, very tasty, and I have already ordered most of their infused oils. Just for information...the ingredients are -Sunflower oil, extra virgin olive oil, diced garlic, diced parsley, natural garlic extract flavor. I thought maybe this last ingredient might make it heavy if it was not fresh. It is very good. The "best before" date on mine is 3/13/10. Todays date is 3/14/09. I recommend this and will buy it again.
