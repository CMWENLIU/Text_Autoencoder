This yellow  popcorn comes in a useful airtight plastic canister that will keep your popcorn fresh and can be re-used to store grains, beans, tea, etc. With a four-pound supply, one canister should last a while. This popcorn pops very well on the stove. Here's how I do it:<br /><br />I recommend using a 5-quart stockpot/chili pot/dutch oven to make popcorn on the stove. You don't necessarily need high walls on the pot, but you do need some interior volume to accommodate the expansion of the popped kernels.<br /><br />1) Pour 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil into the pot.<br />2) Put three corn kernels into the oil and cover the pot.<br />3) Turn the heat on to medium-high. The interesting thing about making popcorn on the stove is that a medium-high heat works better than a low heat, because the kernels pop more quickly and thus have less time to burn.<br />4) Listen carefully to the pot -- the three kernels should pop within a couple of minutes. When the kernels have popped, remove them from the pot. Now sprinkle or grind some sea salt into the oil, and any other spices you may want to use (curry powder, turmeric, cumin, pepper, etc.) Spread the salt and/or spices around with a wooden spoon to incorporate them into the oil.<br />5) Pour 1/2 a cup or 3/4 of a cup of popcorn kernels into the pot. Use a spoon to move the kernels around and coat them thoroughly with oil. Cover the pot.<br />6) Now wait for the kernels to pop. Make sure the lid on the pot is tightly sealed. Every 30 seconds or so, grab the pot handles using oven mitts or potholders and lift the pot slightly off the flame, shaking the pot around in a vigorous circular motion and side-to-side. Put the pot back down on the flame. Shaking the pot helps to keep the kernels from burning and also ensures the kernels are receiving even heat distribution.<br />7) The kernels should begin to pop, slowly at first, then building up to a rapid crescendo. Continue shaking the pot every half-minute or so. When the kernel popping starts to die down, turn off the heat.<br />8) Remove the pot cover, and stand back for a minute. Sometimes, some kernels will still be popping, so just keep some distance.<br />9) Pour the popcorn into a large bowl and enjoy! Put any leftover popcorn into a zip-lock bag and seal it. It will last a few days.
