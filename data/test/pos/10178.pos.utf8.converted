Ever since Brach's and A&W quit their contract for rootbeer barrels, my husband has been missing them in his candy stash.  He was very happy to find these Dad's rootbeer barrels in his stocking on Christmas :)<br /><br />I enjoy these more than the A&W ones, there is more to the flavor than just sweetness.  Also, they are a long-lasting candy, you can suck on one for many minutes before it runs out.
