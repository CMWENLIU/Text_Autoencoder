You know how it is - the local store brings in a new product for customers to try, you buy it and like it, then find the store doesn't stock it.  Sigh.  I do not use salt as a rule.  I find that my tasting has changed and adding salt is just, well, too salty for me.  This product, however, is very nice as it has a mild flavor.  I like that there is magnesium and potassium added.  A bit more expensive that the usual table salt, but worth the price.
