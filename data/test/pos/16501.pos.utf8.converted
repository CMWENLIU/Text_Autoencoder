I'd been hearing about Zevia and finally got to try some of each flavor.  Due to an inability to process sugar (can't "cheat" because I get instantly sick), and headache problems from aspartame and sucralose, I've been unable to drink soda for several years.  I figured I'd rather be healthy, feel good, and drink water or tea than have a drink of pop and feel awful, so I abstained.<br /><br />So I was excited to find Zevia.  Zevia is nothing short of wonderful.  When I could still drink pop, I'd tried all kinds of artisan types like Jones, Virgil's etc. so it doesn't bother me a bit that it's not a Coke clone (but it's not far off either).  It's still got a wonderful, true cola flavor--a fantasia flavor of vanilla, citrus, and cinnamon, like all true colas.  Plenty of fizz that lasts the whole can.<br /><br />As far as aftertaste goes, I've never tasted a soda that didn't have some kind--and that I couldn't get used to.  This probably has less aftertaste than anything I've tasted, other than straight cane-sugar.  If anything it's a sweet, rather than the usual acidic, aftertaste.<br /><br />The opinions of the others in my family are similar.  My husband, who is very picky when it comes to diet cola, loved it and claimed my second can of it.  He's been trying to get away from his diet Coke addiction for a couple of years.  My kids loved all the flavors they tried. They're not normally allowed to drink soda at all, and are thrilled there is finally something out there I'll allow them to have once in awhile.<br /><br />It's selling for about $1 a can, which is less than the other "stevia-supplemented" soda out there (Virgil's is around $2 a bottle).  I imagine that as this takes off, that price will come down.  And it should take off.  It's just as good as the not-so-good-for-you sodas.
