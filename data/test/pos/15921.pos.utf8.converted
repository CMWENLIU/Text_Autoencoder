:: English Toffee Flavored Liquid Stevia ::<br /><br />Amazing how intensely rich this is!<br /><br />It totally tastes like sweet english toffee. How thay accomplish so much flavor in these zero cal little droplets, that's a voodoo mystery to me. My one complaint is that they don't give any hints of their tricks to get the english toffee flavor. I know that stevia is already magic in itself for its sweetness power, but wondered about how they managed to get the strong english toffee swing in there. On package label, all they have to say, basically, is "Natuarl flavors". Unfortunately staying more secretive than I'd have preferred. But I can forgive them that one decision. Since overall: this stuff is a great treat, while leaving your conscience clean on matters of substances in the body.<br /><br />Ultimate Summertime Cappuccino:<br /><br />  - Good quality roast coffee, chilled<br />  - Soy milk (frothed, if frother handy)<br />  - Liquid stevia. English toffee flavor for total indulgence!<br />  - Serve over ice
