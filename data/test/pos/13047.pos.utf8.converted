I'm from Brazil, and when I'm home I usually drink coconut water straight from the coconut. When I moved to the states I really missed tating real good coconut water, until I tried this product. Trust me people, this is the real stuff. It's not as sweet as the othe rbrands, and real coconut water isn't supposed to be, but sour coconut water means that they took it from coconuts that aren't ripe yet. This is the best coconut water you can get in the states.
