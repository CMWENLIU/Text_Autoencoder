I use vinegar in many different ways at home, not just for cooking.  It is a great cleaner - cheap and totally green, no harsh chemicals.<br /><br />My favorite use for it is to clean suede shoes and boots.  Once suede is stained, there is about 24-48 hour window before the stain sets in.  I mix 40% white vinegar and 60% water solution, and blot the stain with a wet paper towel.  When the cleaning is over I stuff the shoe/boot with newspapers to make sure the shape is retained and let it dry.  Note that it should dry naturally, not next to a heat source like a radiator, as it the heat will damage the skin.<br /><br />Vinegar's magic ingredient is acetic acid. All vinegars are produced by oxidization of alcohol into acetic acid.  Since people have been making wine for ever, vinegar was an accidental by-product a long time ago.<br /><br />Here are some of my additional uses for vinegar:<br />1. I add a few tablespoons of white vinegar to water when poaching eggs.  It helps whites stay firm, so if you get an accidental crack in the shell the white will not leak out.<br /><br />2. Adding vinegar to wilted veggies will make them perk up.<br /><br />3. After cooking I don't like to keep the smell of onions on my hands, a quick wipe with vinegar removes the odor.<br /><br />4. When I had a garbage disposal i would mix vinegar with baking soda and put it down the drain. After the mixture fizzed for a few minutes I would flush it along with the smell.<br /><br />5. After washing stemware in some dishwashing linquids they become cloudy.  Cleaning them with vinegar removes the white cloudiness.<br /><br />6. Vinegar works well cleaning grout. I dip an old toothbrush into vinegar and can get stains and dirt out quite easily.<br /><br />7. Vinegar and vegetable oil (50/50) work well removing water stains from wood.<br /><br />8. If I have stains on clothing (food or sweat stains) I wet them with vinegar before putting in the washer. It helps to get out stubborn stains.<br /><br />9. My mom always added a cupful of vinegar to the rinse cycle. Acetic acid is not harmful to clothing, but it dissolves soap residue and dark clothing comes out brighter.  It also has a side effect of working like a fabric softener.<br /><br />10. In the winter I use vinegar/water solution (3-to-1) to wipe down my windows and it keeps them frost free.<br /><br />11. I have a few cracks in my drive way, rather than pouring chemicals on the weeds that grow from these cracks I use 50-50 solution of vinegar and water to keep them under control.<br /><br />12. I like to keep cut flowers on my dining room table, and to prolong their life I add a tablespoon of vinegar to the water along with a teaspoon of sugar.<br /><br />Vinegar is a very useful thing to have at home, I recommend it!<br /><br />Ali Julia review
