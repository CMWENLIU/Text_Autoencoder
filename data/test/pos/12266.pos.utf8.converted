I have now taken the Benecol caramels for about 8 months.  Other then the caramels, I kept my diet the same including the consumption of one dish of ice cream per day.  My LDL (bad cholesterol) dropped from 132 which was borderline high to 105.  My good cholesterol (HDL) went up from 52 to 64.<br />Samuel J. Orr III
