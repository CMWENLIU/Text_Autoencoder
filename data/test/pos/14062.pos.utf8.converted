My McCanns Steel Cut Oats arrived in great condition and a day sooner than expected.  As for the oats...I hesitate to even call this oatmeal.  I do not like regular rolled oats...to me they are mushy and icky.<br />My mom was extolling the virtues of steel cut oats and to silence her I tried some.  Ohhh, they were wonderful - nothing like normal oatmeal.<br />The texture is different and it has a slightly nutty flavor...great!!<br />And, after a month of regular oat eating my cholesterol has dropped a couple of points.
