Crystal Hot Sauce is as basic to Louisiana Cajun cooking as Miracle Whip to church basement potlucks. It's not as salty as some hot sauces or as smokey as others, and it doesn't carry any aftertaste of powdered garlic. It's essentially a "table condiment", what you reach for when the gumbo is bland or the fried catfish muddy-tasting. It's the 'on the table' pick at Angeline's Restaurant in Berkeley, CA, the closest thing to authentic Cajun in the Bay Area. I used to carry a bottle of it in my instrument case whenever I flew to the UK or the Netherlands for gigs, but "them days is gone" in the age of airport security. Now I carry powdered Chipotle chilis, and hope some day a security guard will open the little bottle and take a good sniff ...
