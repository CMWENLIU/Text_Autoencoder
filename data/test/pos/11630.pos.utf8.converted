Please note, Amazon did not incorrectly place this item in the "foods" section:  This is not just a mustard-flavored, or mustard-scented oil--it's actually the oil from mustard seeds, which have been safely consumed by people in India for thousands of years.<br /><br />The reason the label reads "for external use only" is due to an FDA regulation:  When the product is sold in the US, it must legally bear this label.<br /><br />This is exactly the same thing that has been used extensively in northern India for cooking for ages.  This very product ("KTC Pure Mustard Oil") is sold in many Indian groceries in the U.S.,  and everyone there will tell you that it's used for a cooking oil.  If you look on the back of the bottle you will see in the labeling "Manufactured by: KTC (Edibles) LTD."<br /><br /> Mustard oil is actually reputed to be particularly heart-healthy, and have a lower percentage of saturated fats than canola or other edible oil.  One note, it's always briefly heated to a very hot (almost smoking) point by Indian cooks right before using.  This is done to get rid of a raw taste that is considered not pleasant, and to achieve a nice mellow flavor.  Hope this info helps.
