I love this green tea!  When prepared correctly (especially with delicate teas, such as green and white teas) you will experience the most delightfully fragrant and smooth tea ever!<br /><br />Jasmine is believed to be the world's most popular flavored green tea; since I love the scent of jasmine anyway, I thought I'd give it a try.  My first cup was at a local Chinese restaurant in Richardson, TX (of all places, right?...but true!).  The sweet scent of jasmine enveloped the restaurant; my guests and I were immediately presented with this beautiful Chinese Tea Setting of jasmine green tea (already steeped and strained).  OMG! First sip and I was hooked!  With a dash of sugar the green tea  and jasmine flavor just popped. Absolutely delicious!<br /><br />I was advised that one tea bag will yield 2.5 cups (OR a small tea pot).  Brewing good tea requires good preparation. Start with cold fresh water and bring kettle it to a boil.  Let hot water settle for awhile.  Next, prepare your tea pot with one tea bag.  Pour hot water into tea pot.<br /><br />Follow these guidelines for appropriate water temperature and steeping times for jasmine tea varieties.<br /><br />  * Black: Use boiling water and steep for 3 to 5 minutes<br />  * Oolong: Use boiling water and steep for 2 to 3 minutes<br />  * Green: Use 160
