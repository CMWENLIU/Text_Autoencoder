My husband Robert started using the Manuka honey <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK08OC">Wedderspoon Raw Organic Manuka Honey Active 16+, 17.6-Ounce Jar</a> when he was having digestive problems. We decided to try this honey as well, when we saw it came from the same producer. We also liked the idea that the Beechwood honey is purported to be so rich in minerals. Well, this turns out to be the best tasting honey either of us has ever tried. I don't eat it that often, just now and then as a treat - only because I don't need the extra calories. My husband, on the other hand, has no such concerns holding him back and he has this honey on toast at least once a day. He, like me, loves the full, smooth flavor. Robert's stomach used to rumble all the time before he started using these two honeys (Beechwood and Manuka), now all has been silent for months. He looks a lot healthier too. Knowing that it is organic, raw and chock full of nutrients just adds further to our enjoyment. Highly recommended!
