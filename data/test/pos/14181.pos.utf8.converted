These are all medium sized seeds, between the size of radish and garbanzo, with a very high germination rate. I use the SproutMaster which makes growing sprouts a breeze. These are all mild flavored sprouts (unlike radish sprouts for example which have a bit of a radishy bite to them).<br /><br />If you don't know much about this kind of sprout, beans and peas are a good source of vegetarian protein. Sprouts, as they grow produce enzymes, which can play a number of roles in digestion and even immune system function, because most of your immune system is in your gestational tract. Sprouts are also a great source of fiber, and antioxidants. During the winter it is great to be able to grow a fresh, live food, because veggies at the grocery store are usually quite wilted or picked well before their peak. Sprouts, eaten fresh, are a plant that on a per-size basis, is pretty much the most potent and healthy thing you can feed yourself.
