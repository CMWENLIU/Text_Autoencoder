Can I get 48 flavors? Will someone take out the black jellybeans (licorice)?<br />Other than that you cant go wrong with Jellybelly's! And this is an economical way to keep them around the office as a treat. I have to chase my co-workers off because they want to refill the cup if their favorite flavors are not present. Someone has to eat the brown and black ones, cmon!
