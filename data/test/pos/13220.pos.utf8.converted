my wife has Celiac DZ, not me.  this is the only GF stuff I can stand.  i actually prefer it to regular pancakes.  we also use it for other stuff too.  it is pricey, especially vs. regular flour, but with amazon and the 15% off for regular shipments, it's a little more affordable.  don't forget trader joes pasta--the cheapest and the best!
