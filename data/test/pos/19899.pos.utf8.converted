The shipment of Navitas Cacao Nibs I just received had some of the freshest, best tasting nibs I've found. When I want really fresh cacao I skin the whole beans myself but it's a lot of work and these were so close to being just as tasty.  I grind mine in a coffee mill with cashews and then whirl it all with coconut butter/oil and agave nectar or maple syrup and then spread that on an almond meal/dried fruit crust.  The result is an incredible truffle like treat that is packed with nutritional energy and mood enhancing chocolate too!
