B"H<br /><br />A while back, Celestial Seasonings discontinued my favorite tea, Strawberry Kiwi. Since I drink mostly Celestial Seasonings iced herbal teas (which I make with stevia since I'm diabetic and holistic) I didn't know what to do but I found two flavors that work very well together -- True Blueberry and Moroccan Pomegranate Red. I used two bags of each, sweetened to taste, in each half gallon of water.
