Crown Prince skinless & boneless sardines are truly a healthy treat. I love seafood to begin with, and with all the scare about PCB's, mercury, and other chemicals in our fish lately, I have been researching healthier alternatives.  I love the fact that these sardines are large and meaty, with just the right texture.  They have been thoroughly cleaned as well, and I don't have to worry about eating bones, skin, or inner organ remnants (EWW!).  I always make sure I am well stocked, and try to have at least 5 to 10 cans within reach.
