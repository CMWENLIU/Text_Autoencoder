I don't write many reviews, but for those of us who miss Postum, this is important enough to warrant a review.  After tasting Dandy Blend, I knew with the first sip, I felt like I'd found an old friend. It really reminds me of Postum, I think I could have been fooled into thinking it was Postum.  Hopefully, you will love it too.  By the way, I bought a case of Pero, based on good reviews, had to throw it away, I didn't like it at all.
