I gave this mug 5 stars because this is the best steeping mug I have, but it has some issues. First the good things.<br /><br />pros:<br />  1) made of a stable material** that leaves no foreign odor in the tea<br />  2) lead and bisphenol-A free<br />  3) infuser filters out most of the unwanted particles<br />  4) makes it easy to use the same leaves many times<br /><br />And now the ugly ones.<br />cons:<br />  1) the insides are white so tea stains are easily detectable<br />  2) it is really hard to take the infuser out without spilling any liquid<br /><br />** majority of plastic infusers contain BPA
