My black German Shepherd has allergies to corn & wheat, which seems to be the primary ingredients in most dog foods.  We suffered with her for years, cooking chicken, hamburger, rice to keep her healthy until we found the WELLNESS products.  They have turned her into a beautiful, not scratching or licking youthful dog.  We are also now feeding our lab and corgi the same foods with similar results.  Thank You Wellness!  (Incidentally the foods sold by the vet as hypo-allergenic had either corn syrup &/or wheat germ in it.  We read all labels now, all the way thru the fine print!)  Another added benefit for the larger dogs is the incorporation of glucosamine & chondroitin into it, saving additional vet bills.
