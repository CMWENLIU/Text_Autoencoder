Ya, in love, and that's not exaggerate.  I grow up eating instant noodle, and i know what i'm talking about.  This is eaten without the soup, so i think they pack you more noodle then most other instant noodles.  Its got great flavor.  not the healthiest thing to eat, but this is great comfort food.
