After pumping my way (full time) to 8 mos. this formula was the only kind my baby was eager to accept and that didn't cause her diaper rash. She's pretty lactose intolerant as it turns out (which only makes sense considering we only have 1 stomach to a cow's 4 stomachs)...I give this product 5 stars for the product itself. Hope Amazon gets a clue and distributes it in bulk so we can find a cheaper source. Would LOVE to subscribe and save, but there's no savings here.
