I prefer white popcorn to yellow, and it's getting impossible to find white popcorn in the grocery stores around here, so I ordered this because the price is good. It pops well and tastes good. Of course, I don't actually know of any popcorn that DOESN'T pop well and taste good, unless I screw up the process. In case you're wondering about ordering this much popcorn all at once: I looked it up, and most sources say you can store unpopped popcorn for up to two years before it starts to lose moisture. You'll have to transfer this to something airtight, though; it comes in plastic bags closed with twist ties.
