We just had our second baby in five years with severe GERD/reflux.  Luckily, I was able to identify the signs much earlier this time.  We also determiend before even leaving the hospital that she was lactose intolerant, as I am.  She was first switched from Enfamil Lacto-free to Nutramigen, to Enfamil A.R.(not lactose free), to Enfamil Gentlease (reduced lactose), to Similac R.S. (lactose free with rice starch additive).  After the third one, they put her on Zantac and continued on with the formulas until we got to this one and it worked.<br />It is pricey and only available in ready-to-feed, but it was the ONLY formula that kept my daughter from screaming in pain.  She still spits up, but it's not as much.  I might also mention that she was constipated as well before going on this one.  Another word of advise to parents whose babies are put on Zantac- it's much easier to administer if you mix it in with their formula.  Our pediatrician told us it's just as effective that way.
