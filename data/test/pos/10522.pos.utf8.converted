The twick is not so much to catch the wabbit, the twick is to ho'd the wabbit.  Wight awm nestoled awound the neck, elbow beneath the chin, hand cwenching the back of the wodent's head.  Weft awm fiwmwy wapped awound the wabbit's waist, ho'ding the body tight to yow body.  And, quickwy, in one viowent twist, you snap the neck.<br /><br />Sometimes the wabbit will fwop a widdle on the gwound.  You may not have pwopewly sevewed the spinal chord.  This is a weal tweat, as a wiving and fuwy mobile wabbit can be dangewous, wascally even: a wiving wabbit with a bwoken neck is hawmless so wong as you stay away fwum the teeth.  When I see a wabbit fwopping on the gwound, I wift my widdle boot and cwush its tiny widdle cwanium.<br /><br />Then the wabbit is quiet.  Vewy vewy quiet.<br /><br />Huhuhuhuhuhu!
