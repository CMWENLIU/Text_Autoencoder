I highly recommend ALL Wellness products!! My Shih Tzu's were plaqued with severe allergy problems,, Spent $$$$ after $$$$ at vet for relief for them, nothing seemed to work.. I did extensive research on dog food and found out the mainstream brands are all crap, nothing but by products, additives, nothing natural about any of them.. Did research on Wellness and Blue Buffalo, look them up, you will find out for yourself.. Their products are all natural, no additives, no preservatives, 100% meat from animals that are NOT fed growth hormones, etc.. My dogs have been on this food, both wet and dry and they are thriving and the picture of health, bright eyes, shiny coats, full of energy and NO MORE allergies..
