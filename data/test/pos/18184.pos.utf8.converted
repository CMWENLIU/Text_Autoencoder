I've been studying up on how to make the perfect popcorn for quite some time now, and the very best advice I got was right here on Amazon!  Lots of "popcorn people" here, many of whom revealed their secrets.  I bought the threesome recommended by Amazon: Paragon Coconut Oil, Paragon Popcorn, and Flavacol.  With Super-Saver shipping, it's a deal that can't be beat.<br /><br />After reading the instructions on all 3 ingredients and the reviews published herein, I settled on the following recipe: 1/4 cup of coconut oil, 3/4 cup of popping corn, and 1 teaspoon of Flavacol.  I heated up the oil, added the popcorn, then added the Flavacol while the stirrer was churning.  I kept my fingers crossed and waited.  All of a sudden, all hell broke loose and the popcorn commenced to popping.  Much faster than that Orville Redenbacker crap---this was like a machine gun going off!  Very few unpopped kernels compared to brands I've purchased in the supermarket.  This is the real deal, folks.  My house smells like the lobby of a movie theatre!<br /><br />After a squirt of butter, I chowed down on the best popcorn I've ever eaten!  Seriously.  Buying the ingredients in these quantities saved a bunch of money compared to the supermarket, and I have enough to last for a very long time.<br /><br />I'd advice folks to buy a few Tupperware re-useable cereal containers to store the bulk popcorn, as the bag cannot be resealed; and I'm also looking into getting some smaller jars for more convenient storage and use of the coconut oil.<br /><br />Thanks to all who contributed their advice to this "forum" of sorts!
