I am only just ordering this product, but today 9/13/2012 - an article I just received begins with the following data:<br /><br />"Soursop is a flowering, evergreen tree native to tropical regions of the world. It also contains a long, prickly green fruit which happens to kill cancer up to 10,000 times more effectively than strong chemotherapy drugs, all without the nasty side effects and without harming healthy cells."<br /><br />also in the article:  "Besides being a cancer remedy, graviola is a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent for both bacterial and fungal infections, is effective against internal parasites and worms, lowers high blood pressure and is used for depression, stress and nervous disorders."<br /><br />It is called soursop in the U.S., graviola in some countries, and in Spanish guanabana.<br /><br />Memorial Sloan-Kettering has much data on their website.
