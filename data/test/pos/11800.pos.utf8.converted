I have used a whole variety of linguine over time.  But this is one of the better exemplars.  9 minutes and al dente.  Great!<br /><br />I married into an Italian family and have been entrusted with preparing the family "gravy" recipe most Sundays. A little spaghetti sauce, a little marinara sauce, tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, garlic, Italian seasoning, a bit of red wine. Fry up meatballs or pork and add them to the mix. Blend all ingedients together, cook over very low heat for a while.<br /><br />Then, serve the "gravy" over the Barilla linguine.  Yummy! And, better still, you can use this for one or more dinners during the week! Barilla is well worth looking at if you want some good pasta!
