Rich, Creamy, Delicious!<br />The taste and texture is irresistable. Read my review on the almond chocolate version, which this item is quite similar to. Except, I have to say this one is even richer and a favorite.<br /><br />PROS: Healthy, Low sodium, Vegan, Gluten free, Vitamins, doesn't have to be refrigerated, portable as juice box size, dangerously delicious. And amazon.com seems again to have the best price on this with free s&h for $25+ orders. The peel tab comes off so easily, even better than the almond version.<br /><br />CONS: If you have (i.e. kidney failure) restrictions, it has more protein than the almond version (which has 1g), and this one has 2g, though is still on the low side.<br /><br />Drink with delight!
