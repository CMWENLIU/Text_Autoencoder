I'm not much of a pancake person - I like them and eat them occasionally in restaurants, but hadn't made any in about 15 years.  I got this mix as a gift.  These are easily the best pancakes I've ever had.  They are light, fluffy, full of flavor, and absolutely delicious!  I think the malt and vanilla flavoring are what makes them so good.  I looked in the grocery stores to see what ingredients other mixes had, and was unable to find any that didn't contain soy flour! I am concerned about the amount of soy that is added to everything now. This mix has no soy.  I ordered 4 more containers of this mix, along with Stonewall Kitchen raspberry syrup (also to die for) and now I make pancakes about every other weekend.  If you like pancakes, you must try this mix!
