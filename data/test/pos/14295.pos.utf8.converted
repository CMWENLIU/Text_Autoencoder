This is the best stuff ever! My attempts at sushi rice at home failed, never sticky, not seasoned right, etc.. This takes that step out, and with the just a few more things (california rolls-avacado,cucumber, crab) you have perfect sushi. The nori is also cut-up into easy to manage strips. The only thing that I thought was included, or at least should be, is a little spoon or paddle to scoop the rice.
