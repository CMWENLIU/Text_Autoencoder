This item is permanently on my grocery list, because an inexpensive caviar is an invaluable component to a healthy diet.  Caviar is likely the best source of healthful Omega 3 fatty acids on the planet.  Animal experiments have shown that this is sufficient to offset the cholesterol.  A single serving of caviar will get you _half_ of your B12 for the day, and that is not all.  Think of it, dripping with DHA, and half your B12 in one heaping teaspoonful, without killing a single fish.  I have written an Amazon guide about this.<br /><br />I have additional notes about the ingredients in the customer image section where I provide a blowup of the ingredients label.  It is true that some of the inexpensive lumpfish caviars have alot of food coloring, and this one is no exception.  After a careful evaluation, Blue number 1 is among the safest of the food colorings.  It is eliminated relatively fast, and may actually have some healthful benefits.  This caviar has far more Blue number 1 than the other colorings.  It actually detracts from the taste somewhat, but for the price, I give it an A+.<br /><br />I have some additional information and research in my seafood wishlist, so check that out.  These inexpensive caviars tend to store better than the others, so you can keep some in the pantry.  Lumpfish eggs are delicious, so go ahead, eat your caviar... with a little cheese and pepper.<br /><br />Regards,<br />proclus<br />[...]
