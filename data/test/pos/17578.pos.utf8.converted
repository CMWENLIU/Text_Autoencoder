Ever since I decided to start eating better I've been searching for foods like this.  Bulgur is a good, low fat source of protein and fiber.  It makes an excellent, healthier replacement of rice.<br /><br />I've mostly been using it as a filler in recipes that call for rice so far but it also works pretty well by itself as a hot cereal.<br /><br />If you use a lot of rice, or are just looking for a good replacement for higher fat sources of protein like a lot of meats you should definitely give this stuff a shot.
