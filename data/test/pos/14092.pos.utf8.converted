These buns are spectacular, and I feel sorry for anyone who just rips the package open, slaps a hot dog in, and takes a bite. To be edible, they *must* be heated in the microwave until they're hot to the touch. Be careful not to burn yourself, but if you don't heat them enough, they're very dry and unsatisfying.<br /><br />It can also help to get a tiny bit of moisture into the microwave with them. I usually heat mine on a plate I've splashed with a tiny bit of water. Or sometimes I'll try flicking just a bit of water onto the buns themselves before heating (you can easily overdo it).<br /><br />Done properly, they're awfully close to the real thing. Which is an amazing treat if you can't have gluten.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />I've found that if you *really* want these to turn out well, steaming them is the way to go. My current favorite approach is to put a layer of water in a big pan, put the hot dogs in the water, stick a steaming insert above the water, put the buns in the insert, and then simmer everything for about ten minutes. The buns can get a bit *too* damp on the outside, but they'll be soft and tasty. Play around with it, experiment a bit, and you should be able to find the softness/moistness balance which makes you happy.
