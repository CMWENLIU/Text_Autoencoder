I got what I was expecting; a one pound bag of chocolatey covered goodness. The shipping is as much as the product which kinda sucks but hopefully these will last me awhile so the 15 odd bucks will have been worth it. You could probably find the same thing in a store, but if you're too lazy to find a place that sell chocolate covered coffee beans, these will do.
