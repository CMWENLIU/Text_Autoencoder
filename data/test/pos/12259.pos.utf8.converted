Tree of Life -- Black Cherry Concentrate is a great product for joint health. I drink it regularly mixed with water and no sweetener of any kind. It reduces the stiffness and pain common to arthritis and has replaced my reliance on anti-inflammatory drugs. (I no longer use them because of the side effects and because they are hard on kidneys.) I also use fresh berries and tumeric, but a concentrate is handy to have when fresh berries are unavailable. I buy mine in bulk from Amazon.com. I heartily recommend this product to you if you need joint relief and want to take something natural and healthy.
