These gummies are the most delicious I have tasted. Compared to their American counterparts, these are practically the real fruit. Their flavor is fresh and bright, and they taste just like the real thing, but with that fun gummy texture.<br /><br />Kiwi is one of my favorites because, unlike many other candies, this flavor is subtle and not obnoxiously sweet. The seeds add a fun little crunch, and the hint of tanginess makes it taste more like the real fruit...though it could be tangier. They go fast because they are so good--I definitely recommend them!
