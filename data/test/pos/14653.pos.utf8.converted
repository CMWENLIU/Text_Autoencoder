I have a box of Milk Bone flavor snacks, a box of Beneful Baked Delights and one of Raw Boost Bites, lets see how they stack up with the first few ingredients.<br /><br />Milk Bone: Wheat flour, wheat bran, wheat and bone meal, poultry by-products, beef fat, wheat germ, salt---and then a list of ingredients that no one can pronounce.<br /><br />Beneful: Wheat flour, ground corn, glycerin, sugar, corn gluten, water, chicken by-product, preserved animal fat----and then to the food color dye etc...<br /><br />Raw Boost:  Chicken, turkey, turkey liver, turkey heart, pumpkin seed, apples, carrots, butternut squash, flax-seed, montmorillonite clay, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, dried kelp, vinegar, parsley, salmon oil, citric acid, rosemary, blueberries etc.  No food color, preservatives that are difficult to pronounce.  They are made by a small company in NE that obviously care about the health of our pets.<br /><br />Another interesting comparison is the amount moisture and protein.  Milk Bone: 12% moisture, 15% protein.<br />  Beneful: 20% moisture, 14% protein.<br />  Raw Boost:  4% moisture 40% protein.<br /><br />Rather interesting I thought, we usually don't have time to check out what's in our pets food at the store, always in a hurry.  I just thought you might like look at this too.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the treats!  We have two min. schnauzers who always love their "goodies"----and they are rather picky about their food.  The Raw Boost Bites passed with flying colors, so I (with tongue in cheek) think these are the ones that picky pets would choose.<br /><br />Would recommend this product to any pet lover.
