I bake dozens and dozens of cookies throughout the year, with a huge chunk of that happening at Christmastime.  I recently bought--for the first time--a package of the Betty Crocker Sugar Cookie mix.  Well, I discovered a gold mine!  I compared the ease of adding just a couple of ingredients the package mix, to all that I would have to do, to make up a batch of basic sugar cookies, and realized that I was working just too hard!  From there, I made two different recipes from this wonderful mix.  First, for Orange Cookies, I added a heaping tablespoon of orange zest, 1 1/2 tsp. of orange extract, and 1 cup of Rice Crispies.  I then made 1" balls of dough and rolled them in orange-colored sugar.  They turned out just great!  For the next recipe--Coconut Cookies--I added 1 cup of shredded coconut and 1 1/2 tsp. of coconut extract, and--voila!--another fantastic recipe.  Both, of course, were made from the Betty Crocker mix, and I challenge anyone to tell me that they could tell the difference between this mix and "from scratch" cookies.  I'm now thinking of more ways to embellish my new favorite cookie dough.  The possibilities are endless!
