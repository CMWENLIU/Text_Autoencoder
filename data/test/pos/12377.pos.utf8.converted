I really hope they start selling this here again.  I am a chef and food writer, and this is the best cooking/seasoning oil I have ever used.  It's comparatively quite inexpensive, but made with Canola and Olive oil, and the roasted garlic scent and flavor is wonderfully full and natural.  I bought about 8 bottles, and I'm just about out, so I will miss this if they don't bring it back here!
