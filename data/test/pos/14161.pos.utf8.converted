I always recommend you buy one pack first before you buy multiple packs.  The crackle bred is very very light and crispy.  I found it. Is a great alternative to the heavier gf bread and holds it's form when compared with rice cakes.  As many newbie gf knows, you end up making many costly mistakes before you find the 'one'.  I prefer the multigrain as it primarily uses brown rice and everything tastes good on it from deli meat, cheese, smoked salmon, peanut butter.  I have been eating this for weeks and I am not tired of it like i have with some of the other gf bread/rice cakes.  I wish amazon does a 6-pack as the only one with gluten sensitive in the family, it is alot in one delivery even though this has an expiry date greater than 6 months.
