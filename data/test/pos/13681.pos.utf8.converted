I've been buying these San Marzano style tomatoes for at least ten years now.  The can (I've got one in front of me as I'm writing) actually gives no information at all on where they come from, so I don't know on what basis one reviewer claims they are grown in California.  (Also, the picture on the label is a not a photograph, but a stylized drawing of a tomato, and I think the contents do in fact look like the picture.)  It would be nice if they were more up front about the provenance of the product, but...<br /><br />But all that's really irrelevant.  I've tried a dozen canned versions of San Marzano tomatoes, mostly pricier and actually imported from the San Marzano region outside of Naples, and these are the tastiest:  sharp, tart, depth of flavor, and very meaty.  Individual tastes will vary, but if you put olive oil in a pan, cook some garlic, and simmer these bad boys for about 30 minutes, you'll have an amazing sauce, especially with a basil leaf or two.  For that matter, these are as good as the tomatoes I've had actually in Naples, so I'm really not going to complain about where they are grown.<br /><br />Lastly, the crushed variety of these--which admits openly on the label that the tomatoes are grown domestically--is even better, producing amazing pasta sauces, pizza sauce, and the like.  Amazon should carry that as well.
