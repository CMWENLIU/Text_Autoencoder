This is a MEGA jar of treats that doesn't disappoint!!  The container sits on a work desk and BEGS for an invitation from passers-by to try one...little do they know what a EXPLOSIVE burst of SOUR to expect before the candy mellows out to the 'sweet' stage. Wish we had a auto-video-cam setup to catch all the facial expressions! This benign looking candy jar has provided a ton of laughter and funny stories.  MUCH MORE FUN than a water cooler--ha!!
