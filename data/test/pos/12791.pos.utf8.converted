I have used this in both cakes and cookies so far and they have turned out wonderfully! It's great to have a product available that allows a person unable to consume wheat/gluten to still be able to have some tasty treats occasionally; plus the finished product turns out virtually the same as with wheat flour, so you don't have to make 2 versions, one for you and one for your family! When I was diagnosed with celiac sprue, I thought I would never be able to eat another piece of cake, etc. again. I had no idea that "The Gluten-Free Pantry" even existed.....now I count on it!!
