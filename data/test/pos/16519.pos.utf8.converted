One of my cats has had digestive troubles since I got him and wasn't doing well on the food I was giving him. I tried many of the other premium wet foods, but he wouldn't touch them. I read about this Natural Balance formula with venison and green peas and decided to give it a try. Well, my cat loves it and it has really made an improvement in his health. My other cat who is an extremely picky eater tried this and liked it too. I plan to continue buying this product for both of my boys. I like the natural ingredients and the fact that it's a great alternative for cats with sensitive stomach or food allergies.
