I have 6 cats and it is difficult finding a high quality food that they will all finish!  Finish is the key word here..there is absolutely no waste with Stella and Chewey's..All of the problems associated with canned food ..non-existent..no 1/2 cans of refrigerated leftovers gone to waste..I have tried EVERYTHING to give my animals the best possible diet..including making up raw diets for them myself.  this food is the perfect answer for us.
