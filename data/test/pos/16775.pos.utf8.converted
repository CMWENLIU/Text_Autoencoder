For health reasons, our family has searched for an adequate sugar substitute. Over the years we have tried them all and found each product wanting - until we found Ideal.<br /><br />This sweetener has the taste and texture of sugar without any of the issues surrounding other sugar substitutes. It avoids the question of health risks attributed to aspartame. It does not have the 'grassy' taste of Stevia; the 'cold' sensation of erythritol; or, what we find to be, the after-taste of Splenda.<br /><br />For baking, it is unparalleled. Even our friends who eat sugar cannot tell that we use Ideal. We bake custards and crustless cheesecakes with Ideal and no one knows that they are sugar free. We use it in confections such as fudge and chocolate truffles with exceptional results.<br /><br />Like many other sugar alternatives, Ideal will not caramelize. This is not a fault of the product but rather a chemical dynamic of sugar alcohol based sweeteners. However, this seems is a small price to pay for a sweetener that is otherwise indistinguishable from sugar.<br /><br />Whether you choose to use the brown sugar substitute (which does not have the actual sugar found in Splenda's brown sugar blend) or the white sweetener, we are sure that you will find Ideal a wonderful alternative to sugar. We recommend it to our friends who are diabetic or who are looking to cut out sugar for other reasons. They all agree that it is the best tasting alternative to sugar on the market today.
