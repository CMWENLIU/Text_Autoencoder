This is my favorite brand of Thai red curry paste.  We use it to make thai curry at home, because it's soooo simple to make.  Chop 1 onion into chunks, heat up 2 tbsp. of canola oil in a wok or dutch oven, toss in the onions and stir for a minute or so until translucent.  Take 1 tbsp of Mae Ploy red curry paste for a mild curry (use 3 tbsp. if you enjoy spicy foods like jalapenos) and stir into the onions, stir and heat for a minute, then pour in half a can of coconut milk, stir again, and turn heat to medium, toss in 1 lb. of cubed meat (beef or chicken or pork or duck), 2 lime leaves, a few dashes of fish sauce, stir to mix well. Turn heat down to simmer for 15 minutes, add chopped bell pepper strips, bamboo shoots and 2 handfuls of fresh basil, simmer for another 10 minutes. Pour in the remaining half of coconut milk, stir to mix well, then turn off heat immediately. Remove the lime leaves. Serve with steamed rice.<br /><br />The other reason we love Mae Ploy brand so much is because it's the only brand available here locally that has NO MSG, NO PRESERVATIVES. Thank GOD for Mae Ploy !!!
