If you are not aware of Pearls, then you are in for your first surprise as I was.  This tea is strong and pungent with Jasmine flavor and the second steeping is just as good as the first.  While the level of flavonoid antioxidant is not stated, the effect is quite pronounced. This Tea is clearly superior to all domestic, English and Chinese Jasmines which I have had over my 55 years of Tea drinking experience.
