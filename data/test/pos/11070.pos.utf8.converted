Very tasty. If I am not feeling well, I have some quinoa and then I feel better. It is very gentle on my stomach and soothing. It is so full of vitamins and gluten-free. It is so natural.<br /><br />I eat it in a bowl with milk and sugar, or plain as a side-dish. I also add it to meatloaf instead of the bread crumbs.<br /><br />To rinse it-I line a collander (strainer) with a kitchen towel, measure 1 cup of quinoa into it, let water run over it until the collander is half full, and then swish my hand around the quinoa. I let the water drain out of the collander and then repeat the process two more times. After it has drained for the final time, I let the quinoa fall out of the towel into the pot I am going to cook it in. I brush the quinoa that doesn't come out with my hand. (I do all this in the sink so it doesn't get all over.)<br /><br />Then I add the water (for the recipe) to the pot, add a little butter and salt, let it boil, and then turn the heat down to low for 15 minutes-or until most of the water is gone.<br /><br />YUMMY!!
