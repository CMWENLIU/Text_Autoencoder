I am Canadian that moved to the US when I got married 11 years ago..I do whatever I can to transport the Canadian chocolate from home to me here in Ohio. I will tell you that is what I miss the most...although not having it handy every day might be a good thing eh?? LOL Aero is one of my favorites..you can NOT go wrong with this chocolate bar. :)
