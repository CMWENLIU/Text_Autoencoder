I was buying these at my local health store for almost $5 a bag. I had not looked for food on Amazon until recently and found the same dried plums for $3 a bag.<br /><br />I have been through 3 bags so far and I will be ordering more soon as they are the same product I was getting for more money.<br /><br />If you have not had any "Made in Nature" products I highly recommend them to anyone who enjoys real dried fruits.<br />This are tree ripened so there is a variation in each fruit. I love that about this particular maker: the diversity of the fruit. It is what real dried fruit should taste like.<br />I would also suggest this makers dried figs.<br /> One word: excellent.<br />These are the best darned dried plums I have ever had.<br />Buy them now and thank me later.
