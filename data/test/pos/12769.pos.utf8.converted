We've been drinking Millstone French Vanilla ground coffee every morning for a couple of years now. It's a very pleasant mellow tasting morning treat. It has none of the bitter/burned taste that some of the other "Gourmet" coffees have.<br /><br />Obviously, my wife and I like it very much. We were dismayed following Katrina when it became hard to find due to Millstone being located in New Orleans. I was pleased to find it at a reasonable price here via Amazon.<br /><br />We brew our coffee in a Bunn-O-Matic coffee maker because its controlled lower temperature drip brewing is much preferred over the more conventional percolated type of brewer where the brewing water temperature is essentially boiling. The Bunn keeps its water reservoir at 197 degrees which makes a surprising difference in the oils that are extracted from the grind. It definitely reduces bitterness.
