Many 'health foods' are controversial, do they really improve your health? Not oatbran. All doctors and medical tests have shown oatbran reduces 'bad' types of cholesterol. You have to eat lots of it, a half cup a day some studies show.<br /><br />The easiest method is switching to homemade bread. Pure oatbran is not a good flour because it will not 'raise' nearly as much as say white wheat flour. The reasonable method to use it is to substitute oat bran cereal for other flours directly, volume per volume. We have done this for years at our house in all bread recipes. We use 1/2 oatbran and 1/2 white flour. For odd number amounts we use the extra number of oatbran (example: 5 cups of flour called for in recipe, we use 2 cups white 3 cups oatbran cereal).<br /><br />Bread takes time and kneading so our homemade bread is really biscuits. We use store-bought bread for sandwiches and homemade biscuits for everything else.<br /><br />=======================<br />Offtopic bonus:<br /><br />Here is our daily recipe for 6 biscuits made in toaster oven in 6 cup pan.<br /><br />1/2 cup white flour<br />3/4 cup oatbran cereal<br />1/2 teaspoon sugar<br />1/8 teaspoon salt<br />2 teaspoons baking powder<br />3 ounces milk<br />1 egg<br />1 tablespoon cooking oil<br />some spray-on non stick oil<br /><br />spray pan cups with spray-on oil<br />bake 20 minutes 425 degrees.<br /><br />chopped nuts, vanilla flavoring, nutmeg, cinnamon etc<br />can be used to flavor.<br /><br />salt, sugar substitutes can be used (healthier?)<br /><br />2 eggwhites instead of 1 whole egg can be used (healthier).<br /><br />Powder milk and egg powder allows storage out of a refrigerator and for camping trips.<br /><br />PAM is too thin to stick to cup sides,<br />all other brands spray-on oil tried are<br />thicker and sticks very well.
