These are individually wrapped and there are approximately 15 cookies in each box. They have a nice flavor and are fresh and crispy. The fortunes are standard fortune cookie fare. Very few of these were broken during shipping. I definitely recommend these if you like fortune cookies. They are a low-calorie, low-fat snack. Yummy!
