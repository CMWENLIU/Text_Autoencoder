I have tried a few times, unsuccessfully I might add, to make bread by hand using the little store bought packages. They just never turned out. Well while 'window shopping' on Amazon one night, I came across this product. So I figured "What the heck, I will give it one more try, since it is a good price" Figured if I still could not get it right, then I would give it to my dad lol. Well I made a simple yeast bread loaf, from scratch, by hand, using the Le Saffre SAF yeast. IT TURNED OUT PERFECT!!! It rose in half the time, and it was just amazing! I am so proud of myself lol. Since the ONLY thing different in my recipe and technique was the type of yeast, I have to say this yeast made ALL the difference! I can not wait to make more! I highly recommend this product!!!
