I bought this because I wanted to keep tomatos in stock, all our summer tomatoes are gone, lycopene and I am boycotting Heinz.  12 tubes of this takes up as much room as one jar of Prego tomato sauce.<br /><br />And Dr. Gourmet says:<br /><br /> The USDA and FDA use a test known as the "Howard Mold Count" to determine the amount of mold in products that you purchase. There are regulations about the acceptable levels of mold in certain foods. The minute you open that can of tomato paste any mold that is in the can can grow with the exposure to oxygen. The longer it is in the fridge the more chance of mold growing. Most of the molds are benign and not likely to hurt you, but they will taint the flavor of the tomato paste.
