I have been drinking coconut water regularly for the last six months or so. I tested pretty much every brand out there and found that Zico has the best product available. The water is fresh and free of any weird additives.  The container used by Zico is solid and fits perfectly in any refrigerator.<br />I recommend this product to anyone who want to enjoy the health benefits of coconut water.
