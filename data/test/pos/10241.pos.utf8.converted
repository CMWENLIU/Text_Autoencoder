This pina colada is the first Lt. Blender's product that I've tried, but it won't be the last!  I love the concept of the freezable pouch.  In the past, there have been times where I have wanted a frozen drink but did not feel like going through the process of shaving ice, cleaning out the blender, etc.  Now this is no longer an issue.  I can freeze it in advance and take it to parties, or I can keep the whole pouch for myself and have a drink ready anytime I want.  Not to mention that the results are always consistent, unlike blender versions where your results may vary unless you measure every time.<br /><br />These drinks are best consumed soon after freezing.  I left my pouch in the freezer, and it was nice and slushy the first day, but on the 2nd day it was considerably more solid.  This was easily remedied by running warm water on the outside of the bag for a couple of minutes.  But don't try to manually break up the frozen product, as I initially tried to do.  I ended up making a tiny hole near the top of the pouch.<br /><br />Note: I did use 2 cups of rum rather than the 1.5 cups that was suggested.  I also used coconut rum and added 1/2 cup of pineapple juice to my bag (substitute for some water, not added to the water).  The end result tasted as good as a drink made from fresh pineapple and real cream.  It was very tasty and I look forward to trying some of the other flavors.  I'm glad Amazon has them in stock with free shipping.  This is the best price I have found online.
