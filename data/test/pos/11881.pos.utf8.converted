The 12" size takes my 5 month lab up to a week to work through. She did just get all of her permanent teeth in, so maybe that time will speed up given some months. Yes, they do have a bit of a smell, but it's more like I get an occasional whiff when she's chewing on it.  If the chew is just lying around, I don't smell anything.  They haven't left any stains on my carpets, and she hasn't lost interest in them.
