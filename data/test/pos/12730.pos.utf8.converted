These are top-quality delicious sardines.  As brisling fish from Scotland, they are low in contaminants, such as mercury, and packaged as they are, they are very low in sodium, as well.  I have found them to be excellent in simple sandwiches and in cooking applications and make a wonderful simple snack food to keep on hand.
