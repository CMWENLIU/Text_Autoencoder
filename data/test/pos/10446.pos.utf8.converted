This is the tea of my youth, Friday nights at my best friend's house, brewed up properly in a pot or even just by the mug with a little honey. I like tea that's been steeped a while, and letting this tea sit a bit does not ruin the flavour. The orange highlights are just right and compliment the tea nicely. I can be brought out of the foulest mood by just the scent of the tea brewing in my cup. An excellent tea to have on hand for when you are under the weather, or for those cold winter evenings in front of the fire.
