This isn't exactly scientific, but I consider my sense of taste experienced and particular enough to judge water based on the following criteria:<br />  1. Free of chemical leeching from the plastic bottle.<br />  2. Balanced mineral content (i.e. no excessive fluoride, not to "wet" and not too "dry")<br />  3. No excessive purification agents (i.e. chlorine, etc.)<br /><br />Fiji is, by far, the best I have ever tasted.<br /><br />By the way, at the time of this writing, Amazon is selling the water with FREE delivery to retail consumers for less than the manufacturer is.
