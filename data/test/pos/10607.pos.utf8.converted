I bought 5 individual packages of different types of protein drinks to see which I liked before I committed with a whole container. This was excellent - I mixed it with orange juice and proceeded to play 1 1/2 hours of tennis - singles and not once did I feel hungry. I used a small hand-held frother to make sure it mixed completely so I wouldn't taste any of the unmixed granules. I've since ordered the "whole container"...
