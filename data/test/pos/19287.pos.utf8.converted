If you like BeetleJuice and the supernatural then buy this movie you won't be let down.  This is a very good movie fun for all ages.  See this movie is what started the cartoon series on cartoonnetwork in the early 1990's BeetleJuice.  Personally I think Micheal Keaton did a fantastic job as playing BeetleJuice I just really like this movie alot it talk's about what the after life is like basically see Barbara and Adam Maitland die and their ghost's in the movie and they meet BeetleJuice and I'm not going to tell you the rest because you have to watch the movie trust me this movie is really good it will make you want to say BeetleJuice three times.
