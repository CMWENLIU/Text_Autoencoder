I haved tried Misto twice and also the bertoli oil spray you can find in the supermarket aisle; they all clogged after a short amount of time.  I decided it was the fate of using extra virgin olive oil sprayers, that it turns into a stream of oil instead of a spray.  But these do not clog.  The spray is still a little coarse compared to pam, but still functions well in oiling pans and foods.
