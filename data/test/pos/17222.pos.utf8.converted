If you are practicing any type of low carb diet (keto, atkins, etc), this is THE perfect milk substitute.<br /><br />This is higher in fat than unsweetened almond milk, with a lower carbohydrate profile (if I remember correctly, it's 1 gram per serving). Another nice thing about this product, is that they are generous with their labled serving sizes. The label says 4 servings per box but I get about 6.<br /><br />Since it's coconut based, it is packed with medium-chain fatty acids and has a sweet tropical taste. Also can be stored without refrigeration until opened.<br /><br />I personally prefer this over all other milk substitutes.<br /><br />The per unit price seems a bit high considering you have to buy 12 at once, but very few stores carry the unsweetened variety (which is crucial to keto'ers) so I guess it's a supply/demand thing.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
