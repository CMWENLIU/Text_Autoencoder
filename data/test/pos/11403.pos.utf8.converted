Not only does this taste fantastic, but look at the product highlights:<br /><br />"High in potassium, fat free, cholesterol free, and low in acidity, no sugar. Contains five essential electrolytes--potassium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, and phosphorous. It contains similar levels of electrolytes as those found in human blood. Help promote smoother, more hydrated skin. It is an effective oral rehydration medium, and keeps the body cool."<br /><br />All I know is it taste great, so whenever I want to day dream I am in Oahu on the beach, crack open one of these, shut my office door and have my 5 minute zen.<br /><br />Remember on the movie 'The Collateral' when Jamie Foxx would get his zen by looking at the picture of the island. (This is my zen)
