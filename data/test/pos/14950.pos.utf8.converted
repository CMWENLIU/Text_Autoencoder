I recently had surgery to remove a dead vain in my lower right leg that caused a ulcer. A friend of mine recommended manuka honey, saying it helps keep the skin moist (which in my case would promote skin growth), among other things. I searched here on Amazon, and found this Wedderspoon Organic Manuka Honey. I had sticker shock when I saw the price, but after I read all the positive reviews about it I purchased it. I applied it to my ulcer everyday, for three weeks after my surgery and my ulcer was completely healed. **** Note I am a 25 yr old, non- smoker, so if you're older, or a smoker it might not work quite as well. However, based on my experience with it, I recommend manuka honey to help with hard to heal leg ulcers.
