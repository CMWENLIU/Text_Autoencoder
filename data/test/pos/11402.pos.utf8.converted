Like a few of the people who wrote a review I was born and raised on a carribbean island... Barbabdos to be exact. When I came here I tried to find coconut water that actually,.. was coconut water and guess what , One coconut water is exactly that.<br />It taste like the young fresh coconut water that it clams to be from ... loook at the ingrediants no additives just coconut water. There is a difference between young coconuts and more aged coconuts. The older ones are much sweeter :) but the young ones are more refreshing and much healthier.<br />So if you dont know what you talking about..its not right to leave a negative review, because to really know the difference between coconuts you actually would have to taste the orginal product cut fresh and drink it out the nut.<br />One... Thanks.. I always crave coconut water during pregancy because there is nothing better than young cocnut water to keep a mother and her baby healthy and you have given me something wonderfull.
