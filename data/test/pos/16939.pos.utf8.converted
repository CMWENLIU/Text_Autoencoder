My son has food allergies and he loves the Vegan products. Their cheese slizes actually melt and make great grill cheese. I am not a soy fan but even i like the Vegan Parmesan. I use it to make chicken Parmesan, meatballs,  and all the italian favs that need cheese in them. I have even used it to make alfredo. It is a little grainy for alfredo but he still loved the flavor of it! OUr store has stopped carring it i was thrilled to find it on Amazon.
