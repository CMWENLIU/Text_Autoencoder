My family loves bourbon chicken sold at shopping mall food courts, but it's really difficult to reproduce the same flavor at home. I searched the internet for the recipes, and most of them were not even close. So when I found this product I thought I would just give it a try. Well, I'm glad I did! Just dip the sauce on the grilled meat (not limited to chicken) and you're good to go. The time and hassle saved can be well spent with my family; how great can it be?<br /><br />This company's website, [...], provides some variations of the bourbon chicken recipe. If you love cooking as much as I do, do check them out!
