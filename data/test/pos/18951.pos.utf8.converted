My favourite tea for the workday is Yorkshire Gold.  The leaves are cut into small pieces to brew quickly.  The taste is consistent box after box.  I drink it from lunch onward.  It has just the right amount of caffeine to keep me going without being wired.  We are provided free tea bags which I pass up for my own Yorkshire Gold.  Thank you Taylors of Harrowgate for this fine tea!
