This is the heartiest of the Eden Miso packets and it does have a very good flavor along with great lasting quality (it took me over a year to use up 3 packs). People tend to make the mistake of thinking that because Miso is soy based it will be salty when mixed with liquid but this is less often the case. You can add soy sauce or Tamari for salt purpose, Miso is just the base. I saw a review that panned this Eden Shiro Miso, Organic Rice & Soybean, 12.1-Ounce Packages (Pack of 3) but Miso and Rice are about the most bland combination you can start with and must be seasoned to taste. That's why I start with this Barley mix, it has a more robust flavor to begin with but making Miso is about finding the base flavor that you like beyond the seasoning which comes later (some might prefer a thinner rice base). So in sum this Miso Barley has a strong flavor, holds up well to just about any use including thicker sauces and can provide a lot of base when mixed into soup.
