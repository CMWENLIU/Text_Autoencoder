I have used this mix for over a year and have probably made it at least a dozen times.  It's all-natural and very easy...just add your own potatoes, chicken broth, heavy cream, and chicken.  It tastes great, and I always get compliments on it and people asking for the recipe.  If you buy the 4-pack, you will use the 4-pack...it's that good.
