Many people assume that grade B syrup is somehow or other lower quality than grade A. That's true for most foods, but not for maple syrup.<br /><br />I've had grade B's that were only good for baking or cooking, but this one straddles the fine line between 'strong enough' for baking and 'mild enough' for pancakes.<br /><br />Watch for sales, I ended up getting this for about $15.99 with Subscribe and Save and a discount offer, definitely the best deal around for 32 oz of maple syrup.
