I drive over an hour through open deserted desert and across state lines to get a few cans of this, and glad to do it, in an old truck liable to shut down way out in the middle of the vultures and rattlers where nobody goes but the Border Patrol.<br /><br />Now I find I can get right here through the joy and convenience of the amazon!<br /><br />A can of this drained with a box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZ86K">Mori-Nu Tofu, Silken Style, Extra Firm, 12.3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> and some chopped celery and fresh squeezed lime and chopped onion and cilantro and maybe crushed garlic and maybe fresh jalapeno without the seeds and maybe fresh tomato from the garden and maybe you start to get something to sit down with.<br /><br />Or just right out of the can (drained)<br />maybe with chopped celery and cilantro<br />and maybe . . .<br /><br />the great hting here is they use the highest quality chick peas (garbanzo beans) and like, no salt, or very low salt.<br /><br />I never could figure out how to soak the dry beans to get them this good. So until I figure out how to grow my own, this is as good as it gets!<br /><br />And thanks to amazon I won't have to risk my old truck across that desert to town anymore.<br /><br />One can of this and you have a meal for a day, or two!
