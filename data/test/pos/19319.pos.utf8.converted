My son surprised me with a can of the berry Mellow Mood the other day.  I read through the ingredients list and liked what I saw.  It is a natural product.  Period.  Then understanding exactly what those ingredients do to a body, I waited until about an hour or so before bedtime before I tried it.  In a word the effect is *amazing.* I was definitely mellowed out!  Not drowsy or out of it; simply mellow.<br /><br />The taste was very enjoyable. The flavor of the berry reminded me of the sorrel drinks I'd had while visiting Jamaica. Although carbonated, it was only slightly so.  Nothing like soda pop, just a little gas to give it some zing.<br /><br />Words of caution: Do NOT drink this before operating a vehicle or heavy machinery.  I would not recommend drinking this if you need to focus on anything like your JOB.<br /><br />Have a drink, watch some tube, listen to some music, or simply just chill out. That said, expect to relax to the max and not feel sorry for it in the morning!<br /><br />Irie and one love!
