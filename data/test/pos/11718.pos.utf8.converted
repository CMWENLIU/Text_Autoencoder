I use this whey protein concentrate mostly for fruit smoothies.  It not only adds protein but creates a milkshake-like frothiness in the smoothie which I love.  Whey protein does not affect the flavor of the drink and I like that it doesn't have sugar or fake sweetener or any of the other undesirable ingredients you find in many of the expensive commercial protein powders.  Highly recommended.
