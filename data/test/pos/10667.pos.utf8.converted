The first time I chewed a piece, the flavor was so harsh that I had to spit it out.  It's caffeinated, so it's a less time-consuming alternative to coffee.  It has a strong minty flavor.  Also, I didn't buy this from amazon but from a local Japanese store instead, since it's $1.39 as oppose to amazon's $7.14.
