After reading about all the health benefits of hempseeds, I went ahead and bought this 5-pound bag of them even though I've never eaten them before (coming from an islander culture, I was always taught to learn about and respect the healing qualities of various foods). Another reviewer here said that these hempseeds taste like raw pine nuts, and I would agree with that. Nutiva's hempseeds are delicious; they taste fresh, and I love their texture: they're soft like pine nuts, small like quinoa or couscous, and mild in flavour with a tiny bit of sweetness. As I type this review, I'm eating them with a spoon; it's good to eat even by itself. I'm very glad I got the 5-pound bag (with repeat delivery every three months), because I will happily incorporate hempseeds into my daily eating habits. I want to pour this over all my meals now; I may finish this big bag before month's end. If you're even a little bit curious if hempseeds are right for you, I'd recommend getting some and trying them out -- you may discover another superfood that you actually like. If not, then at least you had the experience of tasting something different.
