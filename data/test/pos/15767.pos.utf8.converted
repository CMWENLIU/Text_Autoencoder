For 28 years I have told my husband about being a little girl where every Christmas I was looking forward to going to my Grandma's home in PA where she had these great bubble lights on her tree and this Danish can of Danish cookies, that I loved (No, she was not Danish but had great taste!.) My husband being of Scandinavian American ancestry, never had these great cookies? I have come across them in the past, but they were not the real thing from Denmark.<br /><br />He surprised me on my Birthday, with the REAL DANISH cookies, although they did arrive AFTER my birthday, they were just as I remembered them and a lot of cookies! LOL.  Being a child, I used to dunk them also in hot chocolate, therefore, being an adult, I tried them with coffee.<br />EVEN BETTER!  They are also terrific for Tea Time (for herbal tea drinkers).<br /><br />The only thing negative I can say is they are addicting because they are delicious (as they may be butter cookies but they are light) and there are a lot of them!  So I am offering samples to friends and neighbors.  Otherwise, I could eat them all in about 4 weeks as they are that YUMMY!  Not a SOFT cookie, a hard cookie with a lot of flavor and light (nut buttery tasting).  Simply terrific.
