Most of the time when I don't have a free minute to spare on going out to buy food, I microwave up one of these. They're delicious, healthy and easy/quick to prepare. Plus they're cheaper than going to a Japanese restaurant and having udon there. I eat these relatively often so I've solved most of the problems people had with the cooking process.<br /><br />I've found that the vegetables rehydrate best if you stick them under the loosened noodles and then fill the bowl up with water (just trap the vegetable square under the noodles). This solves the problem of the gritty tofu as well - mine always come out soft and chewy with that method. Also, if possible, microwave the noodle bowl instead of using boiling water. The noodles come out much softer and the miso paste dissolves easier if they're cooked in the microwave for the 2 minutes.<br /><br />I hope this helps the upset reviewers below. I have these at least once a week and they've become a rather delightful staple to my diet.
