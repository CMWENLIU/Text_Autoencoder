Cinnabon Cereal is the most delectable item of consumable goods I've ever had the joy of masticating, let alone digesting! Every sickeningly sweet morsel is like a tiny bit of heaven for my taste buds, and now that they've been bathed in its cinnamon goodness, they can enjoy no other brand equally. My wife and I have started substituting `meals' for `rounds' of Cinnabon brand cereal. I mean, we could quit at any time but why would we? It's high in fiber!! Fiber is great because it speeds up your movements making room for more Cinnabon Cereal! It's a win-win!
