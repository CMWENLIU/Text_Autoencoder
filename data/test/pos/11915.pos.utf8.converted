Sure it's cruel.  All meat is cruel.<br /><br />Once you've set your moral rage aside, this liver is the finest you can buy without having a local supplier (which is a better option). This package is fully dressed...no veins or ducts...and cooks very well. The taste is precisely what you would expect from one of the finer gourmet suppliers in the world. The fact that it is duck means you're not spending as much and the flavor is right on.<br /><br />If you don't like meat, don't eat things that have to be killed to be eaten. If you do like meat and you love foie gras, then this product is a must-have.
