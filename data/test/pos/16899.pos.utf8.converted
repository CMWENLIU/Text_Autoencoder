I first ran across this while working on a TV show - it was on the craft service (snack) table.  I had tried other flavors before, but this version was new to me--LOVED IT!<br /><br />Easily on-par with what you might find at a local bistro, at a fraction of the price. This flavor is top-notch,and truly takes just 1.5 minutes to make.<br /><br />The sip-cup is quite handy for a quick pick-me-up or lunch, or you can put the heated contents into a mug or bowl, and perhaps add in a grilled cheese sand made on any number of contact grills ( George Foreman, Wolfgang Puck's Pannini grill...) to truly make this a hearty meal, in a matter of minutes. (like, maybe 5-- thats MY kind of cooking!)<br /><br />For reasons unknown, this particular flavor can sometimes be hard to find, both in regular stores or at Amazon. Seems to sell out frequently.  I like the auto-ship from Amazon, rather than buying single cans at the supermarket.<br /><br />It is also kind of a nice product to send along to college kids and seniors, as well - two groups NOT well known to always eat well.  They would appreciate something like this, trust me.  And, yup, it is available on motion picture and television shoot's, with some VERY picky eater's!<br /><br />This is truly a five star item, and one that I will never be without.  Yum!
