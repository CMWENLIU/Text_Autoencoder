I grew up in Kansas City, MO, so Wolferman's English muffins were for a long time a staple in my home.  I've tried a lot of different muffin brands, from cheap store brands (not worth the money) to higher-end commercial brands.  NOTHING beats these Bays muffins!<br /><br />They're not fork split -- they're actually sliced, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  They still have plenty of "nooks and crannies" for the melted butter due to the high-quality yeast they use.  Pop 'em in the toaster, and you'll get a nice crispy exterior and a chewy and flavorful interior.  The flavor is wonderful -- just the right amount of yeastiness, but no "sour" taste.  Great for breakfast with butter and a little marmalade or jam, but they also hold up well under heartier accompaniments or in sandwiches.  The flavor still comes through.<br /><br />I made room in my refrigerator's freezer for these, even giving up some ice cream room!  The sacrifice was worth it.
