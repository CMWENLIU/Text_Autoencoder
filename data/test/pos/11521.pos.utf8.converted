This stuff is great. My family can not tell the difference between this, McCainns and Honeyville Farms. All three taste great. 10 pounds will fill a coffee can sized container and a gallon bag.<br /><br />Bring 3.5 cups water plus pinch of salt in pan to rolling boil. Before you go to bed, add 1 cups oat groats plus two rounded tablespoons pecan meal to the water. Stir. Turn off the burner / remove from heat when it almost foams to the edge. Cover and lit sit on the stove overnight. In the morning, heat individual bowls in the microwave. I add a bit of milk and one tablespoon brown sugar. We prefer our oatmeal thicker than standard porridge and this is more than enough for 4. The thickest I have made it is 3.5 cups water to 1.25 cups oat groats.<br /><br />The pecan meal adds nutty flavor. You can make meal using your blender to process nuts.
