I have previously purchased smaller bags of Bob's Red Mill Potato Flour from specialty health food stores. I was pleased to find this item available in larger 24-ounce bags, and in a lot of 4 bags! I have found that this is a great flour for gluten free baking and cooking. I mix it in a 1:1 ratio with rice flour and substitute the mix for wheat flour in many recipes. I can finally make decent cookies and other items with this flour! Bob's Red Mill products are high quality, and this potato flour was no exception. It arrived fresh, with a great flavor.
