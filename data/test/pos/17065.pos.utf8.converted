I LOVE these things. LOVE them. The flavor is somewhat indescribable, definitely not a traditional "fruit" flavor set, though they are vaguely fruity in general. They are the very firm kind of gummy, definitely not for the weak-jawed. These are without question my favorite gummy candy, and one of my absolute favorite candies over all.
