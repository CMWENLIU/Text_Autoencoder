Lagavulin pronounced "Lahk-a-voolin" is one of 9 Islay distilleries.  There is a long and interesting history regarding the region's scotch whiskey distilleries.  If you're interested in it, give it a Google.<br /><br />To me the Islay whiskeys that I've tried all tend to have a smoky, peaty taste, with a hint of the sea.  But of all of them, Lagavulin is my favorite. If you are a drinker of scotch whiskey I promise you will notice the unique and distinct difference right away.  It's wonderful.  My wife who is NOT a scotch whiskey drinker enjoys Lagavulin 16.<br /><br />Over the last decade or so it's seemed to have gained popularity here in the US, I've noticed a substantial increase in local retail prices which typically range $75-$85 for 750ml.  We've also experienced some supply shortages believe it or not, so the price listed in this ad seems very good.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this whiskey.  Give it a try, you will be glad you did.
