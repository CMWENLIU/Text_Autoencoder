We have been eating hempseeds for sometime - they are an essential part of our diet.  I genuinely notice a difference physically when I eat them along.  This is a good price and we have gotten good quality from Amazon.  PLEASE SHARE SOME WITH YOUR FRIENDS!!<br /><br />We must work together to make this available to the USA INCLUDING the farmers.  We live under an oppressive, authoritarian regime which, only a few years ago, would have attacked you for eating what is literally "birdseed".  Wild!<br /><br />2nd Review w/Suspcription Purchase Method<br />We have been delighted to have hemp seed finally taken off Schedule 1 Controlled Substance (along with heroin, etc.).  I know that is insane to even write this but that is the nature of the degenerate and immoral drug policy barons from the DEA and ONDCP - to twist reality and prohibit what are supposed to be free American citizens from obtaining some of the best food known to mankind beause their pseudo fear of people smoking flowers(and then engaging in violence against these same peaceful, free human beings).  NUTS indeed!!<br /><br />In any event, we have started using the suscription method.  This is a great price compared to anywhere else that I have found.  It actually takes 4 mos for us to go through 5 lbs.  Therefore, I signed up for 2 mos and simply skip one.  I will give very great KUDOS to Amazon for how they have set this up - at least for this product, both the product and the system work great!<br /><br />Greg Logan
