Love these green beans! Good tasting, nice texture. Have flavor without being too salty or too bland. I can eat a whole can in one sitting and they are good for you too. My grandson loves them too and I like that he is eating a wholesome, organic green vegetable. They are simply the best green beans out of a can I have ever eaten. I also enjoy this company's peas and kidney beans. Quality products!
