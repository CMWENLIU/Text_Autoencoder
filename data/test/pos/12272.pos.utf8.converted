Buy this product.  Tell your friends about it.  Unfortunately J&J doesn't have a clue of how to market this great product, don't let it slip out of production. I am in club Benecol and haven't received anything. Spread the word, a safer way to lower your cholesterol. Word of mouth is about it, lets hope it works.<br /><br />Don't expect miracles with Benecol, but if you are borderline, this is a great supplement in addition to diet and exercise. Take at least 2 per day.  Expect ~10% lower total cholesterol in a month or two, some have reported more. Could be enough to keep you off the risky statins.  However, some report using Benecol and Statins, but I can't vouch for the results. It would be good to hear reports of that combo.
