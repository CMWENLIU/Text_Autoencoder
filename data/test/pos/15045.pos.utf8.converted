I enjoyed this selection purchased from a Manager's Special Sale immensely! It's an economical way to experiment and try different coffees without a major committment; like buying a whole bunch of something you don't like.<br /><br />I only wish I had purchased it for the holiday season. It would've made each day with a houseful a relatives a wee bit more pleasant, no really. A change of coffee to break the annual routine of hearing the same old family stories from the in-laws AGAIN is something to savor. When the in-laws arrive they take over EVERYTHING including the coffee maker. So I'll get a chance to have something in addition to their STRONG, hair-raising brand and coffee method.<br /><br />Although not a coffee connoisseur, I like the different selections. I anticipate buying more to assist "counting the days" UNTIL the in-laws leave this next holiday season. See there really is a Santa Claus!
