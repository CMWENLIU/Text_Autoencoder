I really enjoy a good cup of coffee.<br />I do like Starbucks, Lavazza and Illy among other espresso.<br /><br />Kimbo has that distinct neopolitan taste and indeed it is a product of Naples.<br /><br />If you like experimenting with coffees and if you like espresso, it's definitely worth your while to give Kimbo a try.<br /><br />Highly recommended for any espresso lover!
