I picked this up because I'd broken my coffee pot and wanted to take my time replacing it. I like bold coffee so most of the time I don't care for instant. However, I thought it would get me through a few days.<br /><br />Now I've decided not to buy a coffee pot for awhile. This is BETTER than most reasonably priced brewed coffee in my opinion. If you served it to a guest they might not even realize it was instant.
