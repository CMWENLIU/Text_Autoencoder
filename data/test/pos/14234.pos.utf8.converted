I started to entitled this review "Couldn't live without," but then decided that I could, in fact, live without my subscription of these Kalamata olives, just not as contentedly.  Unlike a previous reviewer, I rarely find a mushy one, and the mushiness quotient is certainly similar to what one finds in jars from the grocery. e.g., once in a while, a few, not too many.  As for serving them to guests, of course you can.  These are tasty, chemical-free, aesthetically proper olives.
