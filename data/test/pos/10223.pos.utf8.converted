My son is gluten intolerant and allergic to eggs, milk, soy and several varieties of nuts. I make this bread with rice milk and replace the egg with flaxseed meal and water, and he loves it! The taste and texture are superior to anything else we've tried. It is very easy in the bread machine, but it can be mixed and baked by hand, too. If I'm not using the machine, I prefer to mix it truly by hand (300 strokes with a sturdy mixing spoon), as the dough tends to climb the beaters of my mixer.
