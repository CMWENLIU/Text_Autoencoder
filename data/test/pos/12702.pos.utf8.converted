I recently received a roll of this jerky chew, and will say that THIS is what jerky chew should be like! I have previously tried and reviewed the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZI0RG">Jack Links Chew, Original Flavor, 0.32-Ounce Units (Pack of 24)</a>. That stuff tasted like ground up cardboard and pepper that blows away when you open the can. Buffalo Bill's chew is has plenty of flavor, but also is actual shredded (not ground) jerky. The only fault is that occasionally you might get a little chunk that's too big for your lip, which makes it kind of painful. But I usually just chew those right up anyhow. This chew is neither too dry nor too moist.<br /><br />I like to use jerky chew when riding horses or working in dusty conditions, as it helps keep my mouth moist. And though it's not laced with caffine or nicotine, it does help keep you awake because it keeps your mouth and mind busy.<br /><br />I will say without a doubt that this is the best jerky chew I've tried thus far. Even my kids like it!
