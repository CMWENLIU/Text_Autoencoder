Our 3 month old has gone through numerous types of formula including Enfamil Newborn, Similac Soy, Similic Sensitive for Fussiness & Gas, and finally a formula that worked for our baby boy's extremely bad gas: Similac Alimentum. It was costing us a ridiculous amount of money to feed our baby and just started to settle on the fact that we'd be paying over $9.00 per bottle until he starts on solids.<br /><br />I started reading some other reviews on Amazon and found that the Similac Spit Up formula could work just as well as Alimentum. My wife and I tried it and after almost a week it has proved to be a success. Our baby boy is happy and so are Mom and Dad!<br /><br />Try this if you're currently paying too much for hypoallergenic formula and you don't know for sure if your child has food allergies or not.
