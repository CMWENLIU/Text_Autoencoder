I just found Starbucks Kcups in Bed/Bath/Beyond (also in Target) and of course I had to grab them on the spot!  I tried the House Blend and, unlike other Starbucks flavors, this is very smooth and not at all bitter or "burnt" like the Pike Place blend.  This flavor didn't require nearly as much sweetening and, since it isn't overly strong, it's perfect for use any time of day.  I bought a box of 16 for $11.99 - ($14.99 less the typical Bed/Bath/Beyond 20% discount).  I can't even begin to comprehend Amazon's pricing on this item.....or most other Kcups for that matter.  These kcups will be even more readily available nationwide than Dunkin' Donuts kcups so why the ridiculous pricing, Amazon??!!  Starbucks kcups (10-count) are also available in Von's (Safeway) supermarkets.
