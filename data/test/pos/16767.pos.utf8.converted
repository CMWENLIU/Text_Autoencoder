This seaweed and the msg free seaweed are great products.  This one has a nice spicy bite.  I love seaweed plain and with these flavored products I have gone to heaven.  I have been eating seaweed since I was 5 years old.  I was a picky eater, but now I am not.  Nori has great nutrients and is low cal and has high protein.  It is a perfect food.  This is just another great way to taste it and consume it.  I can eat more of the nori if I have the msg variety.  Nori is a good thing to eat a great deal of.  This taste is good.
