Cats are carnivores.  If you check out the ingredients list for many of the common brands you find at the grocery store, you'll see the first couple of ingredients are *not* meat, but rather grains.  As well, the meat typically is made up of by-products, which are not suitable for human consumption.  Yes,  I know, we're not going to be consuming our feline companion's food, but the reality is with cats and their funky digestive tract issues, their food should not contain grain or meat by-products, plain and simple.<br /><br />There are a number of outstanding grain-free cat foods out there, but this one in particular our cats eat happily.  One of our cats was significantly overweight, and with NOW recommended by our veterinarian , my fiancee gave it a try. At the time he began this food, we were actually living on opposite coasts and I hadn't seen the cats in roughly 8 months given my travels.  When I saw our cat after that absence, I was shocked to see how slimmed down he was and how healthy he had become.  Using this food, in combination with that feeding bowl in which the cats have to stick their paws into to retrieve the food (looks like a flying saucer) has been the key to success!<br /><br />Unfortunately, this product is not widely stocked at pet care places in our area, but I am delighted that Amazon carries it.  I've been able to order it, trouble-free, and the food arrives fresh and ready to be consumed.  I highly recommend this brand and encourage you to read the ingredient labels on anything you feed your pet-companions.
