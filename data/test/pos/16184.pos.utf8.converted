I've had trouble finding Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal locally.  I was surprised to find it on amazon.com.  I have been using flaxseed meal for over 5 years.  It is ground, so you get the full benefit of the omega 3 fatty acids and fiber.  It isn't well known that flax seeds are not digestible unless the seed is ground.  While you could do this with your teeth, good luck chewing dozens and dozens of flax seeds mixed with cereal or in baked goods.  The meal is the way to go.<br /><br />This product is at least 60% cheaper by weight than the Bob's Red Mill Flaxseed Meal I was buying at a health food store.  While four 32 oz. packages seems like a lot, you can freeze what you won't use right away.  Or share it with friends.  At this price, this is easy to do.
