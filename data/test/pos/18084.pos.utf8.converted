I purchased this for the first time and am very satisfied with the product and taste. It is a wonderful substitute for sugar in my coffee and cereal. I have gotten used to using no sugar so this is a treat. One tablespoon is 30 calories but I don't use more than a teaspoon. If it is really low glycemic that is a huge advantage for all those who suffer with diabetes. I highly recommend trying this.
