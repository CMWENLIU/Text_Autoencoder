I just received this item. I was happily surprised to find that there are actually TWELVE different kinds of "biscuits" in the box. There are 32 in all. It is a mixture of buttery cookies, and shortbreads with chocolate and white chocolate. Three have dark chocolate, one has white chocolate, one has almond slivers on top, two have no chocolate, and the others have a mixture of milk and white chocolate, or drizzles of chocolate. The ones I've eaten are delicious. They will be awesome with coffee.<br /><br />I thought this was a reasonable price for this item - BUT I bought directly from the seller's website, and purchased enough merchandise to get free shipping. $30 is a little steep to me (with the shipping), however, the product arrived in great condition, and it will make an excellent gift for whom I purchased it. (I DID buy two boxes so I could try the cookies - I'm not eating out of the present!) I do think that in a store, you would pay approximately $30 for this assortment.
