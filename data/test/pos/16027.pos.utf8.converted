I have tried every GoldenValleyNatural.com Jerky product.  By far the best are all the Sweet N'Spicy and Peppered Flavors.  Beef tends to be smoky and fatty, while Turkey is dry and flaky, making their Buffalo meat varieties the best of them all.<br /><br />Avoid their Low Carb Jerky unless you are willing to bite off tic-tac size bites and chew for a minute each time.  All the Teriyaki Jerkys have the texture and taste like sweet Corned Beef, so I'd skip them as well.<br /><br />If you want to try different flavors, instead of 8 of the same from Amazon, just go directly to their web sight and buy them for only 15% more than Amazon's sale price.
