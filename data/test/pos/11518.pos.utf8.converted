We are well into our second month of feeding our 70 pound black lab this excellent high protein dog food.<br /><br />He doesn't shed as much as before, his coat is shiny and very healthy looking.  He has much more energy than when he was on his previous food. And he eats about 1/2 as much as before per serving.  One bag (28.6 lbs) easily lasts him over a month. He only eats what he needs and never gorges himself.<br /><br />It is a bit more expensive than regular dog food but because it doesn't have the grain and fillers, you get what you pay for.  And besides, our boy is worth the very best.<br /><br />All in all, we are VERY satisfied with this product and we'll be ordering again soon.
