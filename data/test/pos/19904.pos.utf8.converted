I loved the Vietnamese Brown Rice Noodles! It tasted authentic and had the same texture of regular rice noodles. I was soo happy to learn it did not have any preservatives and was made from organic ingredients. Because of this it has a shorter shelf life but it didn't last long in my house. I ordered 4 boxes and each contained 4 servings.  A total of 16 servings disappeared as quickly as it had arrived. I am going to have to try all the different flavor variations. Many of my family and friends have been asking me about these noodles. As the holidays are lurking around the corner, I will be ordering these noodles for my holiday gift baskets. It will be a hit for sure!
