I do know how to dry strawberries. These, however, are better- okay, MUCH better. However, I want to warn potential buyers of possible disappointment when you open the can. In my canister, the strawberries took up about 1/2 the can. It was not filled to the top.<br /><br />Now, take a look at the price. These are NOT cheap. However, I am ordering two more of these. Why? For several reasons. They keep indefinitely, even after being opened. However, they don't last long in our household so I need to have some hidden in our pantry.<br /><br />Also, what if the power went out. What if your frozen or fresh strawberries weren't available? These have plenty of Vitamin C per serving (60% of the DV which I believe is Daily Value) and only 15 calories per 1/4 cup. Those who have ALLERGIES (yes, I'm capping that) should be aware that they are made on equipment that could also be used to process soy, wheat, egg, peanut and tree nuts.<br /><br />Anyway, These are just perfect for snacks, eating directly from the can, reconstituting (add water) and using in baking, sprinkling over cereal or adding to recipes. The use is limited only by your imagination.<br /><br />Oh, yes - while I hope food prices don't continue to soar, you could possibly save money with these around.
