Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Tangy with medium hot chili bite. Great for burritos, tostadas, or as a base for a spicier tomato soup or pasta sauce. Try mixing with organic garbanzos (chana) for a great combo. Very much like a typical Mexican diced tomatoes & chilis along with a rich, fire-roasted flavor. Can be also be used anywhere like a diced salsa or tomater chutney. High quality. Also available without green chilis <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKVH9W">Muir Glen Organic Crushed Tomatoes, Fire Roasted, 14.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.
