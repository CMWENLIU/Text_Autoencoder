This honey is one of the best I've ever eaten. I recently purchased the 2 pack and between the jar at home and one on my desk at work I expect they will both be soon gone. I just ordered another 2 pack; co-workers thought it was absolutely wonderful and majority are avid honey consumers. This honey is unbelievably smooth, mild, with a wonderful flavor. You will not be disappointed.
