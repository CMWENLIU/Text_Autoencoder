I've finished 3 bottles so far and am still deeply in love with the honey. It has become part of my morning routine, "eating" (literally as the texture is very thick and sticky) a full spoon of Manuka honey with a cup of warm water. My only complaint is that the price is of the high-end. I hope Wedderspoon will offer a bigger version with a more reasonable price.
