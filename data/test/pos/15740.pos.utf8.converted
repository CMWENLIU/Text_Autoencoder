I have enjoyed "Goldfish" and other cheese-based snack crackers since I was a child, but no more. I tried these Cheddar Bunnies as I have enjoyed other products by Annie's, and have now found my all-time favorite snack cracker.<br /><br />From a nutritional standpoint, they are better than many competing products as they have no hydrogenated oils or artificial flavors, and are made from organic ingredients, including real Wisconsin cheddar cheese. The packaging does an excellent job of preserving freshness, the taste is natural and very refreshing for a snack food, and the price is comparable to other non-organic products.<br /><br />I am completely satisfied with these crackers: the are a good value, they compare favorably in the nutritional realm with competitors (although they really don't qualify as "health food," of course,) they taste fantastic, and last but not least, they're fun!
