If you were to imagine the biggest, sweetest, most tender escargot in the universe, you'd still be pleasantly surprised after opening a can of these lovelies and baking them gently.<br /><br />I'm an escargot lover and also a Yankee. The combination of those 2 things has made it hard for me to order escargot in a restaurant.  I have on occasion, but $10. for 6 tiny, albeit tasty morsels has caused minor pangs in my Yankee heart. Add to that the trend in the US for more casual dining and even finding escargot on the menu now is less likely than it was 10 years ago.  So, not a big deal. Life goes on...no snails for Jo Ana.<br /><br />Until now.  I was doing some grocery shopping on Amazon the other day and discovered the Subscribe and Save program. While checking it out I found the Roland Giant Snails and ordered a box of them, hoping for the best but not expecting the largest snails I've ever seen in my life times 2 !!  I'm not a big eater, but 6 of these with a small vegetable portion is dinner for me.  I bake them with organic extra virgin coconut oil heavily laced with garlic and WOW !  My first bite reminded me how much I love escargot and the rest of the bites made me very very happy that I'm an Amazon customer who happened upon the Save & Subscribe program!<br /><br />If you love escargot, you will be very pleasantly surprised with the size, taste and overall yumminess of this product !
