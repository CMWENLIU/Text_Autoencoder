Tastes very tropical.  Hibiscus is naturally a very sour herb, though, be warned.  Sweetener of some sort brings out the complexity, so that you can taste something besides sour.  I recommend putting honey in it.  It's a all around great tea, good for kids or people who can't handle caffine.  I typically have it at night b/c I can't have caffine after four in the evening.  It's good for colds, too, b/c it has vitamin C in it naturally.
