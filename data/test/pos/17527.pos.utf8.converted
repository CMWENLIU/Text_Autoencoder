Steaks, soups, and all other expensive and carefully prepared food deserve the best ingredients and condiments.  Regarding pepper, our family strongly favors coarsely ground peppercorns.  I am inclined to India Tree brand Tellicherry because: they are as close to the source as one can find; they offer very economical packaging; there is nothing but peppercorns in the package (what is in ground pepper?); there is absolutely no unknown "sediment" at the bottom of the container; they are solely committed to supplying these peppercorns; and they have provided a most memorable enhancement of fine food.  Note that white tellicherry peppercorns are nothing but black peppercorns with the very tasty and pungent black husk removed.  To me, mixing black and white Tellicherry is merely dilution of the essential flavor.
