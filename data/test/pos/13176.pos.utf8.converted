This is the best tea in the U.S. according to my tea loving daughters.  Even my Australian tea drinking mother-in-law likes it and she has been an adamant Red Rose tea drinker for eons.  The bags don't have a string, however, and are shaped like a pyramid so you cannot benefit from using the string to wrap around a spoon to squeeze all the fluid out (like my mohter-in-law does) but overall it comes highly recommended by my family.
