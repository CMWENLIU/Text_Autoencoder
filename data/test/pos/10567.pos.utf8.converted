Based on the other review, I went and tried this tea.  As a choir member, I am always interested in licorice products since they soothe a worn voice.  However, many of the teas I have tried have too much ginger in it.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this tea.<br /><br />1) The licorice taste is subtle, but definitely present.<br /><br />2) No sugar necessary.  As a dentist, I love this.  The licorice flavor doesn't jump out at you at first, but around 4 or 5 seconds after swallowing, the licorice "dances" around the sides of your tongue.  I don't know how else to describe it, but it really does dance.  I've never had that before.  Brilliant!<br /><br />3) It's best when over-steeped - like 10 minutes.<br /><br />4) Most grocery stores I've been to carry this, so it's readily available should you find yourself staring at an empty box early in the evening.
