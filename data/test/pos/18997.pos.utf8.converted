Trying to find a natural alternative for my acne I came across this and hooked Since my first day of college my face that was once flawless exploded into acne (I was 18 then). It hurt, throb, left scars, terrible blemishes, cystic acne along my cheek and chin area, very oily t-zone, large pores on my cheeks, blackheads and dry patchy areas. Worse thing about it I had new ones almost everyday and my chest and acne were the same.<br />Desperate I read up all the natural benefits in using coconut oil internally and externally and it i knew it wouldn't hurt to try. My face was terrible as it is. Anyway when I started applying this externally, my back and chest acne lessen within a month and a half. I have to say it didn't disappear like magic however I notice my skin felt smoother, my skin tone was more even than before,my dry patchy area disappeared and best of all less acne. But my cystic acne still kept coming.<br />So determined I changed my chemical based products into 100% natural. Basic natural cleanser, toner, and moisturizer which is my bestfriend coconut oil and also a healthy diet. Within 6 months of using this externally and internally my face is completely clear with only a once and while breakout and I'm currently 1 month away from being 20 and almost getting to flawless. Except my acne scars is a huge problem for me for the moment.<br />My sisters and I also use it for deep hair conditioning, and some facial treatments.<br />Coconut Oil is creamy and delicious as well. I love eating this with my toast and putting it in my favorite coconut chicken curry. I've noticed when eating coconut oil or just adding it into my food my appetite isn't as big as it was before. Not sure if its because its a healthy type of fat.But anyway I absolutely love, love , love this product.<br /><br />however with the acne part, its not for everyone. I'm fortunate enough that this work wonderfully for me. But it wouldn't hurt to try. Its affordable and no harsh chemicals added at all.
