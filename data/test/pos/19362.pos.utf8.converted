I just got a new puppy about 2 weeks ago. The breeder used to mix canned dog food with hard dog food. When I got my dog home I wanted to get him off the canned dog food, this was not as easy as I thought it was going to be. He just didn't want to eat and was losing weight and seemed very tired. The breeder had gone away to Europe for 2 weeks so calling her wasn't an option, after exhaustive research I found this canned dog food. It is very healthy; they put nothing but real chicken and ingredients into the food. The price may be a bit higher than most canned dog food, but my dog's health is the only thing that matters. I add one Tsp and a little water mix it around to get the taste on the dry food and he devours this stuff. I was so grateful I found something healthy that he loves. I am using Fromm puppy dog food plus this and a bit of water it works really well. I would highly recommend both of these if you have a small breed dog. I hope others find this review useful!
