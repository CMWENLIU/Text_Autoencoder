I've been a vegan for almost a year now and I use nutritonal yeast a lot. I use it to make vegan queso for my nachos, mac & cheese, sprinkled on my popcorn and I like to make a vegan version of parmesan using cashews and nutritonal yeast. I use it in a ton of recipes. MANY people love nutritonal yeast but you will either love it or hate it. You really just need to get a few recipes and try them.
