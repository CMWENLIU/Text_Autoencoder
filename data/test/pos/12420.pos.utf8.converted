I've had a Tassimo machine (not the same one) for nearly four years now, and have tried most if not all of the discs available through Amazon.  While I haven't been thrilled with any of the other Maxwell House discs particularly (I like a strong cup of coffee, but there are a wide variety of preferences on this issue), I've been very, very pleased with the French Roast.  It gives a strong but smooth brew and you can't beat the price--at the time I'm writing this you can get 2 packs of 16 discs of the MH French Roast for under $14, compared to 2 packs of 12 discs for more than $20 for the Starbucks blends.  I still buy Starbucks, particularly the Africa Kitamu, and Seattle's Best, particularly Henry's Blend, because I like variety in my cup of Joe, but MH's French Roast is great choice, especially if you have multiple coffee drinkers in the house and need to keep plenty of discs on hand while still keeping within your food budget!
