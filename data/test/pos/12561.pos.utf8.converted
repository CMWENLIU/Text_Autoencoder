I've been using this product for months in what the Lebanese call "white coffee" or "cafe blanc".  One teaspoon in a cup of boiled water with some sugar makes an extremely pleasant and calming after-dinner beverage that helps digestion.  Excellent and delicate aroma and taste. Strongly recommended.
