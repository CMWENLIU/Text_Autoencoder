I used to buy these bullies from my local store, but they got real selfish after the dog food scare and raised the price to $34 a bag. This price is the best. My suggestion to those of you who purchased...buy the 12", as others have said they can easily be cut in two. I use my garden branch cutter.<br />Keep them in the freezer. Your dog won't mind and the smell and freshness will keep. Give it frozen or let it thaw.<br />I have bought bigger and American made bullies, but my dog prefers this brand.
