I, too, began using this salt after reading "Real Food".  I love, love, love it!  It's got a great flavor and, after eating this salt, table salt is way too "salty" to eat (in a bad way).  This salt adds a great flavor to my eggs in the morning, my salads at lunch, and most dinners that I have at night.  I will NEVER go back to regular salt!
