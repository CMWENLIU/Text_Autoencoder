I've gone through quite a lot of this wheat germ in my soups, oatmeal, and breads. It has been a nice addition to my diet and I will continue to purchase this product. I did have a few bags go rancid (within a few days of opening) when stored in the refrigerator. I now keep all opened bags in the freezer and I've had no further problems.
