I have been a vegetarian for the past 16 years and have purchased Loma Linda swiss steak by the individual cans in health food stores dozens of times. I was delighted to find it available by the case on Amazon.com. It is hands down my favorite veggie meat substitute. It is delicious and filling and you only need to nuke it in the microwave and add some veggies to make a full, satisfying meal. This is a huge plus for a commuter who works full time like I do. I really can't say enough about the product. I eat it often, and always keep some cans on hand. The gravy is delicious!
