I have wanted a Keurig for quite some time now for home use, but wasn't really sure which model I wanted.  After plenty of research, I settled on the Office Pro.<br /><br />The major complaint I read about this model was that it wasn't exactly quiet.  Those reviews are correct, to an extent.  I don't think it's so loud as to be any more distracting than any other noise in the home.  It's certainly a lot quieter than my vacuum and my washer.  I can't hear it in the next room, and neighbors haven't complained about the noise in the surrounding apartments.<br /><br />I have read review after review of the home brewers with the quiet technology, and I noticed that the one common complaint with those was that the pump failed after a couple months.  I'd rather deal with a bit of noise than with a dead coffee maker.<br /><br />We are avid coffee drinkers, and we always use travel mugs in the morning.  There isn't a setting for a 16 ounce cup, but we get around that by brewing two 6 ounce cups with a singular k-cup.  It give us the perfect amount and intensity of coffee, and leaves enough room for cream and sugar.<br /><br />I love that everyone can have exactly whatever kind or flavor of coffee that they want.  No more having to drink chocolate peppermint coffee in the morning because I wasn't the first one up and I don't want to waste a whole pot.  I also love that it's always a fresh cup of coffee.  No more burnt, old coffee.  Just a nice fresh cup.<br /><br />I find that there is a nice variety of K-cups as well, and if you shop around you can usually get them at a great price.  My local Bed, Bath and Beyond carries them and you can use a 20% off coupon on them.  Impact Office Pro also carries them online, for even cheaper than Keurig's site with their coffee club discount.<br /><br />Speaking of prices, I got my Office Pro for a lot cheaper.  Staples has them for $129.99 and you can use a coupon.  My account rep at Impact Office Pro went a little lower than the Staples price, and then even took my $25 Staples coupon, bringing the price down even more.  So shop around and see where you can get the best deal!<br /><br />A word of warning, the my k cup reusable filter offered by Keurig does not work with this model.  However, the solofill refillable k-cup does work so if you want to use your own coffee, buy the solofill k cup.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this brewer.  It's a great addition to our home.
