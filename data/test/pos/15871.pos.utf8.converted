This stuff is really yummy.  It took me a day or two to get used to it, but now I prefer it over the other fudge sauce that I was using. I generally don't keep chocolates in the house, so when the chocolate cravings hit, I head to the jar with my spoon!  It is a very rich flavor.  On the bitter side, which I really like.  I like it best when it is cold.
