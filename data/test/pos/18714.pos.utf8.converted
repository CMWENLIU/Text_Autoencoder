I have a hard time believing this gum is really sugar-free. There is no after taste. It actually tastes better than ANY gum I've ever tried. It has kept me from smoking for a year now, but the store that sells it just stopped and I can't find it anywhere. I was buying it from Walmart for .88 a bag and it's $2.79 online. Anybody know where it might be sold??
