i'm sad that the previous reviewer spoke of one bad experience and did not bother to actually describe the product. i still dont understand how they could not get ahold of the company if the company has its own website and whenever i have emailed for tips or recipes i always get a response. sounds like someone likes to play the victim.<br />anyways enough about the last reviewer on to the product. growing up in a hispanic household there was always a package of Maria crackers at the ready for unexpected guest. often my mother would serve them with coffee or hot chocolate. Maria crackers have a lightly sweet taste  with a hint of caramel ( not like caramel sauce or candy but like the caramel you would get on top of creme brulee). they are crunchy but not hard and are great for dipping since they do not break up when moist.
