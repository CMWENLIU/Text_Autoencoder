I brew and drink a lot of tea, having retired from coffee many years ago. I spent several weeks in China at one point and experienced many fine teas there as well. I like Jasmine green tea on its own or a a small flavor addition to Assam or Ceylon teas sometimes. Jasmine, like any green tea, can be prone to bitterness if brewed to hot or too long. The Coffee Bean Direct Jasmine does not tend to go as bitter as most jasmine I have had, and has a pronounced jasmine flavor. They did not skimp on the jasmine flowers in this blend. It has the pleasant "coat-your-tongue with jasmine" quality that the better jasmine teas have.<br /><br />I am very surprised to get a jasmine tea this good in an inexpensive bulk tea. Better jasmine can be had; the white pearl & silver needle jasmines for example, but they are very expensive and are "special occasion teas" for me. The Coffee Bean Direct is a far more than adequate jasmine tea at a great price!
