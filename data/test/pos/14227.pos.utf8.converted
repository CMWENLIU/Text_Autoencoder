I purchased this almost a year ago to the day because I wanted something to fill a corner of a room, and because I love banana trees (they remind me of home) and wanted one I could grow and keep indoors during the winter months in the mid-atlantic region.  I was between this and the tiny dwarf variety, but figured I wanted something that would occupy the biggest possible space without being the size of a full banana tree.  It arrived a tiny little plant, and at first I was worried that the container I had gotten for it looked ridiculously over-sized.<br /><br />It grew slowly for the first few months because I tried to grow it using artificial daylight lighting, but then started to pick up a little steam around April and I set it outside from May-September (summer months).  I thought it was gonna die outside with the intense heat and sun (I probably should have acclimated it to full sun a little more slowly), but then suddenly it started sprouting leaves at the rate of ~ 1 new bigger leaf per week. The leaves also went from being thin to being much thicker.  I watered it daily, btw, since it likes humidity.<br /><br />FYI, I repotted after the summer and holy moly does this thing have a lot of roots!  Give it a week or so to acclimate once you get it, but transfer it to a large pot soonish to avoid getting root-bound.  I used well-draining palm soil and apply slow-release fertilizer 1-2x a year.<br /><br />A year later, it is getting close to 3 ft. tall and still going (with the large container, it's closer to 4 ft), and currently is overwintering by a sunny window instead.  It's one of my favorite things to wake up to every day.  I've purchased a few plants from Hirt's and am yet to have a bad experience.  Pretty fast shipping, too!
