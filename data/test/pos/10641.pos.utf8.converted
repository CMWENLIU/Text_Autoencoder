Ok, I'm a sucker for just about any product with a nasty-looking goat on the label. Why? Because I've raised goats for years and just love 'em. Anyone who's ever had a billy goat knows that they are just about the stinkiest, foulest-behaved creatures around, but also very affectionate. This coffee really is something like a buck goat in season - mighty high and strong, but lovable. The aroma actually reminds me of compost in my goat barn - and this is NOT a bad thing! It's got a deep, earthy smell that is unusual. Lovely dark roast. Not acidic at all like cheap coffee. Complex and wonderful. Goes great with goat milk and sugar, or black. And, unlike a real billy goat, you won't have to wash your clothes after you touch it....  I'm very picky about coffee and can say without hesitation that I'll be buying this one again!
