Very good quality cat food.  Made at a human food factory with human grade ingredients.  The tuna used is the red meat from the skipjack tuna fish.  They get a variety so this is just part of their diet as I do not want to feed them tuna based foods as their primary source of protein.  Healthy and cats love this.  I try to use this brand, Tiki Cat, Weurva and then for dry food Orijen cat food.  My Himalayan cats are on a no grain, no gluten/filler diet.  This wet food in combination with the dry has led to great coats, no hair balls, good energy and solid not too stinky poo :)
