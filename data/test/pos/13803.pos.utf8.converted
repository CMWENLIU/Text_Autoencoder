Nothing wrong with the cat food, but the vendor (petfooddirect) shares your e-mail address with several other online stores, and they just keep spamming and ignoring any unsubscribe request you place. This is outrageous in this time of day, and this vendor seriously needs to get an attitude adjustment over this. I'm getting spam from bluespree dot com, clearsave dot com, petmeds dot com, and I've never purchased from them. All their websites look identical. Horrible way to treat your customers.
