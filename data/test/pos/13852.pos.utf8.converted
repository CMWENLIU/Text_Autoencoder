I had no idea such a thing exists! I know there are synthetic chemically-based powder creamers but I have no interest in them. I try to stay on a low-carb diet (which I think rules out powder creamers anyway) & I like to use heavy cream for my morning coffee. Since it's expensive to buy these days (& the mini fridge at work sometimes freezes my heavy cream solid which somewhat ruins it), I'll try this powdered cream which I can keep on the shelf for long periods. I'm impressed.
