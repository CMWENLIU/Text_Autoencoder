Based on the reviews, I bought both Bob's and Let's Do... I made pancakes with both and we like Let's Do... better. I found the pancakes to be less grainy with Let's Do... and they simply had a better taste. The pancakes from both kinds of coconut flour were fluffy and tasty. The bottom line is you might have to try both to get the one you need.
