These crusts are so easy and convenient, I wouldn't bother making my own from scratch again. It takes some time to get used to the best way to prepare and how long they should go in your oven, but once you play around with it a bit then you will have an excellent pizza crust. I recommend spraying the base of the pizza pan with olive oil Pam, as well as the crust after you have put on all the toppings. If the pizza is coming out soggy, you're overdoing the toppings.
