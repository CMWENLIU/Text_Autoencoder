A frantic search for one of my favorite spices ended here at Amazon. Years ago, you could buy the small (3.87 oz) jar of McCormick's Broiled Steak Seasoning Salt. Sadly, it has disappeared from the stores. This army-sized container is all that's left now.<br /><br />The 1st reviewer mentioned that this is the same as the new 'Perfect Pinch Steak Seasoning'. But there is a minor difference. This large size is what most restaurants use and is basically the same as the old 'Broiled Steak Seasoning Salt', because it still contains MSG, the Perfect Pinch does not, says so right on the label although Amazon has it listed as an ingredient. So the flavor is slightly different. The spices seem more intense with the MSG. I do understand some folks have an allergy to MSG or avoid it due to health concerns, but if you're looking for a blend that's like the old broiled steak seasoning, this one's for you, not the 'Perfect Pinch'. I've used both, and they're both excellent, although my preference is obvious. The Perfect Pinch has more of a pronounced celery flavor.
