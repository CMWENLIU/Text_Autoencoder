This review refers to "Amy's Organic Soup - Low sodium Minestrone(12 Pack)<br /><br />I'm always searching for something tasty in low sodium foods. We started out on low sodium several years back, when my husbands Doctor insisted on it for him, but added that EVERYONE should be on low sodium. It was quite an adjustment at first, salt was definitely my 6th food group. But we did adjust, the thing is trying to find new and different things we couldn't find in our neighborhood market.<br /><br />Amy's low-sodium minestrone will taste bland to those who are not used to low-sodium products, but just doctor it up with maybe a little pepper and you may just enjoy it very much.If you are already on low-sodium, you will be happy to find something new that is very flavorful. I was buying the Campbell's Healthy Request Minestrone, which has just a little more sodium then this, and the difference is quite noticeable. But the texture of Amy's is not as watery, more like home made(although nothing's like homemade) and the veggies seem more like real veggies then Campbell's. It is packed with veggies and has a good portion of pasta as well, and with a little bread(low sodium/whole grain) it makes a great lunch.There are 2 servings per can, and the servings are a pretty generous size.<br /><br />There are other benefits to this soup beside the low-sodium.It is really nutritious. It is made with al Vegan/Organic ingredients,is very low fat, has NO cholesterol, and you just heat and serve.It's a good source of Vitamins A and C, and has some iron benefit as well. Unlike the condensed soups, no water is added. Also it is marked as Kosher.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Filtered Water,Organic Tomatoes,Organic Onions,Organic Carrots,organic Kidney Beans,Organic Potatoes,Organic Celery,organic Pasta(organic semolina flour),Organic Green Beans,Organic Peas,Organic Leeks,pure herbs and spices,Organic High Oleic Safflower and/or sunflower oil,Sea`Salt,Organic Garlic. It DOES contain Wheat(for those with allergies). The facility also processes milk, soy,tree nuts and seed products, however does not use any peanuts,fish,shellfish or eggs -(all from label)<br /><br />sodium per serving is 290mg,dietary fiber is 3 gm,sugar 5g and protein 3 g. total fat is 1.5g(no trans or saturated fat and carbs are 17g.<br /><br />I also think this 12 pack case is a really good buy. Even if you tried to make homemade soup-have you looked at the price of organic veggies these days.And don't think you will get bored with this, the case I received has a shelf life through jan 2011, so it's not like you have to eat it up all at once(but it is pretty good!) And by the way, my order shipped and arrived promptly.<br /><br />So remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy.........Laurie
