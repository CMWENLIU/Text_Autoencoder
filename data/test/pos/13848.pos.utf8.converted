I use this in my steel cut oats when I cook them overnight--YUM!<br /><br />Dairy isn't evil.  Fat isn't evil.  And animal products aren't evil.  Processed, fake, carb-laden white sugar/flour products are our problem.  Eat what tastes good and is healthy and as close to the way nature intended it as possible.  If you can't keep fresh cream on hand, THIS beats those other creamer-chemical powders in every way.<br /><br />Great product.
