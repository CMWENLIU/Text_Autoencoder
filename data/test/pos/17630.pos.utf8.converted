I have been using rice bran oil since my cardiologist recommended it in the Spring of 2010. Rice bran oil has the highest phytosterol level. Search: List of Foods (with High Phytosterol)That Help Lower Serum Cholesterol.<br />This oil has almost no taste except for a very slight nutty taste. I use it for all my oil needs except for occasional use of olive oil for taste. This brand has the best price point and is also available in 1/2 gallons - which I use to refill the attractive 12.7 oz bottle. The more you buy the more cost effective the shipping expenses so I buy a few 1/2 gallons & share with my mom.
