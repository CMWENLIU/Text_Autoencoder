Delicious & well worth it. Found it at Target & Meijer, Cheaper at Target I think. Great taste, better than peanut butter believe me... Well that's what I think but I do love sun flower seeds so I'm a little bias. Only thing is that by the time you get to the last 1/2 inch it's a little packed so I turn it upside down when in the cupboard so it doesn't separate. I've read some time ago about certain chemicals in peanut butter that cause cancer & so we've been using Sunbutter for the last 3 years. Try it!!!!
