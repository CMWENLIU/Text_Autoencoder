Many whole grain pastas are difficult to cook, and come out heavy and/or sticky. Not this product. Easy to cook.  Wonderful flavor and texture. Extraordinary. It is to white-flour pasta as whole wheat bread is to white bread: More flavor, texture, and health benefits.<br /><br />I deviate from the cooking instructions slightly by bringing the water to a boil, lowering the heat, then adding the pasta* (and never return it to a boil). I usually cook for about 14 minutes, which is four minutes longer than the instructions, but at a lower heat.  I add sliced mushrooms to the water while it is cooking. After draining the water off, i add freshly crushed garlic, 2-3 tablespoons of heart-healthy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FLCOUQ">Nutiva hemp oil</a>, and basil leaf puree (when available) or rehydrated dried basil leaves (when fresh basil is out of season). Add a glass of red wine, some vegetables & sardines, a dab of raw sauerkraut on the served pasta, and this is the perfect meal.  And it's heart-healthy too.  I don't add any salt to the water while it's cooking, but do salt the pasta to taste when served.  Occasionally (rarely) i'll use a little tomato based spaghetti or antipasto sauce, but this pasta really doesn't need it.  Most pasta sauces contain sugar, and more salt than if you just use a salt shaker and salt your pasta to taste.  (Most people don't realize that sugar is metabolized to fat by the liver, and can be bad for the heart.)  Hemp oil has nearly a perfect ratio of Omega-6 to 3.<br /><br />I've been buying this pasta by the case for years now, at local grocery stores, when it goes on sale.  Just noticed that Amazon carries it.  Amazon's price is as good as most of the sale prices, so will probably start ordering it on-line and save myself the trouble of looking for sales and special ordering it from my local store.  I just bought four cases last week.<br /><br />_________________________<br />* I add about 1/10 of the package of pasta at a time, letting the hot water soften it so it'll bend in my pot.  I add each subsequent bunch of pasta in the same manner, but staggered from the other bunches.  Maybe this isn't necessary for this product, but it is a habit -- developed from cooking other whole wheat pastas over the years -- to ensure adequate hydration of all the pasta & prevent clumping.  I then stir the pasta about three or four minutes later, once it has softened up, to ensure none of the bunches have clumped (have never found this pasta to do so, but again habit).  I add the mushrooms about half-way through cooking, and stir once more.
