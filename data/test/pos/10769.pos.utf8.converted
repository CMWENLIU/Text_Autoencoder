I used to by my bertoli or similar extra virgin olive oil at my local stores - then from watching Mario Batali on the food network I got curious to how different the more expensive oils could be, Mario always said that "if they dont let you taste it before you buy it, go somewhere else" - that is not an option where I live, there are no stores like that around here, I would have to drive an hour and a half. So I just figured that the oil Mario uses is probably pretty good, I found it online a few years ago and have ordered it ever since, it truly is awesome, I cook with it, fry in it, make dressings and whatnot, it really is WAY better than the standard EV's you find in supermarkets...
