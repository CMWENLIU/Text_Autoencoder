These are exactly as advertised; a natural set of food dyes that give beautiful natural tones.  They do separate but are easily fixed by shaking, or adding a drop or two of vegetable glycerin to restore their moisture.  I work with powders, gel and liquid natural dyes and these are so far the easiest to work with, the gel is easy to squeeze out a single drop at a time and get just the right shade.  I will definitely buy these again.
