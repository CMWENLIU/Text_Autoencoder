I read the other review and had to laugh.  The white spots you see on the seaweed is normal and is from salt deposits.  It's normal to see it on seaweed, and I think it occurs when it's dried.  This link has more details on it: [...] "Note: Dashi Kombu will usually have white spots that may look like, but is not, mold. These white spots are called "mannitto" or "umami seibun" in the Japanese language and are part of the Dashi Kombu. These white spots occur as part of the natural drying process of the product and bring out the flavor; it is recommended not to wash Dashi Kombu before use in cooking."<br /><br />I've eaten a lot of seaweed, many different kinds, and the white spots are normal.  Anyhow, I love this brand Eden Foods, and regularly buy this seaweed, because this company is reputable.  They do not source from China, and this seaweed actually comes from Japan, which is more reliable, and trustworthy in my opinion. Eden foods imports a lot of their Japanese items straight from Japan, where it's made traditionally, and without chemicals, etc.  Taste their toasted sesame oil. True it's expensive, but if you've tried the organic toasted sesame oils by Spectrum, Napa Valley, etc, they do not compare in regards to flavor.  The Eden Foods toasted sesame oil tastes exactly how it should, while the ones from the American companies are very bland in flavor.  When it comes to Asian foods, I think Eden foods has the advantage.
