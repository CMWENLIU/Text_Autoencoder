I have tried many different oat brans over the years and this is unarguably the best. It cooks to a creamy texture and has a 'creamy' taste as well. I use it in muffins and every morning for breakfast: 1/2 C oat bran, 1-1/2 C water, 1 Tbs of unsalted butter, 1 tsp of olive oil, sprinkled with Tony Cachere's Creole Seasoning to taste . . . delicious!
