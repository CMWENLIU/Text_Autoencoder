All of these "prostate" helpers made me skeptical.  But I have a dull to sharp ache all the time.  I watched videos of the injections they have to do to help stop it so I thought I would give it a try.  These work really well.  The pain hasn't been back after a couple of weeks of taking it daily.  Hey, it just might be a working something.  Awesome.
