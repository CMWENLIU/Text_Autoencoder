Ghee (clarified butter) has been used in India for ages, it can be used as a substitue for oil or butter, in most applications. It's a healthier option to butter and the other questionable frying mediums in use today.<br /><br />A more detailed description from http://www.pcta.org/general/ghee.asp :<br />"ghee is unsalted butter that has been baked to remove not only its butter fat solids, as in drawn butter, but also all water -- so as to produce a food that contains no molecular oxygen, and is thus extremely storable and not subject to rancidity as in normal cooking oils. The health advantages accrue from the fact that ghee contains no oxidized cholesterol, the kind which leads to free radical damage in the cells of the body. Ghee is pretty well known among nurtrition nuts, plus it's a staple within Asian Indian communities and can be purchased in specialty food stores. It looks just like butter in a jar"<br /><br />For those new to Ghee, do bear in mind it has a unique odor and flavor that may take some getting used to. The odor is not really strong and is somewhat buttery.<br /><br />If this is your first time trying it and you don't like it, you can always use it instead of butter for baking, provided the dish you are baking has a reasonably pleasant odor of it's own. Overall, the quality of the product itself is really good and it tastes great.<br /><br />I like the small 8oz jars instead of one large one, it's easier to handle them and you don't need to scoop some out into a smaller container for daily use. Once a can is over, just pop open a new one. Also, ghee has a long shelf life and you don't need to refrigerate the unopened jars. However, if you don't plan on using up an open bottle in about a month, it helps to store the container in the refrigerator, especially in summer!
