Vegan. Natural. Low calorie. Nice Italian tomato flavor with mini pasta. Lower sodium compared to most soups. Flavor balance well created. Low calorie choice. Great with a couple slices of your favorite crispbread or some whole grain crackers. Low calorie, healthy instant lunch "anytime" option. Nice for your desk drawer, traveling, or anywhere you can get some hot water. 100 calories, 4g protein, and 360mg sodium per cup. Important to let stand re-covered as recommended for 7+ minutes and then stir well. Nice vegan "top up" for those not yet on Amazon Prime and might need another item to qualify for Super Saver Shipping. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference.
