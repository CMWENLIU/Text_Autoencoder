We tried the Nesco Teriyaki and Nesco Hot/Spicy seasonings, but really preferred the "ORIGINAL" flavor.<br /><br />Our favorite thing to do with it is make the beef jerky with ground beef. I even got my boyfriend to use the beef jerky gun.<br /><br />Single serving packets, no measuring required. Open packs, mix with ground beef, put meat in extruder gun, squeeze onto drying racks. BAM! Good to go!  Well in about 6-8 hours (give or take).<br /><br />If you are trying to decide which seasonings to buy, go with the Original flavor, it really is the best.
