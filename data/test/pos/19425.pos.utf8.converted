My husband and I LOVE this cookie mix.  All the BC cookie mixes are good, but we are definitely into oatmeal.  I add raisins and walnuts (he like  the raisins and I love the walnuts) and bake away!  My own homemade are no better, not so easy to mix, and cannot be cheaper!  It is sooooo nice to order a case or two thru Amazon. Warm cookies and a book!  Life is good!
