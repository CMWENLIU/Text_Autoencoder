I love this stuff!!  I am a bodybuilder and eat a TON of tuna and salmon and like to keep packets in my desk drawer and gym bag for quick snacks.  I am so excited to have descovered this stuff here on Amazon.com for two reasons.  #1- because it is CHEAP!  Way cheaper than in the store.  #2- because it ROCKS!  It tastes awesome!  I'd eat this even if I wasn't bodybuilding.  It is a yummy, quick snack.  All you need is a fork or spoon and you are set.  I eat this directly out of the pouch.  Excellent!  This is going to be a staple in my grocery shopping from now on.
