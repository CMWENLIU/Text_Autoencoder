This honey is like a cure-all! Worth every penny.  It's tasty, but we don't use it on toast or for baking because of the price.  We mainly use it for illness/injury as an anti-biotic. Works great to heal cuts and cure sinusitis, etc, or simply boost the immune system.<br /><br />Raw honey has monocytes that stimulate white cells to produce inflammatory cytokines to kill infection. Manuka honey in particular works through the TLR-4 (toll-like receptor). TLRs are involved in innate immunity.  Really good stuff. This brand is high quality.
