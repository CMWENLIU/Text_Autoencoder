The Aerogarden is so much better than what I ever expected! The herbs that I started with continued to grow for 5 months. I had enough herbs to share with friends and still have some to dry.  This unit worked so well, that I now have a second unit. All the growing pods have the listed days it takes for the seeds to germinate.  Those days have been exact in each pod I have used.  I have also harvested the herbs, greens, etc. at the approximate time they have listed as beginning harvesting times. I have salad greens and the salsa garden growing at the same time--great fresh salads etc.!  I have recommended this product to many of my friends and continue to do so.
