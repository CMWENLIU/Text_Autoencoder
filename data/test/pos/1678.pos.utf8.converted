After my initial disappointment, I contacted Native Forest and asked them about the Sri Lanka sourcing of coconut milk. They informed me that they had already discontinued their sourcing (this was around September 2011), and that the only remaining cans were those already stocked. It now being February 2012, I decided to give them another shot. I'm SO glad that I did, too, because theirs is easily the best coconut milk I've ever had--now that it's properly sourced from Thailand, that is. Those of you who were concerned about getting any from Sri Lanka should be safe now. Additionally, it seems that while they once weren't accepting returns for this item, you can get a replacement if the cans are dented and you call Amazon. And if they're from Sri Lanka, you can be sure they're going to be dented!<br /><br />Old (1 star) review:<br />Another warning for anyone who orders this: if you get the cans from Sri Lanka, they WILL be watery, and they WILL be dented, and they're NOT eligible for a return.<br />You have been warned.
