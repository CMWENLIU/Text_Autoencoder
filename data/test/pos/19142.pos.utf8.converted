Cheez Waffies have been my most favorite, processed cheese-food snack since I can remember. The cheez flavor is overwhelmingly bad for you, but satisfies the most persnickety of "bad for you" food cravings. They are only for the true lover of fake cheese and waffle crisps. Don't be fooled with the cheaper Cheese Waffles also offered on Amazon. They won't satisfy like these will.
