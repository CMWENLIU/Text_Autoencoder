Various pods from different companies either don't fit my Senseo very well or produce indifferent coffee.<br /><br />These pods fit perfectly and brew easily the best cup of coffee of any of the pods I've tried.  Really delicious.  I'll be trying the World Blend from the same company as soon as I get my hands on it.<br /><br />Although I didn't really like the idea of the pods being individually wrapped, which adds to the amount of waste, I think I may be a convert, since the coffee stayed lovely and fresh.<br /><br />Finally, I got an unprompted individual response from the company about my shipping preferences after I left feedback for them on Amazon, which certainly goes above and beyond what I expect.
