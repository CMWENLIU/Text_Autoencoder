i can't get good miso (with no alcohol or other inexplicable ingredients) at my local stores, so i get this miso online. i have been using miso in my daily cooking for more than 30 years, and i like it pure and plain like this eden genmai organic miso. it's a flavorful and nourishing base for soups, and spreads. it's easy to digest. i recommend it highly.
