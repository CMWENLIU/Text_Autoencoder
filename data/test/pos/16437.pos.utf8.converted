Delicious, and a great bargain AND prepares you for the eventual zombie\nuclear apocalypse. I have a couple cases of this stuff. I eat a few cans a week, mixed with some mayonnaise and lemon juice. For some reason I only eat this when I'm drunk. But it is really high quality tuna, and I think you can really taste the mermaid in there.
