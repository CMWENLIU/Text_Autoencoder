Like other reviewer's here, we've tried several of Betty Lou's delicious, healthy snacks in our home, including the peanut butter and the spirulina nut butter balls, but these Betty Lou's Coconut Macadamia Nut Butter Balls have become our new favorite. They are low in carbs, high in protein and thoroughly tasty. The coconut coating is particularly enticing. An excellent, convenient, nutritious snack for anytime of the day. Betty Lou strikes again!
