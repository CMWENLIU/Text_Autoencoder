I bought these flowers for Mothers Day. I order these flowers early thinking it would take at least a week to get them. They came two days later!! I thought oh no there not going to look good on Mothers Day,to my surprised they lasted 21/2 weeks!! I guess straight from the farm really works. I highly recommend this product. Oh and they came with a beautiful crystal vase!! NOT BAD!!!
