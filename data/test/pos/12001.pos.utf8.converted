This is the only flavored k-cup coffee I like enough to order again and again.  It's good enough that I choose it even when my husband has caffeinated coffee brewing in the next pot over.  I tried Green Mountain flavored k-cup coffee and didn't like any of the flavors much, even though I do like those same flavors when I get it sometimes at the local coffee shop, brewed not k-cup.  This is a mild coffee but the flavor is enjoyable and realistic.
