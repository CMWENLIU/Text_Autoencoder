I came across this tea when I sampled it in front of Teavana's mall store. I was immediately intrigued by its smooth, yet complex, flavor. It is a very sweet tea and it doesn't require a lot of additional sweetener. I find the agave nectar to be the best sweetener, which also doesn't detract from this tea's flavor, nor does it make it overly sweet.<br /><br />You really have to be very careful about following the exact instructions for this tea's preparation. You need to have the exact measure of tea required, and you cannot steep it in boiling water for more than two minutes - otherwise it becomes bitter. You should also use a teapot or infuser that allows water to flow as freely as possible, sine only then will you be able to extract most of the flavor.<br /><br />You also need to keep this tea in as airtight container as possible. That way it can preserve its flavor for months.<br /><br />Overall, really great herbal tea with a lot of flavor and character.
