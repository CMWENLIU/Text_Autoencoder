This was my first time buying a stevia product and I'm very pleased. I've been using it for over a month for our lunch time beverage like lemonade, jamaica tea, cucumber lemonade and ice tea. Nor my husband or my children have noticed the change from splenda to stevia. I have also used it in my morning oatmeal, coffee, and just today I baked some cornmeal blueberry muffins using stevia instead of sugar asked in the recipe and they came out great! Artificial sweeteners all contain chemicals as opposed to stevia which is all natural so I fully recommend this product for anyone on a long term sugar free diet.
