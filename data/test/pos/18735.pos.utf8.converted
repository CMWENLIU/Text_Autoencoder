I bought these shells for a rather unusual reason: housing for my colony of shell-dwelling cichlids, Neolamprologus multifasciatus. On the off chance a fellow fish fancier is looking for shells, these are the ones you want. They're 100% clean (no soaking required), and the perfect size for any of the shelldwellers. My multis just hatched out their first batch of eggs in one.<br /><br />I can't say how good they are for serving escargots in, but if you're breeding any of the Tanganyika shelldwellers, you can't go wrong with a box of these shells, and the price is right. They arrived in perfect condition, without any breakage. One box will furnish up to a 20-gallon aquarium.
