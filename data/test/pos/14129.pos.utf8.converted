Prior purchases of all spices from popular spice website, but I only needed pepper this time & did not want to pay the freight.  This was just as good, if not better & competatively priced.  Bag well sealed & peppercorns went into my 3 different grinders just fine.  Like the flavor, bold, but not overpowering.  Now on my favorites list for re-order time.
