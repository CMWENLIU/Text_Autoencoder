We serve office visitors tea, coffee, water or soft drinks as a courtesy. And the boss (moi) needs to be sufficiently caffeinated in order to stay cheerful. This means that the cup of coffee I drink with breakfast (at around 6am) may not last me all morning, so I sometimes want a second cup at work at mid-morning. And in winter, when it's horrible out, it's nice to have tea or something hot (cocoa? decaf? herb tea?) maybe, in the afternoon.<br /><br />We went through a number of coffee pots. First, the Mr. Coffee type, the standard pot with filter holder. It works fine and we still use it for refreshments at events when we need one or more pots of coffee to serve the guests. But as a one-off, it isn't so useful. I can't keep it on all day for the occasional guest who wants coffee (gets overheated and cooked) and the bags of coffee go stale. And of course it doesn't make tea or cocoa.<br /><br />Then we tried a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0003UF26O">Melitta One:One</a>. This uses the same, or almost the same, pods as the Senseo and these were available, until recently, at our nearby grocery store. But the coffee never was really great, and the pods go stale in their bags, and sometimes they seem D.O.A. (that is to say, stale already in the sealed bag.) That may be because the Keurig ended up being the single serve coffee maker "People's Choice." So other pods, etc, are not as popular and may not move as quickly off the shelves. Our store simply stopped carrying them at all. And in their place, you guessed it, K-Cups.<br /><br />Yes, the K-cups cost more than the pods, yes, the plastic disposable is not as "green" as a biodegradable paper pod, but those cups keep the coffee fresh. And because the Keurig is so popular, there are many brands of coffee and varieties to choose from.<br /><br />The first time I had Keurig coffee, I was less than impressed. I like my coffee really strong. And I kept getting cups that looked like tea. But if you choose the right blend, you can get something that will take the paint off a barn and put hair on a billiard ball. (I favor the Tully French Roast which is so robust, that a six ounce cup is too strong even for me.<br /><br />We laid in a supply of herbal tea, decaf and yes, my favored French Roast and so far, the experience has been excellent. Now, when we have a guest, we have something that can be brewed in a minute or two, and we have something to please nearly anyone.<br /><br />USING THE KEURIG:<br /><br />The reservoir is on the left side of the machine and easily accessible by pulling off the lid that sits on top. It holds something less than a quart of water, enough for multiple cups of beverage. The reservoir, being on the side, is easy to fill (the Melitta had a pull off reservoir on the back. It was better to take it to the water filter than fill on the machine as it was hard to fill without spilling.) The Keurig is easy to fill as the top portion of the reservoir is wide.<br /><br />We primed the pump, ran water through to make sure it was clean, then refilled the reservoir. It doesn't take long to come to temperature. Brewing is equally quick (not even half a minute.) Disposal is easy, pull up the lever on the pod compartment, and pick out the cup, discard. No messy wet pads. I can see the reason this won the single-serve competition.<br /><br />There is a choice of cup size; 6 oz (like a Euro-sized coffee cup), 8 oz and 10 oz. This allows you to make a cup or a mug, and also to adjust the strength of your brew. I was pleased that the 8 and even 10 oz of the French Roast were sufficiently strong. This was not true of the Breakfast Blend which is a lighter roast; in that case, the 8 oz seemed ideal to me. Your tastes will vary.<br /><br />And the coffee was excellent. The key is to choose your favorite blend and thankfully, now there are many makers of K-Cups, so there is sure to be something to appeal to most people. We found three selections we really like (Celestial Seasonings Mandarin Orange Herb Tea, Green Mountain Breakfast Blend and decaf, and my French Roast of course.) Later, we'll add cocoa and other teas like an Assam or Earl Grey.<br /><br />I'm really happy with it so far, and this is a lot easier for serving visitors. We like it a lot.
