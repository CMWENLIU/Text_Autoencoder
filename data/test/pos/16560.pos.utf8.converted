This is just wonderful. Full-bodied and very flavorful. #2 in my top five. After trying dozens of blends (yes, dozens) - Green Mountain has distinguished itself as the leader of the k-cup pack. I'm not much for "flavored" coffee (though I do appreciate the aromas), but Green Mountain coffees (especially the bolds and extra bolds) are very robust and just plain taste GREAT.
