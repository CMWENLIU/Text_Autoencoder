Superior vanilla beans come from the Madagascar "Bourbon Islands," Mexico and Indonesia. I find the flavor was truly superior to normal vanilla extract. While you don't want to use vanilla beans in everything (too expensive!), you will definitely want to consider using them in custards and when you make ice cream.<br /><br />Vanilla enhances everything from creamy porridges to custards and cakes. The list goes on and on. There are so many uses for vanilla. Vanilla is derived from the seductively aromatic vanilla bean. Vanilla beans are actually the cigar-shaped seed pod from a fragrant climbing orchid native to tropical America.<br /><br />Yes, vanilla extract is much more economical, but using vanilla beans is rather gourmet. The extract is created from chopped vanilla beans that are soaked in an alcohol/water solution. It takes about 100 beans to make 1 gallon of extract.<br /><br />You can use the vanilla beans, rinse and dry them, so they last longer. After drying, you can store them again in the glass tube or in their own plastic bag for reuse.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
