When I was young we often had Liederkranz in the house. Most everyone in the house was a cheese lover and this cheese was one of my favorites.<br />I was saddened when the cheese went out of production. Recently I googled Liederkranz and was quite happy to see it back in production.<br />After trying this delight again after decades of missing it...I was thrilled. The cheese was exactly as I remembered it. If you like a "stinky" cheese that<br />isn't overpowering, then this is a cheese for you. I will continue ordering it. Thanks for bringing it back.
