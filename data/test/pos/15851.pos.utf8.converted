Well, the 1 star reviews are from people who never liked Slim Jims and would never like Slim Jims so why they buy a whole package instead of spending a quarter for one at a gas station I'll never know... regardless, these are good and tasty.  Greasy?  Yes.  Bad for you?  Of course.  But you shouldn't expect anything but a fatty treat.  For some reason they seem tougher then they were a few years back when I had them last.  Not something I would eat daily, but a "good" treat if you like them.  With the sales lately amazon has had on them, the price is right as well.
