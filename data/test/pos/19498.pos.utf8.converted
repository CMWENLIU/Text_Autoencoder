I agree with the last reviewer that quinoa pasta must be watched and doesn't store well. It loses structural integrity rather quickly, so add a splash of olive oil to boiling water before adding the pasta, and then stir frequently--the trick is not to let it stick together or it will form a big mass of glue. It's not great for soups and stews because if overcooked, it begins to dissolve. However, in light of all that, I really, really like all the Ancient Harvest quinoa pastas. They are far tastier and have a more pleasing texture than any rice-based pasta.
