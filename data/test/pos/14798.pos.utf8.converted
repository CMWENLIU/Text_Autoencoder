I had to give up coffee some years ago when I became caffeine sensitive.<br /><br />That was hard - I really loved my morning ritual of deciding what I was in the mood for, grinding the beans, boiling the water, running it through my old drip-cone straight into the cup.  Ahh, what I wouldn't give for a handful of half Illy and half New Mexico Pinon Roast, ground as fine as it will go, brewed strong, and sipped black.  Coffee drinkers will understand.<br /><br />I have since found any number of other things to drink, but still miss my coffee sometimes.  For a while, I tried decaf, but yuck.  I found a perfect decaf tea (PG Tips decaf is indistinguishable from the regular tea), and have come to enjoy a number of herbals and other brews, but have never a decent decaf coffee or coffee substitute.<br /><br />I found this stuff by accident online and bought a sample out of curiosity.  I liked that it was organic, and there's nothing in the ingredients that turned me off.  I really didn't expect it to be anything like coffee (they never are), but I thought it might be good in its own way.<br /><br />When the sample showed up, I ran a cup through my old drip-cone, and it was just ok.  A little watered down - I think I didn't use enough for the big mugful of water.  The funny thing though, was that it tasted like watered down coffee.  Just the way coffee used to taste when I didn't use enough for the amount of water.<br /><br />Second cup I used two big spoonfuls directly in the water and boiled it for 5 minutes.  After a minute or two, it started to smell like... well, coffee.  When poured, it had the same dark brown color and opaqueness I remember, and suddenly I was holding a cup of coffee.  I drank it black.  It was a passable cup - very satisfying - I actually stood there and gulped it down in the kitchen.<br /><br />It's smoother than I remember coffee being, less "bite" - probably because it doesn't have the same acids and oils that coffee does - but it does have a comparable taste and richness.  I never really liked flavored coffees, but the vanilla is very light - more a scent than a taste - and doesn't bother me at all.<br /><br />In fact, if you'd handed me a cup of this when I could still drink coffee, I might have looked at it sideways and asked where you found such a smooth roast, but I wouldn't have questioned that it WAS coffee.<br /><br />That's pretty impressive - kudos to whoever developed this stuff.  Don't know how they did it, but I'll keep on drinking it.  I also look forward to giving it to some coffee drinking friends and waiting until after they drink it to mention that it isn't coffee =o)
