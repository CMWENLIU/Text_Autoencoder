I love my ice cream maker, but tired of the lengthy prep to make the ice cream base.  This stuff solves the problem in a couple of important ways.  For one thing, it couldn't be easier to use.  For my 1-quart ice cream maker, I mix a package of this stuff with 1 3/4 cup of 2% milk and 1/4 cup of cream with a stick blender right in my ice cream maker's bucket.  That takes about 1 minute and I'm ready to start up the ice cream maker.  The ice cream is delicious and the results consistent each and every time.<br /><br />Because I use mostly 2% milk, my end product is low-cal compared to most recipes and virtually dietetic compared to store bought, but it is still delicious and has good consistency.  There are no off-putting ingredients in this mix, which I value highly.  I can still get special flavors of ice cream by decreasing the milk and adding, say, fresh peaches, or cherries or strawberries.  I zap them up right in with the mix and milk with the stick blender.  No mess, fast and really good.<br /><br />Because the process is so easy and satisfying, we have ice cream a lot and really get full value from our ice cream maker and since the ice cream is lower calorie and lower fat than other kinds, I don't feel guilty about this pleasure.  Very highly recommended.
