The first time I tasted Harissa, I was in Northern Africa on business dining at local restaurants. Once de-virginized to the savory topping , I fell in love with this flavorful, zesty sauce. Years later I happened to attend a friends home for a dinner and on the table was a bottle of Mina's delicious Harissa sauce. Upon tasting this exotic delicacy , I was transformed back to Morocco savoring every bite. Since then, I've tried many different Harissa sauces, even a good friend of mine who happens to be a native of Morocco , claims her Harissa sauce is the best , However ,upon tasting Mina's Harissa she grudgingly had to admit that her Harissa does not compare to Mina's mouth watering, colorful blend of unique  ingredients. Nowadays, Mina's Harissa is a staple in my kitchen and I use it as a flavor booster, helping me expand my palate in most of my cooking, I also use it  as a topping on most of my sandwich's.Thank you Mina for sharing you secret recipe with the rest of the world and  giving us a taste of Heaven in every bottle..
