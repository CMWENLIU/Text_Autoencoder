We have become enamored with quinoa, with red quinoa being our favorite!  Of course it seems to be very pricey and hard to find too.  On a whim I checked out Amazon and found several options.  Eden had the best price and reviews and we are thrilled with their product.  Signed up for the subscription which makes it a little cheaper too.  Red quinoa is delicious as a side dish or as a cold salad with all your leftovers mixed in...nice and nutty and crunchy.  A perfect healthy food and it cooks beautifully in a rice cooker too!
