This is the spaghetti that I remember from my childhood.  Mom made this.  So it goes without saying that I have special feelings concerning this spaghetti dinner.  I'm not sure what it is that gives this it's special flavor, but it is incredible, must be something in the flavor packet.  So, when I'm feeling homesick, I make up a big plate of this spaghetti.  And I can't have it without making garlic toast and serving with a huge ice cold glass of milk.  I have a terrible fear that it will be discontinued one day!  Woe is me if they do that.
