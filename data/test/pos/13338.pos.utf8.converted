Easy mix with just water and 15-minutes later one terrific waffle ready for the waffle iron.  Ordered both this Waffle mix and the Waring Pro WMK600 Double Belgian-Waffle Maker [...]product from Amazon.com.  I was very excited to try out this waffle mix and my new waffle maker right away, so we had breakfast for dinner tonight.  We thoroughly enjoyed these waffles, Wow, really easy and delicious.  Light crispy outside, fluffly on the inside.  I see all kinds of yummy possibilities.<br /><br />The regular complete waffle/pancake mixes from the grocery store does not compare with this tasty mix.  Hearland Malted Vanilla Pancake & Belgian Waffle Complete Mix is in a class by itself.  Just order the mix, you will have no regrets!  So very good!<br /><br />(I plan on writing a review on the waffle maker after a few more tries, but based on tonight's waffles I am very pleased with this purchase too).
