What's  not to like about tuna in a bag?  The pouch makes taking tuna in a sack lunch convenient, and the tuna in a bag has far less water than tuna in a can.  My suggestion is that everyone switch from canned tuna to tuna in a pouch - in fact, I suggest you purchase all your food in a pouch! The Pouch Rules!
