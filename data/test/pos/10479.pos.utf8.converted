I've ordered from the other online flower sites before and am always disappointed in the quality you get for all the money you pay.  Not at all the case with these flowers!  I sent them to my best friend for her birthday and she said they were the most gorgeous flowers she's ever received!  Very carefully packaged and delivered, the flowers arrived in top condition.  The downside is that you can't specify shipping dates, but if that doesn't matter, just order a few days in advance or contact the company directly.  The shipping is incredibly fast though, which worked out great!  Beautiful flowers, great price, quick delivery....I'll definitely be a repeat customer!
