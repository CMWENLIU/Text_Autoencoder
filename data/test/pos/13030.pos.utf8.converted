Everyone knows the old saying: "A box on the table keeps my jimmies stable."  But is that just more of an old wives tale, or does this archaic rhyme actually hold some truth to it?<br />I, like many others, had a tough time making it through the day.  I would drag myself out of bed at 7'oclock, and sigh as I began my daily routine.  Shave, shower, put on my suit, hastily eat a bowl of Cheerios, and then hurry out the door.  That's when I would begin to feel my jimmies being rustled.  Sitting there, stuck in traffic, as a BMW cuts me off.  I finally pull into the parking lot, and somebody has stolen my usual parking spot.  My jimmies become rustled even further.  I get into the office, head to the break room to get a cup of coffee, and there's nothing left in the pot.  It's only 9'oclock in the morning, and already my jimmies have been extremely rustled.  By that point I figure my jimmies cannot be rustled even further, when my boss comes in and yells at me for only working 12 hours yesterday.  What he doesn't know is how late I stayed up working my *ss off for him, only to have my wife walk in on me making cereal at 4'oclock in the morning.  She asked me, with stress in her voice, what I was doing up that late and I reluctantly replied, "because I've lost control of my jimmies..."  By lunch time, where they're always out of hamburgers, my jimmies lay on their deathbeds from the constant rustling.<br />I didn't think there was anything I could do.  I had come to accept the fact that my jimmies may be eternally rustled, a condition my physician diagnosed as Rustled Jimmie Syndrome, or RJS.  I looked on the internet for answers, but it seemed like nobody knew how I could keep my jimmies unrustled.  Finally, somebody contacted me with a tip: "There is no need to be upset, try the cereal Gorilla Munch.  A box on the table will keep your jimmies stable."<br />At that point, I was willing to try anything.  I rushed to Whole Foods and found a box of Gorilla Munch.  Even after just looking at the box, I could begin to feel my jimmies becoming unrustled.  The gorilla on the front had such a calm look to him.  I got home a placed the box on my kitchen table.  That gorilla on the box seemed to stare in to my soul, as if trying to hush me, and plead with me, "Shh, no tears.  Only dreams now."  After my first bite of the delicious cereal, I could tell my jimmies were heading back to a peaceful, unrustled state.<br />The next morning I went through my normal routine, but this time, I munched on breakfast with my new gorilla friend and his amazing cereal.  The world seemed brighter, as if that gorilla's laid-back, calming attitude had pulled a golden blanket of deliciousness over my jimmies and tucked them into bed.  Suddenly, being cut-off didn't rustle my jimmies.  They were no longer rustled by having my parking spot stolen, or even there being no hamburgers left at lunch.  Even after a yelling from my boss, my jimmies remained unrustled.<br />I cannot recommend Gorilla Munch any more highly.  I'm a new person.  You cannot even imagine how unrustled my jimmies are.
