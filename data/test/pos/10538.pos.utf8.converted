I'm always looking for a new dinner idea for my family.  Just in the last month, I've prepared ostrich burgers, lemming tartare, and feral catserole.  But none of those tasty treats prepared me for the magic of Fresh Whole Rabbit!<br /><br />I'll admit to a little hesitation when I first ordered this gastronomic wonder; I mean, what if his little fur coat got damp and the package arrived smelling ripe?  Well, the good folks at Cloverdale already considered this problem, and thoughtfully skinned the little guy ahead of time!  (Yes, the rabbit was a "guy".  But I'll leave my "Rabbit Penis Soup" recipe for another review...)  Anyway, the rabbit comes packed in triple-layered dry ice and charcoal, and wrapped in a festive satin bag.  Can you spell CLASSY?  (If not, it's right there in the previous sentence.)<br /><br />There were so many preparation options in the enclosed cookbook, so to keep it simple, I chose the simple yet elegant "Raw Chunks on Toothpicks" from the "Rabbitizers" section.  It tasted like sushi, only completely different!  We had enough left over for some vodka-infused Rabbitinis (found in the "Bunny Sippers" section).  I can also attest to the powerful aphrodisiac effect of eating rabbit; not only was the food seductive, but the rabbit's glandular secretions make for a powerful musk that can make any boudoir seem like a vegetable garden!<br /><br />In closing, I will definitely order this exquisite gourmet cuisine again.  And here's a fun suggestion:  Leftover rabbit carcasses + Fishing line = Extra-Cute mobile for hanging over the crib!
