Chuckles were a childhood treat and my favorite candy. However chuckles seem to be an east coast/mid west product.  I never could find them in the west or the Rocky Mountain area.<br /><br />Then I found them on line and at Amazon.  I have now ordered chuckles from amazon twice. Each time they have been soft and fresh.<br /><br />Treat yourself to a great candy.
