Williams chili seasoning is the Good Stuff.  It has no MSG, high fructose corn syrup, fillers, preservatives or any other creepy stuff. The flavor is authentic, rich, smooth, complex and spicy, yet only mildly warm.  (And, no, I am not one of those lunatics that says something "isn't hot" unless it has 500,000 heat units.)  All but the very faintest of heart can handle this stuff.  Williams chili powder is almost identical to "Grandma's Spanish Seasoning", which my family used for years in various favorites.  I was crushed when Grandma's went out of business and thrilled when I found out that Williams had bought them out. I tracked them down on the web and Williams graciously sent me a sample packet of their chili seasoning.  YOWZA!!!  If anything, it is even better than Grandma's.  This stuff is well worth the price.
