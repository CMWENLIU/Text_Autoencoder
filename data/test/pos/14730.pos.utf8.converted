I am a marathon runner and diabetic.  I have spent years tinkering with different energy/meal bars and eventually settled with ClifBar--which is not bad, though it has many sugary ingredients like rice syrup, etc.  I was extremely excited to discover LaraBar, it is delicious, contains no added sugars and provides an excellent source of energy for training.  Definitely the best bar on the market!
