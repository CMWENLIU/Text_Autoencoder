I love black tea, but no longer drink gallons of it day and night, because of the caffeine.  This tea is the only caffeine-free tea that can come anywhere close to passing for real tea.  It's not as wonderful as real tea, but compared to the herbal drek that most people consume, it's heaven.  It's an herbal formulation, but it contains "tea essence" as an ingredient.  I let it steep a long time.  Sometimes I put in a splash of milk or cream.  I take the bags with me on trips.  It's not so easy to find, and I've always snatched up all the boxes I could get my hands on (when I could find it in Whole Foods, for example), so buying it in bulk on Amazon is great!
