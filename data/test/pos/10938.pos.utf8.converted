I normally buy the Rishi Jasmine Pearl Green Tea, I purchased this on accident. It is quite a bit cheaper than the pearls and tastes REALLY close to the same. I usually use an electric tea maker so this is actually better for me, the pearls never had time to brew in the maker. This tea is very "clean" tasting and light, I find it emotionally uplifting it is certainly the best green tea I have ever had and I have tried MANY (over 30 at least).
