Reunion Island SWP decaf is a nice, bold tasting decaf coffee. Drinking it you would be hard pressed to tell that it is a decaf and not a regular coffee. Just note that this is for pod coffee makers, like the Bunn MCP, Bunn My Cafe, Opod, Senseo and others. This is not for K-Cup or T-Disk makers like the Keurig or Tassimo. Some single-serve pod coffee makers may have a hard time with this coffee, as it is a 10 oz pod, whereas the standard seems to be 8 oz or less. This pod is problematic in Senseo makers, as they have a shallower pod holder. These will work fine in the Bunn or Opod makers.
