An avid home cook that is a collector of both cookbooks and cooking gadgets writes this review.  My husband and I have been following the "Eat to Live" plan for about 4 months now.  I purchased this product to give the illusion of meat in my chili and marinara sauce.  Both my husband and I were dubious about how this product would taste and what the texture would be.  We were both pleasantly surprised by this product.  I have summarized my observations of this product below:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Very easy to use<br /><br />2. Can be stored in the cupboard while dry<br /><br />3. Texture is very similar to ground meat<br /><br />4. Absorbs the flavor of the sauce it is placed in<br /><br />5. Soy product, which is good for your health<br /><br />6. Good source of vegetable protein<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. It isn't going to fool anyone that it is beef or pork it used alone, but it does replicate the texture<br /><br />Overall I recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a vegetable protein.  I have used it both in chili and marinara sauce.  I plan to try adding it to my lentil veggie burgers where I think it will work fine.  I have been pleasantly surprised by this product and would recommend it to anyone that is trying to reduce the saturated fat that his or her family is consuming.  If you aren't vegan I would suggest that you mix the rehydrated TVP into meatballs, and hamburgers.  I can't imagine that your family would even know that it is there if you used a 50/50 mix.
