My wife and I recently took a trip from San Diego to Great Basin National Park in east-central Nevada. It's about a 750-mile drive and we attempted to do it in a day. On the way there, I was getting real drowsy by the time we got to Las Vegas and we still had another 5 hours of driving. We'd stopped at a truck stop for gas and I noticed the little bottles of "5-hour Energy" drink. I'd seen them advertised on TV but had never tried any kind of energy drinks. Being somewhat cautious, I sipped about half or the small bottle, saving the rest for later. Well, it seemed to work fine.<br /><br />On the way back to San Diego, I was tired and drowsy right from the beginning. I was fighting sleep all the way from the park to Las Vegas, where we gassed up. Remembering the "5-hour energy" drink, I bought another little bottle for the seven-hour drive to San Diego. After driving for about an hour, I consumed the whole bottle. I was wide awake almost immediately. It was amazing! I still felt very tired, but I was awake and alert and remained  that way for all the remaining drive to San Diego.<br /><br />Other than the awakeness and alertness, I experienced no side effects at all. My wife hated the taste and said she would not drink it again, but then she wasn't the one who was driving. The taste seemed fine for me. Somewhat medicinal, perhaps, but no problem.<br /><br />This stuff is effective! I'll now always have a couple bottles in my car for any long drive. It's expensive, but well worth it. The cost by the case, by the way, is substantially less than the cost of single bottles in the truck stops.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
