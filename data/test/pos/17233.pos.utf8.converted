Love love love these lentils - they cook really fast and are healthier than beans! Here's a recipe that my even the one eyebrow raisers like:<br /><br />In a large stock pot cook a half package of bacon ends and pieces, when the bottom of the pan starts to brown and the bacon is nearly done add about 1/3 of a bottle of cheap merlot wine and get the bacon unstuck from the bottom next, chop two or three leeks ( green tops and all! ) and add those to the bacon/wine debauchery that is happening, add your conveniently packaged and delivered (and recently rinsed) Barry Farm lentils. Cover with enough water that the lentils rest under about half an inch of water. Add salt, pepper and herbs de Provence set on a medium low heat - cover for a soup, it should be ready in a little less than an hour- or - cook uncovered for about an hour for a more robust lentil side dish or some bed-for-my-salmon main course action. Quick, easy, almost healthy (curse my love of bacon !) and de-lic-ous enjoy!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FA68HY">Black Beluga Lentils, 1 lb.</a>
