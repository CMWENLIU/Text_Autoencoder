So many black teas (such as pu-erh and yunnan) are so strong and stark, that to find a tea like this (which is assam and ceylon with herbs) is a real treat. First off, make no bones about it, this is a black tea. It has that strong, bitter taste to it that I look forward to from a black tea. However, the aroma is just incredible. Between the cloves and the cinnamon, it's almost as if you've opened up a box of christmas. The tea itself is very rich and very dark. It produces a little froth on its own, mainly I think because the leaves are so broken up. You'll want a very fine filter, there is sediment through the filter we use.<br /><br />The tea itself has a very strong character of both clove and orange, with cinnamon making the tea very much "spicy." Not spicy enough to detract from the rest of the tea, but certainly enough to get your attention. The box mentions there are 3 kinds of cinnamon in the tea as well. This much I'd believe. I know there are at least two kinds -- Sri Lanka and Madagascar -- of cinnamon, it seems reasonable to me that a third might be adding the "sweet" flavor that the other reviewer mentioned.<br /><br />It is really just an amazing tea that I think most people will find themselves going through quickly. It's a nice break from the standard black tea fare, if that's what you normally drink.<br /><br />I can compare it to Rishi Tea's "The Fire" (another "spicy" tea), and the big difference here is the body. Rishi's offering has a very light boody, whereas this tea almost tastes like it's had molasses added. Yum. All the spice, and character to boot.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
