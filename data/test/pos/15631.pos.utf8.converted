This oil is delicious and must be stored in the refrigerator after opening.  It does not go solid, and the expiration is about 1 year beyond the purchase date. It can be used up to medium-high heat.  I've made some excellent marinades, baked goods, and vinegrettes with this oil.  You generally do not want to substitute all the oil in a recipe with this, as it will impart too much hazelnut flavor.<br /><br />Addendum: Wow the price on these really went up. Double what I paid in 06.
