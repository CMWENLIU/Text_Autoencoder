If you love coconut water, and you love coffee, then this drink will blow your mind.  It's amazingly delicious, not too sweet and has the yummy somewhat nutty flavor you love in coconut water.  I could literally drink a case of this a day, if my budget would allow it.  I haven't tried it as a mixer yet, but it's on the agenda.  I'm sure this would taste awesome with some Bailey's or Kahlua!!
