I am originally from Romania, and I have used this product there, and had it shipped here when I moved (how crazy is this: Vegeta is what I wanted for Christmas from my old country...). It is an amazing product, that will make anybody's food taste much better. Use it in any savory dish you make, instead of salt, and you will love it. Rub it on meat before grilling, put it in any kind of potatoes, stews, soups, etc. Once you use it, you will never give it up. Two thumbs up!!!
