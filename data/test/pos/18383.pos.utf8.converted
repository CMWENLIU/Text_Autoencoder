I purchased this as a gift for my wife for Mother's Day.  She learned about it from a cooking class she took.  We use is sparingly, but the taste is tremendous.  It is better than any other balsamic vinegar I've ever had and I lived in Italy for 2 years.  I highly recommend it if you want to spend this much on a product like this.
