I've been using mole traps of this kind for over 50 years and have killed many hundreds of moles.  I have used Victor traps and cheaper traps.  They all kill moles but I prefer Victor because of the design.  The "legs" that hold the trap in the ground have barbs on them to keep the trap from jumping out of the ground when the trap is triggered.  The trap is made from heavy guage steel and the spikes are heavy guage and very sharp.  The spikes are sharpened diagonally on the tips so they cut like a knife.  The trap is easy to set.....takes just a couple minutes, just follow the simple directions.  If people are missing moles with this trap, it is probably because they are not setting the trap in deep enough or are not making sure the spikes can travel freely down into the ground when the trap is sprung.  A couple of tips:  After locating the run, step on a spot to flatten the run, then set the trap to straddle the flattened run.  Push the "legs" of the trap into the dirt as far as they will go until the trigger touches the flattened part of the run that you stepped on.  Then (important)before you set the tripping mechanism, push the spikes up and down through the dirt a few times until they travel freely.  I have caught several moles this week and will get another one this evening.  This mole trap is well-made (in USA), easy to use and will definitely kill moles if it is set correctly.  I have 9 traps and set them in clusters but you can kill many moles with just one trap...........it just takes longer.
