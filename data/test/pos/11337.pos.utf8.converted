These four-packs of vegetable broth are a great product to use for making soups or to add extra flavor when making polenta, risotto, long-grain rice or quinoa. Each box contains 8 ounces of broth (one cup), so each four-pack contains the same total amount as one 32-ounce box of broth. Normally, these four-packs are more expensive than one 32-ounce box in supermarkets, but Amazon.com has a pretty good price on them -- $3.11 per four-pack (per quart). They are very convenient to use as well, because you never have to freeze or store unused broth in the fridge, as is often the case with 32-ounce broth boxes. Since each box has one cup of broth, you don't need to measure, and you only use as much as you need.
