I drank a Duff Energy Drink - yay. Like the Flaming Moe NRG drink, this one apparently came out awhile ago. Here's another review - hurray.<br /><br />Taste: 4.5/5 Quite good. Not as good as the Flaming Moe NRG drink, but still good. It tastes a lot like orange pop/soda, really. One of the better NRG drinks I've had behind Flaming Moe NRG drink. If you ask me though, for whatever reason, Duff goes down easier/you can drink more faster.<br /><br />Smell: 4/5 This has a very faint orange-like smell. There's not much to it, smells like orange pop/soda, but just a little different. Not a strong odor, but it smells nice.<br /><br />Look: 5/5 The can, while bland, looks exactly like the one from the show. It has the exact same design, beside the fact it says Energy Drink below Duff. Still, like I said, looks like the one from the show.<br /><br />Overall: 4.5/5 Duff NRG Drink shouldn't disappoint. Many picky people may find the taste pretty disgusting ( it, in a way, has a slightly bitter taste, I guess. ) but I really liked it. Most people won't even drink this ( or the Flaming Moe one ) and will just keep it as a collectable. If you ask me, you should buy two of each can so you can drink one of each.<br /><br />4.5/5<br /><br />Notable Nutrition Facts: 12 Oz.
