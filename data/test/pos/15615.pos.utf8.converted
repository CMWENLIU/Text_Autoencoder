I like trying different salts, so when i saw this, i had to snag a jar for myself. It actually arrived early, which was nice.<br />The taste is quite bright, and is a great finisher. I just tried it with chicken, and it really made the flavor pop. I plan to try it on a chocolate mousse next.<br />An interesting by product is that since it is made in part from lava rock, it actually leaves a residue on your hands when you handle it.<br />Anyway, pretty neat and quite inexpensive. As long as you arent copiously coating all your food with it, this jar should last a while.<br /><br />Update: I've been using this salt on a variety of things, including eggs, various meats, fresh tomatoes (from my garden), as well as the aforementioned chocolate mousse (which i had been planning when i wrote the review initially) and chicken. It has continued to be a wonderful addition to my kitchen, and the tomatoes and chocolate mousse in particular stood out as bar none winners.
