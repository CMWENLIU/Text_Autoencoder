The prune juice is great, Ocean Spray can always be counted on to provide a good product.<br /><br />The packaging was poor, three of the cups opened up and make all the others sticky.  My mom spent an hour washing and drying the 45 "survivors."<br /><br />Wish they would refund a part of the shipping/handling costs.<br /><br />Viviana
