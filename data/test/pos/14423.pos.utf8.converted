These are, without a doubt, the best refrieds I've ever prepared and/or eaten ... and I'm a long time lover of refried beans.<br /><br />They are a snap to prepare. Although the directions say to cover and simmer for five minutes, I've found it best to turn the heat to low and stir uncovered for about three minutes or so, then remove the pan from the burner and let them sit covered for a couple more minutes.<br /><br />A quick comparison to a can of top brand 'fat free' refried beans shows that the Santa Fe Fat Free Vegetarian beans have less than half the sodium! And, because of the handy packaging, you can reduce the salt further by shaking the pouch first. This knocks some of the salt to the bottom. Then scoop the contents of the bag into the boiling water, leaving the salty residue at the bottom of the pouch - don't need it.<br /><br />Plus, there are so many additional things you can do with refried beans that are prepared this way. (e.g. add extra water for delicious bean soup or use as a great base for chili). The creative possibilities with this simple "comfort food" are endless.<br /><br />Oh, and they are a great value, also!
