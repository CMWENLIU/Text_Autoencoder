Over the years that I have had my Tassimo system; I have tried every brand and variety of coffee & tea made for it.  The Starbucks brand is the most consistent of all the brands.  Each of the flavors is accurately described.  The  Verona is a bold and earthy blend that will not disappoint if you usually stop at your local SB for a cup of strong coffee.<br /><br />If I want a more serious kick without going to an expresso, I simply press the button on the Tassimo when it is half-way done brewing and it gives an extra bold, but not bitter (half)cup of coffee.<br /><br />Lastly, I have yet to have one of the SB's T-Disc fail (fail = very inconsistent flavor from disc to disc, or inconsistent quantity of coffee to water, or out-right failure of the disc) which happens too often with the other brands.
