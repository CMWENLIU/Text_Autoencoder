Oh my goodness... If all I ever used this in was smoothies, I'd still get my money's worth.  I never imagined I could drink a peanut butter smoothie without first packing my bags for a fat/calorie guilt trip!  In order to get this much peanut butter flavor you'd have to add a ton of peanut butter to even perceive it in there.  To the woman that said it was too pricey, I'd say that ONE peanut butter smoothie from Jamba Juice costs as much as a bag of this stuff.  I'm SO glad I found this product and can't wait to see what other yummy uses I can find for it.  The possibilities are endless!<br />Try this recipe:  1 cup non-dairy milk (soy or almond) 1 frozen banana, 1 tbsp PB2 or PB2 chocolate  Blend and enjoy.
