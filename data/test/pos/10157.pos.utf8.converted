This catnip is so potent my cat begs for it. We have to keep the container hidden away or she will try to pry off the lid with her teeth. After purchasing a "bulk" brand catnip at the local store, she turned her nose up and thought it was just terrible that we would expect her to go kitten wild over anything else.<br /><br />Cosmic Catnip is the one she loves and she will literally eat it out of the container by the mouthful if we let her. It is interesting that cats in nature actually eat wild catnip to aid with digestion. They recommend a tablespoon, but a teaspoon seems to be enough to make any cat a little bouncy and playful. Princess will nibble on some from the container and then we sprinkle some on the floor and she rolls around and acts like she is in kitten heaven.<br /><br />This is also good for toys and you can roll a toy in the catnip and your cat should be occupied for quite a while. While this herb makes cats wild, I drink a catnip tea and it seems calming.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
