Amazon won't let me take all the stars off, or I would.  I had a really cool, Garrison Keillor-esque review of this up, complete with a discussion about how I made apple pie with this for Thanksgiving.<br /><br />What I didn't know yet, was that this is not, in fact, actually gluten-free.  Then I got a nasty surprise--two days of gluten-symptoms.  (The five non-celiac family members who very kindly had a gluten-free Thanksgiving with me didn't get sick at all.)<br /><br />I looked around online, and in some of the celiac forums--apparently Arrowhead Mills doesn't have dedicated, meaning 'gluten-free only', lines.<br />So, this isn't gluten-free.  It's not even close.<br /><br />Don't despair, though:  there are other companies that had the same idea, specifically, The Gluten Free Pantry makes a basic flour mix with the same ingredients.  I can't find anything online that says anyone has ever had a problem with them.  (In fact, they are on Clan Thompson's recommended gluten-free list.)<br /><br />Clan MacDuffie over here thinks we'll go with them instead.
