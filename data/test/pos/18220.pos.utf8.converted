This one is very rich, particularly for a decaffeinated tea, and makes a robust, dark cup. Through the years I have found that Taylors of Harrogate has consistent quality to their product line. This decaf Breakfast tea is not as rich and strong as their decaf Scottish tea, but that product is not easy to find. For decaf teas I recommend the Scottish first, then the Breakfast second.
