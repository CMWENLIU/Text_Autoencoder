I bought this because I have recently switched over just about all of my food to organics.  I was so happy to see that I could fix something that seems like a treat and yet was pretty darned good for you without being loaded with chemicals.  I bought a waffle iron (the Presto Flipside--also 5 stars!)just for this batter.  It works great in the iron and tastes amazing in the mouth!  My family loves getting a special belgian waffle breakfast with berries on top every once in a while just to switch it up.  You can make extra and freeze them then heat them in your oven on the rack again in about 12 minutes.  I love it when DELICIOUS and CONVENIENT are combined with HEALTHY!  I haven't even tried it for pancakes yet, but I'm sure it's just as wonderful.
