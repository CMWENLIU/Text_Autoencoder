I originally bought this for my husband who loves spicy foods. We had an amazing dinner party at the house where I mixed sauce in the white rice with some grilled Kebabs, this small addition made the food so authentic. Mixing it with the rice made me think of my diet and how bland my food has been this spring and alas i discovered a way to spice up my egg whites and make an actual dinner style dish out of this. It was so amazing and really made loosing weight so easy. I started to utilize this spice and it eliminated my cravings. I sauteed carrots then mixed some in, even used it as a dipping sauce for a eggplant that ended tasting like a gourmet infused far eastern salad...This sauce has really saved me from cheating on my diet. It works with everything!!!
