I have been drinking this since -the- week they released it and for the last couple years, every month or so I've gotten in the habit of going to a co-op store that reliably carries it and getting a dozen (or 15 sometimes, whatever is on the shelf!) and drinking a few boxes a week (thankfully it is $2.25 a box here, 10% off when I buy<br />a case!)<br /><br />It is the absolute smoothest milk made from nuts--I am very picky and sensitive to tastes and textures (the "supertaster" test where they dye and scan your tongue? Yeah, I have 14xs the normal taste bud count and twice the depth, crazy but it makes me very aware of nuances for good and bad)... almond ones tend to have a grit; in some the salt and sugar (and cocoa in the chocolate ones) just don't ever quite join the nut blend... and no way am I drinking soy. This is PERFECT to carry with me when I am worried about temperature (so I keep a box of the 4 individuals around but actually usually take the whole 32oz one--I drink it in 3 sittings tops, usually the same day).<br /><br />Pacific foods also have amazing customer service; funny, I moved to Seattle from the east coast and having consumed it over a full year there, it suddenly was not known (the chocolate variety) ANYWHERE just a few hours from their plant in stores that have more Pacific brand broths, milks, and such than all other brands combined. They were awesome about getting it here for me (also before Amazon carried it); not sure why it costs so much with Amazon compared to a SEATTLE grocer since um Amazon is in Seattle, too, but glad for the backup regardless, hoping I never need to pay this much!<br /><br />Having had Pacific's oat, almond, hazelnut... And then Almond Breeze (the other good chocolate variety, sweetened that is, the unsweet isn't so palettable)... This is the best. The plain hazelnut milk is super smooth and great for making my own custom flavored drinks when I run out of my loved Alpenrose dairy goods (amazing milk)... This is definitely great for potential power outrages, winter storms... Great backup for perishable dairy goods! It is well worth $3/each, mind you, or grab the $28/case recurring and set it a few months away and see if you aren't hooked!! Seriously, bet you will be :) gonna go drink some right now (I should upload a shot of the cabinet shelf that is JUST 3 rows of this; 3-4 are always in the fridge cause it is so so good!)
