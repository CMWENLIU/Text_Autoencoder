<span class="tiny"> Length:: 2:29 Mins<br /><br /></span>I was purchasing Canyon Creek (and Waggin' Train) yams for my dogs from the pet store.  They loved the taste but I couldn't stand the smell.  The preservative used is a bisulfite (I incorrectly state bisulfate in my review) and it breaks down to sulfur dioxide (one of the smells of burning matches) on standing.  I don't know if they use too much preservative but either way I never liked the thought of so much of it being there.  Although the Canyon Creek came from China I figured how could they screw up yams?  Anyway, I saw these in the store and saw the Made in the USA label and decided to give them a try.  For me they are better in every way, cheaper, no smell, last longer on chewing, better texture, bigger sizes.<br /><br />Some other notes that I forgot to include in the video, they are labeled as vegetable rawhides, they don't last anywhere near as long as a real rawhide.  Maybe a minute for my big dog.  Also some reviewers noted that their dogs either didn't like them or got sick after eating them.  My dogs experience no loose stools or vomiting and they will beg for these treats readily when I go for the bag (obvious in the video when I pull the treat from the bag and he immediately comes up to grab it), but again this depends on the dog.  These treats fit very well with my wish to feed my dogs a quality product whenever price will allow.<br /><br />Edit:  The price on these seems to fluctuate heavily.  When I bought these and wrote the review they were $9.99, that was a good deal for what they are and comparable with the other brands, but at $18.99 a bag I wouldn't really consider them worth it any more and I would buy other treats instead.
