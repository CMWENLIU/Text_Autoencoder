This is a huge bag, rather than the one displayed. So it's a little funky to store, but other than that it's a great deal. I love Kukicha tea. The tea is made from the twigs of the tea leaves, so don't expect your usual tea leaves. It has a unique, earthy flavor that's delicious and has great health benefits.
