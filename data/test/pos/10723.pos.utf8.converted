After getting my new Irish setter puppy I sat on the internet and did ALOT of research on puppy/dog food. And just like if you put processed crappy food in your body, your health declines. Giving dogs food that you can find in most super markets are made up of mostly corn gluten, by products and things that sounds horrible.<br /> I decided that my dogs would have a better life than that. I did have some issues finally getting a food I felt comfortable giving him and one that agreed with his stomach. At first I tried Wellness puppy food and it gave my little guy loose stool. So I slowly switched over to Organix and have not had a problem since. I will continue to use this until he gets to a year.<br /> Amazon sells this cheaper than anywhere I could find it and if you get the subscribe and save it makes it an even better deal. I have never had an issue with the shipping or packaging.
