I heard of Tim Tams thanks to Wikipedia, they sounded good, but I didn't pay much attention as I figured I'd never be able to try them. However, my curiousity was piqued when I saw these badboys at my local Target, and my friend Charlie being the generous man he was, bought me the Caramel Tim Tam, he bought the regular. When we got to his place that night, we tried them, and I was hooked. The chocolatey goodness surrounding two crunchy wafers, a creamy filling in the center, and of course the caramel which is chewy after a few seconds, talk about silky and heavenly! Of course, the regular ones kick ass too so you know. But seriously these things just rock.<br /><br />Everything about this cookie/biscuit is high quality, the chocolate is very tasty on all counts. The wafers have a crisp unlike anything I've tried before in my life, and the chocolate cream is wow, and the caramel, it starts off a bit hard at first, but softens up after a few seconds in your mouth. Minus that part for the regular Tim Tam, but you got the idea basically. Long story short, Tim Tams rock, and you all need to slam a few down.
