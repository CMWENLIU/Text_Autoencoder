I am a chocoholic who loves very dark chocolate.  I have always been eager to sample new brands whenever I find one that has a  rating of 75% or higher.  Endangered Species Black Panther is the best I have ever tasted. Some  dark chocolate over 80% is bitter or dry, but not this one. Even those in my family who normally don't like the very darkest chocolate like the smooth creamy taste of this one.  I am now totally spoiled and feel deprived if I have to eat any other kind of chocolate.<br />In addition, a couple of years ago I decided I would no longer buy chocolate that was not "fair trade", that is chocolate that was made from beans that were harvested without exploiting children and other low-paid workers.  What a delight to find that this particular fair trade product also happens to be the most delicious as well.
