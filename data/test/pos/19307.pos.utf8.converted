When we adopted our dog last year, we started her on Wellness b/c I knew I wanted to feed her premium dog food and it had a good reputation. Well her stool was always loose while she was on it and we eventually had to add metamucil to her diet to make it more firm. Finally I decided to switch her food to Organix and couldn't be happier. It has a higher fiber content than many other dog foods and many of the ingredients are organic. Cameron loves the food and her stool is nice and firm. And she poops less often too. As one other reviewer said, because the ingredients are so nutritious, you'll end up feeding your dog less of this brand than other dog foods that are made of filler. Couldn't be happier now that the food's part of the auto-ship program.
