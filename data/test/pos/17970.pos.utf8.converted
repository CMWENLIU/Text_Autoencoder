Just bought a few of these along with the paper filters. I've been refilling and reusing the regular k-cups and although cost effective and environmentally responsible, a big mess.  The biggest issue I had with refilling was that it was a pain and it was a bit messy.  I could also only get a few good uses before the filter deteriorated.<br /><br />Now here comes these new EZ-Cups!  These are simple to use.  Throw in a filter, add your favorite roast, snap on the lid and brew. There is a spring and a tamper built into the EZ-Cup so that when you snap on the lid the coffee gets tamped/compressed a bit so that the hot water flows through uniformly. The best part is that the cleanup up is a breeze!  Open the lid to the EZ-Cup and toss the filter and used grounds.  Ready for the next cup! No mess and I think very convenient. Brew quality is excellent as you can choose your own favorites and control how much coffee to use. These just work!<br /><br />Great idea!
