I received 2 sets of these super compact bulbs already and about to order another dozen.  The light is soft, unlike the typical "daylight" fluorescent bulbs and gives out even bright light.  As you turn the lights on, it has to "warm" up I guess as the light starts off a little less bright and over a minute or so, gets to full brightness... small price to pay for something that is so energy efficient.<br /><br />I have a dimmer on a light in my living room and no, it doesn't work in a dimmer and only turns on and off, but, I keep them in anyway and the change in current doesn't seem to affect the bulbs negatively.<br /><br />Well recommended.  I currently use them in my ceiling fans (6 bulbs) my living room light (4 bulbs) my bedroom (3 lights) and 2 sets of standing lamps (6 bulbs) obviously I like them.  I am considering trying the higher wattage for a brighter light, but they don't seem to be super compacts, just the compacts, so they would work fine in just about any fixture.  Great product.
