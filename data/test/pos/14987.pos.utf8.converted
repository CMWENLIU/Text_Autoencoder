I use honey to moisturize my face, to soothe my throat and to unclog my pores. But this honey, got rid of my eczema. About a year ago, a quarter-sized patch of eczema appeared on my back. It was itchy, dry, and a little flaky. So I took to the Internet in search of a holistic and chemical-free solution (I believe chemicals only further exacerbate the problem). And every organic website recommended honey. So I tried store-brought. NOTHING! But soon, I discovered organic raw honey. But it only helped a little. The itch lessened but the size of the eczema patch began to grow. About a month ago, I ran across a website that claimed this particular brand to be a wonder drug so I sucked up my displeasure with paying $34 for honey and purchased it. I put it directly on my eczema everyday for about 2 weeks and one day I realized it was gone. My boyfriend touched my back the other day and said, "That rough patch of skin you had right here is gone. What did you put on it?" My reply: HONEY, honey. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.
