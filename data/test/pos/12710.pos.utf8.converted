My sister gave this to me for a gift.  She lives in Hawaii and sends me goodies and this was an extraordinary surprise.  I enjoy Almond Roca and when I opened up the box from Hawaii... I thought... another box of the same old chocolate macadamia nuts... BUT NO TO MY SURPRISE!!!  MACADAMIA ROCA!!!  My eyes burst with excitement and could not wait to taste one... and WOW they are GREAT!!!  Also the wrapper is just ingenious!!!  The outside says, "Macadamia Roca" and when you open it up, the inside of the wrapper says "ALOHA"... brings me back to the Islands!
