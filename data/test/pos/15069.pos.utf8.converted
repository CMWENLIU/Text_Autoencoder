I really hate that I bought this stuff.  I originally bought it to try the Master Cleansing diet.  After I read the book it sounded like a bad idea so I put it on some pancakes instead.  It was so good I'm not sure I can ever go back to that flavored corn syrup they sell in the stores.  Now my pancake habit is sure to cost me both extra dollars and extra pounds.  I'm not sure why anyone would buy grade A...grade B tastes incredible.
