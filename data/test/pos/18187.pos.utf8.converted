I've been searching for the perfect popcorn for 6 years trying to get it to taste like the movies.  After reading a couple reviews on Amazon a couple reviewers pointed out the key ingredients:  Coconut oil and Flavacol.  Follow the directions on the Flavacol, use coconut oil, and you're in business.<br /><br />The popcorn comes out crispy with that distinct movie theater taste.  I literally jumped for joy when I tasted it!  Just watch out because the coconut oil is LOADED with saturated fat and calories and the Flavacol is loaded with sodium.  That said there are just some things that are TOTALLY WORTH IT!<br /><br />If you're looking for movie theater popcorn do not hesitate, do not pass this up, just buy the coconut oil and Flavacol.  You will not look back.  Also you'll have enough ingredients to make popcorn for a year.
