BE CAREFUL!! This is a very, very hot sauce. I eat tons of hot food and own a small collection of these uber hot sauces. And I can confidently say that this is the hottest stuff I've ever owned, by far. For comparison, I can eat 4-5 habaneros straight up in a bowl of noodles with no ill effects other than the typical burning butt the next day.<br /><br />  True story:<br /><br /> While at work, I nearly died hours after eating a few doses of this sauce. By doses, I mean I was dipping beef jerky strips into the neck of the bottle and coating the first inch+ of each strip. I may have eaten about 8 of these strips over the course of the day. Then in the evening I felt a severe burning sensation in my stomach, or maybe it was my intestines. I immediately went to the restroom and tried to relieve myself of this pain. It only got worse. I had the most severe cold sweats I've ever had in my life. Like a horrible fever, but with goosebumps. Then I had a hard time taking breaths! I had to command my body to breathe! My insides were in too much pain to involuntarily breathe. I had to rest my head on the handicap bar in the stall (eww, I know). Necessary because I began to slip in and out of consciousness and I had to make sure I didn't just collapse onto the floor.<br /><br />  This process would ebb and then recur again a few times during the evening. I called my Wife and kids in case I didn't make it. Just so they would know that I was a moron and killed myself eating hot sauce. I caught a decent break from the symptoms for about an hour, so I decided to drive home. I live a half hour away from the office, but it's a very easy drive so I chanced it. Minor versions of what happened above occurred twice while I was going home, but it was relatively manageable... Until I got about a mile away from home and then the real stuff came back with a vengeance!<br /><br />  It was pretty late in the evening by now, so luckily there were no cars on the road. Good because the pains roared back, and I started to have trouble breathing again. I had to roll all of the windows down and stick my head outside like a dog just so I could suck in some air. By the time I parked I was hurting bad and gasping for air. I went to the door and my Wife and kids opened it up. I stumbled in and up the stairs on all fours. My kids were laughing at me saying that I was acting like a gorilla. They say the craziest things don't they?<br /><br />  After that spell subsided, I tried to lay on the couch and watch some TV to take my mind off of the pain. But then it hit me once again. My Wife was watching all of this BTW. I fell off of the couch and all I could do was squirm on the floor in agony. I started to realize something. My arms and legs were moving completely on their own. I watched my right arm just swing in random directions and it was kinda funny. Like watching myself on video. I see myself but I can't control myself. The funniest part of the night was when my Wife, while watching all of this, said "why do you do this to yourself?" So I promised her, never again :)
