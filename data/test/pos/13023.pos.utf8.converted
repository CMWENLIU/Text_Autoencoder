This water is good and wet.  When you put the bottles in the fridge, you get cold water.  This water will quench your thirst and is suitable for most situations where water is called for.  Some applications, like filling a swimming pool or showering, may infrequently arise.  In such instances, this water will work but you may want to look for a substitute in much larger bulk.<br /><br />The clear plastic container probably does not leach chemicals into the water, but even then, it is not very environmentally friendly.  The actual water is pretty good and I haven't found any floating debris or anything bad or smelly in it.  You may also want to save money and take your own H2O with you, consider the Sigg Classic Bottle - Traveller (0.6-Liters).<br /><br />Our bodies all need water - get some any way you can.
