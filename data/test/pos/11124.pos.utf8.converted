I have been a big fan of Annie's products for some time. I like that I can have the Mac and Cheese experience but just a little healthier. The only draw back is that I have found that the other Annie's products tend to be a little salty. Some people may not notice it much but I don't use salt in my cooking so, to me, it is very noticeable.<br /><br />Now the good news. Annie's have finally licked the salt problem. Pun intended. Not only is this truly an Organic, easy to make, Mac and Cheese, but they have got the saltiness issue resolved.<br /><br />I am so pleased with the quality and taste of this new line that I will continue to buy this line of products in the future. The sauce quality is the same consistency. The noodle quality is the same. But the saltiness is gone. And the best part it is organic.<br /><br />If you want a quality, organic alternative to the "blue box" Mac and Cheese. Here it is.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product. Keep up the good work Annie's.
