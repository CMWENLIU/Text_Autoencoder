So I wasn't convinced about the greatness of Popchips - until I tried them!!  Now, although they are more expensive than regular chips, they are so much healthier and taste GREAT so I'm not sure I will ever buy regular chips again!<br /><br />However, even though I loved the basic flavors in the 6-flavor variety I wanted to try some of the different varieties because they sounded good.  The only purchase option to try some of these other flavors was to buy a whole box, and I was very skeptical to buy an entire box of 24 if I didn't like the flavor.  This variety pack gave me the perfect opportunity to sample each flavor to determine my favorites!  I wondered what flavors I would be getting since they were not listed in the description, so in case it matters to you:<br />  - Thai Sweet Chili (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Parmesan Garlic (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Jalapeno (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Cheddar (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Sweet Potato (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Sea Salt & Vinegar (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Salt & Pepper (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Chili Limi (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Sour Cream & Onion (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Barbeque (3 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Original (3 .8 ounce bags)<br />I haven't had a chance to sample all of the flavors yet, but the ones I have tried are wonderful.  They taste healthy (although they aren't exactly healthy - they are the better alternative) very crunchy and full of flavor.  The only flavor I don't really care for is the Original, and that's because it is pretty salty.<br />Don't be skeptical - try this variety pack and find your favorite flavor!
