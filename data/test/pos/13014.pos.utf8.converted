I am highly impressed by the quality of this product, both in it's seemless merging of both chocolate and peanut butter components and for it's ability to hold up under adverse physical conditions.<br /><br />Conditions like, for example, a roommate stealing it and trying to play keep away in which said cup was caught in a kind of high five with the cup in the middle smushing it with considerable force. After which it was thrown across the room at high velocity.<br /><br />The cup survived all this without even a scratch or loose bit of chocolate in the wrapping.<br /><br />Truly the reeses big cup is a marvel of modern engineering science. And tasty to boot.
