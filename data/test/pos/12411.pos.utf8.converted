I recently purchased a bag of Kookaburra Black Licorice at Target (of all places) Real licorice lovers in US know how difficult it to find REAL black licorice here, so I was delighted to find this product at a retail store AND at my fave online store. It is &quot;gourmet-priced&quot; candy, but still a reasonably priced treat that's well worth it. It is far, far better than the crud that's passed off as black licorice in this country! (no wonder so many people say they dislike it!)<p>Kookaburra Black Licorice is the real, old-fashioned licorice deal, in HUGE pieces that are perfect for a mid-day licorice fix.<br />Buy a bag for your fellow licorice lovers, or invite a supposed black-licorice hater to try the real deal--they just might change their minds...This would also make a great, inexpensive just-for-the-heck-of-it gift for an elderly person who fondly remembers the taste of REAL licorice.<p>Oh yeah, one little word of warning though: Real licorice can have a mild laxative effect in some people. :)
