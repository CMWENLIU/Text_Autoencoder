I was worried that my cat would not like these and was hesitant to buy this many.  I purchased a smaller bag and my cat LOVES them.<br /><br />So I purchased this much larger bag at Amazon's much better price via Amazon from Entirely Pets.  Again, I was worried about the seller based on other comments.  But they were ordered on Sunday, and I got them Tuesday morning - they ship from Fremont, CA.  The expiration date on the bag is 16 months from now, about what I would get in any retail store.  So I've just not experienced any problems with this seller or this product.<br /><br />The manufacturer admits that brushing your cat's teeth is much better, and I do that about every other day.  This product ensures that there is at least something done for his teeth every day.  And trust me, my cat does not let me forget to give him one of these every night.  He'll claw at my legs until I do and his claws are sharp!<br /><br />By the way, one tip for cat owners: many of an older cat's problems are due to the propensity of most cats not to drink enough water: kidney and teeth problems are common.  I feed my cat only a teaspoon of wet food a day, smothered in about 2 ounces of water.  He drinks the wet-food-flavored water and only then gets to eat the wet food.  My cat is 19 years old (the average cat lives to be about 12-14 years old) and has had no major health problems.  However, the teeth cleanings are getting to be too stressful for him, so I've taken to these treats and brushing his teeth to try to spread out the cleanings.
