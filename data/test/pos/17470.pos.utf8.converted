These Twizzlers are amazingly addictive and delicious.  I love fruity & chewy candy and this is my all-time favorite.<br /><br />They're also incredibly unhealthy.  Each bag contains 2,080 calories (16 Twizzlers) and weighs over half a pound.  It's easy to eat half in one sitting. Once I ate a whole bag. Be forewarned.  It's a bag full of sweet sweet wonderful starchy corn syrup poison.  I would rate it one star for your health, five stars for the best candy you'll ever taste.
