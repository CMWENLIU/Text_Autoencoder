Want a fast, easy, yet satisfying soup? This stuff beats everything. Tastes like something you've been cooking all day - as good as or better than the best I've had in restaurants. Add meat if you like, otherwise it's perfect right out of the bag.<br /><br />You can tell the manufacturer knows how special their product is, by the way. The heavy, insulated packaging materials are clearly designed to preserve the aroma of the ingredients. Just lovely stuff. Buy some and see!<br /><br />PS: Another commenter mentioned the saltiness of the soup. I'm not getting that, but I'd bet it's a question of the water/soup mix ratio. "Too salty" probably means it was cooked too long, or as I say too much mix was in the water. Thing is, many people think pea soup should be, er, 'as thick as pea soup'. But I'd err on the 'thin' side with this soup. (Same goes for clam chowder. Many people think it needs to be thick. But the best chowder I ever had was no thicker than any other soup. Thickness is easier to achieve than good flavor, so many purveyors of pea soup or clam chowder err on the side of chunkiness.)
