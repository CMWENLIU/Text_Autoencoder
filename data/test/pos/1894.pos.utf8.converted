The Z-Bones Dental Chews are great!  I was looking for a dental chew that both of my dogs would like, in addition to being a healthy and effective chew.  I have a Sheltie and a Chihuahua (they make a funny couple), and while they are not super chewers like Labs, they do like to chew (including the Chihuahua surprisingly!).  Well, both dogs loved these chews.  They liked the smell and couldn't wait for me to open the re-sealable plastic bag, which was inside the box, keeping them fresh.  Both dogs got right down to chewing the bones and the Sheltie finished his in one sitting, while the Chihuahua almost did!  Even the piece of the Z-Bone that was left (about a 1/3) was finished by the Chihuahua in a couple of days.  It was also nice that the Z-Bone lasted quite a while for both dogs, rather than disappearing in just a few minutes.  I just thought I would share my experience with other dog owners, since I have appreciated the feedback provided by others on different products, which has resulted in great purchases, helping me to avoid poor choices and saving me money.  Thanks!
