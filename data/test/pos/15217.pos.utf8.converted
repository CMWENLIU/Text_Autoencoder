After our local Aldi stopped carrying the similar product I was used to buying, I was very happy to find Mestemacher Whole Rye bread on Amazon. This is very close to the Russian whole rye bread that I grew up with. I am glad it was that easy. This bread freezes great and will last me for a while. I will buy another case when the first batch will be gone. Thanks,<br />Anna
