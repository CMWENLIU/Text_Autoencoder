I bought these cherries because they were<br />  1) 2.5 times cheaper than local store's cherries sold in small quantities<br />  2) Perfect Amazon.com reviews<br /><br />Everyone who has tried these cherries loved them.  They're perfect.<br /><br />PRICE CAUTION<br />-------------<br />I have seen the price double for these cherries and then drop down again.  My target price is in the lower $20s, and with the subscribe and save option you can get them below $20.
