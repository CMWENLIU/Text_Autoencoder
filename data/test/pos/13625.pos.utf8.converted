I agree with the 5-star reviews for this product.  These noodles are excellent tasting, have a good texture and cook up very quickly (4 to 5 min in boiling water).  I have not really bought many soba noodles in the past, so I'm not sure how these US-made noodles compare to authentic Asian soba.<br /><br />It is easy to saute some veggies and make a quick sauce (or use a purchased sauce), for a weeknight meal.  I often cook the whole box then divide in half, making 1/2 as a hot stir-fry dinner and then save the other 1/2 (plain noodles) to use the next day.  I put the left-over noodles in the microwave for a brief time (just to bring them to room temp) then assemble the salad.  Amazingly, the noodles taste fresh and good the next day, possibly better tasting than freshly cooked.  I'm sure they would make a great noodle soup, although I have not tried yet.<br /><br />Ingredients are unbleached enriched wheat flour, buckwheat flour, water, egg whites, salt.  They seem pretty healthy and have a decent amount of fiber, although they are probably not as healthy as a 100% whole wheat pasta, for example.  For the 12 oz box, 6 servings/box, amounts per serving: 200 cal (10 from fat), 3g fiber, 390mg sodium, 8g protein, 10% iron.  Also, great price from Amazon.
