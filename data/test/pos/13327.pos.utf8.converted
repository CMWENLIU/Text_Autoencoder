Purchased a 6oz home popcorn machine for the theater room and the hunt was on for a pre-packaged popcorn that would provide that "movie theater" taste.  The first popcorn we tried was Country Harvest and the family enjoyed that popcorn and we went through the 36-packages in relatively short order.  When it came time to order another box of pre-packaged corn, I went with Gold Medal's MegaPop based on the recommendation from a friend.  Gold Medal also makes a very nice, heavy-duty commercial use popcorn machine, and figured they would have a good tasting popcorn.<br /><br />The popcorn pre-packaged has two compartments; 1) oil; and 2) popcorn mixed with salt.<br /><br />Well, made the first batch of Mega Pop and my daughter was all excited when she tasted the popcorn, screaming it tastes just like the movie theater!!  Couldn't agree more!!  The taste was GREAT!!!  The majority of the popcorn popped no problem, with very few old maids.  If you want to control the amount of salt and want your popcorn to have a little less salty taste, (which is what I like) just shake the bag and don't use as much of the salt that pools at the bottom of the popcorn.  I have a feeling that this box isn't going to last long!!<br /><br />Now, my daughter has a sleep-over scheduled with six of her friends and wants me to make lots of this specific popcorn for her friends.
