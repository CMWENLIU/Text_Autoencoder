I tried just about every kind of K-cup, looking for my perfect coffee. After trying, Tullys French Roast, I just started enjoying it and stopped looking. I wanted coffee that was dark, rich, bold, and enjoyable. This did it for me. I recommend it.<br /><br />EDITED to say that Tully's Kona coffee is great as well. Which is my favorite now? I'm not sure. Both are delicious!<br /><br />EDITED once more months later to say that my favorites are now:<br /><br />1) Italian<br />2) French<br />3) House<br />4) Kona if I want something with a very strong taste.
