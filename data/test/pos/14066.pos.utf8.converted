I found an interesting product at my local Costco Warehouse store. It's cans of Kirkland Signature premium chunk chicken breast packed in water. The individual cans are 12.5 ounces and the entire packet is six cans. I couldn't resist. I like to have things like this in the pantry because they can yield almost instant meals without the need to run to the market. Today, for example, I made up a batch of chicken with rice soup using a can of this chicken along with the seasoned water packing, some cut up baby carrots, celery and a brown/wild rice mixture plus a few spices from the kitchen cabinet. The whole thing was done in an hour and made up a delicious meal. So easy. Tasted great. Economical, too.<br /><br />This is excellent chicken and will lend itself to all kinds of dishes. It's tender and tasty and has a nice chunky appearance. It comes with a little starter recipe book and improvisations are welcome and easy. It's an excellent addition to my pantry.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
