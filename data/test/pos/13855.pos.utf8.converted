I am a tea lover.  I won't touch coffee, not even mocha or coffee icecream.  Over the years I've gotten to know various different teas and tea brands.  Adagio is one of the best brands I've tried and its prices are better than average for tea of this quality.<br /><br />Yunnan Gold is Adagio's premium grade Yunnan tea.  Its lower grade, Yunnan Jig, is quite good and very inexpensive, but Yunnan gold is fantastic.  It is an assertive tea, able to stand up nicely to milk and sugar, but it isn't the slightest bit bitter.  I have had it black and it was still tasty, but I prefer to have black teas light and sweet.  Even when I have accidentally over-steeped it (you should steep it for about 3 minutes), it was smooth and mellow.  There is a natural sweetness to this tea and very complex flavors that are spicy yet subtle.<br /><br />FYI, this is considered a black tea.  Black teas are so named, based upon how long they are allowed to ferment.  Green tea has the least fermentation, oolong has some fermentation, and black teas are allowed to reach complete fermentation.  Generally speaking the more a tea is fermented the more caffiene it contains.<br /><br />This is a perfect all day tea.  A pleasure first thing in the morning, and yet delightful all day and into the night (it has caffiene so if you have insomnia avoid drinking it and all caffiene beverages after 4 PM).  If you like bold tea, like a hearty Assam or Cylon, this tea might be too delicate for you, although I still suggest you give it a try, you might be seduced by its many virtues.
