I love this for breakfast but have only found it once in my local stores.  I'm thrilled that I can get it through Amazon.  Additionally, the lower sugar content makes it an appropriate choice to help me control my diabetes. My only jibe is that they put 8 Peaches & Cream and only 4 Strawberries & Cream in each box.  I wish it were 6 and 6 since I like them both.
