This is so much better than food coloring.  It only takes a very small amount to ad color to icing, cake batter, and cookie dough.  Some colors (especially red and black)when you are trying to get the deep rich color may leave a little after taste.  Try adding some alcohol based extracts (alcohol based extracts will not thin your icing like some artificial products will).  When trying to get the true black color, try starting with chocolate icing then ad the black color.  It requires less coloring thus less after taste.  These are the only 2 colors that I had a problem with after taste.  This product is great and I will continue to reorder this product.
