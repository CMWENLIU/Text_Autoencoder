I visited a friend and she had me try C2O Coconut water.  I loved it, great in the morning or anytime.  A nice refreshing taste and it felt so good doing down, like I was doing something good for my body.  That was an unexpected bonus.<br /><br />Because of the price, I decided to taste test all of the coconut waters so I bought a few of each brand - Zico, A&B w/pulp, Vita Coconut, O.N.E to compare.  C2O just was the most refreshing and full flavored, tasted like the real thing.<br /><br />All of the brands I bought say they're just natural coconut water, but there is definitely a taste difference.  One has an after taste, another seemed watered down or flat, but C2O was consistantly good.<br /><br />The main problem is price.  I bought a case of C2O from Amazon last week, think it was $29. and free shipping.  I didnt realize it was on "Sale".  This week Amazon has it for $43.  Give me a break, that price difference is ridiculous.<br /><br />Amazon needs to work on their pricing for this product or else I'm going else where to buy.  Heard even Hi-Health had it for much cheaper than Amazon....<br /><br />Also, in reading some of the coconut water reviews, I started laughing at the "dented" cans.  Every one of the cans in my 12 case was dented when I received my shipment.  I thought it was odd at the time, but then saw this happened to others.  What's with that?
