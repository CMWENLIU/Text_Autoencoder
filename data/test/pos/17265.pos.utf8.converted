I've tried a number of stevia products, and all of them had a nasty aftertaste. Not SweetLeaf, though. So far I've only used it to sweeten my coffee, but the result is absolutely pure sweetness. I couldn't ask for a better taste. Now, granted sugar sets a standard, but sugar has a taste that comes additive to sweetness; SweetLeaf has a bit of an additive taste to it, too, and it ain't sugar, but neither is it something horribly bitter like some of the other stevia products.<br /><br />I particularly love the fact that SweetLeaf is the real deal. Unlike, say, Truvia, which is a proprietary blend and a misnomer, SweetLeaf is pure stevia.
