Veggie Booty is very yummy.  Both my toddler and I love it, and snack on it regularly.  I'm thrilled to see it's available in 1 oz bags - that is the perfect serving size, and this way it can't get stale.  (Um... and it will help me control my serving size.)  1 oz counts as 1 starch and 1 fat if you are tracking your food exchanges.  It is crispy, flavorful, a tiny bit salty, and really addictive.  It has a high vitamin A content too.  It's a winner!!
