I have my own wheat grinder and find that baked goods made with freshly ground flour are SUPERIOR to using whole wheat flour from the shelf in any store.  They taste better, rise higher (in bread), and are all-around fresher.<br /><br />These wheat berries were fresh and yummy.  I made everything from whole wheat:<br /><br />waffles, banana bread, muffins, dinner rolls, pizza crust...next to try is homemade bread<br /><br />My husband AND 3 kids under 5 loved everything I made.  (Also sweetened with no sugar, just honey and/or maple syrup.)  The white wheat is much lighter in consistency and even guests would never guess the waffles are whole wheat.  They are much better tasting, in my opinion, than white flour, and have many more nutrients.<br /><br />By the way, the white wheat is still WHOLE wheat, just a different type of wheat!<br /><br />We used the entire 25 pound bag and just ordered our second.  I also ordered 10lb or the hard wheat so I could try mixing them together, since the harder wheat has more protein.  I hope you enjoy it as much as our family does!  :-)
