I had a hard time finding this information when I searched for it, so I thought I'd type it up in case anyone else was wondering what comes free with your new Blu-ray copy of "Beetlejuice":<br /><br />1. Danny Elfman - "Main Titles"<br />2. Danny Elfman - "Enter ... 'The Family'/Sand Worm Planet"<br />3. Danny Elfman - "The Aftermath"<br />4. Danny Elfman - "Showtime!"<br />5. Harry Belafonte - "The Banana Boat Song" (worth the price of the Blu-ray disc itself!)<br />6. Danny Elfman - "End Credits"
