I really like this flavor. It's very unique and unlike the Strawberry Banana flavor, this flavor of Blueberry Pomegranate actually tastes like the name. The number one ingredient is Apple Juice, but in this case it doesn't detract from the main flavor of the drink, which is blueberry. There is no added sugar and is sweetened with Stevia, an all-natural plant. I am an energy drink guru so to speak, I have tried about every brand out there from red bull to rockstar, and thus I am used to the bad taste from most energy drinks. With 70 percent juice, these Jamba Juice energy drinks are a much better tasting and healthier alternative. The only complaint I have is there is no ginseng added which would make this more of a complete energy beverage. With Amazon's Subscribe-and-Save feature it brings the cost per can down to $1.77. not bad.
