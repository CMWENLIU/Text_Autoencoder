I had some of these when I went to Germany. They amazed me with their  taste. Inside the little balls lies a core of a smoothly malty goodness that has my mouth watering as I write this. I got mine for around 2 euros, if I remember correctly, but $4 for these is definitely worth it. These are great. If you have never tried one, I strongly urge you to either travel to Europe or get these. You will not regret it, that I guarantee.
