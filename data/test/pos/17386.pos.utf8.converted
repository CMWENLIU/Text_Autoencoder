I bought a couple bottles of this from a local gas station (Michigan) the other day. The owner told me it was bought from Mexico. I tried it side by side with locally distributed Coca Cola, and noticed it tastes like the Coca Cola I remembered as a child. The local Coca Cola does not compare. I attribute the difference mainly to the use of cane sugar in the Mexican product. The aroma of this product is better as is the taste. The greensish tinted bottle gives it a nostalgic feel, but it is the taste and aroma that sold me. Additionally, the local product was overly carbonated, perhaps to have a longer shelf life. If you are looking for the way coca cola used to taste, this is it!
