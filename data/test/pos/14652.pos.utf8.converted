In my attempt to find a vegan alternative to mayonaise, I ran across this product.  I also read about it in The Starch Solution as it was recommended by the author who is also a physician.  The ingredients are all things that I can recogonize, so that's a huge plus for me.  As far as taste goes... It's not bad, actually, it's quite good.  I'm a vegan who isn't big on soy products and tries to shy away from most of them.  When possible, I'll almost always go for the non-soy alternative.  However, that being said, I'm glad that I gave this product a go, because it is now my mayo replacement.  I'll have no problems using this as a mayo replacement in the kitchen.  The texture is smooth, just like mayo, and the smell is very mayo-like.<br /><br />There's only one issue with Nayonaise that people may not like, and that's the consistency.  It is a little bit more on the liquid state than regular mayo, not much, but a little.  I guess that can be good or bad depending on your use.  It's not a factor for me though.  At 14oz, the jar does seem a little on the small size for what you're paying, so you might want to consider buying an extra jar of it, or look at the 24oz size.
