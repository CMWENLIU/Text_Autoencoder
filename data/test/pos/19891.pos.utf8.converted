I have enjoyed the intense flavor, versatility, and healthful benefits of cocoa nibs for many years.  These nibs from Navitas are of consistently high quality and I recommend them to anyone who is looking for nibs. Nibs may be used to make chocolate.  I use them for a wide range of culinary purposes including: crunchy addition to yogurt, berries, desserts, ground with coffee beans for coffee.  I sometimes incorporate them into sauces if I'm not feeling lazy.  I like to cook but I tend to stick to simple things without sauces.  Unless you grind these things, only eat them if you are certain of the strength of your teeth as they are hard.  The flavor and aroma are mindful of chocolate, but unlike chocolate there is no sugar and they have a bitter finish.  I like it but your experience may vary.
