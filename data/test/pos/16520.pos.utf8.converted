This delightful selection of quality chocolate goodies made a big impact on Christmas day and provided the whole family (7) with a variety of irresistible temptations which proved far too difficult to exercise any kind of self-control over. It took less than two days for everything to be inspected, anticipated, eaten and discussed and now it appears that this is a requirement for all occasions and celebrations. Highly recommended for those without a nervous disposition concerning their wastelines but who love excellent chocolate treats.
