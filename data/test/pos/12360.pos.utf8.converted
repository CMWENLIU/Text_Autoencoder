I am fat, but I'm currently trying to change that. Not being a body builder I wondered if this product was for me, and I was very happy with the results. I keep these with me on days that I can't prepare a meal or when I am tired of my diet food and want something that has a little more hearty flavor. Caveat is: just like turkey-jerky, if you didn't know you were eating ostrich you might think that it tastes a bit different. Keep in mind that ostrich tastes more like chicken than beef.<br /><br />The Good:<br />Compact (will fit in cargo pocket)<br />Tasty<br />Fairly low salt<br />Semi-Moist (good or bad depending on your taste)<br />80 calories<br />Great for diets<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Hard to open sometimes<br />A bit large to fit in pocket (won't fit in standard pants pocket)<br />Co-workers think you are weird to eat Ostrich<br />A little expensive<br /><br />So, with all that said, I keep a box of these in my cupboard at all times just in case I need a snack and I don't want to go off-diet. Buy a box and see what you think.
