GREAT GREAT GREAT PRODUCT! The milk is GOD SENT for babies with sensitive tummies, who cannot take cow milk and/or soy. My 3-months old daughter had reflux, high acid level in her tummy, colics, gas and constipation varying with diarrhea. My husband and I are both foreign residents in Switzerland and I have to say that Swiss formula market is apolling in terms of choice, and useless doctors just kept medicating her instead of changing the cow milk formula to something more appropriate, just gave her more and more different drugs which only added to the problem. At some point she was crying all day long for several days!! I stopped listening to the doctors and did some online research- tried soy milk formula and lactose free formula (both Nestle), no changes. I tried all 3-4 cow milk formulas available on the Swiss market (Adapta, Holle, Milupa, Nestle) - no changes!<br />Finally I found a can of Meyenberg goat powder milk in the house, which I had bought previously for my organic cosmetics hobby- and gave it a try in a pure desperation. WHAT A CHANGE! She is like a different baby. ALL PROBLEMS GONE INSTANTLY- on the same day. I took the baby off all the medications these so-called specialists were overmedicating her with ( I am changing the pediatrician as well), and she feels perfect and is happier than I've ever seen her. I am stashing up with this milk now for a long time, as no Meyenberg milk is sold locally. Would highly recommend this product to all parents looking for a healthy  solution for their babies- goat milk protein is much easier to digest by small tummies. Furthermore, historically, long before any commercial baby formulas were invented, goat milk (and NOT cow milk!!! soy was not even on the menu) was used for centuries to feed babies by mothers who could not breastfeed. Today, when everything is Marketing-driven and cow milk manufacturers are dominating the market, this fact is totally forgotten, and all of a sudden other products are advertised to be appropriate (on top of that commercial brands stuff their formulas with all sorts of ingredients and chemicals their imagination can come up with- no matter if good for babies or not). The Meyenberg goat milk has few, simple ingredients which do not overwhelm small tummies, it is fantastically nutricious, natural and tasty. My daughter cannot get enough of it- I never saw her having such a healthy appetite towards any other milk she was given.<br /><br />The only request to the seller (the Vitamine Shoppe - actually one of the most professional sellers on Amazon)- please please please speed up your order processing! Although it arrived earlier than estimated (7 days instead of estimated 9 days after the order was placed), but the order processing itself took 5 days before it was actually shipped by expedited shipping. This is far too long, if the baby cannot eat anything else. If you could process orders faster- it would help a lot!<br />Thank you very much for shipping this product to Switzerland anyway (I think it is almost the only reliable seller who does)- it's a life savior.
