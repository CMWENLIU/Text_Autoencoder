I used to buy some freeze dried hashbrowns from costco, however they discontinued the excellent product in their stores.  I searched everywhere online to find a similar product and eventually found these.<br /><br />Although this is an enormous amount of hashbrowns for purchase for me and my wife at our home, they have a long shelf life so we took the chance.  These turned out to be even better than the costco ones.  They turn out golden brown with tons of potato-eee flavor!  These are the best hashbrowns you can purchase anywhere, and I am a hashbrown aficionado!  If you don't know already, most of the restaurants that have superb hashbrowns use these freeze dried style hashbrowns.  A friend of mine owned a huddle house and it is what they used.<br /><br />BTW, don't let the picture deceive you, one of these cartons is about the size of the human head, and you are receiving three of these.
