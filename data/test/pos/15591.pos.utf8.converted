I have been dissapointed at the store recently with my Top Sirloins.  I am not even sure what meat group they are selling.  Anyway gang you can never go wrong with Omaha.  Delivery is fast and you receive them in a little igloo type thing with dry ice inside.  The steaks are wonderful and I will definitely purchase more when I see the sale I like.<br /><br />Joan from Maryland
