I made cookies with this and it was refreshing taste that I remember from when I was a child. When I bought this I bought due to reviews that I have read all over the net and only bought a small amount to see if I would like it as well. I used it cup for cup in my family recipes and so far everything has turned out great and taste. The only thing I fine is that the cook time is a bit longer than what it is with gluten flours, but this has been the trend with most gf products that I have cooked such as pasta. Besides using old family recipes I have also done the recipe that was on the box for Italian bread rolls and they were taste and not dry. My family uses them for buns, they work great
