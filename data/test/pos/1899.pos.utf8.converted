I was very pleasantly surprised when I first tried Smart Bran. I love its crunchy texture and great flavor, all the more because it is low in sodium and low in sugar without resorting to using Aspartame. The fact that all of the ingredients are organic is a definite health plus. I have been eating Fiber One original (the "twigs") for years because it seemed to be the only really high fiber cereal (14 grams)and was not loaded with sugar in one form or another. It is sweetened with Aspartame, however, contains corn oil, guar gum and a few other less-than-desireable ingredients, and is primarily corn bran. Smart Bran is composed of Oat Bran which has been shown to help reduce high cholesterol. I haven't heard anything about corn bran in that regard. Smart Bran also contains psyllium in a very tasty form & works great for keeping the lower digestive track functioning efficiently. I mix a rounded quarter cup of Smart Bran with fresh fruit and cottage cheese for my breakfast most mornings and find it's a great way to start the day. Buying it through Amazon in a 6 pack saves me more than $1.50 per box over local supermarket prices, and I don't have to worry about it being out of stock.  I highly recommend Smart Bran, and look forward to incorporating it in my baking as well.
