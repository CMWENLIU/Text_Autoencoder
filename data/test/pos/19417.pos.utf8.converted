I had to write a review of this raspberry licorice, after completing my review of the "original" black variety.  For starters, if you are craving something fruity and chewy, this is for you.  I love the sweet, slightly tangy flavor of raspberries in this licorice, as well as the soft texture.  You can easily chew it, and it is very satisfying.  What's more, it is fat free.  So, no guilt here!  Just keep it out of reach, on a high shelf, so you don't consume it all at once!
