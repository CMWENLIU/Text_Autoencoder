My father-in-law recommended that I get the flax seed mill, as part of a healthier, more nutritious diet. I ordered the flax seed mill and noticed the muffin recipe on the back that I wanted to try, especially after all of the wonderful reviews here. Only one problem...I hadn't gotten the oat bran. So I ordered it, then tried the muffin recipe and...WHOA!!! Absolutely fantastic! Then I tried it as a hot cereal, adding a tbsp of the flax seed mill, a dash of salt, a few chopped walnuts, frozen blueberries and a touch of maple syrup. OMHolyGod, is this stuff tasty!!! So, I have a bowl of it for breakfast, and maybe a bowl for lunch (if I'm in a rush, I'll pack a couple of the muffins). It's so light and filling, without making you "full", and you can rest assured knowing that you're getting all the fiber you need for the day. Keeps me regular (an added bonus), and my cholesterol in check. I'm a very happy gal!!!
