I love flavored coffee. I would rather think a "regular" cup of flavored coffee than an expensive coffee drink (e.g. carmel macchiato)anyday. That being said I have tried lots of brands, from flavored folgers to Seattle's Best. I have to say of them all Arbuckles has the most unusual flavors, fast delivery, and great gift assortments. I purchased this as a gift for the holidays and I am buying another for Birthdays. If you love flavored coffee, Arbukles is the way to go!
