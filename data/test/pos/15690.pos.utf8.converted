The doctor in our newspaper has posted letters from people with arthritis who drink a mixture of a few spoonfuls of Certo mixed with unsweetened Grape juice, a few times a day.  These people have had relief from arthritis.<br /><br />After researching the folk remedy, and finding answers on [...], I tried it.  After about a week, I was suffering a noticeable decrease of pain in an area of my back where there are severely degenerated discs.<br /><br />The Certo+grape juice remedy did not help the neuropathy in my hands or the undiagnosed pain in my neck.  However, I'm happy with the results, and I sent a Thank You letter to the doctor in the newspaper.<br /><br />Certo is available in my supermarket above the puddings, but the 4-pack on Amazon.com is a much better buy, by about 35%.  (Besides which, you get bonus points for using your Amazon Visa card if you buy it here.)
