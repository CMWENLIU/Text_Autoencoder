I have always ground my own flax seed to get the full benefits of flax. I purchased this product after my grinder gave out on me and I needed more ground flax seed. In the meantime, I purchased the flaxseed meal until I found the grinder I was looking for. I am very pleased with this product because it has a nice texture. The meal I made ended up like flour but this meal has a bit of the seed in tack for a good crunch that makes it a nice added topping to yogurts, cereal, etc. Now when I buy a new grinder it will be used just for coffee beans and I will purchase this product again because I could not grind the seed the way Bob's Red Mill product does.
