I absolutely love this chai.  It's not too sweet like the chai that is commonly sold in grocery stores and coffee shops.  It has even passed my "blind" taste test-- I had some at a small restaurant and asked the waitress what kind it was because I loved it so much.  A few months later, I noticed that Coffee Plantation, my favorite place to order chai, uses it as well.  Way better than Oregon Chai!
