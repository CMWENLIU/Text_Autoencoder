If classic chai is your cup of tea, I don't think you'll find one better than Rishi's. My suggestion is to prepare it in the traditional manner, i.e., for every 1 - 1.5 tablespoons of chai, use 1/2 cup of whole milk, 3/4 cup of water, and 1.5 tablespoons of white sugar. Bring the chai and liquids to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for five minutes; I add the sugar after straining (it's supposed to be very sweet; add less if you like). It's really a yummy pick-me-up.<br />Rishi makes a number of organic chai blends, none of which, unfortunately, are available from Amazon at the time of this writing. I'm now going to make a confession: as good as Organic Masala Chai is, I actually prefer the other blends, all of which I prepare in the aforementioned classic manner.<br />One is called Maghreb Mint; it has a green rather than black tea base, and as its name indicates, is spiced differently from a classic chai. This one also tastes best sweetened with white sugar and is delicious. However, I drink a LOT of really fine tea (much of it from Rishi) that should be drunk "straight up," hence I'd rather have my chai "tea-free" (a contradiction in terms, I realize). My two absolute favorites are Rishi's rooibos-based chai blends: one is called Rooibos Chai and the other, confusingly enough, Rooibos Chai Caffeine-Free. Since neither of these blends contain (as far as I can tell) caffeine, the choice of names is unfortunate [UPDATE: these have since been renamed "Rooibos Chai" and "West Cape Chai," respectively and are both caffeine-free]. The one not designated caffeine-free contains something called "ramon nut" which adds a lovely, chocolatey flavor, and which is also an ingredient in another caffeine-free Rishi offering called Rainforest Chai which I also like but which some might find too peppery. These both, I find, taste better sweetened with honey or Volcanic Nectar blue agave nectar rather than sugar.<br />All of the Rishi chais can be found at Whole Foods or direct from Rishi. With any luck, Rishi will start packaging some of these other blends in canisters and Amazon will carry them; they're wonderful!
