I bought this package when I extended my fence. I cannot comment on the posts that are included within the kit because I was using wooden fence posts with plastic extenders to hold the wire. I use the hot wire to contain my four dogs and it works perfectly. I previously had a higher model number from the same company, but the power was too much for the dogs...it was designed for livestock. This kit provides the right amount of power to contain my dogs that range from 30-100 pounds. Even when they touched it (when it was first installed), they did not scream like they did with my first power unit. This kit provides the enough juice to get the point across to the dogs without the guilt of hurting them.
