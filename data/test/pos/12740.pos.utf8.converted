I 1st got this flavor as a gift along with my new Keurig. I am extremely upset that the flavor is discontinued. Granted I am not a Cappuccino drinker, never even tried it. I do like regular coffee but I normally need a ton of sugar or Equal to be able to drink it. I've tried numerous K-cup flavors and this was the ONLY one I could drink without really any sugar in it. I used to drink it as a dessert or just as a treat and now it's gone. Thanks to a bunch of people who complained about having no foam like the regular stuff. REALLY PEOPLE?? Get a freakin grip and get over yourselves. Big deal, something doesn't look or taste EXACTLY like the originals and you have to bust chops about it. If you didn't like it, drink the regular stuff. Why complain about it to the company and on reviews? Now the people that actually like the flavor won't be able to get it anymore after a while and now it's at a ridiculous price due to the supply and demand factor. So thanks a bunch to you people. It always has to be the complainers to ruin it for everyone else. Another great flavored product gone by the stupidity of others.
