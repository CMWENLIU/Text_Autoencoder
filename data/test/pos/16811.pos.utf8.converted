My cats have been on Natural Balance dry and canned food for more than 6 months, and I am not going back to any other brand.<br />First of all, the can is 6 oz. so it's more food for a reasonable price.<br />Most importantly, the dry and canned foods are nutritious, all-round, and healthy. Consumer reports (online)researched them and found them to be the best cat food out there. And now, my cats can prove it. They don't eat so much, have maintained their weight, and their coats are so soft and glossy that I can't stop petting them.<br />Indoor formula and Ultra is their favorite, along with Salmon.
