After reading that Bentley's has the finest Ceylon teas in the world, I decided to give this as a Christmas gift to my husband.  He says it is the best tea he's ever had, and since he is somewhat of a tea connoisseur, I would consider that a compliment.  The box is beautiful, and it makes a lovely presentation.
