I have 2 black lab mix dogs (littermates).  They are now 2 years old.  They didn't tell me when I got them that part of the mix was beaver.  These dogs can chew anything.  If it squeaks, it takes on average 10 seconds from being new to being destroyed.  Don't even get me started on toys that have stuffing.  Within the last two weeks, I've started allowing them to be uncrated in my house without me there.  Previously, they were completely untrustworthy, but I feel really guilty crating them while I'm at work.  And I thought they were acting more grown up.  Not chewing my stuff, just theirs.  So, I came home one day to find a highlighter destroyed (on carpeting, of course).  The next day the victim was one of their dog beds that they'd always left alone.  So, out of desperation I tried this product (and paid way more than the price at Amazon at a local pet store).  These things are AWESOME.  They keep their attention for hours and a treat lasts for about 2 days.  My one dog loves hers so much that she's like obsessed with it.  And the material it's made of seems to be unchewable to them (which I initially worried about, having not found anything in nature or manmade that they couldn't destroy).  I love these things.
