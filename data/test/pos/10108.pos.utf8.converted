My bull terriers can't get enough of these chews! I have searched high and low for the perfect chew - one that lasts and also one that is safe. I have spent a fortune on chews and the "stuffed" hooves are the best, also smoked knee bones are excellent.<br /><br />I have never had the hooves splinter or cause any safety problems.  This may be a potential problem with really large dogs who can really get their jaws around the hoof and crunch it maybe...so far no problems with my bullies.<br /><br />The natural "stuffing" is all the dried flesh and bones attached to the hoof that most brands remove, this is the best part for my pooches. They absolutely love getting all the stuff out of the hoof...takes a lot of time and distracts them for hours.<br /><br />Also, all of the other "chew-hooves" I have bought have a HORRIBLE death-cow-poo smell which made me want to vomit if my dog was chewing them around me. For some reason, this brand just kind of has a mild, smoked-meat smell. No rotten, nasty smell with these.<br /><br />i would definitely supervise a dog with one of these for the first time, since you never know how they will do with a new chewie.<br /><br />Hope this helps!
