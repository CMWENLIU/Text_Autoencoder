I had read all the reviews on this product and realized people either hate these or love these noodles.  So, I bought them.  I'm on the hCG diet and everyone was talking about them.  Do you eat them in P2 or not?  There is a huge difference in opinion on that subject, but, I wanted to add something with a little substance about 2 weeks into P2, so, bought them.  I was afraid to open because so many had said there was a fish smell.  But, there was none.  Still, I rinsed them for about 3 minutes in a collander under running water anyway just in case there was a strange taste.  Which there wasn't.  They DO look like pasta, but....<br /><br />They ARE NOT Pasta!<br />I would NEVER mix them with pasta sauce<br />DO think asian dishes - put them in a brothy soup or stir fry (P3 for the stir fry)<br />LESS is MORE!<br />They will "blob" up on you.  You need to pull some strands out and add to your broth.  Just dumping them in won't work - they stay in a blob.<br />Taste is NOT PASTA!  They tend to take on the flavors you are cooking them in.  Personally, I didn't feel they had any flavor, mainly just added substance to my soup.<br /><br />Will I use them on round 2 of phase 2 again?  Absolutely.  They ARE filling.  Everyone warns that if you are using in P2, just be careful.  See how you react to them on the scale the next morning.  Some people do fine, others gain a pound.  Again, I would not make a meal out of them, especially the first time.  Maybe add a couple forkfuls and see how you like them, AND, how the scale likes them.<br /><br />I think the negative reviews were from people that were looking for a pasta alternative.  I cannot emphasize enough that there is no comparison to pasta - do not expect these to replace or taste anything like pasta!  You will be extremely disappointed.
