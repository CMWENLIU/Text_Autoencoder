I should preface this review by saying that I don't actually like the taste of coconut water, at all.  But I keep hearing about the benefits of coconut water so I thought that the flavored coconut water would be better.  I bought both the pineapple and the peach mango, fully expecting to like the peach mango more.  Unfortunately, the peach mango was not for me, I'm pretty sure the coconut water flavor was stronger in that than in straight coconut water.  However, the pineapple one is a great!  The pineapple flavor is not strong, but it almost completely masks the coconut water flavor, so that it tastes like a delicate pineapple drink.  It doesn't have a strong flavor, but a pleasant, light pineapple flavor.  I would recommend this for anyone that wants to get coconut water, but doesn't care for the taste.
