I have the Keurig My K-Cup and found it to be annoying to have to pull out the insert to use it after I use an actual k-cup.  This eliminates that and I've found it to make a better cup of coffee as well.  It's a nice one piece design so no messing with the 3 pieces like the My K-cup.  Works great.
