This is the only gluten free flour I have found that works just as well as regular flour. I have made pie crusts, cookies, zucchini bread, pancakes--you name it I use my original recipes and substitue the flour with this product.  I only use 1/2 the amount of baking soda and powder because it already has some in it. We only have 1  of 3 children that needs gluten free and the others dont notice when I give them this.
