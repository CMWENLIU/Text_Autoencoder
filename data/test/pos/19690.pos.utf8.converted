What I love BEST about this is that it gives me gas.  Don't ask me why... I buy a container when I have the extra money (it's not cheap) and giggle like a kid when the farts start about 3 hours after consumption.  This is just for the original flavor, the chocolate just gives me runny poop.. not quite diarrhea but you know what I mean.<br /><br />I think the chocolate flavor has changed over the years but I can't quite define how.  Both flavors used to come in glass containers.  Since Carnation switched to plastic, the quantity you get for the money has decreased but that also applies to cereal, snacks, etc.
