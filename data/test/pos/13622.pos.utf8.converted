I think the K20 protein drinks are fantastic. I am a vegetarian and am always looking for ways to supplement my protein intake.<br /><br />I first tried the actual bottled drinks for K2O; I was disappointed that there was only about 5g of protein (about 2/3 cup of milk), but when I tried the drink and found, not only no aftertaste as many of the other protein drinks out there have, but excellent flavors... I was hooked. My problem is that even in bulk... they were priced at around $2 a bottle (around $24 for 12 bottles) which is out of my budget.<br /><br />Then came the powders which you can just mix in a 16-20 oz cup or bottle of water. If I buy a case of bulk water at my local warehouse for around $5 (or just use filtered water at home) the cost for 28 bottles is now anywhere from about $5-$10 less than the price of only 12 premixed bottles. Plus they are significantly easier to transport to work.<br /><br />Now I have the best of all worlds... added protein to my vegetarian diet... low calorie, great tasting drinks... and a very reasonable price. I have them on subscription now!
