I bought these not sure what to expect.  When I tried them, they taste just like a good chili without the vegetables.  This makes these beans great side dish to a vegetable or whatever.  These are a nice option in addition to the regular Eden beans, which are the very best beans.  Not to mention they are BPA free.  These are very good, as are all Eden products.
