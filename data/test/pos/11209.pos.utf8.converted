I don't eat a lot of sugary sweet things but I like a little syrup on a pancake or two. I usally buy from the grocery grade A in a little bottle for about $8 and was happy with it. I got to tell you the day I got this I opened it up to taste it and was amazed at the flavor so much so I poured a little glass and drank it! Everyone that stopped over at my house the following few days got a spoon full and I made them try it. I use to make the pancakes maybe once a week, now its 2-3 times, it just tastes that good to me. My bottle is almost gone already.<br />I am sure it varies bottle to bottle year to year but I just loved it.
