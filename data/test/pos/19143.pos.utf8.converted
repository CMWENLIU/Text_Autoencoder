These crackers were my very favorite childhood snack.  The lightness of the waffles and the tanginess of the "cheez" are a perfect marriage.  Every time I go home to Atlanta to visit, I scour the stores looking for them.  The last time I was in Atlanta I could not find any.  My sister suggested that I try online...voila!! Amazon came through for me.  I'm stocked up for the next few months, but I will certainly order them again.
