I used to be a coffee drinker, grind my own beans, you know the drill. I read an article about how beneficial green tea is, and I decided to try this stuff. I was surprised because it has a fruity aroma, and with a dab of honey, it is delicious. I had tried green tea in the past, and it tasted awful. This stuff is good! It's supposed to keep my blood pressure down, so we'll see.
