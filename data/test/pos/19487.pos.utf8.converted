The description may be a little unclear, so just to clarify, you are getting 12 boxes, each box has 3 packets, so a total of 36 packets.  Each packet makes 1Qt of milk.  Those of you that have purchased powdered milk before will see how convenient this this.  To get powdered for a reasonable price at the store, you need to buy the biggest box they have.  The problem there is that as soon as you open it, you need to find better containers to store it in, preferably air tight and not made of plastic.<br /><br />The smaller packets you get with this product remove the need to find secondary storage containers.  Because you don't have to open it all at once, you don't have to worry about the moisture making the milk go bad, or light reducing the vitamin quality.<br /><br />If you have never used powdered milk before, there are some nice benefits.  The main benefit to me is that it doesn't go bad.  I don't drink enough milk to justify buying it by the gallon, and even buying half gallon sizes it would go bad before I could use it.  With powdered milk I never have to worry about it going bad, nor do I need to wonder if I have milk on hand.<br /><br />Now, as for taste, I don't drink milk by itself, powdered or not.  I've read that if you do, it's best to mix it up and then let it sit in the fridge for a few hours.  I use it in protein shakes, where it tastes no different than regular milk.  I imagine it would be great for things like smoothies as well.<br /><br />Another great use for powdered milk is adding it to coffee.  Much healthier for you than powdered non-dairy creamer, and just as creamy and delicious.  And, unlike regular milk, the powdered milk will not cool down your coffee nearly as much.  I've gotten a few people hooked on using powdered milk in their coffee.
