I'm reading the other reviews and I'm quite shocked!!!<br />This is absolutely one of the best commercial coffee blends you can find out there. not too bitter not to sweet, excellent crema, delightful!<br />I have a Gaggia espresso machine, I drink it every morning and occasionally make cappuccino to my guests, they all L-O-V-E it.<br />Warmly recommended, light years better than the sour-greasy-burnt American coffee (Starbucks, Seattle's Best, Peet's etc...)
