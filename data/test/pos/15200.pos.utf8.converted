This Tea Is very Very Good! My Husband and I drink it ALL THE TIME it is easy to make and a lot less expensive then 3.50 a glass at Thai places. I sweeten it with sugar and sweetened condensed milk and then add half and half, heavy cream or even just milk to it!<br />my recipe is 1/4 cup tea to 4 cups of boiling water and then after it steeps about 10 minutes I strain it and add 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup condensed milk and chill it in the fridge. When I serve it I mix it with half milk and a little cream on top. you can also add ice if you want to drink it right after making it or to water it down a bit. I make it in my french press. Its a great drink!!
