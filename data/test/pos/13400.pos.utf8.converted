I wrote this to ease the worries of those who read some of the lower starred reviews complaining about the plastic container and possible "leaching" of harmful byproducts into the oil.  Turn your Nutiva jar upside down and read inside the little recycle triangle.  See the little "1" symbol and the PETE written under it?  That's a good plastic:  "#1 is Polyethylene Terephthalate, also marked as PET or PETE. Companies normally use this plastic for various beverage containers such as water, soft drinks, and sport drinks. You can also find this plastic for ketchup, peanut butter, salad dressings, jellies, and various other condiments. This plastic is known as one of the "good" plastics since it is not known to leach, or gradually penetrate, chemicals into the products it houses." [...]<br /><br />Also, don't worry about the clear container--coconut oil is highly resistant to becoming rancid from heat/light, unlike olive, corn, and other oils.<br /><br />Enjoy.
