After chewing one piece of Spry peppermint gum you may notice your teeth and gums feeling more healthy. Since I'm always looking for natural alternatives to regular processed sugar as an ingredient, this item caught my attention.<br /><br />Not only does Xylitol not promote tooth decay, it has natural ingredients to decrease plaque formation and adhesion. Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actual produce about 11g of Xylitol a day.<br /><br />It can be commercially manufactured from "xylan hemicellulose" sources such as Birch trees in Finland. Some Xylitol products are also made from corn.<br /><br />This product is made with a Xylitol, gum base, natural flavors, glycerin, gum Arabic, soy lecithin and beesewax.<br /><br />Xylitol actually has been proven to:<br /><br />Reduce Tooth Decay<br />Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria<br />Inhibits the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections<br />Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids<br />Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel<br /><br />What more could we ask for from a gum? This gum is a natural defense system and you will start to notice the results. Unlike other sugary gums, this will reduce cavities and it is just as flavorful, if not more so than most gums.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
