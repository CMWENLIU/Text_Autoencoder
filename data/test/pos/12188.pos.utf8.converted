I bought this for my parents as a Christmas gift.  It was a big hit and immediately brought with it reactions of, "look at this one" and "I'd forgot about them".  One thing that shouldn't be forgotten is that after all the trips down memory lane, you actually get to eat the candy.<br /><br />My strongest reaction to the box when it arrived was shock over its size and weight.  It is huge. I expected to pay 15 dollars for the candy and 15 dollars for novelty.  But I honestly think it has close to $30 worth of candy in it, if not more.  Usually, when items are created to tug on the sentimentality of buyers, something is lost in the actual product.  That isn't the case here.  It is both an exciting gift and a practical one.
