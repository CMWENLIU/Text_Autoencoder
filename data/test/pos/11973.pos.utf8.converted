I would not use these as a meal replacement. Not enough protein, for one. But when I have them with a meal as dessert, no blood sugar spike. (I used to be prediabetic, and I do check these days to see how foods are affecting me.)<br /><br />But for folks who want a "less crap" candy bar or dessert treat, this one's it. VERY sweet. Tastes just like these chewy coconut candies my mom used to bring home in the 60s and 70s in my Bronx days. I used to love those. And I love the Almond Apricot for tasting like them. Every single variety I've tried--about a half dozen--are very good. But Almond Apricot is my fave. It hits the "oh, candy" and "ooh, nostalgia" vibe for me.<br /><br />My second fave (though it's gaining on the Almond Apricot in stealth mode) is the Almond Cashew Flax one. I thought I'd hate it (flax is not my fave thing), but man, it's like a gentle cookie taste in a chewy bar. It's quite delightful. I find I want to reach for that one for my evening "dessert" with coffee treat.<br /><br />Third fave: Mango Macadamia with Calcium. Very mangoey. Mangoes are my fave fruit and these do taste mango-ey. Macadamia is quiet enough in the taste department to let the fruit shine through. Different "bite" texture than the almond based ones, too. Smoother. (I'm a Caribbean born gal, and I've adored them since I was a wee one.)<br /><br />The peanutty ones are my least fave. I do find the cashew and almond based ones just are more enjoyable.<br /><br />If you low carb, you probably wanna steer towards, say, the Almond Coconut and have half (or one of the minis). It's not a lot of calories, and it's certainly a prettier nutritional profile for those who want a more "whole food"/no gluten lifestyle. (Beware the ones with peanuts if you're more into the Primal/Paleo side of things.)<br /><br />These babies are SWEET. If you're prone to abuse sweets like candy bars, don't even taste these. I'm serious. They're amazing. Addictive. Delicious! I've lost 116 pounds (moderte carbing, Primarian eating), and while I did order some (the minis, almond apricot, and others for hubby's lunch box), I think of them as CANDY. Not something to have in place of food, but something that I can have as a treat when I have the calories to allot. I also would happily carry a mini in my purse for emergencies. Because they have healthful fats, they can tide you over.<br /><br />How did they do on my glucose the way I use them (dessert):<br /><br />Premeal: glucose 81<br />Post meal: protein/veggies/fruit and one mango macadamia bar (after 1 hour): 88<br /><br />Not bad.<br /><br />I wish they'd ratchet down the glucose/honey, cause they could be less sweet. BUT...I cannot tell a lie: THESE TASTE DA BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I almost wish I'd never encountered them. They are tempting!<br /><br />And with the 25% off right now with S&S combined with the code good til 9/15, if you are dying to stock up, it's a good time.
