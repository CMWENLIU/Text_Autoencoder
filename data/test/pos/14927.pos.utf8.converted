This product was first mentioned to me by a relative earlier this year as I was having stomach aches, nausea, constant burping, etc. However, I figured what could honey really do? I went to the gastroenterologist and was diagnosed with H. Pylori and was subsequently given the 7 day course of strong antibiotics which cost a bomb! However, it seemed to do the trick and I was "healed." Or so I thought.<br /><br />A few months later, I started getting the same symptoms of a light stomach ache, nausea, constant burping, etc. again. But I am now traveling so I can't see my specialist back home. I then remembered my relative's mention of Manuka honey for stomach problems, and so did some research on it on the internet. I was so surprised to see that Manuka honey is claimed to kill the H. Pylori bacteria in the stomach, so ok, I gave it a try. Whole Foods had run out of the 16+ Manuka factor which was highly recommended for H. Pylori infections, so I bought a bottle of the 12+ instead. After a couple of days, I started to feel much better, but it had not gone away even after a week. I then went back to Whole Foods and finally they had re-stocked the 16+ Manuka honey. I started taking a teaspoon 20 minutes before meals and before bed, and within 2-3 days I felt so much better. After 1-2 weeks of taking it, I don't feel the stomach aches anymore.....perhaps just the feeling of the infected lining of my stomach healing. I'm now feeling much better day by day, and can actually work out normally at the gym again. No more frequent burping, no more nausea.<br /><br />I'm amazed, but it actually works, and I'll be taking this manuka honey for general maintenance once I am fully back to normal health....and with no antibiotics! Will have to cut down the amount though as the sugar is a bit of a concern. What's more, it tastes yummy.
