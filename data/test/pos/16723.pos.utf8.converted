This granola is really yummy stuff!  The taste is fantastic, a nice vanilla flavor with a hint of apple and a lighter hint of blueberry.  It is healthy and most importantly for me, free of additives and preservatives!!  I love eating it as a cereal with milk, mixed in my yogurt, right out of the bag as a snack or I use as a topping for my apple crisp.  The price is reasonable for the quality and quantity and the nutritional value is good.  The only criticism I partially agreed with that I read from another reviewer was that it barely had a trace of blueberries in it, which I agree but hey - adding a handful of fresh berries (any kind) is pretty simple and delicious!
