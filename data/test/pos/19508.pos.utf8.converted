I'm not a big dessert fan. I don't even go gaga for chocolate often. But this is easily the most delicious piece of sweetness (okay, bittersweetness) I've ever happened upon.<br /><br />True, you probably have to love dark chocolate to appreciate this. But if you do, do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this slice of heaven.
