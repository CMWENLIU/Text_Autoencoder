I have tried dozens of chili recipes. My favorite used to be from Cook's Country recipe for Texas Red. Now it is the Carroll Shelby Chili Kit.<br /><br />The hot version is not hot, just tasty. I use cubed beef chuck roast and ground beef. I also used just diced tomato and no tomato sauce.<br /><br />The gravey that comes from Shelby's spices would make shoe leather taste delicious. Add a little more water if you like a more liquid gravey, I do. Also, you probably don't need the masa included for thickening.<br /><br />Outstanding.
