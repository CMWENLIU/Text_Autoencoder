I have identified 3 critical parts to the movie theatre popcorn you love.  I will break it down for you:<br /><br />  1- Paragon Coconut Popping Oil = Provides the 'nutty/toasted' flavor, the odor that permeates the local cinema, and yellow hue to the popped corn<br />  2- Flavacol = The pseudo-buttery flavor and ultra-fine salt of good cinema popcorn.<br />  3- *Butter-flavored topping = that goo you get when you ask for "extra 'butter' " at the concessions counter.<br /><br />I hesitated buying this at first ... thinking "$15 ... is it really worth it?"  I procrastinated buying Flavacol because it seemed silly that shipping cost more than the product itself.  Well, now after 1.5 years I still haven't used up either product and spent less than $30 total for popcorn that is absolutely incredible.<br /><br />*IMPORTANT* - I read a review that stated the purchaser was dissatisfied because it wasn't 100% Coconut oil.  The label on the back says "76 (degree symbol)" coconut oil plus beta carotene NOT "76% Coconut oil" .  It's 100% Coconut Oil mixed with beta carotene (for yellow color).  The "76 (degree symbol)" refers to the melting temperature of the coconut oil.  [I had it sitting on the counter when it was 80 degrees indoors and it started to melt ... later that same evening when the A/C brought the house to 74 degrees for a couple of hours ... it began solidifying again.  Neat.]<br /><br />This popcorn oil is a solid at room temperature* (less than 76F) and provides NO butter flavor.  It does not require refrigeration once opened.  It DOES provide the 'missing ingredient' between cinema popcorn an your homemade popcorn.  Been using some form of vegetable-oil haven't you?  It JUST doesn't taste correct, right?  Add about a heaping spoonful of this 'popping oil' (solid, remember) to a batch of stove-top popcorn and you're done. (I have tried 'gourmet' popcorns, white popcorn, etc ... but have found that plane-jane barebones no-frills yellow popcorn from your local store actually tastes best.)<br /><br />If you want 100% theatre-like popcorn ... you'll have to substitute #3> above with the 'butter-flavored topping' of your choice.  But, to be honest, that goo kind of turns my stomach.  The butter does soften the popcorn slightly (there's a little water in the butter after all) but it's still awesome.<br /><br />I prepare my popcorn using a stovetop hand-crank popcorn popper, add a heaping spoonful of the 'oil' (remember, solid at room temperature) and 3/4 tsp of flavacol.  Top with 3 tbs of butter melted in the microwave and you're done.  Bliss.  Heaven.  It's soooooooo good.
