As a dog owner, I try to do the best for my dog.  My mother is a veterinarian technician and strongly recommend that I take good care of my dog's teeth.  Based on her job, she had plenty of stories about dogs with terrible teeth and told me that I should either feed my dog an oral care food or brush her (my dog's) teeth daily.  Knowing that I wouldn't want to brush my teeth and that my dog wasn't going to like it, I opted for the oral care science diet.  My mother recommends the Hills Prescription Diet TD (prescription oral care), but said that the oral care is also acceptable since it is available without a prescription.  I have been feeding this to my dog for 3 years (since she was a puppy) and her teeth are very clean and white.  I rest happily knowing that I won't be dealing with a vet recommending that I pay a huge amount of money to rip out teeth or put my dog under to get a teeth cleaning (these procedures can run into the thousands of dollars in some severe cases).  Over all, the food is more expensive than other foods, but the benefit of knowing that my dog's teeth are well cared for is worth it to me because I know how expensive the alternative can be.  Another added bonus- my dog likes this food!
