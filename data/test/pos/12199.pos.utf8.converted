As it is very difficult to find Ginger in Syrup in stores I decided to go on Amazon.  The product is excellent.  The ginger comes in nice regular pieces,it is pungent and the syrup is fragrant. I am be able to use it  baking, cooking and salads. I kept some pieces whole as a garnish with a curry  and, after one guest tasted it, the others wanted more of it. A good thing that I bought 4 jars!! Try it with sweet potatoes!!
