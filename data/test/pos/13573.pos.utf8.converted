I wanted to make cupcakes, but out of eggs.  I only use prime shipping usually.  So, I checked and there was only the large sizes of powdered eggs on amazon in the 50.00 range. Checked again a few days later and found these, so bought 2.  Glad smaller packages are available.  I was able to make my cupcakes.  Still have most of the first bag left too.  It looks well processed and clean and just like real powdered eggs that it is. No additives. Will be buying more. Shipping was quick, and that is important to me.  I am anxious to try scrambling some to see if they taste like fresh eggs. I will do a follow-up if I do.
