Man oh man, I love Fever Tree's Ginger Beer. I asked for a ginger ale at the St. Regis in San Francisco and got this instead. What a pleasant surprise! The smell of ginger transformed me to another world. A world of sakura petals falling softly on verdant, rolling hills with a warm breeze and snow capped mountains in the background. I took a sip and little pebbles of joy started dancing in my mouth. And the fun didn't just go away like with your average drink. The taste lingers, prolonging the experience. This is a drink for parties, after-parties and after-after-parties. Or to be enjoyed alone.<br /><br />There's a scripture that describes my reaction to this drink. "And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also; for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit." (1 Nephi 8:12)<br /><br />If you like it, you'll know you are in select company. I gave two bottles to my next door neighbor. They returned one unopened. A friend said it cleared her sinuses, but did little else for her. My wife rolled her eyes the same way she does when I burn incense. Fine. All the more for me.<br /><br />After returning from San Francisco, I started my search. For six months I searched. Whole Foods doesn't have it. Trader Joe's doesn't have it. Your local grocery store will almost certainly not have it. But Amazon has it. And now so can you! Let the sakura petals fall and the joy pebble dance commence!
