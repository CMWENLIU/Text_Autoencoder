I've tried in the past to grow any plants and would not have much luck, I'd forget to water or the sun light was either to much or too little.  This product works wonderful. The firts time I seen it my sister was at my sisters house. She had the herb garden growing. The plants were healty and Tasty. There is nothing like having fresh herbs for cooking. After that I just had to have one. It's has taken all the guess work out of gardening. It's easy to maintain and it's nearly self suffecient. There is a light that come on about every two weeks as a reminder to add the fertilizer and water and the rest is taken care of for you. You can get any better than that.<br /><br />LK
