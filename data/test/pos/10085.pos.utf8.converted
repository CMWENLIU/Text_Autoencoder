This honey is among the best I have had. It was the first raw honey I had ever tried and, quite honestly, if I had tried a different brand first I may not have continued to purchase raw honey. The reason I purchased it was the price; however, I purchased it at a discount store so it was much less than retail. I got the 2 lb jar for only $10.  The store I got it from only gets it in stock when it is another store's overstock so I'm SOL now.<br />I have tried several other brands since this one but none are close to the quality you get with this one. The only one that was comparable was a creamed honey from Trader Joe's and that one was only $3 per lb but I'm not positive it was raw. Wee Bee has a thick layer of propolis, wax, and pollen on top and after mixing it in the first time it becomes easier. I have saved the little bit left for wound healing because it's so difficult to find anything as good as this! The propolis from this honey works better for me than Manuka!
