There's hope for those of you who'd like to re-experience the taste of this popular German fast food here in the U. S.  In Germany, Polish-sausage type weiners are deep fried, then doused with curry ketchup and a bit of curry powder, then served with French fries.  Using Costco's quarter-pound+ Polish sausage (grilled), this ketchup, and McCormick's curry powder, the flavor is dead on.  You'll be transported back to an Imbiss in a Fussganger Zone in any-town, Germany.  Zeisner Curry Ketchup is well worth the price.
