The granules are larger than Kosher salt so when I sprinkled it on a salad, I got these intermittent explosions of salt - very nice.  I don't use it in cooked dishes [common salt will do], just a sprinkle on whatever needs to have fresh salt. I approve of the extra minerals also.  Amazon's price is far cheaper than what Food Network entertainers are asking on their websites.
