My son was 18 months old when he was put on this drink. He had a mild to moderate allergic reaction to cow's milk protein, which caused him throwing up quite often. It's always been a struggling for us, as a parent, to keep the weight on him (he's always on the 20th percentile). Then the dietary specialist recommended this drink to us and said if he can drink 5 cans per day he'll gain weight even without eating anything else. This is the only milk (soy/cow milk) that provides 30cal/oz.<br /><br />It took a little bit time to migrate him from cow's milk to soymilk. We started out from 1oz then gradually added up, now we mix 4oz can with 4oz regular SILK. He goes through 2 cans per day. And he's up to 50-60% on weight at 2 years old and he's not thrown up since then, nor has he been sick either. We highly recommend it. We hope to be able to buy it from the regular grocery store though.
