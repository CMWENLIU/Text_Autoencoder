I came across some research that suggested organic extra virgin coconut oil might help people suffering from Alzheimer's.  Before giving it to my parents, I decided to test it myself to see how it tasted and to check for side effects.  A visit to the health food store and I was ready to check it out.<br /><br />Honestly, it has replaced butter and olive oil in most of my applications, becoming my fat of choice.  It may all be in my head, but I am convinced I am "sharper" when taking it.  My parents are getting about a tablespoon a day, and enjoy it on bread as a treat.  They are more alert than they were more than a year ago - I can't prove it's because of the coconut oil, but it's the only thing we've changed.  Draw your own conclusions....<br /><br />When I found Nature's Way at Amazon, the price blew me away.  When I read about the subscription program (save some $ and get free freight), I decided to try it.  Getting 16 ounces is convenient, and having it come regularly with free shipping (even though it's less than $25) makes it a great value...and it tastes better than the stuff I'd gotten at the health food store.<br /><br />Heck, it's under $10 - give it a try!
