Don't believe what you hear, MSG is completely natural and safe, and has never been proven to cause headaches, etc..<br />It's sodium and an amino acid your body produces, and a third less sodium than salt.  So if you're "allergic" to MSG, you're allergic to yourself.  It's found naturally in tomatoes, mushrooms, etc., etc..
