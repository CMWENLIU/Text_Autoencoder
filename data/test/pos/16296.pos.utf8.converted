I had a craving for a lemon something sweet.  Not pie.  Not candy.  Cake?  Oh, a bit too much.  But the craving would not go away.  I thought about baking some lemon cookies, but dismissed that idea.  I'm a good baker, but I was not in the mood for it.<br /><br />So I went to the supermarket and checked at the bakery.  I got donut.  Well, I didn't buy donuts; I mean the bakery had no lemon cookies.  Then I checked the cookie aisle.  These were the only lemon cookies I could find.  I was shocked!  And they were on the top shelf at the end of the aisle, where the merchandisers like to place the pricey stuff.  Not that one could miss that green and yellow package, and why do they show a cockatiel?  I was skeptical, but the craving had evolved into an obsession, so I bought them, expecting to be completely disappointed.<br /><br />They are wonderful!  Best new cookie I've tried in many years.  These are sandwich cookies with more heft than Oreos.  The cookie is made short and not too sweet.  The cream is a perfect concoction of smooth, lemony and sweet.  The overall flavor and texture of this cookie is truly fine.  They are unquestionably lemon, but not overbearing.<br /><br />Best of all, these go wonderfully with tea.  There's nothing worse than an overly sweet cookie with tea!  A perfect match with black, green or oolong.  I wouldn't recommend them with a spiced tea.  I enjoyed them very much with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AR158W">Numi Organic Tea Magnolia Puerh, 16-Count Full Leaf Tea Bags (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />Bonus points for those looking for cookies made in a nut-free factory.
