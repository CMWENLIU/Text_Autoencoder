I've loved tapioca pudding since childhood, and really don't understand folks who turn their noses up to it!  This is the deal I got at Amazon.  It takes $25 to get free shipping.  If I had ordered only 1 case it would have cost $20, with shipping.  I bought 2 cases for $26 total, because of the free shipping!  Granted, that's a bunch of tapioca, but you have to refrigerate or freeze it anyway, so I stuck it in the freezer, safe and sound.  I'll also share a few packs with family & friends, of course.  I searched several grocery stores around town, and could only find that nasty 'minute' tapioca.  Get the real deal.
