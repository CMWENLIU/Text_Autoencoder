We had been plagued with pantry moths for MONTHS, and were getting at our wits ends.  They were everywhere!  I checked every food item we had and threw some away, cleaned the cupboards, but nothing I did even put a dent in the amount of moths we had.  When I found some information online about these pantry moth traps, I then came here to Amazon to read the reviews.  I was torn after reading that the newer versions were said to not work, but I was also desperate.  When I received this, I set up one of the traps in our kitchen on top of one of the hanging cabinets, and was amazed that in only about a week, our problem was solved!  I wish I would have tried this at the beginning and saved us a LOT of stress.  I would HIGHLY recommend these traps to anyone... they work!
