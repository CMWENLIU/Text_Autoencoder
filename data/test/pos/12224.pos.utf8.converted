My husband eats these sardines, usually a can a day.  He had wanted better Omega 3s to help his blood pressure, but had generally found sardines to be "fishy".  He wanted something he could tolerate eating regularly and did a lot of research online.  He found that Trader Joe's Moroccon sardines got rave reviews.  So we started to buy out our local TJs of their stock every couple of weeks.  He commented once that he thinks his mind is clearer these days.  Don't know if it's helping with his blood pressure though.  I did taste them, and the taste reminds me of tuna.  My 2 year old daughter loves helping her daddy eat these.  I looked here on Amazon and found this listing, and read the reviews.  They were similar to the reviews for TJs.  I ordered a box, because we seem to run out of TJs before we can get more.  Hubby tried them and says there seems to be no difference in taste.  These are slightly more expensive than TJs if you just order just one box, but the price is better than TJs if you do the subscription.<br /><br />Update 9/29/10:  My husband just went in for his bloodwork, and everything looks good - triglycerides, cholesterol, etc.  He's even no longer pre-diabetic.  Not sure how much of this is from eating a can of these a day, but I'm sure it's helping.  He even says his mind works better since he started eating these.
