Yes, these are a little more expensive than your supermarket solid white Albacore in oil, but that's like comparing Filet Mignon and hamburger.  You actually get a very decent amount of tuna per bottle here, and it's all lush, luscious Ventresca.  With quality like this, even a little goes a long way!
