I am a soda fan, trying sodas from all over the country. As far as grape sodas go, this one is the absolute best, hands down. I loved grape sodas as a kids, but find the few that are made nowadays to be over sweet, too syrupy, and the grape seems too fake. There is a reason for this, first is that most bootlers use more carbonation in sodas than they used too and it overwhelms the flavor. Second, the soda companies switched to high fructose corn syrup in the 1970's in order to save money, but the corn syrup makes it taste, well, syrupy. It weighs the flavor down into a mess. But there are some premium brands that use real cane sugar, just like the old days. That and a bit less carbonation, and you have a soda that tastes like they used to back when.<br />Boylan's grape really does has an oaky concord grape flavor, like real grape juice, and does not taste like artificial grape flavoring. That and the lighter carbonation make this the best grape soda I have tried in over 30 years.<br /><br />The company: Originally brewed in 1891, the New York classic "Boylan's Birch Beer" started in a apothecary in the early 1890's and developed into the most popular flavor of The Boylan Sodaworks. Boylan was a bottling and keg filling operation located in the heart of Paterson, NJ, the first industrialized city in the country. Competition increased however, and in the 1930's Boylan was forced to close its bottling lines, leaving Boylan's Draught Birch Beer as its only product. Shortly thereafter, the rights to the name, the formula, and the sole route was purchased by the driver. His grandkids the Fiorina's still run the company in New Jersey today, and have expanded again to near a dozen very delicious flavors. They recently changed packaging to the very good looking and nostalgic bottles with raised lettering and painted on labels. Look for my other soda reviews at Amazon.
