This is a tasty orange sauce. We buy frozen orange-flavored chicken. The sauce pack included barely coats the meat, with nothing leftover to flavor the rice we serve with it. We used to buy a large size at Costco, but they don't seem to carry it any more. We are happier with the 20.75 ounce size, even though it costs a little more. You don't have a huge bottle open in the fridge for months, and the flavor is fresher. It took a long time to find an orange sauce we liked, and we hope Panda Express keeps making it.
