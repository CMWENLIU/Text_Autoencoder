These treats, which are pieces of pure freeze dried-chicken, are pure chicken and as such<br /><br />are absolutely captivating to both my dog and cat, who will sit politely drooling, side by side, waiting for their treats, much to the amusement of friends and family.<br /><br />They are, however, fairly expensive.  The fact that I can buy them for a much more reasonable price through Amazon.com makes my faithful animal companions very happy, makes me look like a sport and keeps me out of the poorhouse.
