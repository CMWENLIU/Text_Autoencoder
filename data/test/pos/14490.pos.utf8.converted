I know this sounds crazy. I discovered this method accidentally one day when the oats n honey bar slipped from my hand and dropped into the sink. Not wanting to waste the food, I thought "eh, I'll just rinse it with water and gobble it up." Much to my surprise this rinsed half-bar tasted MUCH BETTER than the original. It serves two purposes: To "tenderize" the bar, making it become a soft tasty crunchy instead of the hard, uninviting crunchy, and also washes away a lot of the sugar making it a lot tastier and healthier (the bars are originally too sweet in my opinion). People have said "eat it with water" etc. which helps with the dryness, but it simply is not the same as rinsing or dipping in water. Ever since I started using this technique the bars have gone from merely good-tasting to heavenly.
