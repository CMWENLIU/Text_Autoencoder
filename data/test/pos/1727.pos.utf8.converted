I got some of these chocolates in December, and just ordered a replacement bag (because two pounds of chocolate should not be consumed quickly :). They are fantastic. It is high quality chocolate (nothing chalky or waxy) and tart pomegrante juice. 20 pieces to a serving, giving you 180 calories and 65 calories from fat.
