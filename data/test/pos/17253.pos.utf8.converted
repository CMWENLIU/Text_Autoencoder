I've always been very particular about my coffee and I'm sorry I didn't begin using these filters earlier.  With your first cup, you'll immediately notice a delightful difference. Unlike the inexpensive bulk coffee filters I bought for years, these natural filters allow the coffee to drain a little faster.  If your ear is tuned to your coffee maker, you'll notice a difference in the drip sound straight away.  The faster drain means the water does not linger and thereby pick up unpleasant oil and acid.  The verdict: Your coffee is served hotter and tastes far more mellow.<br /><br />Two things to note.  1) If you're using a cheap coffee maker that gives your coffee a metallic taste, I'm not sure how these will make a difference. (I use a Cuisinart and I love it.)  2) A medium grind works best.  If you use a fine grind, you might find a bit of it in the bottom of the pot.  Still the same, the coffee tastes so much better, it's worth the extra clean up.
