If you bake on a regular basis, you also know that the tiny packets most grocery stores sell their yeast in are pretty expensive (75c per use at least). This bag has the same product without the extraneous packaging and will serve you for months while bringing your yeast cost per bread/cake down to pennies (10-15x cheaper :)). Please note that yeast needs to be kept in the fridge once it is open.
