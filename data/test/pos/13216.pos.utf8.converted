My daughter has celiac (a complete inability to eat any wheat, rye, barley, and in her case oatmeal, or any of their starches or glutens). Pamela's baking and pancake mix is a real heaven-sent product. It tastes good! Unlike some other baking mixes I have tried. It is easy to alter "normal" recipes using Pamela's mix to have great tasting baked products. The bag has good recipes and Pamela's products website has additional ones. I would recommend this product to anyone, especially those who don't want to take the time to mix their own grains or want to keep it on hand for when celiac family or friends come to visit and you would like to provide a delicious, easy to make treat.<br /><br />I should also add - Pamela's also offers bread, cake (chocolate and vanilla), brownie, and cookie mixes that are very good. I usually just alter the baking mix to make these baked goods, but I keep a chocolate cake mix on hand for a fast, easy cake. We used the chocolate cake mix for my daughter's wedding cake. No on knew it was gluten-free.
