I've been using the Nutiva brand for 2 years now.  It has the best flavor of any of the brands in the nutrition and grocery stores.  When I used the other brands I rarely used the coconut oil.  They smelled and tasted yucky.  Plus I found out they were processed.  Nutiva is raw.  I have completely thrown out shortening; butter; and probably cut back at least half on the olive oil I used.<br />My chronically dry skin is gone without lotions.  I use it on toast or bread as a snack and I feel full and satisfied for hours. And I have seen a lot less water retention all over....not so puffy.  Wish I could say I lost weight or inches, but no, I didn't.  I have heard of others losing as soon as they start switching to coconut oil.  When I bake with it instead of shortening or butter...everything is so moist...no coconut flavor added to anything either.
