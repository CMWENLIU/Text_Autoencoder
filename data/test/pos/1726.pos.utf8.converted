I just discovered this candy at Walmart and only bought one bag to see how I liked it. I wish I'd bought more!  I love almost any combination of fruit and chocolate and these sweet-but-tart little morsels are a superb example of how delicious that blend can be.  Walmart's price is currently the best by a large margin, so off I go to stock up on my latest confectionary addiction!
