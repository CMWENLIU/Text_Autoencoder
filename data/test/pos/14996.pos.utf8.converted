I am now finishing my third bottle of Wedderspoon manuka honey. So far I have been very happy with it. I take manuka honey daily for its presumed health benefits, however unsubstantiated they may be. It seems to keep me healthier and makes the duration of a cold shorter. That may be all in my head, but so be it ... that means it works for me! ;-) Regardless, I have tried a number of different manuka honeys over the years. This one is not quite as thick as others, but it is not runny either, and is does have some substance when scooped up with a spoon. The flavor is moderately sweet and not medicinal. It tastes similar to other manuka honeys that I have used. The price is very competitive, particularly with the "subscription" discount. I am finding this to be a quite satisfactory and good tasting honey and will continue to use it for the foreseeable future.
