This is one of my favorites of olive oil.<br />This extra virgin olive oil has a lovely golden green color and sediment in the bottle.It's got a  good fruity ,rich flavor.It is also a little sweet.<br /> I like to use it deliciously compliments salads.I like to drizzle it over  tomato and cheese.<br />I am sure you will enjoy it and I highly recommend it.
