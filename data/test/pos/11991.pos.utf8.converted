I did my research and found the Matcha Green Tea Powder and how well this product will help with my health concerns.  I read and have proof that it has improved my health and will improve anyones health that will incorporate this fine product into their life.  I like a small amount of honey in my tea.  Others can find many ways that they will like it.  It is worth every penny and more!!!  And a plus...I have been drinking it once or twice a day, for alittle over a month and I have lost weight drinking it, feel more alert, no caffeine buzz,(I can't usually tolerate caffeine), my skin and hair has improved and I feel that I have more strength.  My husband is now drinking it because he sees the improvement in me and he is starting to feel the difference in his health.  We both think we found the green tea that is the best and the one that will make a big difference for the better in our lives.  K.  10/29/08
