Have now tried all Auguri oils (Basil, Lemon & Orange) and they are wonderful.  All these oils are good to saute, marinate or drizzle on fish, chicken, beef or salads.  I particular like the Lemon on salads with a splash of white vinegar - yummy.  Try them with confidence and enjoy the unique flavors.
