Okay,okay.. I must admit, I was skeptical. After years of drinking coffee and than having to stop....oh my goodness, I thought I'd have a melt down. I tried several coffee alternatives and each time I was so disappointed, so much so that I gave up looking; knowing that I'd have to get use to drinking Pero, you feel my pain, right?<br />Last week I was introduced to Ayurvedic. I was BEYOND SHOCKED! Can I just tell you, it was like an answer to prayer. Seriously, this coffee alternative is so close to the "real" thing that if I were blindfolded, I don't know that I could tell the difference.<br />Thanks Ayurvedic for restoring my faith.
