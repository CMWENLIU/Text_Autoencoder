I cannot believe the quality of this lovely ristto for the price.  It has a slightly firm, yet moist texture when cooked per the directions on the bag and the flavor can't be equaled.  I will purchase this over and over as it is one of my family's new favorite foods and I can make it in 7 minutes flat using my pressure cooker.  I just saute any vegetable on hand to stir in right before serving.  Top with a pat of butter and some parmesan cheese . . . yum.
