2 reviews up here. One says "It's no 5 hour engergy" one says it's the same thing, just rebranded. I'd tend to believe that it is in fact, rebranded 5hr Energy. Just bought a 48pk from Costco for $35. Much less than here. Took one today. It was the multi flavor pk. I had berry. Sucks like them all but the new lemon/lime. I hate how sweet both are, but love the results. Especially from the Kirkland for 1/2 the price of 5H.E.
