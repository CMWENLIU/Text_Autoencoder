I have several recipes that call for chicken broth.  I have been eating a "No cholesterol" diet.  This broth is every bit as tasty as chicken broth.  I have recipes that I have successfully converted into vegan, thanks to this amazing, delicious product.  Plus I have been using Gardein products that look like meat, but again is vegan.  Combined, I can cook and eat all of my old favorite recipes.
