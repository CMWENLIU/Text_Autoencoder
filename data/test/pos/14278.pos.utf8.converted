This is a 3 pack and the price is pretty darn good, this price is cheaper than you'll find 17oz boxes on sale in the local supermarket. But you'd have to buy 3, but that's not a hardship for those who love this cereal. However, I've noticed that the new boxes with the word "Fiber" on it taste a little different from the old boxes. I don't know if anyone else has noticed. The Froot Loops seem to be less crisp and more woody in texture. I hope they didn't mess with the formula because I don't really buy this cereal for the fiber, I buy it for the taste.<br /><br />Froot Loops is one of Kellogg's troika of cereals that Moms hate but kids love! (The other two of the Corn Pops and Apple Jacks.) I suspect the reason behind this is that neither the word "Froot" nor the word "Loops" are consider true food words, to Moms, these two words signify sugar and artificial colors. However, scientifically speaking, neither is truly bad. In today's age you can hardly avoid artificial coloring unless you want to eat gray and beige colored food and a serving size (3/4 cup) only gives you 12g of sugar vs. 39g in a 12oz can of Coke, so the word is moderation.<br /><br />I love it because it tastes good and I love the texture, it's crunchy without being too hard. And surprisingly, if you check the nutrition panel, there's 25% RDA of quite a lot of nutrients in it.<br /><br />So:<br />Pros: Tastes great.<br />Cons: Has the words "Froot" and "Loops" in the name so Moms don't like 'em.
