I usually do not write reviews on Amazon (or anywhere else for that matter), but I really have to make an exception in this case because of how well this device works.  It is rare for any device to work exactly as expected, but the Victor Blackbox Gopher Trap works above and beyond any expectations that I had for it.  I do not work for the Victor company, and I have no financial stake in the sales of their products.  I am simply an exasperated homeowner who got fed up wih gophers tearing up his property and decided to give this device a try.<br /><br />I had used poison pellets, smoke bombs, water hose, and those silly sonic devices... nothing worked and those gophers were probably laughing at me.  With the Blackbox, it's nearly a sure thing.  Also, you actually get to see the results with a dead gopher right in front of you, unlike smoke bombs and poison which are always a guessing game as to whether or not they actually did their job.<br /><br />Within 2 day of getting this product, I had already caught 3 gophers.  One of those gophers was caught less than 1 hour after I set the trap.  Free lunch on my property is now officially over.<br /><br />The key to the effectiveness of this trap is to find a freshly dug up gopher mound.<br /><br />My sure kill method:<br /><br />1) Find a freshly dug up gopher mound.<br />2) Dig out the mound until you find the tunnel.<br />3) Place the activated trap flush with the entrance of the tunnel, with the small round hole (on one side of the trap) facing outward.<br />4) Cover up the gaps at the top, sides and bottom of the trap with dirt so that it looks like the tunnel extends into the Blackbox, but make sure the opening to the trap is unobstructed from inside their tunnel.<br /><br />The idea is to make the trap seem like an extension of the gopher's tunnel, and by instinct the gopher will head towards that small open hole on the other side of the trap to plug it up (they don't like any openings into their tunnels).  Once he enters the trap, it's goodnight Gracie.  This trap is so strong that the gopher will be nearly snapped in half.<br /><br />Before getting the Blackbox, I had also tried using a "Macabee" gopher trap (the one with the 2 pincers that snap together) but the gopher simply pushed that trap out of his tunnel.  The Macabee is also a lot more risky to use and harder to set (in terms of triggering it accidentally on your hand).  The Blackbox is safer to use and much easier to set because the trigger mechanism and the killing device is contained fully within the box itself.  The Macabee trap can also be dragged away by a dying gopher if it is not properly secured.  There is definitely no chance of a gopher dragging away a Blackbox.<br /><br />In summary, I wish I had used the Blackbox from the beginning.  It would have saved me a lot of time, money, frustration and parts of my yard.<br /><br />UPDATE Aug-17-2011:  I have just posted some pics as proof of the effectiveness of this device.  After 13 captures within the first 4 months of use, I have not seen any more gopher activity since April 2011. I guess word got out in the gopher community that there is now a steep price of admission onto this property.
