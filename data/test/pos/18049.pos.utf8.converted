AS I kid my mom used to buy this stuff by the case!  It was awesome!  I started buying it for my nephews and nieces and they LOVE it.  Everytime they come to my house, they go to the cabinet to get the malt and to the freezer to get the ice cream so we can make malted milk shakes!  It is a family tradition that will be around in my family as long as they sell this product!
