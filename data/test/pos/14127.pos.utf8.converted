I've been making/eating Japanese rice for over twenty years. Having lived in NYC most of my life there were many places to source fine Japanese goods so I've been a little spoiled by access to the best ingredients; having moved out west a couple of years ago sometimes ingredients are harder to find. There were no reviews on this rice on the day I purchased it and I'm so glad I took a chance; this is hands down the best Japanese rice I have had in a very, very long time. Unusually fine short grain.  I made a batch the first night it arrived intending to pair it with some leftover chicken curry. When the rice was done, I went to take a taste and sweet Jesus!, was that good. Firm bite yet tender yield. A bare hint of sweetness. In a word - delicate. Another taste, then a bowl. Needed not a drop of shoyu or anything - naked perfection. I wound up forgetting all about the curry.
