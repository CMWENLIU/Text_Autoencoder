This is the ubiquitous "Chico strain" used by legions of home brewers and professional brewers alike.  This yeast strain was developed by the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company, and is what is used to ferment Sierra Nevada Pale Ale among many other beers. The Wyeast "smack pack" is a great delivery system for yeast.  After smacking the pack to burst the inner pouch of nutrients, the rate and amount the whole thing inflates tells you how active and viable the yeast is.  Quite an effective system and I can't say enough how much I respect Wyeast products.<br /><br />I have used this particular yeast strain extensively as a home brewer and find it to be great choice for almost any kind of american style ale in which you want to showcase the flavors of the hops or malt used instead of focusing on flavors derived from the fermentation process itself. Wyeast 1056 works exceptionally well in hoppy beers like pale ales, India pale ales, and double/imperial IPAs, as well as American interpretations of amber ales, stouts, porters, etc.  It has pretty good alcohol tolerance (higher even than what Wyeast reports, I believe).  Some say this yeast doesn't flocculate very well but I have found that is not a problem so long as the finished beer is left in the refrigerator undisturbed in a keg or bottle for a week or two.<br /><br />All in all this is a superstar yeast that everyone should consider a staple in their brewing arsenal.  I know I surely do!
