I have phenomenally high HDL (>100), which is great, but my LDL was creeping up---it got to 160.  I'm vegetarian.  I cut out nearly all dairy fat, added ~15 almonds/day and ~3g/day of psyllium, and started taking 1 Smart Chew 3 times/day.  My HDL remained the same, but my LDL dropped to 120, a 25% decrease!  I am a very happy camper!<br />My only complaint is that the product contains Yellow 6.  I've written to the company requesting that they remove it; if enough of us do that, maybe they'll comply.
