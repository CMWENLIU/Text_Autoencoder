Lifeboat Tea instantly became my favorite and a daily staple from my very first cup.<br /><br />The original packaging described it as "a tea of strength and character," and that's entirely accurate. The flavor is robust with just a hint of sweetness, but even though I like my tea brewed strong enough to etch paint, it's never bitter.<br /><br />I also appreciate that proceeds from the sale of the tea help to fund lifeboat rescues off the coast of the British Isles.  Nothing like drinking an outstanding cup of tea and knowing that you're helping to do good at the same time.
