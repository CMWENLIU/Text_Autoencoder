I wanted a chocolate fountain for a recent party with 70 guests. After looking at many fountains, I splurged and got the Sephra. The Sephra, which is over twice the price of the Rival, has elegant looks and incredible quality. Why put ordinary chocolate in it? This SF chocolate was delicious. It is also easy to use. For most people, the fountain is only one of many things being prepared for a dining event, so speed and ease are extremely important. The bags heat nicely to get your fountain going quickly. Well worth it, and much easier than fussing with oil and chocolate blocks or chips.
