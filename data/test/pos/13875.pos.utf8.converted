June 28, 2006:  Lovely bonsai, extremely well packaged - arrived in perfect condition (beware the oodles of styrofoam pieces left after unpacking! :-))  My olive tree was actually blooming when it arrived last week, and has a nice, delicate fragrance. Pot doesn't come with a saucer, so be sure to put a dish underneath before watering. More compact that the tree pictured (but more typically bonsai shaped), I am quite happy with my purchase. I still prefer to grow, shape and pot my own bonsai, but this little olive (which I can't find in my area other than ordering here) was a nice addition to my bonsai collection.

It has had no health problems, and has bloomed several times since purchased(small, pale green flowers, followed by tiny ornamental fruit that falls off shortly thereafter, like an ornamental crabapple). Needs watering every two-three days in summer, every three-four days in winter. Mine sits in a floor-to-ceiling window in a highrise building receiving full sunlight most of the day, and constant air from an air vent above the window. Hasn't grown much (I experienced one burst of new leaves, which promptly died when I left on vacation and it went without water for almost a week).  So, I haven't needed to trim it yet.  Still recommended!
