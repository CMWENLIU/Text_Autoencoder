Ever since I had my first taste of marzipan at the age of 4, I've been hooked. Each Christmas, I'd get a little tray of fruit-shaped marzipan - once a hotdog, etc. The foil wrapping inside the cardboard package helps to keep the marzipan soft enough to mold or eat. I chop out little 'coins' of the tube and drop into a bowl of strawberries, cantelope and creme - nice little confectionary add-on. I'm not much into sweets at all - but this is just the right flavor - almond and a hint of sugar without the overwhelming over-sweetened pre-made treats sometimes have.
