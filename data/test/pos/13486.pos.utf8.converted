A nice choice for making salad dressings.  It has a slightly "thicker" feel than other oils and therefore stays blended well with a creamy texture.  Avocado oil has a mild flavor and while more flavorful than canola or olive oils, it is not overpowering.  (It sometimes hardens a bit like olive oil does when you refrigerate it, but it quickly warms up and blends when shaken.) Use it with some balsamic vinegar and either Good Seasons Italian or Basil Vinaigrette mix for an easy and delicious "homemade" salad dressing.
