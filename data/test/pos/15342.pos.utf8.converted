I first experienced these liquor filled delights in Italy. And when I returned I gave a box of them to my wife. She has always loved the European liquor candies, but they are so hard to find here in the US. They are the kind of thing that you keep for special moments... Maybe in the evening with a nice cup strong coffee... when the kids are in bed... And you can sit back and spoil yourself a little... But they are so good that you will want to spoil yourself a lot more often!!! :-))))<br /><br />From the first bite as the chocolate candy opens up, releasing that wickedly delicious liquor (and it is REAL liquor) to overwhealm your taste buds and slip warmly down your throat... To the deliciously firm Marachino cherry center, and the finish of excellent creamy milk chololate... It is a wave of pleasure... You know, I think I'm going to run off and have one! :-)))))))))) You should buy some too! You won't be sorry!
