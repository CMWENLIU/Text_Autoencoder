I've been one to study labels on food packaging that I plan to consume, even more so now that I'm a father of two young ones. Prerequisite: No hydrogenated oils, high fructose, or preservatives. There are a few other ingredients but these are the main offenders.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised when I recently read an article on NurturMe baby food. The article linked to their site [...], so I spent some time perusing to learn more about the brand. For one, I thought the packaging was super appealing and a wonderful idea. Simple packets vs. glass jars, right up my alley. Secondly, I wasn't too keen on "quick dried" foods, but did some research on it and quickly found that through this method, the food maintains it's nutrients with no preservatives needed...passed my test. After ordering a few packets of each flavor (pea, squash, sweet potato and apple) on NurturMe's site, I received them a few days later and had both my babes try them out (5 mo and 26 mo's old). I used my wife's breast milk to reconstitute the sweet potato for the youngster and water for my elder babe and figured apple was a good start since he's a big fan. After pouring the contents of one packet into a small bowl it didn't appear there was much, however, after mixing it with the water and breast milk it turned into quite a good serving size. The first thing that really jumped out was how rich and vibrant the flavor of the food was - a great indicator that there's no preservatives. The smell was also right on target, as if I'd just sliced a sweet potato or apple. I gave it a try myself and said, "hmm, good stuff." I then gave the apple to my son and just let him get after it. After turning around from providing my daughter with the sweet potato, my son had literally gobbled almost every last bit of apple. The sweet potato would have been taken care of in the same way had my daughter's dexterity been at the level of my son. GREAT product.
