These supposedly have some of the highest levels of antioxidants of any food, which is why I bought them. But I really like the taste too. It's not too far off from a cross between a tomato and a strawberry, but a very little bit bitter at times.<br /><br />Overall they taste great, though some kids might not like them due to the slight bitterness.<br /><br />Edit: A few of these berries have a bit of mold on them. I would reduce my ranking by 1 star if I could.
