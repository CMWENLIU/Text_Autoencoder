Having tried numerous brands over the years, I find this the absolute best of all Tabouli mixes.  Every year or two when a new brand comes out I try it, and every time without exception I go back to Casbah.  So now I've gotten to the point of not even bothering to try new competitors.  When I've found Casbah on sale I've bought 20 or 30 boxes at a time, but now that is unnecessary due to Amazon's great price.<br /><br />My favorite tabouli preparation is to mix in the juice of one fresh lemon, decreasing recommended water a little accordingly, then adding a diced small tomato, chopped green onions (or regular onion if green unavailable), and fresh cilantro.  Enough cilantro for a moderate amount in every bite or two - but cilantro can overwhelm if too much is put in.  Occasionally I'll add some garlic or green garlic for variety.  And when I really want variety I add jalapeno or some sort of hot chile pepper.
