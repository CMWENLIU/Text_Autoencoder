I've bought five different growers' figs from Amazon - though I suspect it's one big Fresno cooperative that separates by type and dryness. For sweetness, freshness, and just overall taste, the Sun Maid Calimyrna win hands down, BUT they are the most expensive. They come in a 6-ounce bad instead of everybody else's 8. And be careful: Sun Maid also has the darker figs in 8 ounce packs, and they're plump and sweet as well, but I can only get those in the market right now.<br /><br />The best buy is Blue Ribbon Orchard Choice Figs. They're quite a bit drier, but taste as good. They're also smaller, so watch the calorie count. There's a tendency to east 8-12 of these little ones without thinking that you're going through 240 calories fairly quickly.<br /><br />I see no difference between organic and ... what, inorganic ... except that organic costs more. All five that I've bought run between $2.50 and $3.00 a pack, about 60 cents less than market price. But all five have exactly the same calorie count, vitamins, and additives or lack thereof. All come from Fresno, and the two differences are in size and mositness.<br /><br />If I were a rich man (play Fiddler in the background), I'd buy a truckload of the Sun Main. Oh, yeah, most of the Sun Maid Calimyna don't have stems to worry about. On the other hand, sometrimes stems make for good "handles."
