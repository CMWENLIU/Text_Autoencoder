I first got these after reading about them in The Thin Commandments Diet.  They were recommended as a way of controlling appetite.  I have to say that they are an acquired taste.  My pet name for them is "baked hay".  But, I eat them because they help fill me up, give me fiber, and have only a few calories in each one.<br /><br />As long as I don't eat them "straight", they are good.  Many mornings, I eat them with a little bit of spray butter, cinnamon and Splenda.  Other times, I dip them in the soup I'm eating.  Yet other times, I melt cheese on them. They help fill me up and satisfy my appetite.
