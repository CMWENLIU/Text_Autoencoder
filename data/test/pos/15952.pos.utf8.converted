I have been drinking French Roast coffee for over 20 years.  I was a little unsure about ordering 5lbs of coffee without trying it.  I was concerned about people who commented that it was not a true French Roast - well it is!<br />Occasionally I drink Vienna roast which is the lightest of the dark roasts - not as dark as French.  I don't like the burnt smokey taste of Italian roast.  So it's French roast for me.<br />I knew this coffee was good just by the slight aroma without even opening the bag.  The beans are the right color for a French Roast and slightly oily, as should be.<br />I boil the water and use a filter cone to make the coffee.  This coffee is rich just like a French Roast should be.  This is the French Roast for me from now on.<br /><br />May 2012(Follow-up review.  My third bag was a lighter roast - more like a Vienna roast - but still very good quality.
