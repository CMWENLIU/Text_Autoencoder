Lundberg Mocha Sweet Rice Cakes are the best tasting rice cakes out there. If you get bored with just eating them with a spread, try breaking up a couple of the rice cakes in a bowl, drizzle olive oil over and sprinkle with sea salt and microwave on high for 22 seconds.  You'll never miss popcorn.<br />Deb
