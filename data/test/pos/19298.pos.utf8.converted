These cookies are on the large size for what they are.  Thick too.  Well packaged in four individually wrapped and sealed trays.  Not loose and broken like I imagined they could have been.  Compared to the small packets in the store these are like half price per cookie when you buy this large tin.  This is one large tin too.  This large size tin was bucks off from what it was last I looked so I was concerned they were old stock and inferior ( I ordered them the first week of December ) ; could be a year old from last year I thought.<br /><br />Nope, nope they are fresh and quite good.  I am picky so they are extra good.  The tin is BEAUTIFUL.  Elegant old time illustrations well executed, not chintzy.<br /><br />The cookies are heaven with a bit of your favorite jam or jelly on top with some tea or coffee in the morning.  Easy to eat this way because the cookies are only slightly sweet ( not icky sugary).<br /><br />I am so glad they are only slightly sweet.  Could not have been better.<br /><br />I am a happy boy.
