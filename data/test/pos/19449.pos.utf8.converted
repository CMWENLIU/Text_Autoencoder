I think that this product is wonderful!<br /><br />My dog and cats love the taste of it.  I would never be able to provide the same level of nutrition to my pets by using only my own ingredients.  This enhances the nutrtional level of my pets' meals considerably.  And it is so easy to use.  I often add some fresh vegetables, blueberries, and a very small amount of liver too, instead of just boneless meat or fish, but that's optional because all of those things are already included in Call of the Wild.  All you really have to do is add one teaspoon of Call of the Wild to every 3 ounces of fresh meat, stir it up, and serve. It's that simple to give your pet a fresh food complete and balanced stellar diet.<br /><br />I used to think that the best kibbles like Orijen, Nature's Variety Instinct, etc, were okay for my dog.  Call of the Wild with fresh meat or fish is a far beter diet for my dog.  What a comfort it is to know that my pets are getting the nutrients of a natural diet: raw meats, organs, connective tissues, vitamins, minerals, fruits, vegetables, fiber, fats, antioxidents etc. -- about everthing that they'd get from eating natural prey and other natural foods.  And this is not expensive.  It's very convenient and uncomplicated.<br /><br />I use Call of the Wild for most of the pets' meals (and sometimes I also feed Stella and Chewey's freeze dried raw.)<br /><br />My dog devours the homecooked meats with this stuff on it. I would not be able to provide the same level of nutriton without this product.<br /><br />I very highly recommend this product for homecooked pet meals.<br /><br />You should also get a food scale to weigh the meat, so you can add the correct amount of Call of the Wild.  Use measuring spoons, too.  The only other thing you need is fish oil with natural vitamin E for days that you don't feed sardines or wild salmon.<br /><br />I cannot see myself ever going back to feeding kibble again, not even the best of them like Orijen or Nature's Variety Instinct that I used for a long time.  I am very convinced that fresh meat with Call of the Wild + occasional Stella and Chewy's freeze dried raw meals is a far better diet for my dog than when I fed the best grain free kibbles.<br /><br />It's worked out great for feeding my two cats and extraordinarily active German Shepherd dog.
