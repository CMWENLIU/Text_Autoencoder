As a vegan, I want to insure adequate complete protein in my diet.  Nutiva Hemp Protein-50% is exactly that--product weight divided by 2= protein weight.  Nutiva is a fast way to boost protein, is a complete protein, and mixes easily, without a need for a blender and its cleanup.  I have Nutiva Organc Hemp Protein-50% on subscription every month and appreciate the savings for my health.
