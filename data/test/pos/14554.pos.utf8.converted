SweetLeaf is great! We've been using this instead of sugar or Splenda when making Kool-Aid. (Okay, I know the Kool-Aid is anything but natural but I take it where I can!) We love it -- 1 tsp of SweetLeaf is the same as 1 cup of sugar so a bottle lasts quite a while. It's tasted great in all of our beverages. I hope to try it in other things soon but I highly recommend even if we only used it in drinks.
