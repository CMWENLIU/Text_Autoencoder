I first started using the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000668Z96">Victor Ultimate Flea Trap</a> when I lived in California because we had a problem with sand fleas coming in our back patio screen door. We also didn't want to use any pesticides, since we had four small house pets.<br /><br />When we moved to Michigan, we continued using the traps because our child was born, and we felt even more strongly about avoiding pesticides. Although we did not have a flea problem, the traps have caught several types of spiders, the occasional house fly, a few random creepy crawlies, and even a hornet! Basically, they seem to trap anything attracted to the light/heat.<br /><br />We keep them tucked away, out of sight (ex: in a back corner of our furnace room, under furniture), and in places where the pets can't get too curious -- getting a refill stuck to your skin (or dog fur) is the absolute worse.<br /><br />All in all, I think we've been using these traps for nearly ten years now. The bulbs can be replaced with regular night light bulbs or the new LED bulbs.
