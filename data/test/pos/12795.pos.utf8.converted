Beth's Gluten-Free all purpose flour is very good.  It is still a little pricey as all gluten free seems to be.  However, I used this four for my Christmas cookies this year and they came out great.  They were even better than my regular flour cookies!  I liked the ease of the premixed flour so I didn't have to worry about clumps of baking soda or baking powder like I usually do when baking.  I recommend this flour to other GF bakers, even/especially the newbies because it makes it so much easier and tastes great!
