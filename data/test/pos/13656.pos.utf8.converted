It is actually amazing how this stuff can take on such a meaty flavor.  It is easy to use and there are tons of recipes on the Internet.  It is very nutritional and it tastes good depending on how you prepare it.  The neat thing is it really does have a texture of meat when prepared as such...  I read a recipe the other day where someone made it taste like oatmeal... Very versatile... Great survival item to keep in your pantry or take camping... Soak in water until tender and use it any way you like...
