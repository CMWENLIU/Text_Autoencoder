This is the best No Salt season I've got so far, it is way better than buying Mrs.Dash,We add this seasoning to all the food we cook, Taste is Good and has No Salt at all it is healthy and you can add all to you need.I got this from Costco and it's worth spending the money on this product, I will stick to buying this. We Love it.Thanks<br />Kirkland Signature for a this GREAT PRODUCT.
