Five months ago I was diagnosed with Endometriosis (they think I have it but haven't done a laparoscopy to confirm) and was put on Birth Control pills from my Gyno. I don't do well on birth control; it makes me extremely unbearable to be around due to the intense mood swings it causes. But because I was in chronic pain from the Endometriosis I decided to try it. After three months I had to stop and find an alternative method because I wasn't handling the birth control well at all. This caused me to search for alternative/holistic methods to help ease the pain and regulate my periods. I read others reviews on this site and on fertility sites about the benefits of raspberry leaf tea. Since I use the Throat Coat from Traditional Medicinal which works wonders I trusted the brand completely.<br /><br />After I got off the birth control I started drinking this tea immediately, as directed and included Chaste Tree (VITEX) extract into each cup 2-3 times a day. I even steep it for the recommended 15 minutes to maximize the benefits. Since starting this I have reduced my periods from a standard super heavy flow for 7-8 days to a light-medium flow for 3.5-4 days (PLEASE NOTE HOW AMAZING THAT IS!) It started working right away on my very first period off the birth control but before I wrote a review to preach about it I waited another two cycles to see if it was consistent. It was! My periods are regular and the cramping has become less and less each month.<br /><br />Would I recommend this tea? ABSOLUTELY! If you have an issue with Endometriosis this could be an alternative to birth control pills and is something that I've found really helpful for reducing the length of my period and thus reducing the damaging effects that Endometriosis can cause. I am SO GRATEFUL for the accessibility to these types of traditional medicines!!! THANK YOU TRADITIONAL MEDICINALS!!!
