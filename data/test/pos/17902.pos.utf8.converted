I've been eating Linketts since I was a very young child since my Grandparents are vegetarians, and I LOVE them.  I will admit it is a very aquired taste.  I even got my boyfriend started on them and he loves them too.  =D<br /><br />I would suggest finding a store that sells them by the can before you invest in a whole case.  I know that you can find them at Raley's on the West Coast.  If local health food stores don't carry them check to see if there is a Seventh Day Adventist Church near you.  The SDA Church typically has a book center that sells the Worthington/Loma Linda products.<br /><br />Edit:  I have also found Linketts in the natural food section of Kroger's here in Texas as well.  Another Edit.. My local Kroger has stopped carrying Linketts.  =(
