I am new to macrobiotics, so I am still training myself  to stay within the guidelines, but sometimes I either need a quick healthy snack or a treat to reward myself. These bars are really yummy. They are a little small to use for a meal replacement, but they make a great snack or a healthy dessert alternative. I have tried four of the flavors, and so far these are my favorite, but they have all been good. I hope this company is successful and someday the price might come down a bit more, but it's a great way to pamper myself. Enjoy!
