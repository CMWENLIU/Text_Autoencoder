Over the last year, I have been discovering the phenomenal health benefits of Green Tea. Since I'm still nursing my baby boy  I have given up caffeine and needed something to feel energized. As a new mother I wanted to keep up with my son as he is so full of beans all the time. For many years I have tried all kind of products in the name of health and wellness. So I'm excited to finally find a product that suits my busy schedule called Chi Green Tea Extract. Its really easy to use , I drink a full dropper of Chi Tea in warm water every morning. I find the taste of both to be delicious and I actually crave drinking it I have noticed a more steady flow of energy throughout the day since using Chi Green Tea Extract. and friends have commented that I'm glowing and looking younger (Its not just the mothers glow)<br /><br />The website I order Chi Tea is at [...] . I have found it very informative and have provided me with all kinds of fascinating facts. I enjoyed learning about anti-aging properties of green tea. Epidemiological observations have shown that people in green-tea consuming countries-mainly Japan and China-have very low rates of cancer. In Japan, the women who teach the tea ceremony, and thus drink more than the average amount of extra-strong green tea, are noted for their very low mortality rate and longevity; deaths from cancer are especially rare in this group.<br />I sent my mother a bottle in Australia and she has seen an improvement from her high blood pressure, stomach problems, tiredness and varicose veins. After drinking the Chi Tea for a few days her blood pressure was back to normal and after a couple of weeks her stomach problems completely improved.<br />I found some great research on the website [...] about the magical benefits of green tea.  Dr. Earl Mindell in his Super Antioxidant Miracle book describes ways in which green tea could help you. These ways include protective safeguards against possible breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, intestinal cancer, skin cancer, and stomach cancer. "Further," he states, "it prevents oxidation reactions in the brain, acts as an antibacterial against harmful digestive bacteria, it cures gum disease, it lowers oxidized LDL cholesterol and raises HDL cholesterol, it lowers triglycerides, inhibits viruses such as HIV, hepatitis, and herpes viruses, and acts as an antioxidant protestant against damage to blood vessels. Not only are there so many scientific facts about the benefits of Green Tea.<br /><br />Chi Tea has been endorsed by by Dr " Tea"Mark Ukra. Dr Ukra has been on Oprah several times and uses the product daily. Its also on the menu at his famous Teagarden Tea house in Beverly Hills. Click here for more info. I really just enjoy the taste of Chi Green Tea Extract. Its convenient and will make a great Christmas present to family and friends. This year the best present I believe that I can give to loved ones is good health.
