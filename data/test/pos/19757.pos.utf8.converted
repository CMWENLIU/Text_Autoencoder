I have bought the Gogo brown rice and liked it very much for carrying to school for a quick, if starchy, lunch. This is even better. Nice variety of rice types, flavors, lengths. Very easy to carry and make in a microwave. Very filling for one person's meal, would be great for sharing with someone as a side dish. Will be wonderful when it's cold outside this winter.
