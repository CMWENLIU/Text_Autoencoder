I tried this tea for the first time three days ago and have used 2/3 of the box already.  It is a delicious tea to drink any time of the day.  My daughter and I are very pleased we discovered this product and will be drinking it regularly from now on.  It has a very pleasant taste with a very subtle hint of mint.  I do not care for mint tea; however, I love this tea!  This tea is great for reducing stress and energizing.  I wish Amazon sold it with free shipping.  5+ stars!
