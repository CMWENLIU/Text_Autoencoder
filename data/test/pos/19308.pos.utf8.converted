C&P Organix is a great line of dog food.  I'm not sure how much I agree with some of the other reviews.  For instance, DogFoodAnalysis.com is a FOR PROFIT website - doesn't exactly qualify as non-bias.  Also, the reviewer who said their dog was 'itching' - don't know what that was about.  People are constantly commenting on Crixus' fur and how shiny and beautiful it is - I've fed him Organix since he was 9 weeks old and I would never change to another brand.  Unless a dog is in his/her 'golden years' or has a health condition, there really is no need to beef up on the GC&MSM.<br /><br />Everyone is going to have a different opinion on 'the best dog food'.  I'm just saying, if you don't mind paying a little extra, (significantly less than Orijen or Evo), and you're looking for a quality food - C&P Organix is great.  Their treats and wet food are high quality as well.<br /><br />Another important point - the dog food is made in the U.S.A.<br /><br />If you do decide to purchase it, I highly recommend subscribing through Amazon.  Best price and delivered to your door - no hassles.  The only local store I've found that carries this line is Petco.  Unfortunately, Crixus' favorite feed store doesn't carry it - but the owner was very impressed with it and is looking into purchasing it.  You won't ever find this line in a grocery store.  That says a lot.<br /><br />Good luck!
