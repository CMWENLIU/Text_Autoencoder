Everything about this product is of the highest quality.<br /><br />The only thing I have to add to these glowing reviews is more product information: the honey is shipped in a plastic -- not glass -- jar, so you needn't worry about glass breakage during shipment. It's an amber color and opaque, unlike most commercial honeys.<br /><br />I also was concerned that since the honey is from New Zealand that it would take a long time to arrive at my door, but this was not the case. The product arrived promptly and in excellent condition.<br /><br />One thing I would have changed would be the Active + number: I think I should have purchased the 16+ instead and will do so in the future.
