I found this on the spice shelf of my local grocer and decided to give it a try. What a find! Our house smells like a gourmet kitchen every time I use it. It's excellent in the oven and on the grill. Recently, smaller stores stopped carrying the product, so it's a lot harder to find. But it's well worth the trouble. I've tried many other brands of chicken rubs/seasonings (McCormick, etc.) but this one is by far the best.
