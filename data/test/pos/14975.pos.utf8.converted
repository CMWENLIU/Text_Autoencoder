I don't want to go into gross detail, but I did have an open pore that occasionally became painfully inflamed.<br /><br />At first I thought it was a bug bite with a permanent pin-prick sized bite "hole/mark", as it never did go completely away, but when it repeatedly (2-3x a year) swelled up to the size of a quarter (hard to the touch and very painful) I finally decided to seek medial advice.<br /><br />My Dermatologist explained it was a pore. She could make an incision to clean out the debris of dead cells, but suggested a surgeon who could completely clean & cut out the core of it all to avoid further occurrences.<br /><br />Not feeling so cozy about that, I searched online for alternatives to cleaning cell debris, I forget the exact key-word search I did, but I came to a website that talked about the HEALING qualities of MANUKA Honey for all kinds of ailments & diseases from internal such as intestinal issues, ulcers, Crohn's disease  to  external skin problems including those caused by Diabetes, burns, and so much more!<br /><br />Didn't take me long to be convinced this ACTIVE honey is worth a try. I found a good deal right here on Amazon and purchased Manuka jars on a regular schedule.<br /><br />IT DID HELP! Wasn't instant, but it did work.<br /><br />I spread  Active 16+ Manuka Honey  on and around the area of the inflamed pore. I then covered the area with a piece of gauze and used medical tape to hold it in place. I did this mornings after my shower and evenings before bed.<br />I treated the inflamed pore for 16 days till it was cleared up.<br />It flared up about a half a year later, so I repeated the whole process again. It's been almost a full year since I've had my last flare-up.<br />At some point in the future I may decide to have the core of the pore surgically removed, but for now I've not had problems for so long, I'm definitely content to leave it as is and treat naturally again if necessary ;)<br /><br />I also learned that Manuka Honey is good for the gut too. So I started taking 1 tsp before meals and noticed reduced GERD symptoms within a day!<br /><br />We now keep two Manuka Honey jars in the house. One labeled "medicinal" stored in our medicine cabinet and the other is kept with our daily supplements in the kitchen.<br /><br />*All the best to your health*<br />:)
