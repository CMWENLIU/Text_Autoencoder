I'm sitting here this morning drinking a cool and refreshing Guayaki Yerba Mate and it reminded me that I have not yet done a review on my most favorite drink. Guayaki mate comes in many forms; dry loose-leaf tea, tea bags for steeping, and sweetened, flavored iced tea. I was first introduced to the joys of mate over a year ago by my tea-savvy sister-in-law. She was so devoted that should could not help but tell everyone she knew about the awesome powers of mate. Yerba Mate is made from a holly tree that grows in the South American Rainforest and the native people have been drinking it for centuries. In fact the natives call it the "drink of the gods." Mate contains a cousin of caffeine that many have dubbed "mateine" which wakes you mentally without all the negative side effects that caffeine has. It doesn't give you the jitters, or an upset stomach, or the sweats. It just gives your brain a little energy boost slowly but very effectively. Mate also contains many antioxidants, even more than green tea!<br /><br />The plain hot tea tastes very similar to plain green tea and is great on a chilly morning. They have recently started selling flavored versions of the hot tea (at least at the store near me) but I have not had a chance to try them. I know one of them is mint flavored and I would bet that it's tasty. The sweetened and flavored ice teas are beyond delicious. They come in Revel Berry, Lemon, and Mint flavors and I have tried all three. I'm not a big fan of the mint flavor, but my husband thinks it's the best of them all. My personal favorite is the Revel Berry flavor.<br /><br />Best of all, Guayaki is Certified Organic, Fair Trade, Kosher, and Non GMO. Guayaki is committed to helping the farmers earn a decent living as well as restore the Rainforest. According to the Guayaki can, "Guayaki's mission is to steward and restore 200,000 acres of South American Atlantic Rainforest and create over 1,000 living wage jobs by 2020". So, we can rest assured that the delicious beverage we are enjoying is going to actually HELP the Rainforest instead of ruin it. So drink up!
