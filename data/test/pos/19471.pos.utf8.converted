This is a great price for this.<br />I love baking with maple sugar, and sometimes I'll have it in my coffee as well. My favorite use of this wonderful tasting sugar is in shortbread made with whole wheat flour. The flavor stands up well to the stronger flavor of whole wheat and makes just the best shortbread I've ever had. I've also used it in breads. It's more expensive than brown sugar, but the maple taste of pure maple sugar can't be simulated.<br />It's also good in oatmeal, granola recipes, and most anywhere you would use regular sugar or brown sugar.
