I was looking for green tea supplements that offered appetite surpressing and detox.  I always read the reviews of AMAZON and find them very helpful.  There were a few people who rated this product below a three, but more than not it was rated 4 or 5.  I understand why! The fasting herbal supplement has a good flavor and a little sweet taste at the end.  I am drinking it every day and find that I am eating less.  I do have more energy and I am moving away from coffee to drinking more tea daily.  I love it and I don't believe that alone I will lose weight, but as part of an overall better eating plan it will help me pass up some of the sweet stuff over the holiday season and beyond.  Good product.
