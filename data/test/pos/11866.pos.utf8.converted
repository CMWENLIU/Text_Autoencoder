I've taken to making cupcakes and cookies and making icing letters on them...  you know, an "H" on one cookie, "A" on another, and so forth, and arrange the cookies or cupcakes to spell out HAPPY BIRTHDAY or whatever the occasion might be.  I prefer bold, rich colors, like jewel tone colors, so these gel colors fit the bill to get the bold color without watering down my icing.  Only takes a few toothpicks of color to get what I'm looking for, so each 1/2 ounce color is going to go a long way.  A good buy, all around.  I will never go back to regular liquid food coloring!<br /><br />Also, I know others have stated this but I'll say it again, the black color is good but you have to start with a chocolate icing, not a white icing.<br /><br />**Update** I found another use for these Wilton colors by making colored sugar.  I've used it with granulated sugar and with sparkling sugar (bigger crystals) and it works great either way, but the sparkling sugar is more, well, "sparkly" which I like since I use the colored sugar to decorate cakes and cookies with.  Put the sugar into a Ziploc bag, take the tip of a butter knife to get some color on it, then wipe the color off the knife on the inside of the bag. (Does that make sense?)  Zip up the bag, then mash the sugar around with the color until evenly distributed.  The color will come off the side of the plastic bag just fine and blend in with the sugar.  Then spread the sugar out on a plate or a sheet of foil to dry for a few hours.  Voila!
