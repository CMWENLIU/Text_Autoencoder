Being omniscient, I knew this candy would be satisfactory long before I had even ordered it. As expected, my guest partook in taking a large portion of these and stuffing them in his hat for later consumption. Even after setting fire to my home, he returned to snatch the entire bowl as I was reaching for the fire alarm.<br />I highly recommend these candies for anyone aiming to be an excellent host, like myself.
