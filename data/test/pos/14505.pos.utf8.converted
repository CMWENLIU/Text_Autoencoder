I love cayenne or other hot chilis in sweets like chocolate, and thought these sounded delicious!  They are!  The mango really does taste like a ripe juicy mango, and the heat adds a nice contrast.  The lime is also perfectly balanced with the hot.  These lollipops are hot enough to be enjoyably spicy, but without making your lips swell like some hot sauces can.  They have become my favorite lollipops!
