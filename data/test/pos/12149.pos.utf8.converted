I use the Euro Cuisine Yogurt Starter to make my yogurt with the Euro Cuisine Yogurt Maker YM100. It makes a great yogurt. My only suggestion is that you stir the culture into the milk very well, as I found it a bit difficult to dissolve. I now take some of the prepared milk into a separate container, add the culture and stir to blend extremely well, then add it back into the entire prepared milk. This assures that the culture was dissolved properly and gets evenly distributed.
