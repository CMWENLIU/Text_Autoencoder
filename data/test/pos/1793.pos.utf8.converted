While other people have ponited out the heavy SUGAR content and average protein, i have been using the shakes for 2 weeks and lost 7 1/2 pounds. What i have done is had 3 shakes daily, 50 oz of water, 1 to 2 coffee's and dinner. Dinner is primarly a great protein (chicken, turkey, veal, sometimes steak or a burger while only having a small amount of carbs. i do not feel lacking (although the weekends are harder......)or hungry. All of this being said I have not made a true comparisant to other shakes. This one is working though. When i called the Special K hot line and asked them if they have a suggested diet to follow with the shakes they said no just to eat a sensable dinner. I figured that out myself and was hoping that there would be a better response.<br /><br />For someone that needs to loose 10 - 30 pounds this is a great option to get started.
