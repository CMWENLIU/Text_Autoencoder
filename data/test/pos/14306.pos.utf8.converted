I love how they come in individual packages. They taste good. I know because I tried one. They're about as sweet as a graham cracker but as hard as a ginger snap. Like everyone else said, they do get goopy, but babies are messy and the sooner you come to terms with that, the better you'll be as a mom! Most importantly, they're not made of horrifying bleached flour or high-fructose corn syrup (still don't know what that is...). These are the best, so stop wasting your time looking!
