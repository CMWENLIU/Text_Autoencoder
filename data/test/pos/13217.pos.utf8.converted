Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix is wonderful.  Haveing been gluten free for 27 years and not being able to find products that were good tasting I gave up and went without until my daughter discovered this mix last year.  It makes the best pizza crust - so good my husband does not eat boughten pizza and prefers mine made from the Pamela's mix.  Check out their site for other great recipies.  I have tried the sugar cookies, peanutbutter cookies, chocolate chip cookies, banana nutbread, pizza and biscuits.  Now I am going to give their bread mix a try.  Hope that is as tasty! The price of the mix through Amazon.com is great too!
