I really can't say enough good things about combining these three products. When I first received the rabbit I thought it was a joke, a good sacrifice perhaps but just a joke.<br />Boy. Was I wrong!<br />I received the lady bugs and the uranium ore a few days later (to my horror the uranium had leaked into the ladybugs) so my 4500 ladybugs had turned into 5 super ladybugs and 4495 dead ladybugs, I suppose even science has it's losers.<br />Anyway the super ladybugs quickly consumed the fresh rabbit I had just spent $40 dollars on. However in some benign act the ladybugs began to mutate. Creating some hybrid rabbit beast that attempted to consume me.<br />Of course I had preordered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MRD5JO">7 Million Live Beneficial Nematodes-Kills over 230 Bugs</a> who quickly reduced the super ladybug rabbit beast down to mulch.<br /><br />I'm not overly pleased with the rabbit but I still have three more and a half tin of Uranium.
