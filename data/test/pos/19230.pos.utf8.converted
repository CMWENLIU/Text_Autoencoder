I didn't order them from Amazon because I can find this brand in a store in Houston. So I cannot review the shipping...<br /><br />I was looking for boudins noirs for a long time. These are great !!! The texture and tastes are just awesome.<br /><br />They are delicious cooked in the oven, or on a fry pan (without adding any oil or butter) with apples, rice etc...<br /><br />They are also good in a pie (with apple also).
