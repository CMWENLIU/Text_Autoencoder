When I was diagnosd with Celiac Disease, I started on a search for good BREAD!!! And this is it!!!!! Easy to work with and actually tastes great. I was not successful using my bread making machine - this dough worked much better with a regular electric mixer. This mix also makes wonderful cinnamon bread!
