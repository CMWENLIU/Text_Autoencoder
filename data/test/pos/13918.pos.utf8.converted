Okay, my title is a little korny...okay, alot korny. I purchased the triple treat caramels; although, after reading the ingredient list, I was very skeptical. Every sugar-free product containing malitol (other sugar alternatives too) I had ever consumed (which there were tons) over the years had always left a less than palitable aftertaste to me. When I opened my box and saw the packaging, I was very excited by the look of the caramels. My mouth was watering as I opened my package and then I ate the caramel and was ZIP POP WEEEE...ALL FOR MEEE...HAPPY AS CAN BEEEE!...ehem, sorry, I couldn't help it. I am amamazed that there was ABSOLUTELY NO AFTERTASTE! I can not believe that there is no sugar in these delicious treats! I will be buying more of these, uh....NOW!
