<span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:52 Mins<br /><br /></span>I was going to write about how much my son LOVES Earth's Best Teething Biscuits, but I thought he could just show you how much he LOVES them in this video.  The biscuits do get soft after some time, but we just break of the soft piece and give him back the rest of the biscuit.  I would advise not to give these biscuits to a child until they've learned to chew puffs with their gums, so even if they were able to break of a piece themselves, they know to chew on it before swallowing.  My son is 7 months old in this video by the way.
