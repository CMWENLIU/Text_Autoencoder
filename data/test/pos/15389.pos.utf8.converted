So i went to Red Lobster and had their Alotta Colada.  Which is basically a double size Pina Colada.  And im soo glad i got this drink.  After that i went sampling other places Pina Coladas and the Red Lobster version is by far the best.  But not wanting to spend way too much money on a Bar tab i went hunting for the ingredients and tried many.  This Ingredient makes it PERFECT !!! Tastes Fantastic.  2 0z Captain Morgan Spiced Rum, 2 oz Pineapple Juice, and 2 oz of this " Cream of Coconut " blended with a cup of ice and you may not stop drinking this  tasty treat. Unfortunately here on amazon the price is kinda steep.  I get mine at BEVMO for significantly less. Sorry seller =(<br /><br />P.S. if you go sampling this at Red Lobster to see if you like it.  make sure they make it with Captain Morgan and you get the extra "Full Shot" of more Captain Morgan.  Cuz Mo Rum is Mo Betta =)
