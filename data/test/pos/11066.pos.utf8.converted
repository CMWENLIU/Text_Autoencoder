I bought a bag of Mediterranean Java at my NFS yesterday to try, and I think it tastes great with the same "mouth feel" as coffee. I even get a bit of a coffee head buzz from it, but it has no caffeine. I had been using those instant grain coffee substitutes like Roma and Cafix, and they are kind of watery with a taste that is no better than just OK. The difference is that with those instant substitutes, I am fully aware that I am depriving myself of real coffee, but the Teeccino is just something good and different, but not a sacrifice.<br /><br />I just ordered a 3-pack of Teeccino in 11-oz bags from Amazon since I plan to drink this stuff as long as they keep making it. With Amazon's lower price, free shipping, and no sales tax, I save about 33% over what it costs to buy it locally. Thanks, Amazon.<br /><br />ETA 4/19/2010. I ordered the $12.95 (includes shipping) sample pack from the Teeccino website and got it two days later in TN from CA. It includes packs of all ten varieties and each pack makes a quart of full-strength brew. Some of the flavors I really didn't like, so it was a lucky accident that I randomly picked my favorite of all ten, Mediterranean Java, the first time I bought an 11-oz bag. I don't like most flavored coffee, so I didn't like flavored Teeccino any better, but that is no slam against Teeccino in particular since some people love something like Amaretto in a hot drink. Anyway, my advice is to buy the sampler, then get your 3-packs of whatever you like best from Amazon.
