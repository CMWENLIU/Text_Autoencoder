I like to toss a couple of tablespoons of ground flaxseed into yeast breads and pizza dough.  I think it makes for interesting tweedy texture and imparts a nutty flavor.  However, the other person in the house who consumes the baked goods finds regular flaxseed by the same manufacturer to be too assertive and too multi-grainish despite arguments for its healthful advantages.  This product is a good compromise: golden flaxseed produces a nice straw colored hue instead of a tweedy look, has the same healthful properties and is more refined in flavor and texture.  I store it in the freezer and it lasts  indefinitely.
