This brand will spoil you for all other tunas. Period.<br /><br />First of all, when you open a can of American Tuna, Dorothy, I can assure you, you are not in Kansas anymore. It's a sashimi grade tuna steak, not crumbles, pieces or flakes. It's from one piece of fish, not Charlie D'Tuna and 49 of his fishy friends. You CAN'T squish the can lid down to where there's about a quarter of the height left as with other tunas; in fact when you open the lid you'll probably do as I do and drink the broth. All Omega 3s baby!!!<br /><br />If you compare how little product you actually get out of a "regular" can of tuna and one of these, there is probably about 2.5 to 3 times as much tuna in a can of American Tuna. Relatively speaking then, it's not really any more expensive. What it *IS* is totally worth the extra cost, on EVERY level. 42 grams of protein in every can. Hand filleted, hand packed, caught and canned in USA.<br /><br />more things to love about American Tuna:<br /><br />Real fishermen, real families, sustainable fishing practices. Plus excellent customer service provided by the real families that catch the fish. I actually spoke with one of the fishermen's wives after calling for more information about the mercury testing. I could not have been more impressed.<br /><br />Pole caught fish means I don't worry about mercury levels; they do independent tests for that too just in case. You can ask for copies of the testing.<br /><br />Tastes better than any other brand of tuna I've ever had. Folks that say it's dry maybe have not read the part where it's not meant to be drained.<br /><br />This salt free version is the one I use in recipes which helps me control the flavors a little better. There are also salted, jalapeno, and garlic versions too.<br /><br />Once you open a can though, there is no going back. You'll be spoiled rotten for anything else. You've been warned.
