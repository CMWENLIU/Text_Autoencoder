On vacation, I had breakfast at "Two Cats" Restaurant in Bar Harbor, ME. The breakfast was excellent, the ambience was colorful & intriguing, but it was the coffee that is my lasting memory. What a unique, delicious way to start that day. The following day I drove a considerable distance to that restaurant again just for another cup (I'd already had breakfast) AND to find out what kind of coffee they served. This product is their source. I often order coffee from Hawaii or Costa Rica and tend to buy the best brands locally, because I truly enjoy a good cup of coffee. This particular coffee has a flavor that reminds of a french or dark roast, but it lies a bit more softly and pleasingly on the palate. Like a fine wine or light dessert. There is a mellow boldness about it that satisfies with a smile and invites another sip, another savoring moment, another cup. It is one of the few super cuppa Joe's I have found that are affordable enough to be enjoyed often. The flavor/price ratio is as high as I've found.
