I found this product in a gourmet grocery store, and since I like to make sauces, but don't have the time usually to do it from scratch, I tried it. I taste tested it against three different canned and boxed stocks I have used, and it was better. Depending on the concentration you mix it to, it is always chickeny, just a hint of sweet, and looks just like regular stock. I have even tried putting a quarts worth of the concentrate into a cupful of sauce and it doesn't make it salty, just taste richer, and it doesn't seem to affect the chemistry of sauces, thick or thin, no extra tendency to break. I have since tried all the other flavors with equal success. These are great for gourmet camp cooking too, and can be used any where you need a stock but don't want ot haul all the weight and bulk. Makes great soups too, friends and family rave about my Greek Avgolemeno soup which only uses this as the stock, along with some orzo, lemon, egg and diced cooked chicken.
