I am very happy with this product. I have way too many foods allergies to list so finding a product a can eat is a joy. I tolerate these well. I had to eliminate and/or greatly reduce oats in my diet due to reactions.<br />I am so happy to eat these like oats for breakfast. Also great in baking bars,cookies,cakes,meatloaves.<br />I couldn't find these many places, especially at this price.
