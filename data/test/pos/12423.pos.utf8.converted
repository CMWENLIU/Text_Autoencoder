I picked up this peanut butter on a whim one day, and it quickly became my favorite. The heat comes from chilis and cayenne, but it's not overdone... just a mild glow. I first tried it on crackers, and that was great. Next I tried it in a sandwich with cherry preserves--wow. Cherries and chilis complement each other nicely. I've used it to make spicy peanut noodles and it was a hit. It's even terrific on a spoon out of the jar. Peanut Butter and Co. peanut butters are quality spreads, with a fresh peanut-y taste and a nice consistency. The Heat is On is my favorite variety.
