Excellent product, and SO convenient for when you don't have a chance to buy fresh milk at the store.  We also take these on our boat, and they'd be perfect for camping, RV'ing, etc. since they don't need refrigeration until you open them.<br /><br />Only problem I had was with shipping, where the boxes leaked.  They ended up at the post office and I had to pick them up (they were worried the leakage was toxic!).  Amazon promptly refunded my money, though.  Last time, they were better boxed.  I would NOT recommend ordering these with books.  I did, and everything got soaked.
