I ordered this after having a facial where they used a mixture of almond oil, coconut oil and tamanu oil. My skin felt so wonderful, I had to try it for myself!  She recommended just getting coconut oil.  I actually really like that it solidifies so that I can just rub a little in my palms to heat it and apply it to my face & body.  It does feel a bit greasy at first, but absorbs nicely and my skin has never felt or looked better.  (I'm also using diluted apple cider vinegar as an astringent.)<br /><br />Now I need to try some of the other uses for coconut oil!
