A dear friend sent these to my dogs as a gift.  Both of my dogs (a lab mix and a pug/chihuahua mix) both thoroughly enjoy these Fruitables.  With the lab, all I have to do is pick up the bag.  I don't know how she knows, even before I open the bag, but she knows (even if she's in another room).  She'll wiggle, jump, shiver and shake until she's had her daily Fruitables.  I can hardly wait to try the other flavors.  I really like that this are all natural and healthy for my pets.
