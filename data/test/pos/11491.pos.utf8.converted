These are HOT! I like my food hot and spicy, but I wasn't expecting this much intensity when I first had these. The first time I cooked with them, I literally couldn't eat my soup because it was so hot lol. I've learned to use these (in moderation) in a lot of my dishes, and let me tell you, they are fantastic!
