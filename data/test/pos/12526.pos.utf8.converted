Wild caught, no added salt, great price.  Great flavor too.<br /><br />Bones and skin are pretty normal in canned salmon and mix right into a salad.  A source of calcium, actually.  And Omega 3 oil is highly recommended.<br /><br />Add some herbs and lemon juice (and maybe even a little salt), some fine chopped sweet onions, some fresh garlic ... have a feast!<br /><br />I don't buy many canned or other prepared foods because of the high salt and other additives, so this is great to find!  I notice this company also carries no salt added tuna - also a great price.
