I love this salt but the price, here, is way out of line. You can buy a case of 12 at buythecase.com for $30.00something dollars...works out to $3.09 per box. A case is a lot, but it just goes to show that this salt can be found for a much lower price. Publix used to carry it, although today, my hubby says he could not find it there. Men!<br />A humidity issue was mentioned in another review...I live in Florida at the beach and I have never had a problem with this salt. I have probs. with regular salt but not this. I keep salt in a small, open dish on the counter and when the humidity reaches about 90-100% I can still grab a pinch...it may stick together a tiny bit, but nothing to fret about. This salt also has recommendations from various culinary associations and institutes, and Alton Brown.
