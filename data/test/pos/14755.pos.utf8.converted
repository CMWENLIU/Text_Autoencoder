I have 2 allergy-prone French Bulldogs & it took many many years of experimentation with every type of dog food.  Finally a year ago... I came upon this product: WELLNESS CORE OCEANFISH & it was the absolute best food they ever had.  I am 100% pleased with this product & their health, as a result.  My bulldogs are fed this product 2x per day; I mix a little dry with the WELLNESS Oceanfish wet + a little water.  Their allergies have improved & they haven't been bored eating this everyday... They have now been on this food for over 1 year & I highly recommend it!  Great for bulldogs in particular!
