...at least I hope it remains available. It is so delicious- the only way to get better soup is to spend half a day making homemade soup. Why don't grocery stores carry it anymore? My local stores are H.E.B., Sun Harvest, and Whole Foods, and I can't find it at any of these places. And to Campbell's I say, "Please do not discontinue this product- it is your best soup." So, I'm just going to order a case from dependable Amazon- and when it runs out, I'll order more.
