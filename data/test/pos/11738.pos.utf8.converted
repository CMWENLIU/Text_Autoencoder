These fish pack a real flavor punch!<br /><br />We've been on a Haribo taste testing tour here in my house for the last few months. The bears, frogs (big and small), cherries were first and all gobbled up with much pleasure. So I ordered these a couple weeks ago in hopes of another hit, was not disappointed!<br /><br />If you are tired of the same ol gummy and like a little zing in your candy you will really enjoy this 5 pound bag of colorful fish. We ordered these from Amazon when they were having a sale, they arrived within 3 days with the Super Saver Shipping.<br /><br />0 complaints - on to the next Haribo delight!
