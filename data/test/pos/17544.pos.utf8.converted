I've been feed grain-free for many years, back when Innova Evo seemed to be the only company available at the local pet food store (not big stores like Petsmart). I switched off Evo a few years ago when grain prices increased and never decreased... taking my normal $40/large bag to $44 to $46 and now $50. The knowledgeable owner recommended Taste of the Wild as comparable and much less expensive at $30/large bag. This is much more cost effective for us since we have four cats to feed.<br /><br />I periodically re-research the state of cat foods to check whether Taste of the Wild is still comparable to the best available brands and it's held steady among the more expensive brands for several years (Innova Evo, Orijen, Wellness Core, etc.) Recently, I did more research and found that wet food/raw frozen food/raw homemade food is the best option for healthy kitties, NOT any kind of dry processed food (although grain free is still better than other substandard brands). However, dry food is still the most convenient for early morning automatic feedings, short trips away from home, and having a backup supply.<br /><br />This food, both this and the other available flavor, has been fine for the cats. They think it's tasty, don't barf it up (only one cat has issues and it's from scarfing his food in two minutes flat, not the food itself), and it keeps their coats healthy. Their weight seems stable (although the two fat cats stay fat from stealing food and human leftovers), energy levels fine (for an animal that sleeps 16hrs/day), and they're not eating scary junk (which is what I now think of the Iams/Eukanuba they ate before I went grain-free). Handling the food isn't bad, it smells like cat food, but not overwhelmingly gross (some dry kibble can be strongly odorous). The price point is the best plus for me for a dry food.<br /><br />Regarding other posts about unhappy cats... GRADUALLY introduce a new food. If your animal notices that there's something different or just refuses to eat, you're probably doing it too fast.<br /><br />Also, I'm not that concerned about the ethoxyquin issue that someone else pointed out (that particular poster is also talking about dog food forums too). Many manufacturers claim that it gets eliminated from the high heat (heavy processing that makes dry food so much unhealthier for cats in general) and others claim that all non-human consumption "ocean fish" get treated with ethoxyquin under US law which dissipates over time, yadda yadda, etc. Basically, there's a lot of talk about it and not a whole lot of evidence that it has any provable effects on animals. Just about everything processed nowadays seems to cause cancer or other horrible things. The non-ethoxyquin foods still mislead consumers (farm fish instead of ocean fish, etc.) or just use human-grade fish, which makes it MUCH more expensive. If you're that concerned about getting the best food quality and absolute healthiest diet for your beloved pet, IMO, you shouldn't be using dry cat food at all.
