I sure enjoy smoothies, and the Madagascar Vanilla Smoothie Mix does the trick.  I make fruit smoothies, strawberry milk smoothies (which we endearingly call PBS (Pepto Bismol Smoothie), chai smoothies, and my personal favorite---coffee smoothies.  The Smoothie Mix thickens any drink and has a very good flavor.  Buy it, enjoy!!!
