These are the best panko breadcrumbs that I have used in the past 5 years.I like that they are all natural.and they help make the best baked fried chicken. They stand up to a lot of dipping.and are always crisp.They do a baked fried catfish justice. Super Panko!<br />  Joe Griffin, North Port. Florida
