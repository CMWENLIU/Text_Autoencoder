This is my second purchase of these vanilla beans - I ordered 16 the first time & went for 1/2 pound the second time around.  I made my own vanilla extract - amazing!  I'll never buy already made extract again. (I used to get the expensive stuff too!)  I'm also giving my extract away as Christmas gifts this year.  I think I'll try the Creme Brule recipe with some of this batch.  Thanks again, JR Mushrooms!
