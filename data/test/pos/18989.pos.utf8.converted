Ok i have been using this brand of coconut oil for about 3 months now. I have been eating it, and i have hypothyroidism. It has made me feel so much better, more energy, swelling in my throat has gone down and it tastes great! i make chocolate shakes with it. I also use it as a skin lotion, no more dry skin and it smells soo good. I use it on my hair, no more dry hair, it has helped me grow my hair out and its really shiny. I have also been using it on my face, it has completely gotten rid of my acne and is quickly fading my acne scars, and no it does not clog my pores. This coconut oil is amazing, i love it!!!
