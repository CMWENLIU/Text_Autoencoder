My cat had scabs and bald spots all over her body. She scratched her whiskers off, had plaque on her belly she couldnt stop licking and had a rodent ulcer on her lips.  My vet put her on pred and cortisone shots and i put this in her food twice a day. The meds made her so much better but i noticed when i didnt put the fish oil in her food her scabs came back. I bought the 33 ounce container last time and it was way too big, went bad and smelled awful so i buy the small container and it lasts a few months. Great for pets with skin allergies. Finicky pets wont taste or smell it in the food. Great fish oil. The only con is the bottle leaks everywhere, i have to put a paper towel underneath the bottle.
