I've been buying these since they appeared in my area, and they are delicious.  The portion size is acceptable, considering these are only 100 calories.  The cookies are nice and minty and have a chocolate coating on the bottom of each cookie.<br /><br />Unlike say, the Oreo 100 calorie packs, these actually taste like grasshoppers, only smaller.  Unlike regular grasshoppers though, the 100 calorie pack version is trans fat free.<br /><br />Overall, these are a great example of what a 100 calorie pack should be.
