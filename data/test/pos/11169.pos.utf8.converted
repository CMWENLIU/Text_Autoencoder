I did not purchase La Chinata's Sweet Smoked Paprika from Amazon, but I have tried this product.  In short, I can only say it is beautiful.  It's like a soft silk caressing the tongue.  It imparts a smokey flavor that is enhanced by the unique flavor of Paprika, only this paprika is one of the best I have ever tried.  There is more depth to it as it hits every surface of your tongue.  Goes well on many things, though in my household we prefer it on fish with color, such as salmon.  This also goes well on white-meat chicken, adding flavor to an otherwise rather flavorless meat (just a side note: organic, free-range chicken is always more flavorful than prepackaged, frozen, "housed" chicken).  Though this paprika is sweet, it is great for savory dishes.  I highly recommend trying it!
