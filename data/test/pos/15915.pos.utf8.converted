My otherwise healthy daughter started getting caries at about 18 months. Giving her xylitol-based cheming-gum after every meal or snack seems to have stopped them (no noticeable developments 15 months later; we also paid more attention to brushing and dental visits). Next step was to find a replacement sugar and chose Xlear's Xylo-Sweet. The product tastes better than sugar, is just as sweet, and if the Finnish and other Scandinavian dental authorities recommend xylitol for caries control, I ain't going to argue.
