I have only recently begun cooking with almond flour in order to eliminate wheat/gluten from my diet.  The order of almond flour was received on time and the product itself is wonderful quality.  I have made several recipes from Elena's Pantry, who is the guru of almond flour cooking, and the end result was fabulous.  Thanks for making such a great product.  It is helping to make my transition to GF easier.
