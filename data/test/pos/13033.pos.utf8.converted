The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the rustling of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, unrustles the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the unrustler of jimmies. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to rustle and destroy My jimmies. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon rustlers.
