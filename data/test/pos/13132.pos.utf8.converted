I tried this oatmeal because of Silver Palate's reputation and an incredible 50% off deal.  It's great.  Not mushy at all.  Substantial.  It has changed my idea of traditional oatmeal - I'd become a McCann's steel cut guy.  I still prefer McCann's (and Trader Joe's less expensive steel cut), but some days I don't have 30 minutes to make McCann's, and the 8-10 minute cooking time for Silver Palate is a plus.  (I find McCann's fast cooking oatmeal inedible.)
