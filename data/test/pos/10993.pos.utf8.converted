A recently deceased friend told me about this food, Canadae Platinum.  He fed his "boys" both the dry and the canned.  His boys are a German Spitz and a Bichon Frise, 4/14 years old respectively.  Doug said that after less than two weeks, the 14 year old was like a "new dog".<br /><br />I now have his dogs, fullfilling a promise, added to our Doxy and Shiba Inu ( 5/7 years respectively), three cats and 7 birds.  All the dogs are now on this Canadae Platinum dry food and love it.  While they used to pick at their old food, they dive into this.  They also seem to get satiated faster, so they actually leave a little in the bowls.<br /><br />The Glucosamine/Chondroitin is the key for the older dog.  A vet once recommended it for an older dog we used to have years ago.  When I started taking it for my arthritic ankles, I was soon able to stop taking anti-inflamatories like Daypro.  I've since found out that the medical establishment considers GC to be useless.  All I can say is that it works for me, and within a few weeks of re-starting Little Boy ( the 14 year old) on this food with GC, he runs, plays and jumps with the rest of the dogs like a puppy.<br /><br />There are a few places in Las Vegas selling this food, all "high-end" pet food stores and all slightly more expensive.  The convenience of one-click and having the food on my doorstep in a day or two is even better than the savings.<br /><br />We've also moved our cats over to Felidae (the feline version of Canadae) with similar results.
