We've had this Kirkland Signature 16-ounce bottle of  Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla around the kitchen for several years now. We don't use it very much, but it's just one of those ingredients one has to have around a kitchen. My wife uses it in cookies, cakes, puddings and deserts of various kinds. Good vanilla is expensive and we got this KS Vanilla at our local warehouse store at what we regarded a bargain price. It's been excellent. We've been very satisfied. And it has a wonderful aroma!<br /><br />Gary Peterson
