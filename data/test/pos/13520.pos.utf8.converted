I read in a book that pure Stevia and this product are good for diabetics, and will not spike my blood sugar.  I've cut out all sugar and high-fructose corn syrup in an effort to get in control of my diabetes, and to get me back on track so I won't have to go to insulin replacement.  It means giving up ALL sugar.  I am happy to report I was able to do this-- but it means reading labels, reading labels, reading labels, because sugar and any of it's names for sugar AND even fake sugar is no longer on my game plan, yet is in everything.  I do not like the taste of stevia, even after trying it for a month to get used to it.  However, I can DO SlimSweet!  It does not have a bitter taste, and I've used it in gluten-free products also to create a 'whole grain' dessert cake, which is what I really miss on my new quest for great diabetes readings.  It makes my morning cup of coffee pretty good... So, I would recommend this product for those who want to get off sugar and sugar replacements that are not good for you... Being made of a fruit grown, and having a low-glycemic number makes it a "PLUS" for me.
