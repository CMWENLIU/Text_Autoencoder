I LOVE Evamor water. It is the only Alkaline water I've had which doesn't have a chemical taste. I drink at least one 32 oz bottle of Evamor each day. I've found it has played a significant role in balancing my PH levels. I wish Amazon would offer this product on Subscribe & Save. If they do, I'll be the first person to sign up!
