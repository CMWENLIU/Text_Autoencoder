I've been using the SoyaJoy Automatic Soymilk Maker about once a week for almost a year now.  A deal at $99, the soymilk maker has paid for itself over and over again.  It's so easy to use; my favorite recipe is my own: Pineapple Soymilk.  All you have to do is soak soy beans overnight.  Thaw half a can of frozen pineapple juice; add the juice to the SoyaJoy along with filtered or bottled water.  Add a tablespoon of oat flakes to the soy bean filter, then add the soy beans; attach the filter to the unit, plug it in, and about fifteen minutes later, your soymilk will be done.  Let it sit for about half an hour to cool; chill overnight in the refrigerator, and enjoy.  Using a whole can of frozen<br />pineapple juice overwhelms the taste of the soy beans and additional sweeteners are not needed.<br /><br />I also prepare soy milk this way: soak overnight soy beans, a few raw almonds and raw Virginia peanuts along with about half a teaspoon of Basmati rice; next day, prepare Soymilk as usual.  I add the Okara (the residue that is left after the liquid is drained off when making soybean milk) to homemade soups as well as when I cook rice (I use a crock pot in both cases); the Okara adds something special to each meal.<br /><br />"The SoyaJoy Concentrated Magic Cleaning Powder" is very easy to use, and aids in keeping the soy bean filter clean; in fact, I used the powder, as directed, only a few times, then one day I realized that I didn't need to use the powder anymore, and a simple cleaning was possible using water, the brush that comes with the SoyaJoy, and a sponge.<br /><br />If you plan on using the SoyaJoy often, you can pre-soak the soy beans; they keep up to a week in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator.<br /><br />I've been on the "Blood Type" diet for a decade; Dr. Peter J. D'Adamo says of his diet that soy-based foods are "super foods" for a Blood Type A.  Every time I walk by the soymilk section at the grocery store, I see an expensive way to buy that food; the SoyaJoy Automatic Soymilk Maker is the most economical and easiest way for a Blood Type A to enjoy "super food"!
