Being a diabetic, and being a long-time lover of Oreos, I've searched the shelves and tried many brands of cookies looking for a replacement! None ever came CLOSE! Now there's a sugar-free Oreo that tastes JUST like the Oreos I grew-up with! I'm in heaven! Sometimes I break them up and put them in my sugar-free Jello pudding, or my sugar-free ice cream!
