This is fine with just water if you want to put something over it. However, if you want an easy, tasty, healthy side, try tossing around with a little butter and garlic then cook with veggie or chicken broth.<br /><br />And remember - rinse, rinse, rinse beforehand and stir a few times while cooking.<br /><br />This has a lot of nutrients, so worth a try and some experimentation.
