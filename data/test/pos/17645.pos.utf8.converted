I've been trying different Espresso from Amazon since they have a large selection to choose from. This is brand number five, Alessi is by far the best! It's a rich tasting Espresso, not bitter but creamy with a hint of cocoa. Best Espresso on Amazon! I found this Espresso months ago while shopping to refill my stockpile, but it was not available at the time. So I added it to my wish list in hopes it would be back in stock soon. Looks like no one has discovered this Espresso! yet. I sure it won't take long for my secret to get out .............Espresso!!! Espresso!!! Espresso!!!
