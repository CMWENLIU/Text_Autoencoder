I am trying this coconut oil as a dietary supplement. By itself, 1 Tbsp tastes very rich and coco-nutty. Too rich for me so, I decided to put it in a cup of coffee. It was delicious!! I used Columbian coffee (Green Mountain, Fair Trade Select K-Cup), sugar and some hemp milk (Pacific Natural Foods). That is definitely a keeper!! If you don't drink coffee, I'm sure it would work great in a cup of hot cocoa as well.<br /><br />Later, I decided to try it in some oatmeal. I mixed the following into a cup of cooked oatmeal: 1/2 Tsp cinnamon, 2-3 Tsp sugar, 1 Tbsp coconut oil. When the coconut oil melted completely, I added 3-4 Tbsp hemp milk to cool it down. My taste-buds were amazed!! Tomorrow, I will try this with raisins. Mmmmm.<br /><br />We make a lot of fruit shakes at our house and I've had coconut in them before, so I know this will taste great in a shake too. Here's the recipe I'm going with: Banana, Cantaloupe, Orange Juice, Ice, Hemp Milk, Honey (maybe) and Coconut Oil.<br /><br />I still have to find one more meal that I can add this to in order to keep up with the recommended 4 x 1 Tbsp daily dosage, but I'm sure it will be no problem to find something else that this goes well with.
