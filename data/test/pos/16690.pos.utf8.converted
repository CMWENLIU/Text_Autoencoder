This product is everything you would expect, and then some. The shipping was fast. The Matcha is sent in a resealable, heavy-duty FOILED plastic bag, EXCELLENT quality. I recommend using a small tin for everyday use, taking no more than an ounce or two from the larger bag, to preserve the flavor and freshness.<br /><br />The taste is WONDERFUL. Very fresh, very green, very subtle, yet intense.<br />I purchased this product after Starbucks raised their prices (again!), because I had become a frozen green tea frappucino addict...Now I am just a Matcha addict.<br /><br />I love it in the evening warm, in a large mug with a good splash of milk, and simply adore it from the blender with milk, ice cubes, some vanilla syrup and a splash of whipping cream for the frothy, creamy taste...<br /><br />I use 2 level teaspoons, not packed, to a 20 oz. mug, so figure 1 teaspoon per "regular" coffee cup.<br /><br />The illustrative picture is what your matcha will look like. None of the other vendors show the color/quality of their product...For something like this, being able to see what you will get is half the issue. I can tell you that the flavor, which is the other half, is also the quality you would expect and wish for.
