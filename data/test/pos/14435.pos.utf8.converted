I adopted Layla as an older cat (~7yrs), and she had chronic diarrhea and was underweight, but also a finicky eater. My vet prescribed special IBS canned food, which Layla hated with a passion, so in an effort to coax her to eat, I would let her eat cheap gravy food (the only food she kind of liked) along with shredded chicken I would cook. This was either hit or miss with her, and I frequently ended up wasting food because she either flat-out refused to eat it or wouldn't eat all of it. Even with frequent vet visits and medicine, Layla proceeded to get sicker with her IBS, and out of desperation, I ordered the Paw Lickin' Chicken along with some other flavors. Layla absolutely adores it!!!! It looks and smells like human food, and is clearly high quality (it looks exactly like the picture). The other cheaper food would sometimes make me gag at its consistency and the poor quality of the meat, but Weruva is wonderful! It is high in water content, so I know Layla is staying hydrated, and it's also so easy to wash out of the bowl, unlike gravy food or pate. The other thing I've noticed is that Layla doesn't need as much food to stay satiated. She eats about three 3.0 ounce cans a day, and has no problem with grazing on them throughout the day, which she wouldn't do with the other food.<br /><br />Economically speaking, yes, Weruva is a more expensive food ounce for ounce, but the money I save on waste actually makes Weruva cheaper for me. Plus, when you compare the price to the quality of the food you receive, Weruva is a far better purchase than the more popular high-end cat food (which cost the same). However, the most important point is that I now have a very happy cat without IBS symptoms, who is finally gaining weight, and this is priceless to me =).
