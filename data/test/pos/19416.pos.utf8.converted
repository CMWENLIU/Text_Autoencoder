Being Gluten intolerant, eating in a restaurant is a challenge.  Recently I visited a restaurant that specializes in pasta dishes and was amazed to see that they offered a gf option.  I took a chance (gf pasta can be really pasty and gummy even if cooked properly) and ordered the shrimp scampi.  I was blown away by the firm, aldente texture and fabulous taste of the pasta and asked the waiter if the cook would share the brand of pasta he prepared. In short order the waiter appeared with a package of the Heartland pasta.  I can't say enough about this great product.  I have since purchased several packages of the spaghetti, fusuli, and penne pasta and can finally enjoy italian food again!  Even my very picky boyfriend who detects even the slightest off-taste that gf products can have likes this product.  If there was a higher score than "5", I would give it!!
