This cereal is all-natural, with no preservatives or transfats. And it tastes good! The protein comes mostly from soy. The main grains are corn and rice flour. I wish that it had brown rice flour instead, though. Here's the ingredient list:<br /><br />soy Protein Isolate, Yellow Corn Flour, Rice Flour, Tapioca Starch, Inulin, Pea Fiber, Natural Honey, Evaporated Cane Juice, Dehydrated Apple Pieces, Canola Oil, Cinnamon Powder, Vanilla Extract, Natural Flavoring, Baking Powder, Double-Acting Leavening Agents, Salt.<br /><br />I appreciate the fact that it is low in sugar. There's no high-fructose corn syrup, either. Here's the nutritional information:<br /><br />Serving Size  1 oz (Approx. 1/2 Cup)<br />Calories  100<br />Carbs  15g<br />Fat  1.5g<br />Fiber  3g<br />Sugar  3g<br />Protein  9g<br />Weight Watchers Points  1<br /><br />This is a very good cereal at a very good price, especially with the 20% off special. I think that you will enjoy Kay's Apple Cinnamon Protein Cereal. Especially if you are a cereal lover like I am. And even if your name isn't "Kay" like mine is!<br /><br />Recommend.
