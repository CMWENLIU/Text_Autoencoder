Henry Weinhard's Root Beer is quite easily my favorite, I must admit. There is a creaminess to it, a body, that makes it a real pleasure to drink. However, there is a trade-off.<br /><br />If you're looking for a root beer with a biting, unapologetically brash character, you best look elsewhere. This rootbeer has subtle notes of vanilla mingled with it's sassafras, hinting at it's sweeter cousin, the Weinhard's cream soda. In my opinion it's mildness makes it extremely drinkable. For this reason I personally prefer to use other root beers that are thinner and less complex for root beer floats and enjoy this by itself.<br /><br />Before TSA rules prevented me from packing liquids in my carry-on baggage I would always bring a six-pack back with me from West coast sojourns. It was always worth it.
