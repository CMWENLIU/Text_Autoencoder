I usually just don't buy canned/boxed veggie soups. I find most just plain suck. But this one is quite nice. Granted, it's a convenience soup, so it's not gonna shine like homemade, but it's quite convenient, yes, and flavorful and serviceable. Even my veggie-not-so-friendly hubby will eat this and enjoy it. This is great for those soup and sandwich lazy lunches, when I can split the box with hubby.<br /><br />It's got a nice texture, not too brothy or too thick. It's got a nice mouth feel. Not too acidic, as some veggie soups can be, overusing tomato. This is a great addition to a low-calorie/weight watching diet. The whole box is only 150 cals. There's lentils and brown rice in there, too, so you get some protein. (And it adds to the nice texture).<br /><br />Low calorie, with fiber and vegan-friendly, pleasant flavor. It's a good deal and in these economically-challenged times, great to take to work (if you keep a bowl there), as the package opens easily with just your hands. :)<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />UPDATE, 11-26-10: A commenter asked about the sodium.
