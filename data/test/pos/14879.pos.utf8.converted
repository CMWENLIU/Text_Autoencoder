I enjoy a heaping spoon (included) of this every day in a mango-banana smoothie. It's everything I expected--fresh-tasting, nicely packaged (looks good enough to leave out on the counter), and reasonably-priced for the twin-pack at $41 from Amazon, or $37 (missed this when I was searching) from Pier Mall. I don't know how it compares with the other matchas here, but I'm more than satisfied. Enjoy!
