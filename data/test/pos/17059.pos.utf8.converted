A few reviewers commented in a black & white, all or nothing, manner on the evils of agave nectar. The sources and way agave nectar are processed vary from brand to brand. Some are from blue agave, some are from other types of agave plants. Some are created by high tech chemical processing and some are processed minimally at low temperature. The Wholesome Sweetners Organic Blue Agave is (as the title indicates) made from blue agave and not other "wild" types that are cheaper (btw, I'm a regular Amazon consumer and have no connection with this company). "Raw" is a term from the raw foods movement which indicates that this product is produced by very low heat to encourage evaporation, converting the soluble fiber inulin into sugar, and not the high heat that is destroying all the enzymes and creating something chemically different. The more processed "light agave" does have a higher fructose content, but is that a bad thing?<br /><br />The "evils" of fructose is baffling to me. Fructose is what you get from fruit, green peppers, onions, carrots, etc. Fructose is not bad for you. However, the amount that is contained in an orange pales with the massive dose in the "Big Gulp" drink you get at your local convenience market. This reminds me of the bad rap for fats that the government propagandized about for years in their now proven useless nutrition pyramid that we were indoctrinated at school with when we were kids. Fats, too, are essential for your health, but overconsumption of anything (and the wrong kinds, and in the wrong combination with other foods) can be bad for you. In one "scientific" study people were fed large doses of "agave nectar" (I put that in quotes because it turns out that some of these cheap nectars - hey, studies cost money, so get the cheap stuff! - were adulterated with high fructose corn syrup and with maple syrup). Maple syrup is very yummy, but the presence of a non-agave nectar product in the thing you are supposed to be testing is what we call in the scientific world a "confounding variable" (read: invalid study). Additionally, I use a teaspoon of agave nectar and don't drink the bottle like it's a can of Coke. The equating of agave nectar with high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is total hornswoggle. Yes, both have fructose, but as we shall see, so does pretty much most other foods we eat.<br /><br />The most common dietary sugars are glucose, fructose, and galactose. These are six carbon mono-saccharides and are the building blocks of most other biologically important sugars, ones that have been used by humans since recorded history. Glucose is also known as dextrose because it is a member of a broader classification of sugars known as dextrins. Dextrins are named because they bend polarized light to the right (dextrorotatory is the term chemists use to describe this physical property). Fructose is also known as laevulose because it bends polarized light to the left (levorotatory is a term chemists use to refer this physical property).<br /><br />By the way, where is sucrose (common table sugar) in this mix? Sucrose is simply the combination of two of the above sugars: glucose and a fructose. The point here is that you're starting to see that this so-called bad fructose is in almost all forms of sweets. Not only in sweets like candy and chocolate bars, but also in virtually every fruit such as apples, pears, berries, melons, bananas, etc. Further, fructose is also found in high amounts in apple cider vinegar, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, every carrot you've ever eaten, broccoli, cucumbers, even squash.<br /><br />Every whole grain has fructose. Please note that this fructose isn't placed in these vegetables and fruits by us evil manufacturers that run laboratories; this fructose is just naturally in these foods. "Well, it's not that all fructose is bad... it's the amounts in each food that matter." Fair enough. Let's briefly look at the amount of fructose in a 200 calorie serving of a few food items. Listed from most fructose to least:<br /><br />Food item  /  mg of fructose  /  Serving size<br /><br />standard US soda beverage / 29,760 mg / in a 200 calorie serving<br />Applesauce, canned & sugared / 28,634 mg / in a 200 calorie serving<br />Honey, US, supposedly awesome / 26,930 mg / in a 200 calorie serving<br />Agave syrup, Mexico, supposedly evil / 26,896 mg / in a 200 calorie serving<br />Apple, raw / 25,125 mg / in a 200 calorie serving<br />Dates, raw, dried / 23,074 mg / in a 200 calorie serving<br />Vinegar, balsamic / 16,773 mg / in a 200 calorie serving<br />Strawberries, raw / 15,247 mg / in a 200 calorie serving<br /><br />This information above comes from the USDA's National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference. You can go there and get this info on any food you want. What does this mean? Unless you're living on 100% meat, fructose is a part of the human food chain. It always has been, and will continue to be a part of your diet. Demonizing it is illogical. Some proponents are against agave because they have their own agenda (e.g. one critic is hawking his own healthy honey on his website, which as you can see has slightly more fructose than agave nectar, so what's his illogical point about agave and fructose?). Plus, I don't eat a 200 calorie serving of agave nectar. I use a squirt in my coffee. I'm getting less fructose than what's in an average apple. Let's demonize apples now because they're worse than agave nectar!<br /><br />Fructose has received much negative attention due to the fact that fructose can be converted into fat in the liver. The process of converting fructose into fat is related to the way the fructose is absorbed -- unlike other dietary sugars, fructose is not actively transported into the bloodstream by transport proteins. Instead, fructose -- be it from the banana you ate this morning, the squash soup you had last night, the Coconut Bliss that's in your freezer, or the delicious honey you just dripped into you tea -- is passively absorbed into portal circulation from the GI tract. Portal circulation sends dietary fructose to the liver for further processing. It sends *all* fructose this way.<br /><br />But here's where the anti-agave writers get it wrong. First, there are plenty of things we eat that get processed mainly by the liver; lipids and proteins are just two examples. Secondly, like those fats and proteins, the outcome of fructose in the liver isn't fixed. It can have a number of different fates:<br /><br />1) it can be consumed as fuel (during times of great energy demand),<br />2) it can be converted to glucose and released as blood sugar (during times of energy demand and low blood sugar),<br />3) it can be converted to glucose and converted into glycogen for storage (under well fed state following energy depleted state),<br />4) it can be used as a reducing source for production of NADPH for reductive synthesis (biological molecules are built by reductive synthesis). Or, god forbid,<br />5) it can be converted into fat in the form of triglycerides (overfed state where fructose is not necessary for any other functions and blood triglycerides are low).<br /><br />To simply state that fructose is converted to fat is a gross oversimplification of biochemistry. It's a salesman's pitch. The conversion of fructose to fats as free fatty acids in the liver and ultimately release of fats from the liver as triglycerides requires a specific dietary condition. In biochemistry, it is called "the well-fed state" (that's the actual scientific phrase). In layman terms for you and I, we call this the "you're eating too much, pal, so stop blaming specific food components for your problem" state. This well-fed state of extreme elevation of blood triglycerides is seen in populations that consume very high amounts of saturated fats, and carbohydrates, with simple sugars as the major component of total carbohydrate.<br /><br />Agave contains a fructooligiosaccharide (FOS) known as inulin. Inulin has been shown to have numerous positive impacts on human health due to the propensity for it to increase the population of beneficial bacteria such as acidophilus and bifidus in the human gastro-intestinal tract. One of the many positive benefits these bacteria provide is the reduction in triglyceride production in the liver.<br /><br />Fructose has been suggested to be a possible safe alternative for type II diabetics because fructose has a low glycemic index, and has even been shown to reduce hemoglobin A1c (a marker of long term loss of glycemic control). Small quantities of fructose have been shown to even have a blunting effect on the glycemic response of high glycemic starches (Heacock, Hertzer and Wolf J. Nutr. 132: 2601-2604, 2002).<br /><br />The debate over the relationship between dietary carbohydrate and serum lipid levels is not a new one. Several studies conducted in the 1960's and 1970's showed a relation between a high sugar (50%) and increased triglyceride levels. Two bestseller books took this idea and ran with it. The books were "Sugar Blues" and "Sweet and Dangerous". The studies cited by the authors were short in duration (2-6 weeks), this may have led the authors to assume a false conclusion. This prompted more studies. In later studies that were longer in duration (3-6 months) it was noted that triglyceride levels normalized. This is not to say that a 50% sugar diet is safe or sane. Far from it. However, it does show that making quick conclusions from a small number of studies can lead to false perceptions.<br /><br />The purpose of pointing all this out is to encourage a rational examination of the safety of common sweeteners. You only need to look at healthy old people (or my own, or your own experience with agave) to see that sweeteners used in moderation are fine for human health. Sweeteners can be included in many diets with no adverse health effects, assuming the diet is rich in complex carbohydrates, quality fats (especially essential fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids) and quality lean protein.<br /><br />If you are consuming massive amounts of simple sugars, with saturated fats, low fiber, and poor quality proteins, then the least of your problems is the agave syrup. Instead, the pharmaceutical industry and your local emergency room are ready and waiting. Agave is not HFCS. Apples, bananas, and figs, although high in fructose, are also not HFCS.<br /><br />Debra Lynn Dadd, a consumer advocate who writes for the New York Times covers this topic as well at[...]. Interestingly, she and her husband did their own mini-test where they tried various brands of agave syrup and tested the rise in blood sugar with their own blood glucose meter. This brand above brought the least blood sugar rise of any brands they tested (obviously, this is a limited test and we all vary). In reality, as far as blood sugar results, who cares what some lab does with a bunch of other people with unique body chemistries? Get a small bottle of this (and a couple others), get out your blood glucose meter and do your own test. Your own test with your own body is the only one that counts anyway. Any other lab tests are just general indicators. "Your mileage may vary" as the saying goes.<br /><br />Yes, there is a difference between brands. Some have been adulterated with high fructose syrup and one study (one of the negative ones) found the dark "agave syrup" was actually adulterated with maple syrup (which, while yummy, is sort of getting away from the reason why you're buying agave nectar in the first place). Caveat emptor is always a wise policy.<br /><br />You can go to the manufacturer of this product for more information as to nutrition, where it comes from, what it contains, and how it's produced [...]. This is Mexican blue agave and not something else which other brands may use. Raw agave nectar is heated gently (usually around 118 degrees) and converts the inulin in the agave to the sweet product we are looking for. By this manufacturers description their light agave is heated to 165 degrees and converts the inulin to fructose, so it does have a higer fructose content that the raw does not. Thus, in my humble opinion, I think I'm going to stick with the raw (which I like the taste in my coffee and adds some tasty caramel notes).
