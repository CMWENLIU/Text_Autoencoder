In today's market most chocolate flavored products are primarily sugar with a dusting of low quality cocoa.  I have tried Peringotti because it was touted as having a wonderful fruity taste. And it does! But I prefer to have my fruit and cocoa separate. Valrhona is the darkest and richest pure cocoa flavor that I have come across. It mixes extremely well in drinks and for baking. More importantly, pure cocoa allows one to control the level of sweetness and the calorie content.<br />This is the only brand I will use.
