I begin my day with one cup of smooth move tea-- everyday.  If I forget I make sure that I take it before I go to bed at night. It taste good. My teenaged grandsons like it.<br /><br />It depends on how blocked you are which will determine how it works.  You may have to have two cups before it begins to work. However, make sure you do not have any place to go when you are trying it out for the first time.  Believe me it will work. Some people it takes time others it works right away. I use it once a day and it keeps me regular. It dosn't run because I know how to use it. I have been doing this for some time--for four years. I steep it for one minute if I kept it in for more than 1-5 minutes I would not be able to go out because it would run. My friend steeps it for 1/2 a minute that way she is able to go out. Give it five days before you give up on it. So good luck to you all.
