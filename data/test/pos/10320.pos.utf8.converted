This is tasty and healthy. Nothing GMO, no corn syrup, and organic. I bought a case with subscribe and save. Very happy I did. I use this for the family and they enjoy it. None of them can tell the difference between this and  Heinz. I have been a ketchup love all my life eating it on anything and everything. I am very picky about ketchup. This organic brand, I love. I like it even better than Annie's organic. It also makes a great base for homemade BBQ sauce.
