After reading the other reviews, I was sure that I was going to love this protein powder but, initially, that was not the case. The flavor is very earthy and tastes "healthy", if healthy has a taste. I eased my way into using it by first sprinkling it onto my yogurt...it lends itself very well to cinnamon, so pile it on. I quickly went from, "yuck" to "ick" to "ok" to "not bad" to "pretty good" to "I LOVE IT!". So, yes, it is an acquired taste but the more you use it the more you will find that you love it too.<br /><br />My favorite snack:<br />1/2c Almond Milk<br />1/2c Frozen Blueberries (still frozen)<br />3 Drops of Liquid Stevia<br />1-2TB Hemp Protein Powder<br />Tons of cinnamon.<br /><br />Stir & Enjoy!
