I ordered several Stevita products and this was one of them. I had read many reviews where people described stevia products as having a bitter or weird after taste.<br /><br />So when I got this product I added a litte bit at a time and tasted it as I went... I made a normal sized Kool-Aid or juice type decanter and added a full teaspoon (not heaping) of the powder. It has a very nice subtle sweet and fruity flavor. You could add more for a much more pronounced sweetness and flavor but I think thats what happens when people complain of a bitter after-taste... they add too much.<br /><br />The Stevita drink mixes were not meant to have the bold flavors and sweetness of say.. Kool-Aid or grape juice.<br /><br />These products are wonderful for those who are avoiding sugar, diabetics (check with your doctor first), low-carbing, artificial sweeteners and are tired of drinking water, water, water all the time ;)<br /><br />When you receive the container you will be surprised about the size... it is smaller than it looks online but remember a little goes a LONG WAY!
