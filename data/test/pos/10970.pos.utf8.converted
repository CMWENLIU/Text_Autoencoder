I've recently gotten into health drinks (Emergen-C and ZipFizz, etc...). This stuff is a little expensive but I got it with the 15% discount. Without a doubt I had more energy while working out the first time I tried it - I burned 100 more calories than I usually do on the treadmill and afterwards felt like I had never gone running in the first place. I've used it a few more times since then and this stuff is great. I'm no health expert but I have already recommended this stuff to several siblings and friends. Everyone I've told about it (gave them a free pack) liked it a lot and got their own.<br /><br />Try it out for yourself. I take it 30 mins before I workout.
