This is excellent French roast coffee.  It's not over roasted/burnt tasting & the flavor is complex.  The beans are oily, black & I found no quakers (underdeveloped coffee beans that make coffee taste awful - they stick out because they do not roast/darken properly).  That's a good test of coffee beans:  empty the bag on a cookie sheet & see how many quakers you find.  A few is "acceptable" but more than 10 is pretty bad in my opinion.<br /><br />I have also tried Cameron's Organic French Roast.  It is equally good but perhaps a little less intense.  For those who don't care for Starbucks French Roast - (I personally find it over roasted/burnt but ok) you may want to give this coffee a try.  If you prefer light roasted coffee or supermarket brands, both of these French roasts may not be your cup of coffee.<br /><br />I use the "pour-over" method to brew coffee every day because at this time, there is only one non-commercial drip coffeemaker that gets water to the ideal brewing temperature of 192F to 204 F.  I use cold, filtered water, a Melitta natural brown filter, manual drip coffee filter & brew directly into my stainless carafe.  I heat the water to boiling, pour a few tablespoons over the grounds to saturate & plump up the beans, wait a couple minutes & then flood the grounds with the rest of the water.  There is a lot of crema, the beautiful reddish brown foam that develops on top of the beans, & it smells & tastes wonderful.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CFLIL">Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 6, 40-Count Filters (Pack of 12)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EN8DMU">Copco 2 Quart Thermal Capacity Brushed Stainless Steel Carafe</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUDDTY">RSVP Manual Drip Coffee Filter Cone for Carafes or Thermos</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012S1V2A">Oster 5965 Stainless-Steel 1-1/2-Liter Electric Water Kettle</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043095WW">Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder, Black</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ESSASK">Cameron's Organic French Roast Whole Bean Coffee, 32-Ounce Bag</a>
