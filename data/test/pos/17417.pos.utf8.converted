I live here in New Zealand, down here in the south pacific. One day, our neighbours who are from Texas, bought over a dish they'd made with Colgins Liquid Smoke. BLEW ME AWAY- absolutely fantastic!!<br />So I got on line and bought a bottle- which I had until one day our son "borrowed" it and we haven't seen it since...<br />I'd like to buy some more but.. the cost of getting three $3 bottles here comes to about $60.. so I won't. When they get that right, you'll have a ready market down here. Irrespective, I can't recommend it highly enough. Really makes a BBQ a BBQ!!
