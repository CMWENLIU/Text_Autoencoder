I bought the assorted pack of fizzies as an alternative to the constant water I've been drinking since being diagnosed with diabetes. I think they taste great. They are made with sorbitol and splenda so there is no aftertaste and it doesn't make your blood sugar go up. My favorite flavors are orange, lemon-lime, cherry, and sour apple. They also offer root beer and fruit punch but I think the fruit punch tasted more like bubblegum. I didn't get sick drinking it unlike another person's review. I think it would be a great alternative to diet soda which I can't stand.
