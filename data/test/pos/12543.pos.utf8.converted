I began using this green tea shortly after the New Year when I was going to do a 3 day Detox that I had seen on The Today Show, which included drinking green tea 3 times each day. I chose this brand solely on the reviews since I was previously not a tea drinker and had no idea where to start. I was a little nervous about receiving 6 boxes of it the first time around, but am now actually getting ready to order another 6 boxes! On and off (more on than off) I have problems with constipation and it has been particularly worse since my entire pregnancy and birth in August 2010. I was increasing water, exercising, eating foods with fiber, even taking Colace and was still miserable. I tell you what, I have not had one problem with constipation since I started drinking this tea in January. Smooth as silk, for lack of a better description. It tells you on the box that it aids in immune and digestive function and so far it's claims are accurate. I haven't even been ill this winter (knock on wood). It tastes good, it smells great.... I have had many compliments on the smell of my drink while at work or others will come around and ask what smells so good. I even keep an extra few packets in my scrub jacket to share when people compliment it. I work nights, so the caffeine helps keep me energized. A neat addition to this product are the little sayings on each bag tag similar to the papers in a fortune cookie. Although I have not used any other green tea brands, I have to say that this is a great choice that I will continue to use for the simple fact that it keeps me regular and that, my friend, makes me happy :)  5 stars!
