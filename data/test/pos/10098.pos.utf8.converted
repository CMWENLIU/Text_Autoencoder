i buy these bulk on Amazon and store them in my drawer at work. We get free water bottles so I always flavor them with this. Tastes good but I always split one package of powder into two bottles of water, .5L each. The flavor is much more enjoyable half-dilluted like this.<br /><br />I occasionally get sensitive to the caffine and get stomach issues, but they never last long and are not bad at all. Definitely not a show stopper.<br /><br />This helps me drink more water AND wake up in the morning. I love it, will keep buying!!
