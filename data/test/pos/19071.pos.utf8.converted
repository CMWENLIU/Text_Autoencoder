That's right, two cylinders with two different seasonings.  One is white, and filled with salt.  One is black, and filled with pepper.  Combine the two, and you've got salt and pepper.  Salt can be used to make food salty.  It can also be used to make water salty too.  Some people use salt water as a mouth rinse, and I've got to say, this salt is really salty.  The pepper is finely ground and spicy.  Used as an inhalant, it creates a burning sensation in the nostrils, often causing the user to sneeze.  It works on cats too.
