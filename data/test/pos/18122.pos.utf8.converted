This is dense tuna. I love it straight out of the can over salad greens, with a little olive oil, lemon juice, and capers. It is super high in omega-3s and just delicious. I have been eating this for years, and Amazon has a great deal on it. I am a student in a masters program (Physician Assistant) and always have cans of this in my locker for lunch in case I forget something. It has come in handy! It satisfies my hunger for hours because of all the protein and fat.<br /><br />The taste is really strong, but that is what I like. Regarding the metallic taste, I have only tasted a metallic taste once and that was the unsalted variety. I have probably eaten 200 cans of this over the years and have only tasted that once. So I don't think it's a common problem.<br /><br />I think this tuna is for someone who doesn't really want to have to add a bunch of stuff to it to make it palatable/taste good. It's a bit pricy, but well worth it for the convenience and nutritional value.<br /><br />One thing to be cautious of is that if you want to put a lot of stuff in it, this might be a bit too salty for that. I find this pretty salty, but you'd have to judge yourself. I buy both the unsalted and the salted. If I'm making a tuna salad or tuna melts, I use the unsalted and add in salt to taste. Otherwise, I find it's too salty. Straight out of the can, though, the salted is the best way to go.  :)
