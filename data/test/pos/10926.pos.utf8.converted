This tea is a great way to get the antioxidents of both red (rooibos) and honeybush teas in one cup. I have enjoyed all the editions, and prefer full organic ingredients so this is the one for me. This is a good spicy blend that completely masks the earthiness of rooibos.<br /><br />As to the change in flavor, the Good Earth website FAQs say: ... the Sweet and Spicy Red Tea blend was changed from using an artificial spice extract to using an all natural spice extract. This change did make the blend less bold. If you ...[want] the original blend before the change, ... try the Original Sweet and Spicy - Caffeine Free ... that is NOT All-Natural.
