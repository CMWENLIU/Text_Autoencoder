The jury is still out about the efficacy of curcumin (found in turmeric) as a treatment for cancer or Alzheimer's. Not enough testing has been done yet. But it has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for about 4000 years, and there seems to be less cases of cancer and Alzheimer's in South Asia where it is consumed. So, who knows? I like the color it gives the food, and I don't even notice any change in taste to the foods I put it on. I try to sneak it into just about everything from roasted vegetables to fish/shrimp and to rice.
