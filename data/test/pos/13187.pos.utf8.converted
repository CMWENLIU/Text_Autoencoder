These are very, very good. I love these for a snack and they take care of a sweet craving too. Not too awful sugary sweet, just sweet and tart enough! I tried a handful in my oatmeal with some vanilla creamer this mornining for a treat and it was so good with those sweet, tart cherries. They are great to snack on and add to muffins and in baking. A great buy in bulk, compared to what I find in our local supermarkets which are very pricey! These are nice sized and fresh too! They would be great in trail mix. My husband likes them as a snack in his lunch too! Thumbs up!!!
