Unlike most hot sauces Matouk's West Indian has a papaya base.  (Oddly enough it does not taste at all like papaya.) This makes the sauce much less acidic, and less vinegary.  However, the sauce still packs a punch of hotness.  This sauce is excellent on quiche, scrambled eggs, baked chicken, rice, fish, pork, hamburgers, or steak.  I also use it in chili; it gives the chili a nice heat and flavor without adding the acidic hot pepper taste.  We have been using this sauce in our house for over three decades and would be hard pressed to replace it with another.  If you are looking for a hot sauce that is hot, unique and has multiple uses Matouk's will do the trick.
