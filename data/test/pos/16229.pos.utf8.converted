If you are looking for a change of pace from regular tomato based sauce, you will be pleasantly surprised. I purchased this at Costco, I am not sure of any other stores that sell this. It is amazing. Very fresh tasting. A little, but not too, sweet. I cannot recommend it highly enough, especially for a gluten free offering.
