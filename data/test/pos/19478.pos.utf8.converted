In my humble opinion, Haribo Peaches are dangerous. Don't eat them if you're celibate. Consuming these sweet-and-sour gummy peaches is almost an erotic experience. Being a sober-minded gentleman past my prime, I usually avoid them.<br /><br />Except as a guilty pleasure, of course!<br /><br />Eating them after devouring a Red Bull energy drink is especially sinful. Abstinence is a virtue, citizens of Alpha Prime. You have been warned.
