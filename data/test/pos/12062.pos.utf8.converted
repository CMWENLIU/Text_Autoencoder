I used to use litter crystals and then switched to clay when I could get a 40-lb box at BJ's for just $8.99.  I used the clay litter with those sifting liners and all was well.<br /><br />Well, as my little guy is now over 10 years old, he's gotten funny in his ways.  He seems to like to get in his box and toss litter all over the place before . . . uh . . . handling his business.  That was making my bathroom a mess.  I'd have to sweep and mop before putting down my bath mat to take a bath and it was just too much so this week I switched back to crystals.  Yippee!<br /><br />The low tracking is what does it for me.  For the few crystals that get out of the box, it's no issue to clean up quickly.  No fine dust to contend with.  The solid litter is a breeze to remove and I stir about twice a day, usually when I'm already in the bathroom and notice he's gone.  I mean, you can't even tell I have a cat in the house.  Zero odor, little tracking and easy to clean.  The only thing I do is use a liner with it so that whatever liquid does get through doesn't seep into the plastic over time and stink it up.  The simple fact that this litter is lighter overall is just wonderful.  Less mess and less dust make it a winner.<br /><br />I would LOVE if I could buy this product in a 40-lb box so I could keep it on hand instead of buying small bags.  But I can't say yet if it will last a full month.  I bought a 4-lb bag and I imagine it will last a couple weeks at best.  However, I'm setting a reminder in Outlook and in 3 weeks I'll give you the honest results.
