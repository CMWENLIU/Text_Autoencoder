I am not some kind of caviar snob but I have had the very expensive down to lumpfish from the local grocery store.  I was so surprised at the extremely fresh taste and mild flavor.  It even had the "pop" of the expensive brands. What was so wonderful with this type is I could just get a little spoonful whenever I wanted instead of waiting for a special occasion.
