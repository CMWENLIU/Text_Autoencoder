This is good stuff!  Has a great taste and leaves very few, if any, unpopped kernels.<br /><br />The large opening of the container makes it easy to scoop out just the right amount.<br /><br />What a huge difference between this and microwave popcorn.<br />I would definitely recommend Snappy Popcorn!
