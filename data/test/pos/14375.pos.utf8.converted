I ordered this product to give it a try. I added about 8 teaspoons of the supplement to 4 cups of goat's milk on the stove top, heated to around 105 degrees. (It mixed well around 95 degrees- for a cold drink, I might tend to mix a small amount of liquid with the mix into a paste and then add the rest of the liquid- you know how difficult cocoa is to mix sometimes.)<br /><br />Poured the hot beverage into cups for my 3 boys, and they said "it is great! How often can we have this as a treat?"<br /><br />Now, we love Stevita flavored supplements for our cold milk- some favorites are Toffee, Vanilla, and Chocolate. My oldest makes concoctions with all 3 flavors in his cold milk drinks. I just purchased the Mango, and it is super in my hot tea.
