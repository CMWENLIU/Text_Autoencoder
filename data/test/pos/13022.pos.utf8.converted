If you are looking for a great churro maker for your kitchen, this is it.  If you have tried making them with a pastry bag, you know that sometimes the dough can be to thick for the bag to handle.  This churro maker is well constructed and made with a sturdy plastic (almost like PVC tubing).  Rather than squeezing like you would do with a pastry bag, you turn the handle like a screw.  This provides equal and constant pressure to the dough as it exits to the frying pan giving you better control on the size and shape of the churro.  This churro maker is easy to clean - it can be taken apart and all the pieces are dishwasher-safe.
