I love organic coconut oil and feel it is a must in our diet. I just couldn't stomach the $16 price tag from Whole Foods anymore for the exact same product. I received it today, it has the exact same exp date on the package (I know that is an issue with some items on Amazon, products being too close to the exp date and maybe that is why you got it at a bargain price).<br />Came well packaged with the seal intact, no problems. I will buy it again from this seller. And with Amazon Prime, it makes it a super bargain!<br />Also, if you are doing your research on the many amazing properties coconut oil possesses, you know that it is anti-bacterial. I discovered almost 3 yrs ago that I was allergic to antiperspirant/deo. My armpits would itch and I would scratch them almost raw. When I stopped using anti/deo, the itch stopped. Looking around online, this happens to many people. What to do? Well, I went to Whole Foods and bought plenty of natural deos that did not work AT ALL! Good for me they take back anything, including used deo. I researched and found a recipe for coconut oil deo. It has cornstarch, baking soda, and coconut oil. I followed a recipe, (google coconut oil deodorant recipe) formed it into an old deo container, and what do you know? It works like a charm! NO ODOR! It does not stop sweat, but guess what folks? You are supposed to sweat under your armpits, it is your body's way of detoxifying itself. Sweat smells when the bacteria from the skin and the perspiration meet in a dark, warm place- the armpit. The EVCO inhibits the production of bacteria. You have a serious amount of lymph nodes there that need the freedom to move toxins out of your body. And we wonder why women get breast cancer more and more these days. When I have important social events or meeting I use a regular antiperspirant, but 90% of the time I use this. Keep in fridge in warmer climates, it melts at 76 degrees F.<br /><br />Coconut oil is truly amazing stuff, give it a try. Can't hurt.
