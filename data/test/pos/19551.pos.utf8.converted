These are really yummy, and I have a major sweet tooth problem! These are snacks I can go to when a piece of fruit just won't cut it, but they totally satisfy that craving for a sweet or dessert. I am not sure why you would criticize them for being sweet, i mean the title is Cinnamon Danish after all? Of course its sweet, I think that is the point. If you just want a cereal bar Healthy valley has plain old fruit filled cereal bars too, I think of this as a healthy alternative to candy bars or reaching for cookies during my day. Highly recommend them for those trying to live a healthy life, but just need some sweets too!
