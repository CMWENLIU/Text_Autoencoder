I have never written a review on Amazon before, though I swear half my paycheck is devoted to them.  After trying Hi=Tek, I had to write a review.  I have a Golden with a known grain allergy and a Bernese with a recently discovered grain allergy.  I had been feeding my Golden, Nature's Balance.  He's a Golden...he eats anything.  The Bernese would have nothing to do with NB.  After the reading the reviews on Hi-Tek, I thought I would give it a try.  Both dogs love this food! They race to their food bowls and eat every nugget.  I would highly recommend.
