I've been using this for pecan pie and other baked goods for about fifteen years, because I just can't tolerate the cloying, mouth-drying sweetness of corn syrup.  It's been very hard to find in recent years, though, so I'm delighted to find it here.  It has a really clean, subtly caramel flavor, and an incomparably rich texture.  It substitutes for anything you would use genetically-engineered corn syrup for, and you'll be much happier with the results!
