While reading through one of those lists advising me of what I should be eating in order to get all of the vitamins, minerals, bioflavinoids, and existential approval necessary for perfect health, I found that I should be eating dried cherries.  On a regular basis.  As in daily.  So I went off to the store in search of dried cherries.  It turns out that not only are dried cherries really good for you.  They are also really expensive.  Or dry as sawdust with about as much taste.<br /><br />Oskri produces and packages some wonderful dried cranberries and I wondered if they did the same for cherries.  It turns out that Oskri's dried cherries are just as wonderful as the dried cranberries.  Like the cranberries, these are the whole fruit and not bits and pieces.  The cherries have been pitted and doused with a touch of apple juice for a bit of extra sweetener and then dried.  The end result is a dried cherry that retains the perfect amount of moisture and a deep rich flavor.<br /><br />I've been mixing my own "trail mix" (it should probably be called "office mix") using Brazil nut, pecans, almonds, hazelnuts, and these dried cherries.  Fabulous, healthy with just enough existential approval.
