I disklike coffee very much and found myself trying to find the perfect tea.<br /><br />This is it.<br /><br />It's strong enough to wake you up in the mornings and keep you up all night long to finish exams.<br /><br />It has a full body taste and wonderful aroma.<br /><br />It's best with a little sugar or honey and just a touch of milk. But I prefer just sugar normally.<br /><br />If you like strong tea - this is the best. Let it seep from the bag for a few minutes it get it's full power.<br /><br />Once you have this you will never go back to Lipton or ugh... Nestea...
