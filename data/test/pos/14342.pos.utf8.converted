We got a beauceron puppy when she was 12 weeks.  She was on Iams at her first home.  Her coat was kind of dull, but we transitioned her to Blue large breed puppy as soon as she moved in.  Her coat was shiny within a week or two.  She likes the food, although the feeding guidelines have been a little low for her activity level so I feed her about a half a cup more.  She has a bit of a sensitive stomach with treats, but she has been fine on this brand of food and treats.  She is now just shy of 8 months and I'm still loving this food.
