At the advice of my doctor, I've been taking unflavored gelatin daily for many years to strengthen spinal disks.  Various local sources of capsules, packets, and added-value gelatin in containers were an unnecessary expense of packaging and unwanted vitamins.  Fortunately  Knox unflavored gelatin in 1 lb. cans is available online.  I keep  a plastic teaspoon measuring spoon in the can to add gelatin to morning juice (drink before it thickens too much)or coffee (stir quickly so it won't clump up). In addition to strengthening spinal disks, my "paper" fingernails have hardened.  In addition, the gelatin is on hand for cooking purposes.  Ordering a year's worth at a time stretched shipping cost, also.<br /><br />Older woman
