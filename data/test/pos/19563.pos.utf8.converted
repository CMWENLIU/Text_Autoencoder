My cat is EXTREMELY picky... Late last year, I decided to switch both her canned food and kibble. I spent tons of money on "samples" of canned foods for her and I ended up wasting so much money. She didn't like anything I put in front of her. I was online one night and happened to stumble upon Weruva. I did my research and not only was I blown away at how awesome the quality of the food is but also the story behind the company. All of the meats are cruelty free as well which is a big plus for myself and my husband! Amazon has the best price anywhere and I love the free shipping! :-) I have also been feeding her Orijen kibble. Considering the quality of both of these products, you can't beat the price!
