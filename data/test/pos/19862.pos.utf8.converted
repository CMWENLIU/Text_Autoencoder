Somen is meant to eat cold. You use 1/2 cold water, 1/2 memmi sauce with wasabi, grated ginger and scallions, and you dip the somen in it. It's like cold soba noodles. This is the best type of somen you can purchase in bulk. You just boil water, put the somen in for about 3 to 4 mins and rinse with cold water, serve over ice. Don't get these if you don't know how to cook them or you may not like it. This isn't a replacement for angel hair pasta. Obviously you'll have to remove the paper ring around the noodles...that's just common sense and not worth a 4 star rating (from the other reviewer).
