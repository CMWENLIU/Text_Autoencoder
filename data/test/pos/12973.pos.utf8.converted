My husband purchased this sauce the first time while on a business trip in Orlando Florida this past spring. We reside in North Carolina and have been unable to locate it here where we live (Charlotte/Gastonia area) Was glad to be able to find it here at Amazon. It is a hot sauce indeed but unique and good on anything, especially mexican food.
