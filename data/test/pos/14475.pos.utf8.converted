I was a little nervous about buying so much yeast without ever trying this brand. It is the best yeast I have ever used!!! My favorite part is the seperate packages, I just empty one into a jar and use it that way. The rest is in my bulk supplies staying fresh and ready to be used. I will surely be buying more when mine is gone.
