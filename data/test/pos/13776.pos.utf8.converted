As I get older I have noticed that my mental process is a bit slower than when I was younger. I have tried various energy drinks and dietary supplements to see if I can recover my mental acuity.<br /><br />The problem for me is caffiene is not good for me. Unlike most folks it actually disrupts my mental process rather than improving it. I get more confused, not less. It makes me very jittery and disrupts my sleep patterns. It is like some kind of amphetamine. So, I tried the decaf 5-hour ENERGY and it gives me a great boost from the B vitamins etc. I like the benefits I get without the caffeine. I feel better, short term memory is improved and none of the side effects I suffer with other caffeine laden supplements.<br /><br />I like this stuff and will keep using it.
