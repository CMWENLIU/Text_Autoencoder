We've been using these for years, and always have two cases in each car. We've used them for taking medicine, mixing formula, washing hands, and drinking (of course.) When they get near their expiration date, we freeze them and use them as cold packs. A frozen Aqua Blox will keep a lunch cold for hours, and they're sterile, so they can be used for cleansing wounds in an emergency. Rodents recently gnawed through several cases of water bottles in our garage, but not the Aqua Blox! You can also recycle the aseptic packaging in some places, and the empty boxes flatten easily. With a five year shelf life, the price difference between them and bottled water is no issue, and they don't get brittle and leak like some types of plastic. Great for travel and home.
