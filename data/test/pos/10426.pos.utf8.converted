I don't know how many people have had "Astronaut Ice Cream" but it is sooo good.  Seriously, it is something you have to try.  I've had it since I was a little girl because I grew up in TX where NASA was close by.  It is really convenient to feed to kids in particular because there is no mess to clean up afterwards.  The best thing about the ice cream is that it really packs more flavor than you would expect and when it melts in your mouth you'll be glad you tried it.
