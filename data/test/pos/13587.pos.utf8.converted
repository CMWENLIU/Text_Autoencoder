I must say, I was hesitant to order a "tub" of demi glace base, but I just don't have the time or inclination to make my own these days.<br /><br />I received the product a few days ago, ordered 2 tubs of Demi-Glace Gold and a tub of their Chicken Demi (I know, but I figured why not?)<br /><br />Opened up the Demi-Glace Gold, and could immediately tell this wasn't just some "base".  The aroma is rich, not over powering, and has a very dense gelatinous texture.<br /><br />I made a roasted chicken that evening and decided to do a quick Cabernet and Port wine reduction, just simple to check out the new product.<br /><br />Made the Demi per the instructions (1T to 4T water, heat for 5 mins), then added it to the wine reduction (another 4T of reduced liquid or so), then added another 4T of chicken stock (just good Chicken stock, not the Chicken DemiGlace I mentioned earlier), let this simmer while whisking over a med-low heat for about 3-4 minutes while it all pulled together.<br /><br />A tiny dash of Kosher salt, and time to serve.<br /><br />The end result was absolutely amazing, and the DemiGlace Gold performed every bit as good as a homemade DemiGlace.  The sauce had that wonderful shine to it, that extra richness that you can't get without a Demi, the right texture, it was bright and complex.  Every bit as good as a sauce made with homemade demi.<br /><br />This product is the real deal, or as close as it's going to get.  It is an amazing time saver, and for the price it's worth every penny.<br /><br />If you are like me and hesitated, wondered if it would be worth the money, wondering if it tasted "fake" or was otherwise a waste of money, do yourself a favor and get this product.<br /><br />(Note to those not familiar with Demi Glace, this is not a "base" per se, and while I guess you could use it as one, I recommend using it to create sauces, experiment a bit, and you'll find that soon, using demi glace, you'll be creating sauces that are every bit as good as anything you'll find in an expensive restaurant.  It's a great way to experience what that "special something" in gourmet sauces is, without having to make your own demi, and without having to invest a few days to make it yourself)
