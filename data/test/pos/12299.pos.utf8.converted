I'm a coffee holic. It's rather strong candy - if you're looking for sweet sugary candy with a bit of coffee flavor, look elsewhere! Real compressed coffee with a bit of sweetness, I like it for mornings when you're too late to grab a cup or for road trips when you need the pick-me-up but need to keep your hands on the wheel. Very reasonable price!
