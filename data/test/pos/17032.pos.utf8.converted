I'd say this is one of the best gluten free pizza crust mixes out there!  It's simple to make & is not too heavy.  I like to add some italian seasoning to the dry part of the mix before I combine the wet & dry ingredients for some extra flavor.  Even the pizza eaters not on a gluten-free diet like this pizza crust. All in all a good one!  And a decent price too!
