Both my mom & sister are gluten intolerant, so I have used many gluten free products to make cakes or other recipes for family get togethers. This is the best cake mix by far....This cake mix is just as good as wheat-based mixes. I modify it to make various kinds of cakes: coconut cake, red velvet cake, etc. It always gets rave reviews, even from those used to eating wheat-based cakes. (My mom & sister can tolerate vanilla pudding, so I add one third to half a box of instant vanilla pudding - regular, not sugar free - per bag of cake mix to make it extra moist.) I also use The Gluten Free Pantry's chocolate truffle brownie mix; it is better to me than any wheat based brownie mix.
