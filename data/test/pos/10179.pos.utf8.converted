Absolutely no preservatives, pesticides or chemicals, this is the way tea has been made for centuries. The smell is sweet and floral, the taste is divine!<br /><br />May also be used as an exfoliating scrub on the body and face, eliminates blackheads and great for oily skin. (Not reccomended with any other teas due to the additives.)
