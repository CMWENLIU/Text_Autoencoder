I don't know whether she has a hereditary predisposition to a delicate digestive constitution or whether it was my daughters' Polly Pocket doll clothes, which she has twice ingested and for which she was twice treated by a veterinarian, but my eight-year old house cat vomits when she eats any cat food that contains cereal fillers. What a pain in the rear end! Front end, actually. As my cat's gastrointestinal challenges worsened, it took me a while to identify the source of the problem and then a while longer, through trial-and-error, to find a food she could eat and keep down. Finally, I found it: Taste of the Wild Dry Cat Food.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure the key is the omission of cereal/corn fillers in the recipe, but I believe there probably is another reason, too. (I'd tell if I knew.) I'd tried other foods with no fillers before, but still had the same problem, although not quite as pronounced. Maybe it's the venison and/or the salmon, which could be more easily digested by cats than other proteins. I don't know. Whatever the reason, I buy only Taste of the Wild for my cat. We adopted another cat from the local shelter near the end of last year, a one-year old, and switched him from Iams (which the shelter uses) to Taste of the Wild. All good; almost six months later, he's flourishing.<br /><br />No, I'm not an employee, vendor, distributor, or any other person or entity related directly or indirectly to the manufacturer. The stuff is just really good.
