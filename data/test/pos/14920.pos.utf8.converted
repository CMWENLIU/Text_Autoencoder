In addition, the seller of this product is in no way responsible for any treatment decisions made regarding the use of the honey.  I am simply relaying my own experiences.<br /><br />Manuka Honey is not only great on toast, it has many medical uses.  In September of 2008, I contracted what turned out to be an autoimmune disorder called pyoderma gangrenosum, which acts as a "flesh eating disease" and it destroyed all the flesh on the front and sides of my right leg below the knee.  Recovery has been long and hard, and as of August of 2009, nearly a year later, is not complete.  In February, after months of wound healing, I had reached a plateau where there were a number of open areas and the scar tissue was still very raw and oozing.  It had been that way for a long time.<br /><br />A friend suggested I try manuka honey.  My doctor and I began researching the product, and after finding many medical journal articles on the subject, and becoming acquainted with Dr Peter Molan of New Zealand's Waikato University, the primary researcher into manuka honey's medicinal uses, we decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Within weeks the stubborn open areas had closed up and the scar was looking much better.  Not only that, but the "pipe veins" which had formed, large varicose veins which protruded and were very fragile, had begun to recede.  It was amazing.<br /><br />I am now using less honey, because of the progression of healing, and though I have a ways to go before I can walk normally again, there is no doubt that the manuka honey has played a large part in my healing.<br /><br />Please note that this honey is being sold as a dietary supplement and food product, and any medicinal uses should be discussed at length with your doctors.<br /><br />A photographic journal of my experience with pyoderma gangrenosum can be found as a right menu link off of [...] -- please note that the photos are somewhat graphic in nature.
