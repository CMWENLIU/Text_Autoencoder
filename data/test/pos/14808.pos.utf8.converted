Xyloburst Peppermint Gum, 100 count<br />Made in USA with materials from China (Non GMO)<br /><br />Ingredients: Xylitol, Gum Base, Natural Flavors (peppermint oil), Vegetable Glycerin, Gum Arabic, Soy Lecithin, Beeswax<br /><br />This was my first time trying xylitol gum and it was pretty good.  Very intense at first and then fades, but not too quickly.  The flavor does last awhile considering it's a more natural gum.  I was debating between this and Spry gum, but a lot of reviewers said that Spry faded quickly.  Glad I chose this instead.  The pieces look big in the container (each is 1.5grams), but they chew down small so you might want to chew 2 at a time.  Amazon also has a 500 count container, which is a better value if you can afford paying it at once.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015NE02K">Xyloburst Peppermint Xylitol Chewing Gum 500 Count</a>  This also comes in blister packs (total of 144 pieces) and sometimes it's cheaper than the 100 count container <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019AC50I">Xyloburst Peppermint Blister Pack 12 12 Pc Packages</a>.  I used to chew Orbit Peppermint gum, but I think I'll get this from now on.  Less chemicals and tastes better.
