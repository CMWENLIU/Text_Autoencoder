Absolutely love this cake mix as we have family members with allergies one to milk protein, and the other to wheat, corn, soy, peanuts and sesame and they can both eat this cake! Just wanted to mention that you can follow the mix or experiment with it too! We made a version of this cake  with carrots and raisins and used a shredded coconut based icing on the cake and it was wonderful. You can also make this cake and poke fork holes throughout the top of the cake. Then while the cake is still warm pour a mixture of 1 can coconut milk mixed with 2 cups sugar evenly over the top of the cake. Then let your cake sit overnight and it will crystallize and you have a very rich dessert.  Another thing we have tried was baking the cake mix until almost done and then mixing the cake up with a jar of cherry jam ,that had whole cherries in it, and a tablespoon of virgin coconut oil to make a rich cherry cobbler. We took the cobbler to a church covered dish and it was a hit!
