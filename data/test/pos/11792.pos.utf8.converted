I have been drinking this coffee for over 20 years and was so upset when Maxwell House stopped making it.  Thank goodness Maxwell House has reproduced the original recipe but, most stores are not carrying this product in Maine. (Target does carry it.)  I have made a personal commitment to remedy this problem by meeting with local grocery store managers and requesting they bring the Orange Cafe' back to the people who have delighted in this flavor for so many years.  Orange Cafe' is truly the best flavor of all the international coffee made by Maxwell House.
