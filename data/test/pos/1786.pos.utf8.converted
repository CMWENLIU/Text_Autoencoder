This box weighs in at 60 oz & contains the normal size Tootsie Pop..not those small ones.<br />I decided to count the quantity of each flavor:<br /> 32 Grape<br /> 17 Raspberry<br /> 16 Chocolate<br /> 16 Cherry<br /> 14 Green Apple<br />  8 Orange<br /><br />103 Total Tootsie Pops<br /><br />I'm not a fan of apple flavored candy, but the Green Apple flavor isn't too bad.  These Tootsie Pops are for my hubby anyway; he takes them along for long car trips. I couldn't count them without having at least one.  yum...I love Tootsie Pops<br /><br />Tootsie Pops have a Tootsie Roll center (a chewy, chocolate candy that doesn't melt) surrounded by a hard candy sucker/lollipop.<br /><br />One Tootsie Pop has 60 calories, 10 grams of sugar, 15g total carbohydrate & 2% of the daily iron requirement; no fat, cholesterol, fiber or sodium.<br /><br />~~UPDATE: We just received our 2nd order of Tootsie Pops. For anyone who's interested, I did another count.<br /> 34 Cherry<br /> 19 Grape<br /> 18 Chocolate<br /> 16 Raspberry<br /> 10 Orange<br />  7 Green Apple<br /><br />104 Total Tootsie Pops<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I told myself I wasn't going to count these again.  Well, our third shipment arrived today & instead of rec'g the Variety Pack (which doesn't really mention 'variety pack' on the box, but instead says Assorted) we rec'd the Fun Flavor Assortment. So I did a count:<br /><br />52 Cherry; 13 Chocolate; 12 Strawberry; 10 Lemon Lime; 9 Blue Raspberry; 8 Watermelon =  104 Tootsie Pops<br /><br />These 3 shipments each came from different suppliers.  Two were fulfilled by Amazon.
