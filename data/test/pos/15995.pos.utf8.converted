Clearly, no one would accuse Simply Fiber Cereal of being the best tasting cereal in the world.  After all, it contains no sugar or other unhealthy ingredients to make it taste "good."  However, mixed with a little fruit (I like raspberries or blueberries) and a handful of almonds, it is actually very good.  And, for what it may lack in the flavor department, it more than makes up for in terms of promoting good health.<br /><br />I lost 35 lbs. eating this cereal as the "cornerstone" first meal of the day (with a handful of almonds and fruit mixed in along with a cup of skim milk).  I feel full and energized until well into the afternoon each day.  It is incredibly high in fiber (14 grams per serving), which promotes longevity and good health in countless ways.  I buy it by the case.  Great Stuff!
