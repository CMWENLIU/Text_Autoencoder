I was introduced to Kava or AWA drink in Maui.  The first cup is like drinking liquid earth, but I developed a taste for it.  It really works to help relax aching muscles.  I can make my own AWA, but it is time consuming.  I tried this tea and with the carob and cinnamon it is delicious.  I love it.  I buy it from Amazon in the larger quantity because it is cheaper, even with shipping, than buying in a health food or grocery store if they even have it.
