These oils may come in a small bottle; however, they go a long way!  I first started to purchase the Garlic Oil from Costo about a year ago.  I was very disappointed to find that my local warehouse had discontinued the product, leaving me with only a few drops in my bottle.  I was thrilled to find this on Amazon and have since ordered several times.  This set makes a perfect gift or stocking stuffer for the holidays.  The 3 pack deal makes it an even better offer. After giving 6 sets this holiday season I have heard nothing but wonderful reviews.<br /><br />One of my favorite ways to use the garlic oil is for garlic bread. Take a loaf of Italian bread and slice about 1" thick.  Brush both side with the oil and sprinkle with a small amount of sea salt.  I cook the bread on the grill right before taking steaks off - about 2 minutes per side.<br /><br />All of the other oils are just a great and work very well in marinades and stir-fries.  You can really use them for just about anything - including dipping oils.  I will be back to purchase these time and time again.
