I bought these to keep in my candy bowl at work for diabetic colleagues. Normally, I prefer the "real deal", but after trying one of these I think I found a new addition to my favorite sweets. If you read my review on Pillsbury Surgar-Free Bownie Mix, you will see that I'm not always so open-minded to foods that use subsitutes (in case you're wondering, I gave those a 4 star rating). I highly recommend these, even if you are not diabetic.
