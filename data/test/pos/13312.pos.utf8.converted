Vegan. Organic. Kosher parve. Fat Free. High protein. Very nice. Barley gives a nice additional flavor note. Can heat and serve as a bean soup or 'dal' right from the can. Great as a bean soup base, add your favorite veggies. Also can be used for fantastic casseroles or on top of your favorite noodles. Made with organic great northern beans, organic red beans, organic barley, organic lentils, and sea salt. 350 calories, 0g fat, and 21g protein per can. Labeled "vegetarian," but is vegan also.
