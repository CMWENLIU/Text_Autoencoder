The bulk section of the organic food cooperative I purchase from began stocking this rice.  We tried it this week and I just love it.  When cooked, the white interior bursts out of the pink a bit, creating a pink, white and slightly brownish/red side dish for your plate.  I found the flavor to be mild and pleasant.  I also enjoy Lotus Foods' Bhutanese Red but prefer this milder, less pungent rice for the hot days of summer.  The leftover cold rice made a wonderful salad when tossed with some greens and sliced strawberries.  Another bonus was that it cooked up very nicely in 20 minutes with slightly dry, fluffy grains.
