I love the truly unique flavor of Pickapeppa.  Its relatively mild, perhaps 5/10, but it more than makes up for it with outstanding flavor.  The unique flavor comes from the mangoes, but the combination of other spices is exquisite.<br /><br />It's similar to A1 in thickness but VASTLY tastier.<br /><br />I'm a fan and I buy this by the gallon thru Pickapeppa's website.<br /><br />As for their other sauces, give 'em a pass.  All are too sweet for my taste, particularly their "hot" sauce.
