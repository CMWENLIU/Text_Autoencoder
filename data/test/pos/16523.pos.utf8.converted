Been buying roasted beans from this company for several years so have a great deal of trust in the quality. The Nicaraguan SHG beans roast up beautifully with normal chaffing. The flavors are subtle so don't expect to be bowled over by the boldness. It's great either by itself as a well-balanced cup or mixed with a bolder bean for a totally different taste. I like mixing with a Rwanda or Sumatra bean or just experimenting with multiple combos. Can't go wrong with this one!
