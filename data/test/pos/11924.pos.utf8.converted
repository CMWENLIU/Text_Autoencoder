Have you ever gone to an Olive Garden chain restaurant and been given a rectangular chocolate mint with your bill?  These are those mints!  At first, I though OG was handing out Andes Creme de Menthe mints, and I bought the Creme de Menthe at the grocery store only to be disappointed by a sharper mint taste (peppermint even, maybe?).  Ew.  Note to self:  You can't find Andes Mint Parfait candies at the grocery store.  They are online only, it seems.<br /><br />To describe the Andes candies in Mint Parfait flavor, they're a smoother, creamier taste of mint chocolate.  The texture is also smooth and creamy, go figure!  Very very good.  When my brother turned 30, I lined the rim of the chocolate birthday cake with the Andes Mint Parfaits as a decoration, because he loves these!  It was a hit.
