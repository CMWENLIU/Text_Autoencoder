The Venturi is just what we hoped it would be.  All the young wines at restaurants today make it difficult.  We've used it on a newer red, 2007 Brunello, and an older, 1998 Shiraz, just to see the difference.  The Shiraz was already ready to drink but the Venturi opened it quickly.  The 2007 was amazing - it was far too young and yet the Venturi did the trick.  It still isn't a 1998 vintage but the difference was truly amazing.  You can take the Venturi anywhere in its cloth case.  Get the tower as well but use a decanter underneath instead of a wine glass.  With a glass (even a taller one) there is some spill from the height.  The tower does have a "catch" for the spill but the decanter takes away most of that.
