We have an 18 year old cat with serious digestion problems including regular vomiting and diarrhea to the point where she was dehydrated and very underweight.  We were running out of things to try untill I heard of Wysong Geriatrx and decided to try it.  All I can say is, this food has quite literally saved her life.
