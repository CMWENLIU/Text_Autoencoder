I LOVE THIS LIGHT ROAST COFFEE. IT IS VERY FLAVORFUL AND DOES NOT LEAVE A BITTER AFTERTASTE. I USE 1 KCUP AT 8 OZ. WATER WITH A SECOND K CUP AT 6 OZ. FOR A LARGE MUG IN THE MORNING. BY AFTERNOON I JUST USE 1 K CUP AT 8 OZ OF WATER FOR MY AFTERNOON COFFEE BREAK. IT IS SO HARD TO FIND LIGHT ROAST COFFEE. THE MEDIUM AND DARK ROAST COFFEES LEAVE A BITTER AFTERTASTE.
