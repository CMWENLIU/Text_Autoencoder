Green Mountain Organic Sumatran Extra Bold K-cups for Keurig Brewers is a rich bold coffee that is not bitter.  I love not wasting coffee by brewing one cup at a time, however, I do wish that the K-cups were a little more environmentally friendly.  I hope that they can start making the pods from something that is more biodegradable in the future.
