The Eight O'Clock line of coffees has always represented extraordinary value. I had occasion to prepare a coffee tasting for a small group of wine-lovers a few years back. The contenders were Eight O'Clock Bokar blend, Illy Cafe's Famiglia blend and two blends from a very famous coffee shop chain that probably has a store within three blocks of your house.<br />I asked the tasters to use wine descriptors to judge the coffees and then to  make a judgment of overall satisfaction. Of the 22 in the group,21 picked either the Illy or the Eight O'Clock in first place and all 22 picked one of them for second.<br />This blend is one that we use at home for the afternoon or early evening cup when we don't want to be over-caffeinated. The flavor is truly balanced, slightly fruity with a hint of toasty chocolate. It's a medium-bodied blend, but you can concentrate it by using less water without harming the flavor.<br />I strongly recommend using a plunger type french press coffee maker like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LM0R">Bodum Chambord 3-Cup Coffee Press</a> or the unbreakable<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YY9X">Bodum Columbia 8-Cup Stainless-Steel Thermal Press Pot</a>.<br /><br />Lynn Hoffman, author of The New Short Course in Wine and the extremely well balanced bang BANG: A Novel
