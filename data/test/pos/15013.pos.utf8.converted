2 things happened to me from drinking this tea.  One, I got cramps the night of drinking.  Two, I pooped my brains out the next morning.  That's why I bought it, so I give it 5 stars.  It tastes so-so, but if I want taste I'll buy other teas.  If you need to go, this stuff works.  Beware, mild cramping, bloating is probably going to happen.
