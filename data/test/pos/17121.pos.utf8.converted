First discovered these in Rome, where they were put out every morning at the Duke Hotel in a dish at the front desk. These are exactly the same product, complete with liquid (and delicious) center. They may seem a trifle expensive, but these are truly the monarch of hard candies and worth every cent. I will continue ordering Rossanas to set out at my house and in my office.
