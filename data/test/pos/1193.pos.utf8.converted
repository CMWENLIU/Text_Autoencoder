My secret weapon to perform hard work with a great attitude.  Guanine (a caffeine analog) gives a long lasting stimulant boost while theobromine provides the attitude adujstment of chocolate.  A wonderful delight that got me to quit coffee which is jittery, short-acting and just pale in comparison.<br /><br />Guanine is oil-based so it's hard to dissolve in water but that allows for slow-release in your body.  Be brave, depending on your body size use a teaspoon to a tablespoon.  If you can consume a tablespoon of coffee you can certainly consume a tbsp of this.<br /><br />Instead of trying to dissolve into liquid put it in Yogurt or Apple Sauce.  Makes a great low calorie breakfast that stays with you and reduces hunger.<br /><br />Truly an amazing product that leaves a six-hour silly grin on my face with motivation to clean the garage !
