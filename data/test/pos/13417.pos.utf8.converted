This is a wonderful product.  We have tried several other brands.  The health benefits are amazing.  We use it for a substitute for shortening in baked goods(pie crust, cookies, etc.) We also prefer it now for frying eggs, potatoes, pancakes, everything, as it is much more stable at higher temps. --A word of caution, if you don't like coconut taste, it will take some getting used to.  My oldest daughter(17) falls into this catagory. She is now accepting it more and more.  The other 4 kids have had no trouble making the switch.  It is interesting that we now eat more healthier fats and fats in total, yet have lost weight.  My husband and I have each lost between 10 and 15 lbs. using this product, along with making other healthy changes in our diet.  Enjoy!
