I did some research on natural ways to help arthritis, and I got reviews about cherry juice. So I ordered this juice. It has helped so much. I might sound like a crazy but I have only had it for a week, but was drinking 40oz of water a day with the cherry juice.  I missed a day and about 5pm I was in so much pain. I laughed and told my husband I needed my juice. I did drink the juice but had to take 3 Advils to help...  Well I have not miss a day and don't need Advil everyday anymore...
