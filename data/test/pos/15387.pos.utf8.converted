Hemp protein is outstanding!  Regardless of the great nutritional value of hemp protein, it also tastes very good in oatmeal.  I make a big pot of "steel cut" oatmeal (the quick way is throw a cup of oats in 4 cups of boiling water and just let it sit overnight), put in a good helping of hemp protein, and you have a wonderful delicious and healthy breakfast!  Feel free to add a little cinnamon, peanut butter, fruit (bananas, blueberries, or strawberries are typical choices for me), or your own oatmeal favorite additions.  Also, adding a helping of flaxseed, chia seeds, and/or maca powder to the oatmeal can create a very healthy multi-grain oatmeal that will keep your energy levels high all day. You might even find yourself not needing coffee!
