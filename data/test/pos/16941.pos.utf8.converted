first, i'm not sure what product the people were reviewing with casein in it...their veggie shreds DO have casein (and what's the point in using a cheese substitute if it has animal products in it?), but this is the VEGAN version, which is CASEIN FREE.  (the difference, aside from casein, is the color of the packaging.  veggie products have a green background, while the vegan products, shown here, have a purple background.)<br /><br />that being said, this is a great substitute for parmesan cheese--but it's not identical, so don't purchase it with the expectation that it will taste exactly like the Krafty Cheese Product you're used to sprinkling on your spaghetti.  in my opinion, it tastes much better than that.  :)  i agree with the other reviews that it's a great addition to a vegan pantry, and it adds a great finishing touch to a lot of dishes!
