I'm glad I ordered this without reading the negative reviews, but even if I had at least I have the reading comprehension to understand that the two things most people are complaining about are actually listed IN THE DESCRIPTION. Who buys something online without reading the description first? Honestly...<br /><br />1. Yes it comes in a brown paper/zip lock bag. Whoop de doo. You could still give it as a gift, just get your own cellophane bag and tie it off with ribbons. If you have a lot of friends with keurig machines you'd be able to pick a couple flavors for each friend, and it would be adorable to do a little gift bag with a coffee cup and these.<br /><br />2. Yes some of the coffees were ones I don't like, and yes some of them were repeats, that's what happens when you order a grab bag. It flat out states in the description that you will most likely NOT get 1 pack of each of the flavors, and that the flavors listed are EXAMPLES, you are not guaranteed which ones you will receive.<br /><br />If you can't accept those two "downsides" don't get this product. Instead try Keurig K-Cups Travel The World Sampler Pack (35 K-Cups) Those are supposedly the same every time, and the gift box is supposedly adorable. Twice the price, but hey, if it's what you're looking for...<br /><br />As for myself, all of the cups arrived in fine condition. Yes I did get an overage of a particular flavor(I'm really fortunate that I love hazelnut coffee) but I liked that many of them were multiples. Since I live with my boyfriend this mean that we can each try a cup of the flavors with extras. And if we don't like one we can save it for when company comes, someone we know will probably enjoy the cup.<br /><br />As a service that allows you to try a bunch of flavors without having to buy a box of each this was cheap and pretty effective. I'll be purchasing again, and next time I'll be sure to come on here and put in which flavors I get, I didn't write them down this time, and they're all mixed in with some other samplers now.
