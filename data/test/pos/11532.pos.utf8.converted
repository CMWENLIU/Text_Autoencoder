I have tried many of Kashi's cereals and I have really liked most of them. I think that this may be my favorite. Nice crunchy wheat cereal, lightly sweet, with a nice touch of natural vanilla. YUM!! I also like the nutritional stats...lots of fiber and 6g odf protein. Awesome! This cereal tastes great and fills me up until lunch time. Thanks for another awesome cereal Kashi.
