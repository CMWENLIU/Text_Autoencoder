I love Lapsang Souchong tea, which is hard to find in retail stores. The online choices are Twinning or this Taylors of Harrogate. I won't pretend to make a "connoisseur's" analysis of their relative merits; to me they both taste delicious, even though I do believe this (Taylors of Harrogate) tea to have a more pronounced taste (perhaps -- see below -- because there's more tea per cup???).<br /><br />But let's look at what we're asked to pay... This one is $0.12 per bag while Twinning's is $0.16. Moreover, each Taylors of Harrogate tea bag contains 25% more tea than Twinning's (2.5gr vs 2.00gr), so that an equal-weight Twinning tea bag would have to cost $0.20, or a Twinning-size tea bag of this would only only cost $0.09. So in effect we're asked to pay over twice as much per Twinning tea bag! Now, even if there were a difference between them (and they all come from the very same Chinese makers) and the Twinning were the better-tasting tea (which I dispute), it would still not be twice as good to justify spending the extra cash.<br /><br />Yes, it's a lot of tea to buy at once; but at my rate of consumption it represents about a bit less than eight months' supply, and the shipping is free.<br /><br />Finally, regarding that misguided soul who wrote the single 1-star review complaining about the expiration date... this stuff is bone dry, packed in cellophane. It has no meaningful shelf-life limitation. If I brewed you two cups of this tea, one from a freshly-bought box and another from a box that's 1-3 years past its expiration date, I'm confident that -- in a blind test -- you would not be able to tell the old from the new.
