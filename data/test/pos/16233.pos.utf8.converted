If you haven't tried this product you really should buy a bottle and experience it for yourself.  I think that it is good enough that you won't miss the sugar.<br /><br />Water is so good for us, but so boring.  If you are trying to increase your consumption of water, try a little of this in the water.<br /><br />This product can also be used to make an Italian soda (a little syrup, a little cream, and some sparkling water).  Another yummy treat, if only they made a fat free cream it would be perfect.<br /><br />My husband and I have been buying this brand of sugar free syrup for years.  A pump of this syrup into your coffee changes it from a standard morning beverage into a liquid candy bar in a mug.  I recently switched from half and half to soy milk in my coffee.  With this syrup in my coffee the switch to soy milk was very easy.<br /><br />The ingredients in this product (listed in order) are as follows:<br /><br />Purified water<br /><br />Natural flavors<br /><br />Caramel color<br /><br />Potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate (to preserve freshness)<br /><br />Citric acid<br /><br />Xantham gum<br /><br />Sucralose (splenda brand)<br /><br />Acesulfame potassium<br /><br />Nutrition Facts label reads as follows:<br /><br />Serving Size:  1 oz.<br /><br />Servings per Package:  25.4<br /><br />Calories:  0<br /><br />Calories from fat:  0<br /><br />Total Fat:  0 g<br /><br />Sodium:  15 mg<br /><br />Total Carbohydrate:  0 g<br /><br />Sugars:  0 g<br /><br />Protein:  0g<br /><br />If you find that you like this product I would suggest that you order a pump for the bottle.
