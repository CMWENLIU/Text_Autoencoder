These pumps are very durable.  I've been using the same pump for over a year for my Torani coffee syrups and have no problem with them whatsoever.  The fit is perfect and I never have syrup running down the side of the bottle. The only thing I make sure I do when changing the bottles is rinsing out the pump as sugar crystals can dry around the pump mechanism and cause the pump to get stuck.  Cleaning is easy:  just let the pump soak in clean, warm water (no soap necessary) and then pump water through it a few times to blast away the remaining sugar residue.  Maintaining these pumps this way prolongs the life of the pump.<br /><br />This five-pack is the best deal on Amazon.  Others sold separately cost more by other shippers because of the added shipping costs.  A five-pack now allows me to keep several bottles of different syrup flavors available to chose from while making my morning cappuccino.
