I sought out this product when I realized my toddler was allergic to cow's mlk. As my child is a boy, I was concerned about the effects of non-fermented soy and the plant estrogens that soy milk contains. There was not another acceptable nutritional alternative- hemp and flax contain practically nothing in terms of protein. This actually has 4g protein per serving and 30% DV of calcium. I combined it with coconut milk and it made a doctor-approved whole milk substitute.<br />The flavor is slightly sweet, but the product does not contain additional sugar, another plus. The only con is the cost, and amazon is about the cheapest way to get it.
