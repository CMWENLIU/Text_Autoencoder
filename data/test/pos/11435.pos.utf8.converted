I'm a serious calorie counter but I love my evening ice cream treat. I've been relying of Skinny Cow for years and it's been fine, but I often pined for an alternative that would give me more treat for the calorie. Now I've found my dream. It's almost unbelievable that I can eat a whole pint for less than 150 calories. And this stuff is GOOD tasting.It's not premium, high fat content, high calorie premium ice cream good, but who needs that anyway. The chocolate flavor is really very chocolatey, the consistency is smooth and the satisfaction of not destroying my calorie limit for the day is priceless! Bravo Arctic Zero!
