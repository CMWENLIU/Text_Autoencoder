Maybe I'm getting used to sugar free stuff but this syrup is great.  I needed something to punch up the Mocafe sugar free frappe mix and this syrup did the trick.  The frappe was smoother, blended well with the ice and really improved the chocolate flavor.  I'm glad I bought three bottles - I love it!
