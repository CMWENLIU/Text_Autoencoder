My Australian exchange student introduced these magnificant chocolate bars to me in January, and have loved them ever since!!! I don't know why they aren't sold in the USA, I've looked everywhere and have yet to find them! I bought some recently in Canada, and before that, relied on my Aussie exchange student to send them over. Crunchies are the BEST thing that has ever happened to the chocolate industry!!! The taste is undescribable, they melt in your mouth and are just SUPER SUPER GOOD! TRY ONE!<br /><br />&lt;3
