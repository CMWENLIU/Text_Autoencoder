I have a number of homemade shakes and rubs of my own creation, mostly based on combinations of the spices of a nearby specialty store, but this one is the best commercially made shake I have found.  Veggies, beef, pork, chicken, it works on most everything, and it is salt free.  I literally buy this stuff by the case.
