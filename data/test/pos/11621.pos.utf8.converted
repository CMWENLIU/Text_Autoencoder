I had been struggling to find a way to give my cat with hyperthyroidism her medication twice daily.  I had tried all sorts of other things (american cheese, cream cheese, bread, etc) to wrap her pills in, but she always managed to spit them out.  This product has been a godsend!  Prior to finding this product, my cat had started to become anti-social, probably due to the fact that every time I managed to track her down she was being traumatized by being pinned down and having a pill shoved down her throat... now, if I am not right on time when it comes to giving her a pill, she is the one who lets me know now by meowing and making noise until she gets her pill.<br /><br />One suggestion... if your cat is not accustomed to receiving treats, I would introduce them to treats for about a week or two before introducing these.  My cat was skeptical of treats, because she never got them, so I started giving her Temptations cat treats about two weeks before starting the pill pockets.  It got her used to the idea of receiving treats daily, and after a short amount of time she was gobbling the treats without even chewing.  Made it much easier when I introduced her to the pill pockets - she ended up just gobbling those down too without chewing, so she doesn't even notice there is a pill buried inside.  Without this product, giving my cat her medication would be a daily battle - instead this product has made it a pleasure to give my cat her medication!
