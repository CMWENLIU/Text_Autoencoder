I used to live in Atlanta, Georgia.  The air temperature in Atlanta yesterday was around 100 degrees F.  The temperature of the surface of the sun is around 10,000 degrees F.  We know that the surface of the sun is around 100 times hotter than the air temperature in Atlanta yesterday.<br /><br />Tobasco sauce is around 2,500 Scoville units.  Dave's Ultimate Insanity Sauce registers a blistering 250,000 Scoville units.  From this we can see that Dave's Ultimate Insanity Sauce is about 100 times hotter than Tobasco sauce.<br /><br />Therefore, the difference between the the temperature of the air in Atlanta and the temperature of the surface of the is roughly the same as the difference between the heat of Tobasco sauce and the heat of Dave's Ultimate Insanity sauce.<br /><br />When friends of mine want to try this sauce, I first let them know the above information.  Telling them that the sauce is really hot isn't sufficient.  It's impossible to describe the feeling when this sauce hits your tongue for the first time.  But, if after I tell them the facts and they still want to try it at least I can say they are making an education decision.<br /><br />This sauce is absolutely incredible and this the 4th time I've ordered this sauce.  Also, it's worth video taping someone the first time they try it.
