I purchased Monin's Violet syrup last winter, when I wanted to make classic cocktails and Creme de Violette liqueur was not yet widely available. It made a delicious, if slightly too-sweet Aviation cocktail. Now that Eric Seed (of Haus Alpenz) has gotten real classic liqueurs back into stores, I prefer the more authentic ingredients. That doesn't mean the Monin Violet has lost favor in my kitchen -- when I make a Violette fizz, I often substitute Monin for plain simple syrup for extra violet kick.<br /><br />This syrup makes wonderful soda and lemonade. It really pleased my teetotaler guests.<br /><br />If you're shopping for violet flavoring for baking, candy-making or flavoring ice cream, you should search for extract or concentrate. This product isn't designed for concentrated use. (If you DO get violet extract, you can make your own violet syrup. 1 part sugar, 1 part water. Heat over a low flame until the sugar is just dissolved, and you have simple syrup. Once the simple has cooled, you can add your favorite extract drop by drop until you're satisfied with the flavor.)
