**UPDATE** I had this on a Subscribe & Save order from Amazon. I tried to put through the S&S order early, but Amazon has evidently decided not to carry it any longer, since they have "suspended" my upcoming order because my card on file expires in 6 weeks. To get around that, I cancelled my S&S and tried to re-activate it, but Amazon will not accept the order, saying that it was now only available from something called "Lil-BigShots"(no there's a household word!!), an Amazon 3rd party seller.<br />However, that seller charges what works out to THREE TIMES as much when their exorbitant shipping is added in. Since Amazon is courting the state of Texas as a possible new home, maybe this is just a sleazy ploy to make customers in Amazon's home state glad to see them go.<br />I contacted Amazon support in an effort to fix this situation, but was given to someone who didn't speak English well at all and refused to help. I then called, and spoke to an obvious native English-speaker, who at least attempted to help.<br />Right now, I'm more pissed off at Amazon than I've ever been in 12 years doing business with them!!<br /><br />Item review<br />I always liked Peter Pan PB, but for years it wasn't available in my area. Eventually, 12-oz jars came on the market in my area, but why waste all those plastic jars, so when Amazon started carrying these larger jars, I jumped on it.<br />One thing I like about Peter Pan is that it seems to taste more of Spanish peanuts, which may be why it seems less sweet than Jif or Skippy, and just tastes of peanuts. If I want something sweeter, I have the Peter Pan Honey Roast Peanut Butter, which I'm able to occasionally find locally in 28-oz jars.<br />And by the way, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00295GR3I">Peter Pan Crunchy Peanut Butter, 40-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)</a> is great, too!! I just wish Amazon would sell these in packs of 4: then I could use the Super Saver option without having to find something to add to take the total up to $25.00. Doing a subscription takes the price down more, which is nice.<br />One thing: since these are large jars, a longer knife is needed. I got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DVYEQQ">Mayo Knife - Spreader</a>, which works fine, so I can get that last delicious bit of Peter Pan PB....or mayo, or whatever. The Mayo Knife will be fine until I can find a Spatula/Spreader for a decent price.<br />A couple of words of warning: These three jars are shrink-wrapped together, and as a unit are heavy, so it's not a good idea to order a CD or DVD to fill out the $25 for Free Shipping. The first time that I ordered, I added a CD, and the case was destroyed. Next time, I ordered a DVD & requested that it be wrapped separately or in cardboard. Again, the case was broken, and Amazon's response was "So what?"<br />Amazon ships this item via USPS, but it's a service like UPS or FedEx: no shipping to PO Boxes, so since I don't have mail delivery to my home, I have to put my street address, followed by my PO Box in parentheses. The PO needs a delivery confirmation(so they can't simply put it in a lock box), and when I've queried Amazon about this stupid policy, again their response is "So what??" Nice<br /><br />I've signed up for a subscription with Amazon on this. What a great deal!!
