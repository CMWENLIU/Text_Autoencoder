I have rosacea and many believe that with rosacea comes demodex mites. I'm not sure if this is true for me or not, but I do know that honey is one of the only things that calms the irritation of my face. All raw honey will do this. However, this manuka honey was something else. I not only noticed a very apparent calming result the next day but I also noticed that the oiliness of my nose was greatly improved as well!<br /><br />My guess is that the antibacterial properties of the manuka honey worked against the natural bacteria present alongside demodex mites and gave my skin some reprieve. I cannot do any kind of chemical topicals at all, so I am trying to boost my immune system from the inside to deal with the mites naturally. However, this is great for clarifying my skin and helping my immune system along so it doesn't have to fight as many things at once.<br /><br />One thing to note was that my face generally seems slightly redder after using this compared to normal honey. I'm guessing that this honey is 'stronger' in it's antibacterial properties and might be a bit harsher on the face. But the next day was such an improvement, a little bit of extra redness right after washing it off is not a problem at all.<br /><br />I will say it and say it again: We should be washing our faces with things we can EAT. If not a bunch of manmade harmful chemicals is being absorbed through your skin and your body has to work hard to deal with these toxic substances. Don't force your body to deal with even more than it has to. Go natural. Go with something that your body doesn't mind absorbing.
