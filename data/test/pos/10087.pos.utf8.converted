Mazie, my incredibly persnickety feline companion, is mad about Newman's Own canned cat food. Although I'm living on a necessarily frugal income, I know that buying Newman's Own products for both my cat and dog makes good sense in every way. I recently lost two other beloved pets to old age and disease and believe now that a better diet would have saved them a lot of physical pain and me a great deal of emotional turmoil and sadness. As my own diet becomes more organic and I reap the health benefits, I know Paul Newman and his daughter are on the right track for pets as well. I'll gladly skimp on less important things to know that my four-legged kids are eating right and animals around the world are being saved by the Newmans. It's truly a win-win situation.
