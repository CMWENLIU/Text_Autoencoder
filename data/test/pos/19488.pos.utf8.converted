My wife is cursed with arthritic hands and the those large dehydrated milk  boxes are just too much for her to handle.  Since the quality of dry milk is about the same by every maker, Mix 'n Drink is an excellent product. It is a wonderful alternative packaging with its 3-gallon packets which are easy to open and pour from.  Price increases among like products or other cost differences are not as important as my wife's health and comfort.
