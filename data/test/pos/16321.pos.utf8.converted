Once you've navigated the challenge of removing the wrapper, you're in for a treat.  The dusting of confectioner's sugar or starch to keep the candy from sticking to the wrapper is only moderately successful, but this distraction pales once the candy goes in the mouth.<br /><br />Initially, the candy is moderately chewy, a little firmer than a caramel with a powerful honey flavor.  This really took me back when I checked and there was no honey in the ingredients.  As the candy warms and softens in your mouth, a monstrous ginger flavor rises out of the depths of the sweetness and kicks your sense of smell into submission and rips your eyelids open.  This is a great thing to experience.  At this point, the sweetness is taking the edge off the ginger flavor (barely), but not prevent the tears from coming to your eyes (of joy, I swear it).  And in a few moments it is done.<br /><br />And then, of its own accord, your hand begins to reach for another...<br /><br />A bag of twenty-four might last three days, if I really control myself.
