I am a hard-core aficianado of peanuts.  In the shell at baseball games and fooball games; salted and unsalted; and all varieties and all manufacturers.  I eat peanuts every single night.  I have tried virtually ever popular brand out there, from mundane Planter's to Costco's Virginia, to Aunt Ruby's.  No other type or brand of peanut can begin to compare with these.  They are almost impossibly delicious.<br /><br />I shall order these from Amazon FOREVER.<br /><br />As usual, Amazon rocks!
