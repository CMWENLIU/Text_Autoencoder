They have 3 different sizes of these so I bought one of each size for each of my kids. Obviously the older one get the larger size and my little one got the smaller bank.<br /><br />My middle son has to eat only sugar free gum so I got him a package from these people and my other son and daughter split one of their tubs of the smaller sized gum.<br /><br />Good people to deal with, talked to them on the phone and were very helpful. Yes -- I would recommend them.
