I have avoided products with sugar added for many years. In the interim, I have tried various 'healthy' brands of ketchup...none of which have even come close to the taste of this product. I really haven't used ketchup often, but now look for any excuse to use this brand. It has a light, fresh taste, and is really delicious!<br />Thank you, Organicville!! I am definitely going to check out any other products made by this company.
