Because a kind soul brought her Keurig into work, I got to try Timothy's Columbian decaf.  The coffee doesn't have any of the after taste associated with decaf.  It just tastes like a smooth cup of coffee. After my colleague took her machine home, I craved another cup of that coffee.  So, I bought a Keurig and began searching for the best price I could get on Timothy's Columbian Decaf.  Thank you Amazon for making this 50 pack offer.  The deal is even better if you "subscribe and save."
