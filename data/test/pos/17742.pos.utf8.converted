I first heard about steel cut oats on the Oprah show about its health benefits.  First of all I DO NOT like regular oatmeal like you buy in the grocery store.  I don't like the slimy texture.  But I figured I'd try steel cut oats and I'm glad I did.  They are delicous and very good for you!  The warm nutty aroma when they are cooking is very appetizing.  I add a little bit of sugar or splenda and some cinnimon, it tastes fantastic!  I also sometimes skip the cinnimon and add a tablespoon of granola and/or some dried berries.  Excellent healthy breakfast.<br /><br />Normally these take about 30 minutes to cook on the stovetop.  I found a way to cut the cooking time in half.  Take 1/3 cup of oats, and 1 1/3 cup of water and put it in a large microwavable bowl.  Cook in the microwave on High for 5 minutes, stir, then another 5 minutes, then stir again, and then cook about another 2-3 minutes until the texture is just the way you like it.<br /><br />For those of you who are asking what the difference is between regular oatmeal and steel cut oatmeal:<br /><br />-Steel-Cut Oats are whole grain groats (the inner portion of the oat kernel) which have been cut into two or three pieces using steel discs. Golden in color and resembling mini rice particles, they are as nature intended - nothing added and nothing taken out.<br /><br />-Rolled oats are flake oats that have been steamed, rolled, re-steamed and toasted. Due to all of this additional processing they have lost some of their natural taste, goodness and texture.
