I've tried this and it seems to be both better and cheaper than Bob's Red Mill brand. Buying it like this brings the total price down to around $7.40 per bag..the best deal for people needing to replace the regular flour in their diet. The only thing I can suggest is to carefully store this flour as it can go stale before you use it all. I would suggest a good glass or heavy plastic, sealable container which can go in the fridge. Also you can buy this directly from Honeyville for cheaper.
