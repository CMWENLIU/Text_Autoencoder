This stuff is really good quality. My wife has tachycardia and chicory root made in a coffee pot is really really good for that. Through the years we've bought various different kinds of chicory root and the USDA organic Frontier is really good stuff. While all chicory root helps her condition, not all has the same texture and taste quality. This stuff is good.
