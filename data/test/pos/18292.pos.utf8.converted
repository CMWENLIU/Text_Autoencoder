These bars taste great and are what I call do-able nutrition.  They are not 100% healthy (most products aren't), but they are a healthier alternative than a candy bar for example and have great taste compared to other protein bars.  Even though the amount of protein is not that high, it's still better than no protein.  I use them as a meal replacement or a snack.
