My first and last food review.  If you haven't tried them do.  Simple recipe.  Dried peas, hot Japanese horseradish, salt and sugar.  (How do they put that wasabi on the pea anyway?)  High taste low fat.  Lucky too, because they are addictive.<br /><br />An interesting aside.  Wasabi has antibacterial affects upon the teeth.  Don't have a toothbrush?  Grab a wasabi pea or two.  Just don't breathe on anybody.
