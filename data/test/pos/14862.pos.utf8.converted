this is hands down the best vanilla I have ever tasted!  the flavor is intense too, so you don't really have to use as much - it is well worth the price and will make all your baking that much better!  The grocery store vanillas, even the pure one's, leave a weird aftertaste and have an odd flavor whereas this has a true rich wonderful vanilla aroma and taste because of the cold processing.
