Obviously, Robyn Bell doesn't know anything about seaweed.  Hijiki is a black seaweed and it is supposed to look black and like tiny little nettles.  It's delicious if you make it properly.  I've had this hijiki (even sometimes make my mom make it for me just so I won't have to do it myself--she likes feeling needed) many times and it is especially delicious on a hot summer evening when you really don't feel like cooking--just stick some rice in the cooker, get some of this premade out of the frig, you can add some sliced/diced inari tofu shells and chow down.  After you soak it and rinse it (to remove some of the salt and to rehydrate it), you mix it with the dashi-soy sauce-mirin sauce (so common in Japanese recipes).  You can add edamame to it too to give it some protein.
