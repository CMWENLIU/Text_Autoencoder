I thought I would just google mushroom powder for the heck of it, and came across this.  Now, I have been grinding my own porcini powder for several years, it was very time consuming as well as expensive.  Messy, too.  But I love putting it on potatoes, in soup, on fish, just about everything I could think of.  I love mushrooms.  I had been out of powder for quite a while, and I could not really afford to buy any to grind.<br /><br />I saw this product, and thought it was too good to be true, there had to be a chemical or something in it, or a filler.  But I ordered a couple of containers anyway.  OMG, the stuff is the real deal.  Real porcini..nothing else.  And it is ground finer than the stuff I was making.  And smells fabulous.  It is a HUGE bargain compared to doing it myself.  I don't even have to be stingy with it.  I am overjoyed.  Sometimes I open the lid just to smell it.  It is amazing.  I couldn't be happier.  I will be a grateful customer as long as they carry this product.<br /><br />A few suggestions..in rice a roni, in gravy, in wild rice, in broth, on potatoes, sprinkle on fish with a little bit of garlic powder, seasoned breadcrumbs,and bake, added to cream of mushroom soup  for more flavor, a little in scrambled eggs, the possibilities are endless..
