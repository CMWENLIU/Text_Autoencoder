This lobster bisque is superb. I actually convinced my boyfriend--someone who is not a seafood fan--to partake and become addicted to it. He was actually trying to bargain with me to MAKE MORE!! I will surely stock my freezer again and again with this delicious classic dish. It soothes the throat and is very creamy going down. The flavors are very subtle yet easy to notice. The slight aftertaste will leave you wanting more and more. I'd give it six stars plus, if I could!
