I have tried many bread machine mixes and most have been okay but this one rates an "excellent" because not only is it a very good basic loaf, it also works very well with additives, either prepared entirely in the bread machine, or (after the second rise) removed from the machine, shaped and baked on a stone in the oven.<br />Stretched and flattened with a filling of either savory or sweet ingredients, then rolled and set to rise and then bake in a loaf pan, it produced excellent herb and onion bread, cinnamon raisin bread and a brown butter and seed bread.<br />I buy it via the subscribe-and-save plan as I use it often.
