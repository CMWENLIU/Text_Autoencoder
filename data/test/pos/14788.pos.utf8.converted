i have a Pit Bull, Queensland Heeler and a mutt, they all loved the bone... I let them chew on it for a little while everyday.. sometimes big chunks break off and I usually take those from them (Im paranoid the piece will get stuck and choke them) .. I recommend you supervise your pup when they're chewing on these, just to be safe.. Highly recommended, especially for bigger dogs.
