My aunt used to bring or send me an advent calendar with Kinder chocolates from Germany for Christmas every year when I was a kid.  Now I share Kinder chocolates with my kids while we mark the days on our advent calendar.  It's a tradition I'm passing on and it would not be the same without these incredible chocolates!!  My kids fell in love at first bite just like I did years ago.  Kinder is awesome.  Order early though, since they took a while to arrive (at least around the Christmas holiday).  But they were perfectly packaged and preserved when I received them.
