After battling severe Gastritis from a reaction to NSAIDS, I thought I would never go near a cup of coffee again.  I used Cafix for a while, and did like it as a good substitute, but it just wasn't coffee.  We've been using HealthWise for a few months now, and we really like it.  It's real coffee without the acidity, and easy on the stomach.  It seems to be a bit "drier" than full acid coffee, but it still seems to have a lot of body, and no bitter flavor.  It's also great to be able to return to the ritual of brewing a pot.  Spooning something out of a jar just isn't the same.  If you have issues with coffee acidity, give this a try.  We have not been able to find it in stores, so I order it from Amazon.
