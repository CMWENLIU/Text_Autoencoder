I tried this product after reading research regarding the excellent nutritional value of the product - high level of omega 3, high fibre content, high calcium and iron levels in addition to its impact on glycemic levels and cholesterol. The research was conducted by St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto and was led by a professor of Medicine from the University of Toronto. After trying it out for a month, I have noticed an improvement in my energy level and surprisingly, some inadvertent weight loss. It turns out that since this product absorbs water, it acts as an appetite suppressant as well. I can't say enough about this and highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to boost energy and add nutrients to their diet. I usually add this to cereal, but have also sprinkled this onto blueberry muffin dough before baking. Surprisingly light nutty taste that does not interfere with anything I add it to. I recommend the whole seeds rather than the grain which tends to make liquids thicken up almost immediately.
