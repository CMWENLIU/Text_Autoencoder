I have made one-crust pies with crumb topping, two-crust pies, quiches, and lemon squares with this wonderful, versatile mix.  It works well with my pastry recipes from former wheat-flour-eating days.  The crust is light and fragile, with very little grittiness (less than any other product I have tried thus far.)  Other family members not on a gluten-free diet happily eat items made with this Pie Crust mix and have requested the pies and lemon squares for family gatherings.  One suggestion for those wishing to make a two-crust pie: roll the top crust between two sheets of wax paper, peel off the top layer of wax paper, then carefully invert onto the pie and peel off the other sheet of wax paper so the crust doesn't break apart during handling.  Pieces that do break off will re-attach with your fingers.  Thanks for offering this superior product!
