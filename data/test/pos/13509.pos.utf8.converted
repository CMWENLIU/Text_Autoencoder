My husband and I used to go to Pennsylvania and purchase Bob's Red Mill Buckwheat pancake mix.  My husband ate buckwheat pancakes as a young boy and still loves them.  I was happy to find the mix on Amazon.com and at a cheaper price!!  We made one bag of pancakes (with fresh berries) and enjoyed them.  We will be purchasing more and I will be sending some to family members for the holidays this year.  Made my husband a happy man.
