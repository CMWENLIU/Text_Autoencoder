Unlike other brands, this product is almost tasteless and odorless. It doesn't add after taste to your baked goods. It also rise pretty quickly and make excellent tasty breads and steamed buns. It's much more economical to buy the 1 pound package when you do a lot of baking as compared to the little packets that you get at the supermarket. Apparently, I cannot find the 1 pound package of Fleischmanns yeast at any of my local supermarket or store. Luckily Amazon.com offers this product and I'm very grateful of this.<br /><br />Next time when I run out, I will buy 4 pounds of this product here at Amazon.com and keep the ones that I don't need for immediate use in the freezer. It will keep for at least two years or more in the freezer and a year in the refrigerator.
