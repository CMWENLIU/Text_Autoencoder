So here's the path that we coffee snobs took to Taster's Choice. My husband and I have had two espresso machines. The first was cheap and made great-tasting lattes, much better than Charbucks -- but it only lasted three years. The second was more expensive and, sadly, we never got it to produce anything as good as the first machine. To make matters worse, I had grown tired of cleaning up the mess after each use. I was hopeful when Starbucks introduced VIA, but no matter what strength/flavor I used, it was so harsh (acidic?) that it messed up my stomach. It cost a fortune to boot.<br /><br />Luckily, good fortune was just around the corner. About a year ago, while visiting some relatives, we were introduced to these little gems. Now I just put 8 oz. milk in the microwave for 2:30, stir in one of these, add a little sugar, and voila -- a latte that's almost as good as what our old espresso machine made, with no mess to clean up. If you use lactose-free milk, you can use even less sugar since the lactose has already been broken down into sugar that you can taste. This product is already much cheaper than regular Starbucks or VIA, but if you can find the large plastic containers of crystals rather than these individual packets, your cost per serving will drop even more.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are looking for an inexpensive way to have tasty coffee drinks at home without the mess of an espresso machine, this might just fit the bill.
