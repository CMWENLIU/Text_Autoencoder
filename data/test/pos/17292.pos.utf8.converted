This is a huge package, enough bay leaves to last for years--and supply all your friends. But it is worth it! I am utterly lavish with them in my soups and stews because I have so much of it, and the aroma and flavor it imparts is more exquisite than any bay leaf I've ever bought in the grocery store.<br /><br />If you decide to buy this one-pound package and are looking for some additional uses for your large supply of bay leaves, here are some ideas:<br /><br />According herbal healers, bay leaves are an excellent digestive aid. This means when you cook with them, they also help you digest the meal you've prepared! When eating food you have not cooked with bay leaves or have acquired somewhere else, instead of taking antacids for indigestion, you can chew on a bay leaf. It helps with stomach cramps and with gas. (By the way, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ZZGG2">fennel seeds</a> are great for digestion and gas relief too. Just as for bay leaves, you chew on them.)<br /><br />The aroma of bay leaves is a natural repellent to ants, moths, and grain worms. If you put a bay leaf in your flour, rice, or cereal container, it will protect them from bugs. (Cayenne pepper makes a great pest repellent as well. Sprinkle it around where ants come into your house, and place it on your garbage can to repel squirrels and raccoons.)<br /><br />Bay leaf is also known by herbalists as an anti-dandruff remedy, and it helps with dry scalp, too. Place 5-10 crushed bay leaves in 4 cups of boiling water and seep for 30 minutes. Drain the cooled liquid into a plastic container (you don't want to take glass into your shower) and pour it over your hair as an after-shampoo rinse.<br /><br />Bay leaves also make a good-smelling addition to homemade potpourris.
