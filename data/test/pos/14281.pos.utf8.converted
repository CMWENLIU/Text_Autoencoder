While marketing for healthy breakfast fare,I tripped across this tin of' Mc Cann's, Steel Cut, Oatmeal several years ago and decided to give it a try. I did and now I am all but addicted to it! I followed the directions to have  perfect oatmeal. It was perfect but the drawback was the 25 to 30 minutes to cook it, and to do this daily! I like mine 'al dente' so I fast cook it on high temperature until most of the water has boiled out about 10 minutes, then cover it to simmer it the remainder of the cooking time. However with this method, one has to stir the oatmeal very often while it is simmering. Then along came a friend who suggested that I make a full batch, 1 cup of this oatmeal to 4 cups of water, and put the remainder of what wasn't eaten in a covered bowl in the frig. This I did, and still do. Now I scoop out the amount I want to reheat, place it in a bowl stirring in a little water to loosen it up, microwave it for 2 minutes or less depending on the amount I am reheating, and  I have almost an instant breakfast! Since it so crunchy and so delicious all by itself ( it doesn't even taste like oatmeal!) that it really  does not need any extras!Try it and enjoy!!!
