I have never tried Gunpowder tea before and was hesitant to after reading the recent reviews about how the quality of tea had changed.  I tried it anyway and have learned a lot and now LOVE this tea which is perfect for a tea lover on a budget, because this is A LOT of tea for this price!<br /><br />My co-worker informed me of the following and haven't had a bad brew yet!<br /><br />1) Use about a teaspoon full of tea in your teapot.  I use it with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FPN8TK">Adagio Teas 16-Ounce Ingenuitea Teapot</a> and I got the 32oz size for free shipping.<br /><br />2) For the "first run," the leaves are bitter, so let the water stay in the pot for a few seconds then dump that tea.  It is WAY MORE BITTER and why I didn't like the tea at first.  The subsequent runs will be much smoother<br /><br />3) The leaves can be used 3-6 times (per your taste) before throwing them out.  The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th runs (I have used up to 5 or 6 times and still gotten great tea) are subtle and not bitter and I don't use any sweetener anymore in my tea because I have gotten used to this.<br /><br />4) Lastly, the most important point!  Green tea only needs to steep for one maybe two minutes.  Don't steep it for 3 or 4 minutes or it will get a bitter taste.<br /><br />Don't be afraid to try this tea.  I hated green tea until now.  I actually ordered a second Adagio Teapot for work and split this pound bag of tea in half so I can have green tea whenever I want.<br /><br />I have recommended this tea and teapot combo to all my friends and family and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
