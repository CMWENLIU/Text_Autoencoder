I love these Coffee Shots.  If I need a boost in the morning from a restless night of sleep, I use one.  If it's early afternoon and I'm sluggish, I open one and put it in my coffee and within a few minutes I can feel a bit refreshed, they work really fast.  But NEVER drink it by it self, it taste terrible, but when it's used in a cup of coffee, I barely notice a difference in taste.  I will continue to keep these on hand as I love the energy boost they give me and the cost is fabulous.  I have one in a while use two at a time...they recommend no more than 2 a day.
