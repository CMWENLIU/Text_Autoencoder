Stevia offers a slightly different sweetness than sugar or no-calorie sweetners.  I use this product to sweeten coffee.  The English Toffee flavor isn't prominent at all once in the coffee but it sure smells wonderful as I add it.  I really like this product and am on my second order.  I would just caution that, in my opinon, there is a short adjustment period in getting used to the new taste.  Once that happens you'll love it.
