These pecans were really great. I was incredibly surprised at how fresh they were. Usually when I buy pecans I'm always somewhat disappointed because my grandparents had pecan trees and I know what really fresh pecans taste like. While these aren't as fresh as "just picked" pecans are, they are the freshest shelled and packaged pecans I've found so far. If you love pecans I certainly recommend these for your pies, trail mix, or even just for snacking.
