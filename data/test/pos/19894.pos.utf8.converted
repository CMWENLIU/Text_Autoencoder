This is my third order for the chocolate nibs.I enjoy these nibs because they're organic and they have no hard pieces or shells.I bought a different brand and could NOT eat them because there were so many hard shell pieces in the package.I WILL buy this product again because I enjoy eatting them for the health benifits that I receive from the dark chocolate.
