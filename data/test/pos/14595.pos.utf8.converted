I am a fan of the unflavored VIA packets and equally fond of the flavored ones. Caramel is my favorite. I used to drink caramel macchiatos regularly but gave them up when I eliminated dairy and soy from my diet. The caramel VIA packets fill that void more conveniently, with less calories and at a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />I wish the packets were scored better for easier opening like the unflavored packets. But seriously, grabbing a pair of scissors to cut the packet is a lot easier than loading a 10-month old into the car for a trip to our local Starbucks.
