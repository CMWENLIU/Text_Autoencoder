Just received my Beaba today and made two purees for baby. It's convenient, easy to use -- makes making baby food a breeze. Before I was steaming in the microwave, which kills some of the nutrients, not to mention that the plastic I was using may or may not have BPA. With the Beaba I don't need to worry about this anymore! I just take whatever we're cooking for ourselves, pop it into the Beaba and by the time our dinner is ready, so is baby's!<br /><br />I was a little hesitant to purchase this because I read some of the reviews about mold -- and it's difficult to know what the reviewers are referring to exactly without having the product in front of you.<br /><br />Now that I've used the Beaba, I'm wondering if the people who complained of mold were following the directions. I can see how mold could form in the water reservoir if you don't empty it after use. Obviously, mold can form any where there is water pooling for extended periods.<br /><br />However, the instructions clearly state to empty any water from the reservoir after each use, which I did immediately after using. I also left the top off just to ensure that any additional drops left inside would dry up. If you take this precaution, I don't see any way possible for mold to have the opportunity to form.<br /><br />When the instruction booklet talks about descaling the reservoir using vinegar, it's to ensure there is no lime build up-- not mold.<br /><br />After having used the Beaba, I don't think anyone interested in purchasing this should be turned off by claims of mold. If you take care of the machine properly, it won't be a problem.
