Let me start by saying I am 62 and have been a huge milk lover my entire life and if it were not for the calories I would probably drink a half gallon a day. Maybe that is why I have only had one cavity? Anyway, I know milk is fattening so I have at least restricted myself to skim after gradually going from whole to 2%, to 1%, to 1/2%. But I was still concerned about all the hormones in milk and wanted the added convenience of long term unrefrigerated storage for camping and emergency food supplies. I was skeptical of powdered milk but decided to take a chance with Bob's based on the good reviews here. What a surprise to find that I like this milk BETTER than my store bought skim. It tastes just a tad creamier than skim. Did I say I love this milk? When this 4-pack is gone I am getting on the automatic delivery and figure the cost per quart is going to be 82 cents. So not only is it BETTER than my store bought skim but cheaper and LESS calories still. I mix it in a blender with one cup of warm water for about one minute before adding the rest of the water and blending for an additional 15 secs. Perfect. I do it at night, stick it in the refrigerator and in the morning all the "head" has disappeared and I have cold milk for my cereal. Those complaining about mixing difficulty should just go buy store milk. It is NOT an issue with me. I highly recommend this milk.
