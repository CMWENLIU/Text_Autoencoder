This coconut oil is wonderful.  I use it as the shortening in my bran muffins and then as a spread when I toast them.  I also used it to fry yellow squash.  The combination of flavors were awesome.<br />Even used it on my hair as the best hot oil treatment ever.<br />After reading the benefits of coconut oil, this product will be a staple in my household.
