Several reviewers point out that this product is made with horseradish, not real wasabi, and gave it a low rating because they perceive it to be "fake". Yes, horseradish is much inferior to real wasabi in taste qualities, but I think that is missing the point. Very few people outside of Japan know what real wasabi tastes or even looks like, so the point is moot. If you are looking at any kind of prepared "wasabi" product, chances are almost 100% that it will be Western horseradish (seiyo wasabi) and not Japanese wasabi. Don't expect to find 100% pure wasabi in a tube.<br /><br />Japanese routinely eat sushi with "fake" wasabi, so there is no stigma against it. Real wasabi is too prized and scarce to grind up in large batches and let sit around. Once grated, real wasabi loses its pungency very quickly in the presence of oxygen (within 15-20 minutes). When presented to diners, wasabi is offered as a small root placed on top of a grater so you can grind the paste yourself.<br /><br />Few Japanese people expect real wasabi except at fine sushi restaurants. Everywhere else, it's this horseradish stuff dyed an unnatural shade of green, either offered as a tube or a ball of "wasabi clay" made from powdered horseradish. Real wasabi is notoriously finicky about its growing conditions and difficult to cultivate. What quantities not quickly snapped up by restaurants are sold to end consumers fresh as thumb shaped roots. Availability was sporadic and unpredictable in my supermarkets when I lived in Japan, and most people are happy with buying prepared wasabi substitutes like this for everyday use. S&B tube wasabi is commonly found in Japanese grocery stores and homes. It is also included as little squeeze packets in supermarket sushi sets.<br /><br />If you ever have the chance to try real wasabi, do it! The taste is so different and hard to describe.. it has a sort of sweetness and pleasant pungency that horseradish cannot reproduce. Horseradish just gives you that powerful nasal burn. Real wasabi doesn't.<br /><br />That having been said, S&B is an excellent sushi condiment when real wasabi isn't practical or available. I have used it for many years and will continue to use it. The paste easily dilutes into the soy sauce and coats sushi and sashimi well.
