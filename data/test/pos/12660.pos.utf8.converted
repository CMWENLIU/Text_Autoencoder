I've been looking for this for 30 years.  I boldly assert that this is IDENTICAL, flavor-wise, to the Kraft mac-and-cheese powder.  I'm pretty sure I've tried every form of boxed mac-and-cheese and can't begin to count the thousands of boxes that I and my family have gone through so I'm pretty confident in the accuracy of the prior sentence. In our house, whenever we make mac-and-cheese, we use extra packets of cheese, leaving orphaned boxes of uncooked noodles for later use.  In the last two weeks, we've burned through three pounds of the Barry Farm cheese and a bunch of boxes of unloved pasta. Here's what I've learned:<br /><br />1. As other reviewers have mentioned, you really can't use this exactly like you would the real Kraft powder. It will clump into little chewy cheese nuggets that don't quite work like the Kraft powder. You should mix the powder with a small amount of water/milk, making a paste, prior to adding it to your cooked pasta. As the cheese powder rehydrates, it will thicken a bit. If you plan to use it later, make it slightly runnier than you'd like.  It'll firm up.<br /><br />2. You don't NEED salt, milk, or butter.  I prefer adding a bit of butter to the cooked pasta, but it's just fine to add the cheese, alone, to the noodles.<br /><br />3. This is fantastic for leftover mac-and-cheese.  Kraft veterans know that leftover Kraft dinner is never quite the same as a fresh pot.  The Barry Farm powder, however, completely turns that notion on its head.  Add some of the paste to day old mac-and-cheese, reheat, and it's as good as when it was first made.<br /><br />4. This is great for independent children.  :) My 6-year-old can take some cooked pasta (stored in a zip-top bag), stir in some of the cheese-paste and reheat it for a quick one bowl snack/meal, very much like EasyMac, only significantly better tasting.<br /><br />5. You'll use more of this to flavor your mac-and-cheese than you would if it were the real Kraft powder.  Not a lot more, but it doesn't seem to be a 1:1 conversion.<br /><br />Yesterday, I ordered six more pounds of this stuff and will continue to keep it in our pantry for as long as it's available.  If it came in 50-lb sacks, I'd buy that, too.  It's a fantastic product and I'm thrilled to have found it.
