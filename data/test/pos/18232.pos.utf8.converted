OK, so I know it is salt, but this really was a great buy. I recently got the cooking bug and wanted to look at what different kinds of salt might do for my dishes. I have to say of the salts I have purchased (5 different kidns to date) the black lava salt has been my favorite. To lend additional credence to my review, I can point to my housemate who has also fallen in love with this salt.<br /><br />Pros: Amazing taste<br /><br />COns: It is salt and it is not cheap when you factor in teh price and shipping. That said, I would buy this again.
