I read a lot of reviews for different samplers available and am very happy I choose this!  I received 50 different k cups and all were in great condition.  It came with a wide variety of coffee (flavored, regular, decaf), teas, hot chocolate and a couple seasonal.  These came loose in a USPS box but was packed neatly.  This was a great way to try something knew without having to buy a whole box...and I will order again!
