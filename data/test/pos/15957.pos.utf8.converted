These are great--either as a snack by itself or as a bread substitute. They are half as thick as a rice cake, so it's much easier to eat a Corn Thin sandwich than a rice cake sandwich.  They're great with peanut butter!  My store recently stopped carrying them.  I was thrilled to see that Amazon has them!  My son can't eat wheat, so he frequently takes a peanut butter and jelly on Corn Thin sandwich for his school lunch.  They travel well and are tasty.
