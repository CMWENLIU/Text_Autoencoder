I have tried everything for my finicky feline fuss pot!  Thankfully, Weruva has come along.  My cat is no longer finicky - unless it is not Weruva!  I am very happy that Mr Poof is finally eating everyday - he would go on hunger strikes when he became bored of his food.  Now, he is a little purr monster when the Weruva cans come out of the closet!!!!!!  I actually had a question for Weruva regarding BPA in their cans (there is none) and I got to speak to the owner - what a nice lady!
