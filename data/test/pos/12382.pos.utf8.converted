I tried several Saffron from local stores, and they all came disappointment. Either they have a really bad smell or they are not fresh or flavorful. Then I decided to use a more expensive one (or probably the most expensive one on the shelf) and the result turns out great! the product was sealed in the little envelop inside the sealed glass can to preserved the freshness of the saffron. With just a little of saffron in the Paella, it make my Paella very flavorful and coated with beautiful golden yellow color. The taste was superior, I can taste saffron even with very little saffron in it. Combine this spice with other spices I brought from McCormick for paella, and they all are great!
