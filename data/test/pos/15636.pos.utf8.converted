I had never tried Hazelnut oil before receiving my order, so I have nothing to compare it to. But I have enjoyed this oil, using it in salad dressings, bread, and baked desserts. It has a very nice Hazelnut aroma and a light flavor. So far I haven't noticed much of a distinct hazelnut flavor in the things I use it in, but it does add something to the overall taste.<br />The oil came in what seemed decent packaging, but each of the cans were dented. Not horribly, just a few dings and a couple of bigger dents. I wonder if perhaps they were damaged before shipping. Oh well.<br /><br />So far my favorite use for this oil is a Raspberry salad dressing. Mix the Hazelnut oil with some Raspberry vinegar and voila! a yummy dressing. Also good in Chocolate Decadence.
