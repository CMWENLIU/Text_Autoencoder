I have been reading about the nutritional benefits of Black Rice and was happy to have found it on Amazon.com.  The rice can be used anywhere you would use white or brown rice.  I boiled it, drained and sauteed it in a little Extra Virgin Olive Oil, minced fresh garlic, minced fresh parsley and salt and pepper.  Its really, really savory.  Not bland at all.  I'm looking forward to trying it with stir fry.<br />My only "issue" is that the package doesn't include great instructions.  The best thing to do is to add the rice to boiling water and boil for about 18 minutes and drain.  It is parboiled, so it doesn't need to simmer for as long as regular rice does.<br />Also, it doesn't seem to "expand" as much as white or brown rice do.  That's not a complaint...just an observation.<br />I'm really happy with my purchase and expect to buy it again.<br />Its great to be able to try new products and to get them at a reasonable price.
