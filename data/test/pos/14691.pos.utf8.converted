My daughter has been taking this probiotic for just over two months and I can already tell it is helping her.  She has some digestive issues and I think this will help her body heal itself.  Really like this product so far and would highly recommend it.  As with any probiotic it just takes time to work, it's not an instant fix but what is that really works.  Just give it time.  This would be great for reflux and other digestive issues.  Also this product is dairy free, which I have been looking for a long time.  My daughter is sensitive to dairy products and most infant probiotics have dairy in them.  So this is a huge plus and is made just for you baby's digestive system.
