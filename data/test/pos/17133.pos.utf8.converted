I don't normally use honey but I drink a fair amount of tea and wanted something healthier than white sugar or products like Splenda, etc.<br /><br />Just got two one pound jars of Really Raw Honey and I must say it's much nicer than what I'm used to at the local grocery store.<br /><br />It's packed in glass jars which is the proper way to pack honey (it can absorb things from plastics). Plus its totally unfiltered yet seems more sophisticated in both taste and texture than the super market stuff.<br /><br />It's a solid, so it's less messy than the liquid variety. I just made a cup of tea and dipped a spoon into the honey and it scoops easily up and melted into my tea right away,<br /><br />If you think honey is too cumbersome to use, reconsider. I can't honestly say this brand is better than others in its class but it is definitely nicer than the typical filtered, liquid, plastic squeeze container variety found in most super market brands.<br /><br />Addendum: April 2009 - my latest jars have been 2Lbs 10oz sizes. These have been packed in plastic, not glass jars unlike my 1lb jars were. If this is of concern to you, contact mfgr. to ask about glass jar options.<br /><br />EDIT: Feb 2010 - I should add that I buy direct from Really Raw. Their price includes shipping within the continental US - FYI
