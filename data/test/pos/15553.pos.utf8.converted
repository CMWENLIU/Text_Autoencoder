I cook a lot of pasta, but don't have the time or patience to make my own. This is the finest dried pasta I have ever cooked. My guests always agree. It has a chewiness and ability to hold sauce that is outstanding. Rarely sticks (only if you totally ignore it in the pot.) Worth the effort--far above the best usual store brands.
