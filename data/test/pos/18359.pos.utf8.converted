A little over a week ago and completely out of the blue, I started having heart palpitations.  I'm a 27-year-old female and am on no medications and have no significant medical history.  The first two days, I only noticed a few of them.  Then for the next 3 days, I had them much more frequently.  I could put my fingers on my pulse and literally feel my heart skipping beats (a long pause followed by 2 closer-together beats).  It was absolutely terrifying; I couldn't sleep for two nights because I was afraid I wouldn't wake up.  I had read that these are typically harmless, especially if they aren't accompanied by any underlying heart issues or symptoms.  But that doesn't make them any less frightening and unsettling.  Finally, on day 5, I went to the doctor who confirmed with an EKG that I was having premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).  He told me just to forget about them, that they were harmless.  That lessened my anxiety related to the heart palpitations a bit, but I knew something had to have caused them, and I wasn't content to just deal with them forever.  I had my blood checked, and I was neither hyperthyroid nor hypothyroid, and my potassium level was normal (these are potential causes of the PVCs according to my doctor, in addition to caffeine and stress).<br /><br />But I also read that a magnesium deficiency can cause heart palpitations (and being deficient wouldn't have been a surprise because my diet had been less-than-ideal).  So, on day 6, I went to a health food store and was encouraged to try this product.  I paid $18 for 4 ounces!  I went home and took a big initial dose (probably 2 teaspoons) and, within a few hours, I noticed that my heart beat wasn't skipping as frequently.  The next day, I noticed an occasional flutter but nothing like the big scary pounding flip-flops from the days before.  The next day, they were gone altogether, and they have not returned.  I have been palpitation-free for several days now, and I undoubtedly owe my relief to this magnificent magnesium!<br /><br />Beyond the cessation of the abnormal heart beat, this product helps me sleep like a log!  It has also made me feel much calmer, even in situations where I ordinarily would feel anxious.  I am truly thankful to have found this product!
