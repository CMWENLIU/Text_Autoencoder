I used to be able to get this relatively inexpensively at my local grocery store.  When they stopped carrying it, I looked everywhere and couldn't find it.  Some stores don't even carry toasted sesame oil at all.  It's still a little pricey here but cheaper than some of the small bottles carried locally.  I tried another brand on here and was disappointed to find it wasn't toasted so it had almost no flavor at all.  This oil adds a delicious strong toasted sesame flavor to stir fry or salads.  A little goes a long way.
