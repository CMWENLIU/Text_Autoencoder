I found this product at an Earth Fare store which is an hour from where I live.  It retails for about $10 per jar.  At first, I thought this was a lot to spend on spaghetti sauce, but after trying it one time, it was worth every penney and more!  This is absolutely the most wonderful marinara I have EVER tasted.  It is like you just made it yourself from fresh ingredients.  The flavor is awesome.  It does not taste like pre-made spaghetti sauce at all.  I couldn't get back to the health food store recently, so I bought something I thought would be similar.  No comparison.  I can get more of this heavenly sauce at Amazon and glad I won't have to drive two hours round trip.  If you love a tomatoey, fresh, natural marinara sauce, give this a try.  The tomatoes are imported from Italy and grown in the foothills of Mt. Vesuvius.  I gave jars of sauce for Christmas presents this year.  I can't wait to try all the flavors, but right now, the garlic marinara is my favorite.  You won't go back to those other sauces again!  Absolutely the best available.  :)
