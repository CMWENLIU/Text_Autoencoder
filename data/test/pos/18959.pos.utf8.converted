I receive this oil through Amazon's excellent Subscribe&Save program. 6 shipments, and so far the quality's been excellent. Thanks to all the previous reviewers for pointing out that this oil tastes like an unfiltered olive oil, 'cause it's not mentioned anywhere in the product's description. And unfiltered is what I crave!
