I regularly pop corn in a wok with canola oil.  Nothing fancy, pops like a charm.  My local supermarket chain (VONS) used to sell those old plastic bags of corn for like $2.  You know -- those old fashioned bags that just sit there while everyone else buys all the microwave garbage.<br /><br />Well VONS slowly marked up these bags to about $3 over the years.  Then one day they were all GONE.  Replaced with Orville Reddenschmucker like 'jugs' of unpopped corn.  Just under two pounds of corn for --- WAIT FOR IT -- $5.<br /><br />I have to pay MORE money and get more container but LESS corn?!?  I don't THINK so...<br /><br />So I start surfing the web.  My God -- some site was willing to sell me a 50 pound bag for like $18.  My cheapness grinned ear to ear.  Then I saw the shipping charge --- WAIT FOR IT -- $43.  Yeah... no...<br /><br />So then I see this brand at Amazon.  12.5 pounds for $17.  Shipping?  FREE.  And I don't have to store 50 pounds!<br /><br />Just over a dollar a pound instead of twice as much?  SOLD.<br /><br />Now it's home.  Just made a batch.  I'm not a gourmet -- it's frickin' popcorn, okay?  To me, it's either a pass or a fail.  Better than Von's, the same, or unacceptable.  It's either better or the same as Von's -- I can't tell.  It seemed to pop bigger, but I'm not sure the bigger popping translates to better taste.<br /><br />Why are you still reading this?  Just order it already.<br /><br />;-)
