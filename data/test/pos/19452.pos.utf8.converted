Vegemite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002O10K6C">Vegemite 400g Jar</a>is practically unknown in North America, but I'll bet there is no one is Australia of an ethnicity who has never heard of Vegemite, and of those who have, almost everyone will have some at home. Every restaurant and side of the road eatery carries it. It comes in tubes, jars, and little packets like jams and butter substitutes do in the US. It is Vegemite, the concentrated yeast extract spread that goes on most slices of bread or toast Down Under. Dark brown to be almost black, it has a strong taste, so if you're a novice, spread it thin. Americans who try Vegemite fall into two categories: those who hate it or love it immediately. Don't take my word for it, check it out online: there is no better sourse for B vitamins than Vegemite. If your are used to nothing other than peanut butter and jam on your bread and toast, you are ready for a change, a change for a low-calorie healthy product that you won't be able to stop talking about. It's flavour is unique; it's closest cousin is the British and New Zealand Marmite, though similar, is not the same. Ordering it in the US is more expensive than getting it Oz, but it is a sacrifce that I am happy  to make just to have it on the table.
