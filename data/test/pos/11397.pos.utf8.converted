I just received this wonderful tea and can't get enough of it. When I opened the bag for the first time, I was delighted by the tea's aroma. I then made a cup and was in heaven. It has a rich, delightful taste, is well balanced and leaves you wanting more - like a fine dessert without all the calories!
