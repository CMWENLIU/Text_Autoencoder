After a student giving me an Amber Lyn Chocolate Bar, I was amazed how delicious and exceptional the taste was. I do not like sugar free products, but in looking at the ingredients, artificial sweeteners are not used in making an Amber Lyn bar. After eating the chocolate bar, I went to the Amber Lyn website to find out more about their chocolates because the taste is unique. While I like most chocolate, this really is different because there is a different aftertaste left in the mouth. Chocolate seems to resonate throughout my mouth after eating the Amber Lyn bar. It is definitely worth the cost to try one of these bars because See's and Godiva both charge a lot for their confections too. Amber Lyn is definitely gourmet chocolate and a box of bars might make excellent gifts at Christmas and other holidays.
