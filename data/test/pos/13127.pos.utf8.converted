I developed a liking for butter toffee peanuts when I was on vacation in Michigan one year.  Up there they are available in the nut aisle of pretty much any grocery store.  Down South they are much more difficult to find.  So I actually bribed my sister in law to send them to me once in awhile.  Now I have these!<br /><br />They are packaged very well, in six sealed bags that are packed very tight so the nuts don't slosh all around.  I think about 95% of the butter toffee is still on the nuts where it belongs.  They are also very fresh, and the butter toffee is very good.  I am very picky about these things, and I think this brand is wonderful.<br /><br />The amazing thing is that the fat content on these is only 6g per ounce, and only 130 calories.  Plain peanuts usually have 5-6g of fat and roughly the same amount of calories.  These are healthier than chips and a lot of other stuff, and they taste like carnival food.<br /><br />Treat yourself right and order some today!
