This fun pack is a veritable taste sensation.  I thought perhaps I was dreaming when I opened up the snickers and smelled the sweet aroma of nuts and chocolate -- nothing beats biting into that succulent chocolate bar! At least that's what I thought, until I unveiled the crispy crunchy twix bar.  To do this is a true revelation, as the cookie and the caramel mingling sinfully with the chocolate is like dying and going to heaven. The fact that you can top off this delightful combo by unsheathing a Mars bar or the ever decadent 3 Musketeers -- well, it's truly a miracle indeed.
