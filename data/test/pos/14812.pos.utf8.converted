My best friend returned to Japan and I felt that unless I went to a Japanese restaurant, I would never, ever have real miso soup.<br /><br />I tried every paste, every color. I tried making my miso with and without wakame; I even tried mixing the pastes and still could not get it right.<br /><br />I FINALLY got it! I didn't even intend to order Hon Dashi, had it on my wish list, but it was the best mistake I could make.<br /><br />I'll be experimenting with my dashi to see what else I can add it to. The smokey flavor is superb.
