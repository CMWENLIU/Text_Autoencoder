I have waited for the Starbuck's K-cups.  Finally, they're here!  I've only tried the Breakfast Blend and it rocks!  If you want a stronger brew then use the middle brew button but I find that the larger cup (3rd button on the B-60 and B-70) to work for me.  I'll try the others in the near future.  I've been drinking Gloria Jean's Capuccino (middle brew button) and Coffee Barista's Columbian.  They are excellent!  I like a strong cup of Joe but not bitter and these 3 are great!  You pay a little more for the Starbuck-s K-cups however, I feel it's worth it.  I'll pay just about any price for a "GOOD" cup of Joe.  People, stop your whining and enjoy your coffee -
