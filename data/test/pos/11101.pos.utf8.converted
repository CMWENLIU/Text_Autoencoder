I have been using stevia products since at least 2008, originally as Stevita, a product that has the consistency and spoonability of sugar.<br />Like Stevita, Truvia has the consistency and spoonability of sugar. Like Stevita, Truvia has no calories. It is an effective sweetener, and in the spoonable version I'm reviewing is quite easy to use in many ways. The envelopes of Truvia are handy to carry with, but ripping them open spills a little bit on the counter, when using a small spoon with the jar version might well be neater.<br />UNLIKE Stevita Truvia is widely marketed, except that it's not in a Target store in the Chicago suburbs. It is even available in my local fairly small supermarket in West Philadelphia/University City. At one time the supermarket carried the jars, but then there was price drop on the envelopes and that is now all they carry.<br />I agree with another reviewer that Amazon is taking a cue from one of its sellers, and is charging an outrageous price for 3 jars of Truvia. A little goes a long way; I am really not sure I want to spend twice the price of 3 jars in the store, to buy 3 jars from Amazon. Would I even use up enough in a year to justify the purchase?<br /><br />It's a good product. Keep looking until you find it at a semi-reasonable price. It does cost more than sugar. On the other hand, the benefits of no sugar high, and reduced calories, make it worthwhile.
