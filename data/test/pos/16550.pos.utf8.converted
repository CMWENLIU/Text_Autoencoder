I love this machine. It is a breeze to use. It is easy to clean. I usually soak my beans over night, and in the morning I have fresh delicious soymilk in fifteen minutes. I've tasted alot of soymilk and this is by far my favorite. The machine comes with a recipe book. The only downside for me was that I thought it would make rice milk. It makes rice "paste", which i guess you could drink. (a little thick though)But overall, well worth it!
