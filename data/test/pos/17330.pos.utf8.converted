My dog loves these!  I've only tried the salmon and peanut butter, I held off on the chicken due to other reviews saying it smells bad.  I prefer the peanut butter by far, the salmon is a bit stinky.  I noticed that my hands as well as my dog smelled fishy after giving him treats and petting for a job well done.  Treat size is perfect although they do tend to dry out if you don't keep them in a well sealed container.
