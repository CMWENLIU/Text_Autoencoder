Been searching around locally to find whole grain organic Rye and the closest local place is a fair drive away and the rye is not that cheap. Decided to try out this brand and I have to say it works great. It is cheaper than what it would cost me to drive to the local feed store and buy it and drive back, plus this gets delivered right to my door.  The subscription plan makes the price break even sweeter. For cooking, mycology or whatever else you use Rye for, this stuff works great.
