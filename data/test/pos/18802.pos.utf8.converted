I've only ever used the curry pastes they sell in my local chain supermarket. It comes in a tiny jar, is $7, and has such little flavor I almost need to use an entire jar every time I make curry.<br /><br />After doing some Amazon searches for curry paste this one seemed to have the most, and best, ratings. And it has  A LOT of paste in the container! So I ordered it. I figured if Thai folks use this curry, it must be good.<br /><br />And it is! It's the best, and now my curry rivals that of the local restaurants. We don't go out for curry anymore, since it takes less than 30 minutes to make one that tastes just as good.<br /><br />The container is huge, and it will take months for me to work through it even if I make curry once per week.<br />When I first smelled the curry I was a little afraid to use it. The spices are definitely in there, and I started to sneeze from the chili! But I tried it and all the scariness of the curry went away. It smelled amazing, the amount of kick was perfect, and it was not overwhelming.<br /><br />I highly recommend this and I will definitely stock up. This is cheap, free shipping with Prime, and it's the best curry paste I have ever used.
