This works great if you soak the pearls in whatever liquid you are planning to cook them with.  Don't drain, just cook after soaking for about a 1/2 hour.  I've only made vegan tapioca pudding and it always turns out great.  I use variations of a recipe from Sweet and Natural, by McCarty, which is a great cookbook without refined sugar/refined flour and vegan.
