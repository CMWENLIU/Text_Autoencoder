I got my Jack Russell puppy started on Glucosamine bones several months ago and she loves them!  I was buying them at the local pet store for the same price and they only had one knot while these have two and last longer for the same price!  Best of all, I don't have to leave the house to go to the pet store!  My puppy is now 8-months old and one of these bones will last her about 1.5 to 2 weeks and she chews on it constantly.  I highly recommend this product!
