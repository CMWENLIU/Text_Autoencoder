I am so pleased that I can get the Frontier products off of Amazon.  Using the subscription plan the price is excellent and I don't have to get to the health food store all the time.  The chopped white onion has excellent flavor in our opinion but a LITTLE goes a long ways so be careful how much you use until you are used the product.  Wish I could buy only one pound at a time instead of two but they come in one pound packages so the second pound stays fresh with out a problem.
