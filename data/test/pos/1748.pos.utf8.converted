I have just placed my third order for finishing salt from Das Salt.  Ms. Das provides an excellent product that I find myself using time and again in much of my cooking.  I am far from a gourmet chef, but I do like to experiment with different spices and flavors from time to time, and her salts do often add just a bit of subtle flavor that helps just about any meal.  Finally, with my first two orders and I'm sure my third I just placed, customer service has been excellent.  Each time a card or invoice signed by Ms. Das has been included, along with a sample of another product she sells under the "Das Food" line, like some of her caramels.  Packaging is always excellent too, the jars are well protected without using excess packaging.  This is a product I fully recommend if one is looking for a gourmet finishing salt.
