I am plagued with adult acne and I have tried most of the stuff out there with little luck so decided to start from the inside out! I took some info various books along with a few other sources and have had success. I began ingesting the following(see below) and by week 3 of this new intake my skin looked amazing! really amazing, glowing I would dare say! Acne is a bummer and is emotional and as a woman I know how awful it really can be! I slowly built up my intake of the following and now consume each thing on this list each day and I swear to you my skin is 95% clear!!<br />1) vitamins: Pantothenic acid, alpha liopic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, acidophilus.<br />2) I ingest tablespoon of organic fish oil (liquid) and flaxseed oil<br />3) I ingest 1 tablespoon of pure organic cocao powder(not coco powder w/ sugar..the real deal like this BRAND)I use in a shake w/ a banana since this stuff can be very bitter.<br />4) 4 cups of organic green tea<br />5) 1 glass of blueberry juice<br />6) topically I use BP each night on my skin and use not a moisturizer but a hydration cream and I cleanse with an over the counter sensitive cleansing liquid.<br />7) for scaring I use topical vitamin c serum each morning<br /><br />I decided on this mix based on several different resources and this combo works wonders for me. I am not sure if one thing is more powerful than another to be honest but I can say that 3 months into this "test" my skin is still looking amazing. I had to share because I know that so many suffer with this horrible condition.
