Nature Valley bars are a natural source of energy to fuel healthy active lifestyles. One bar has 140 calories. That's not bad for a bar that satisfies our cravings for candy bars. We keep a box of Fruit & Nut bars on hand. When we get ready to leave on a road trip, we take some with us. That way we can travel further without having to stop along the way. Sometimes we grab a bar in the morning when we are in a hurry. They make a good breakfast.<br /><br />Fruit & Nut Bars contain almonds, raisins, peanuts, and cranberries.<br /><br />In 1975, Nature Valley created the granola bar category. Since then Nature Valley has continued to set the standard for granola bars.<br /><br />Now it is possible to buy Nature Valley granola bars in all sorts of flavors, such as Apple Crisp, Strawberry Yogurt, Vanilla Yogurt, Blueberry Yogurt, Mixed Berry, Banana Nut, Oats and Honey, Cinnamon, Maple Brown Sugar, Roasted Almond, and Peanut Butter. We started with Fruit & Nut bars, and so far we have not managed to buy anything else. I suppose we should try other kinds, but Fruit & Nut bars are too good.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.
