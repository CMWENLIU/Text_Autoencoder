"...made without hydrogenated oils - which is a good thing since it's difficult for our bodies to absorb trans-fatty acids that come from hydrogenated oils." ~box<br /><br />These are definitely natural snack crackers to bounce around about. I mean, it is so rare to find even natural foods without hydrogenated oils. I can't count the times I've read labels only to be disappointed to find that "natural" does not always mean healthy.<br /><br />Ingredients: Certified organic wheat flour, expeller pressed safflower oil, aged cheddar cheese (contains milk, salt, enzymes, cheese culture), salt, yeast extract, paprika, annatto extract (for color), ground celery seed, onion powder, yeast.<br /><br />I've made my own cheese crackers and these really do taste homemade. About 24 tiny crackers will satisfy any cheese cracker craving and that is about 70 calories.<br /><br />These crackers are Bernie the Bunny (Annie's beloved mascot) approved. They are also made with only vegetarian ingredients. I love the cute rabbit shape and you can add these crackers into snack mixes with pumpkin seeds, chocolate chips, dried cranberries, GeniSoy Soy Nuts and anything else you can think of including sunflower seeds.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
