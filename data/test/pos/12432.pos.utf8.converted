This is a great seasoning.  My dad taught me how to cook and our favorite basic spice combination for meat, fish and poultry is salt pepper and paprika.  Decided to eliminate salt from my diet and tried a some supermarket brands that were not great.  Kept looking and saw a spot for this at Costco but it is always empty.<br /><br />Instead of waiting I got it here on Amazon and have been using it for a few days.  This is great.  The closest to salt(I can't taste the difference) but the mix of flavors actually work better with meat, poultry and fish.<br /><br />My only concern was using it in soups but I ground it up and it was perfect in my favorite summer soup (corn chowder with crab/shrimp).  I love it.<br /><br />Ingredients(from the back of the bottle):<br /><br />Organic onion, organic garlic, organic carrot, organic black pepper, organic red bell pepper, organic tomato granules, organic orange peel, organic parsley organic bay leaves, organic thyme, organic basil, organic celery, organic lemon peel, organic oregano, organic savory, organic mustard seed, organic cumin, Organic marjoram, organic coriander, organic cayenne pepper, citric acid and organic rosemary.<br /><br />I love this and it is a great salt replacement.
