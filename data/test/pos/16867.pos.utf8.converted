I am so glad that I have found Taste of the Wild. This dog food is made by Diamond, which is a well know, good quality dog food. Taste fo the Wild is a grain free formula for all life stages. I've been trying for a year now to find a good quality dog food that won't break my bank. I tried Nutro Max, Nutro Ultra, Nature's Recipe, and even the highly claimed Canidea (which he did not do well on at all). I found Taste of the Wild (among other high quality foods) at a local feed store. I placed 5 different high quality dog foods down, and even his current dog food, to see which one he would go to first. He went to the Taste of the Wild first and went between this and another brand. What really got me was that my parents' very picky pomeranian went straight for this food, and ate it without wet food on it!<br /><br />So I brought Taste of the Wild home and have been switching it, slowly, over. PLEASE make sure when you switch your pet's food you mix it slowly and gradually over time or else your pet may get an upset stomach.<br /><br />Overall he's doing much better. His coat is shiner, he has more energy, and he gobbles up the food. Taste of the Wild costs about as much as some name brand foods at Petsmart and is a much better quality food. Email them and they will send you samples so you can have your dog try it.
