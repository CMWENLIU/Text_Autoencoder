I bought this item based on health reasons, reviews of the product here and all the great information on the internet about the benefits of adding flax seeds to my daily diet.  I also bought a mini coffee grinder just for this product.  At first I tried to chew it, ugh... it takes a lot of hard work, I felt like a cow chewing cud and the flavor is extremely, uh... earthy.  So instead I ground it up in my new coffee grinder and added it to yogurt, YUM... the earthy flavor is gone and a nutty wholesomeness is added to my yogurt.  I add it to everything and it makes a great addition to my healthy diet.  The seeds look fresh, clean and healthy.  They almost looked too perfect with a nice shiny shell.  The freshly ground meal smells very clean and definitely has a nice nutty bite.  There is about more or less a year on the expiration date on the package that I received.  I would recommend this specific product to anyone who wants to add a bit of health to their daily diet.  I'll more likely than not be ordering more of this stuff in the near future at the rate that I've been chowing down on it.
