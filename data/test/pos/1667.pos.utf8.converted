Are you a big fan of Hot & Spicy "cup of noodle" products?  I am too and these are the perfect solution to avoid getting an entire day's worth of sodium and about 400 calories from a simple bowl of spicy soup.<br /><br />I take one package of the noodles and rinse them in cold water and put them in boiling water for a minute or so (basically following the directions on the package).  Then I soak it in chicken broth overnight in the fridge.  The following day I dice up some chicken and drain the bowl of the broth until there's the amount of liquid I prefer for my soup.  Add in some texas pete buffalo wing sauce (anything similar will do just fine) and mix it around and you have some delicious, guilt-free hot & spicy soup!  Just as filling as anything you'd get in a styrofoam container with a fraction of fat and salt!  Next time I'm going to drain the broth into a pot and bring it to a boil before re-adding the noodles and adding the hot sauce and an egg.
