MUCH TO MY DISMAY WHOLE FOODS NO LONGER CARRIES OLD WESSEX FIVE GRAIN CEREAL. I USUALLY STOCK UP ON IT WHEN I GO TO THE STORE. I HAD TO ORDER IT ON LINE AND TAKE A CASE.  MY GRANDAUGHTER WHO IS EIGHT WAS EATING IT OUT OF THE BOX. I GAVE MY DAUGHTER A FEW BOXES AND SHE MADE HER FAMOUS COOKIES WITH CHOCOLATE CHIPS FROM THE RECIPE ON THE BOX. I USUALLY DON'T GET TO EAT LUNCH UNTIL AFTER TWO O'CLOCK SO THIS CEREAL REALLY KEEPS ME WELL FORTIFIED.  I ADD PROTEIN POWDER, WHEAT GERM AND GROUND FLAX SEED TO THE HOT CEREAL AND ALSO SOY MILK.  WHAT A TREAT!!!
