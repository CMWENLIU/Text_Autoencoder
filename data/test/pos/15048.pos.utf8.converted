I've used 6 different kinds of cayenne pepper so far, 5 of which were organic.  My uses include spicing up foods, as well as an ingredient in the lemonade made while doing the Master Cleanse (it's NOT a diet! :) (by the way, Shady Maple Farms Grade B maple syrup is the best I've found as well).  This was the tastiest cayenne pepper BY FAR and for me, worth the price of admission.
