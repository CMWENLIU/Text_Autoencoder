Although a fan of citrus tinged (Earl Grey & Lady Grey) teas, I must say that Numi's "Emporer's Puerh" is quite unlike any other black tea I've tried.  A malty flavor and dark black color (as dark as coffee) are at once noticeable.  It lacks the aftertaste found in a traditional breakfast blend, of which I am not particularly fond.  This tea is a nice change of pace from Earl Grey and for any tea afficiando is definitely not to be missed for its unique flavor and color.
