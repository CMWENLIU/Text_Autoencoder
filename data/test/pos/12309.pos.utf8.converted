I generally avoid most pastas, preferring the zucchini noodles or spaghetti squash as gluten free alternatives instead of rice noodles or other gluten free options. These are such a nice surprise! I only bought them because they were on sale at our local health food store (two 12-oz. bags for $5.00). Admittedly when I took them out of the bag, I wasn't too certain about them. The texture is a little odd straight out of the package. I rinsed them with water and then made a tahini, almond butter, tamari, rice vinegar, sesame oil, adzuki bean miso, and coconut sugar sauce to pour over them. I had to massage the sauce into them a bit with my hands. Then they softened up into reasonable nicely textured noodles. I topped it with thinly sliced cucumber, carrots and chopped almonds. Mmmm! They are very high in calcium, and with the tahini sauce, it's a calcium fest. Granted, I can't very well see how they're considered "raw." They hardly look like any kelp plants I know. Some processing had to take place somewhere along the way. I am happy to have found them to satisfy my occasional craving for something that's a little more genuinely noodle-y. Hooray!
