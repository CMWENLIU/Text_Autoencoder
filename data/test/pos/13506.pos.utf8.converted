I remember Buckwheat Pancakes from years ago. The thought of these heavy, rich tasting pancakes brings a sigh to my lips. My Mom useed to cook these when I was a kid, and I always loved them...now, I fixed them for my Grandson, and he feels the same...3 pancakes, 2 eggs, and lots of butter and real Homemade Hot Sugar and vanalla suyrp...OMG...soooo good. layer a pancake, then egg, then pancake, then another egg, finished by another pancake to make the Family Stacker! I found this brand a few years back, and it is the real thing...easy to make, healthy, and Lord knows...eat 3 of these and you will NOT be hungry in a couple hours! They Stick with you. Is a common breakfast item from long ago...settlers and farmers...eat these and you could plow a field, and have more energy to make it till lunch! Be Well, and Blessings upon all...
