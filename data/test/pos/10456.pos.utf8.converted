After hearing rumors about full fat, dutch processed cocoa powder, and sick to death of the anemic offerings by Hershey's, etc., I took a chance and ordered the 1kg bag of the Callebaut brand of dutch processed cocoa.  They sent me this brand instead, along with a note stating it's the exact same product, just different packaging.<br /><br />I use this stuff *exclusively* to make hot cocoa, using 2% milk and either dark brown sugar or  blue agave syrup, depending on my mood.  Trust me; I'll NEVER go back to regular cocoa again.  The dark chocolate contains more antioxidants and is more flavorful than the bleached Hershey's offerings, and I use less than half the sugar one would normally put in cocoa (about two tablespoons per 10oz mug).<br /><br />My recipe: Into 12oz warm milk (just past drinking temperature, NEVER boiled) add two tablespoons dark cocoa powder, and 1-2 tablespoons (level) dark brown sugar (to taste) OR one tablespoon agave syrup.  Stir.  Add vanilla or cinnamon if desired (not required).<br /><br />A much healthier, and MUCH TASTIER alternative to the powder packets on sale at the supermarket.<br /><br />Starbucks wishes it had cocoa this good.  **IT DOESN'T**
