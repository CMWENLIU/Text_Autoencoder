My dog loves these treats!  I put them inside the Everlasting Treat Ball and he loves getting through the first cookie to get to the treats inside.  The flavors are varied and he doesn't get tired or bored with the tastes.  You can also divide the treats in half to make them smaller and I use them that way both inside the treat ball and as training treats.  This is a great product which comes packaged in a zip-lock foil bag so the treats stay fresh for a long period of time...if you can keep them away from your dog long enough!  I will buy this again because my dog likes them and because I like to vary his treats.
