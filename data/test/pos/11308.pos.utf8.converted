I love Shirakiku Ramune Soda. The first time I had it was in the Japanese Pavilion in Epcot. I've been dying to find it ever since! When I saw that Amazon had it, I immediately ordered it. It's so wonderfully sweet- I didn't even wait to chill it! It tastes a little like gum to me, but it's very refreshing. I wish I could get it by the case. Gotta love the marble!
