This brand is a lot healthier than other types of ramen. It can be cooked on the stove or in the microwave. I usually put in just enough water so that almost all of it cooks out. Using too much water makes this ramen taste flavorless. I also let it sit before eating so that the noodles soak up all of the flavor. If you cook this properly, it is very delicious.
