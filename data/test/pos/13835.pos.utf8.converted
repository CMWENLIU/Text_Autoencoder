This is the closest thing to European beer snacks in the US! I used to buy Gardetto's Mix just because of those rye bread chips! Finally, they make 'em separately now. Thank you! Contains MSG though, which I'm not really fond of. Try 'em with milk too! You may like it. Quite addictive, be aware! Once you opened a bag - you just can't stop. Be careful if you have very sensitive gums. Publix got 'em in smaller packages. But Amazon has the best price if you buy 'em in bulk. Highly recommend!
