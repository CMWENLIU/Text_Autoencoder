This is a great alternative to chicken soup if you get sick. It will alkalinize you blood and help to get better much faster than you would normally do. Also try it in the morning instead of your regular cup of java - it will perk you up without the jitters of caffeine. True it has a lot of solium, but this sodium is from sea salt that brings with it much needed trace minerals. The seaweed veriety is the best. Open minded and adventurous folks will love it right away, for others it may take some time to get used to. Do try. Your body will thank you.
