Product is great.<br />With that said, make sure and check your local supermarket price for this item first. I have become so accustomed to getting deals on Amazon that sometimes I don't even compare costs. Winds up that the regular price for one package of this item at my local supermarket is $2.99. Could have gotten a bag for free and had money left over had I just checked while I was doing my regular shopping.<br />Like Costco, Amazon doesn't always wind up saving you money.
