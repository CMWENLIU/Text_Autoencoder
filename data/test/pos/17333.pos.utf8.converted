I bought this sponge a few years ago and every time I use it I think of how great of a product it is. I realized that I really needed to write a review to get the word out.<br /><br />We have a longhaired black cat. Her fur is really fine and sticks to all our furniture. This sponge works like magic to lift off the fur. It is such a simple design but works like a dream, much better than those sticky tape rolls and other things I have tried.<br /><br />Occasionally, I have friends with large dogs that ride in my car. The sponge also works well to remove their fur from my car's upholstery, so I am sure it would work well with dog hair in the house, as well.
