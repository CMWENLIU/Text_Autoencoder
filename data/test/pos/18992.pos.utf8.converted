I have always used Nutiva brand coconut oil and ordered this brand to try because it was on sale. From now on I will probably keep both brands in the house as I found them to be pretty different from one another and useful for different purposes. The Nutiva brand definitely has a lot more coconut flavor, adding a lot more flavor to smoothies or in cooking. This brand absorbs into the skin a lot faster, without leaving the oily film on top of the skin, so I will continue to use this coconut oil for skin and hair care.
