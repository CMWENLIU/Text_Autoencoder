We all know by now, if only from reading reviews, that these puddings are easy to mix.  The sugar-free part eases your guilt of pouring pudding down your gullet.  But what makes this lemon flavor special?<br /><br />It's one of the best flavors, and I think many or most will agree with that; it's vibrant, comparatively speaking.  But consider mixing it with others!  For example, it really can pick up the rather bland cheesecake flavor and improve on them both.  You'll make at least two packages anyway, right?  So, one of each works.<br /><br />Use your imagination!
