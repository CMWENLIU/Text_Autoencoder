I've been making my own yogurt for quite a while now, but was pleasantly surprised when I tried this starter.  So far, it's the best I've tried, and I've tried quite a few.  My yogurt sets much more quickly, and has a nice creamy texture instead of the clumping I find with some other starters.  I've re-cultured five generations so far, and it's holding up wonderfully.  Wonderful light fresh taste.  Give it a try!
