This stuff is great!  Cold brewed coffee is smoother, less acidic and Cool Brew just tastes fantastic.  I highly recommend trying it.  I drink it cold but you can have it hot or cold.  It is a staple in New Orleans but very hard to find here in Texas.  The Mocha flavor is especially good but I have had them all and they are all good.<br /><br />Side note:  I have yet to see a more impressive bottle than what this comes in.  It makes portioning you daily cup (or cups) of coffee a breeze.  I love bringing it to work and fixing myself an iced coffee in the middle of the day
