If you are new to gluten-free baking, you should be aware that you only need 1 teaspoon of this binder to each cup of gluten-free flour.  That means that if you were to buy this in this volume, and you are baking for one person, you would never use it up before it went bad.<br /><br />On the flip side, if you are cooking gluten-free for a family, this is a bargain, not for the price, but for the availability:  guar gum can be hard to find in stores.<br /><br />Guar gum itself is a bargain for another reason: guar gum is 1/3 the price of xanthan gum, and yet it's one of the standard binders, xanthan gum and pre-gel starch being the others. (For those of you less familiar with gluten-free baking, you have to have a binder, kind of like an extra required flour, to make up for the lack of gluten.)<br /><br />Finally, hats off to Bob's Red Mill for selling this cheaply and in bulk.  The celiac community is somewhat hostage to vendors who sell what they can eat--and there are those who take advantage of that.  Selling guar gum at this price is another example of Bob's Red Mill having integrity.  Yay!
