I have 8 cats.  All of them go nuts for this item.  In fact, I would call it Kitty crack, I have to watch out for my top cat Buddy, he will open up cabinets or climb up on shelves and maybe knock something over trying to get at it.  Just wish they sold it by a big bag at a lower cost per unit weight, expensive for 8 cats. I have bought some alternatives that most of them reasonable like, but they know the difference between the real stuff, and the 2nd te alternative, and a few of them turn their nose up at any alternative treat.  But nobody turns their nose up at this item.
