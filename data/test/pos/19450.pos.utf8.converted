I bought these at my local supermarket--and this is not a cheapy market--for $2.50 for a box of 5 pouches (10 crisps). The price I'm seeing here on this date (3-23-10, $22.80 for 20 pouches) is more than twice that price. The crisps are great, though, so if you don't care about price, by all means, buy them here.
