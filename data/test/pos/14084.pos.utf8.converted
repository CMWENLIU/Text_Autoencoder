Outraged and disapointed by Kraft Foods elimination of Postum, a group of entrepreneur's acquired the formula and the rights to the name from Kraft. Their web site is simply called postum.com and it claims the new product will be available for purchase this coming winter(2012). So be patient everyone and you won't need to spend $150.00 for a single jar.
