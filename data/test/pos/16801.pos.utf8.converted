When you have to drink decaf and you live in a small town with limited selection, you learn to not be especially picky.  We love our Keurig brewer, but we were paying premium prices for K-cups at our local grocery store.  We found better deals at the Keurig website, but as I'm always on the lookout for a bargain, I was thrilled to see a medium-roast decaf K-cup that I'd tried and liked, available on Amazon's Subscribe and Save.  The deal is great:  I'm paying less than 40 cents per cup!  This decaf is smooth, mellow, not bitter, and not too dark.  I would imagine that if you prefer a dark roast, you'd find this too weak--but it's perfect for my rather tame taste in coffee.  I highly recommend it!
