I have a problem with digesting food, especially coconut milk. I cannot tolerate it (tried fresh and caned) and I don't know why, but this one didn't give me problems. Same goes for their unsweetened, shredded coconut flakes. First, I used a little in a dish then ate it straight out of the fridge when it solidified in the cold. If you have digestive issues, give this product a try.<br />The consistency is creamy with bits of coconut in it and has a mild coconut flavor, not very strong but when I used it in a Thai dish, the coconut flavor came out very nicely.
