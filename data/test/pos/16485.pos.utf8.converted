This was really good! It does taste like a Resse cup! Great for dipping pretzels and I could imagine using it as frosting on a chocolate cake! I love it has all natural ingrediants, but still has a long shelf life (about 2 years is my expiration date if stored in a cool dark place).<br />This is a definite treat for myself as well as the kids and I will be purchasing additional flavors to try as well.
