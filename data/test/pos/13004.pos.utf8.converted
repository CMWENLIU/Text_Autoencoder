Every year my Italian godmother gives me a box of these candies for Christmas and I have to work hard not to devour them within the day.  Within the box, one third are lightly orange flavored torrone, one third vanilla, and one third mildly lemon flavored - all are excellent, soft nougat (that unfortunately leave you wanting another one!).  Glad to know I can order them myself online, now, for the months in-between!
