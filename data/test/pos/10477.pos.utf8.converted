After reading prior reviews I felt confident about placing this order since people mentioned next day delivery.  But I did it late in the day on a Friday (for a birthday the following Wednesday) and was perturbed to see the order wouldn't go out until the following week.  Then I got an acknowledgement email that said it would not ship until Tuesday, with a two to six day delivery window, i.e., Thursday at the earliest.  Sigh!<br /><br />To my amazed and more-than-pleased surprise, the flowers were actually delivered on Tuesday!  According to my sister, they come direct from Honduras, Holland or Costa Rica ... hers came from Honduras.  And that's the small part of this five-star rating.<br /><br />The flowers were absolutely fresh, lavish/plentiful, beautiful, with wonderful colors ... everyone in her office raved about them, with one woman able to specifically identify a special Honduran rose she was familiar with.  The price is great, too, especially in view of what you get.<br /><br />I certainly know where I will be ordering flowers in the future.  My sister, too.  We're both completely thrilled and pleased.
