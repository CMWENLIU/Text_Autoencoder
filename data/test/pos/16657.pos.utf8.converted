Thank you, CAalmonds.com - you GET it! Americans are tired of things being soaked in DDT, boiled in chlorine and zapped with radiation just to make the USDA happy. This company has done its research and stays away from toxic chemicals and damaging radiation while still keeping the gummint boys off their backs - and what WE end up with is a nutritious, delicious health food that can be ordered over the net that will still actually SPROUT if you put it in water. I know - I sprouted several of these almonds after I received them. FYI - the process CAalmonds uses is a short hydrogen peroxide "steam bath." And - if they still sprout - they're good for your tummy, too! Good ON ya, CAalmonds!!!! The only problem is the whole darned 10 lb box is GONE.
