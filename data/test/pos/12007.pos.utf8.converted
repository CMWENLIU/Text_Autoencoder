I have purchased a Keurig Coffee maker this Christmas for my family who all like different flavors of coffee. We also have a Keurig at work and my company supplies another brand of Hazel Nut Decaffeinated which I drink daily. After researching K-Cup coffees online, I found Timothy's World and because of the great rating from users, I purchased it. Well, it is great tasting,flavorful and I enjoy it more than the brand we have  at work. I will continue purchasing this coffee for home and I recommend it for others to try. I can't drink caffein, but I am guessing that the regular Hazelnut is even more flavorful.
