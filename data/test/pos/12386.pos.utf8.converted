Diced Chik tastes just like Fri Chik - except it's cubed. It goes teriffic in a homemade vegetarian pot pie or "chicken" salad. I have used it in heavenly rice casserole and it was perfect. I prefer using it in casseroles over Fri Chik because it seems to stretch farther and it is diced better than I could dice up Fri Chik. It has a tasty broth like Fri Chik, that you could do countless things with, like: make a gravy, add it to your recipe or save it in a jar for another recipe. I highly recommend Diced Chik.
