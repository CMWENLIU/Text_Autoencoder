I have been using xylitol (natural sugar from birch trees) for about a year.  Other brands were about 75% as sweet as cane sugar, but this brand is perfectly matched, teaspoon for teaspoon.  Without the blood sugar spikes as when using regular sugar, I can't imagine ever going back.  There is simply no downside whatsoever.  Highly recommend this product.
