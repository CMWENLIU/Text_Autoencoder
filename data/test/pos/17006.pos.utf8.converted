After going through the sample pack of K-Cups that came with my coffee maker and a second sample pack, Caribou has become my favorite.  It's funny, but the first cup I had I was really excited (maybe the caffiene).  There were no odd flavors that stuck out to me; which is my main complaint with most coffee.  To me, many coffees have good flavor(s), but they also have an extra twang or something that throws it off.  Caribou just tastes like good coffee without any distracting tastes.
