This is a great product, very tasty and at the same time having all kinds of good natural nutrients. I buy it on "Subscribe and Save" program, getting 5 lb. every six months and enjoying sizeable discounts. It makes up a part of my regular lunch consisting of an apple, a banana, and a mixture of sunflower, pumpkin, and hemp seeds (1/4 of cup each). The apple a day definitely keeps a doctor away (to my delight), and the seeds provide a close to perfect combination of "right" protein and fatty acids. Pumpkin seeds also keep my prostate healthy, which is important in my age. Hemp seeds give the mixture the additional taste and flavor.
