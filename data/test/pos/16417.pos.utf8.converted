We cooked our rice with this wonderful tea and they came out a great hit. Saute some cumin seeds in olive oil, brew 2 cups of Dilmah Moroccan Mint green tea, take 1 cup of Basmati rice and add the same into tea and cumin seeds. Add salt to taste and let it simmer on low heat. The rice should be cooked in 10 minutes or  when the water evaporates. You will have a wonderful tasing and very healthy rice dish with Hint of Mint. This has become a regular feature with our meals and we are going to try such ideas with other Dilmah flavors also.
