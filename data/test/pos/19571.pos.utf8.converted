Fantastic stuff!  I recently had a heart attack and had to make a drastic change in the way I eat.  Couscous was one of the "preferred" items listed on my new menu.  I went on line and found a receipe for Aztec Couscous and it was the hit of the dinner table.  I am so impressed with this product that I ordered a whole case (4 packs of 4 :-})
