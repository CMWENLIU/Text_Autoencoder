I have purchased these smoked oysters from the store several times and intend to purchase them now via Amazon in mass by shipment.  I've found nothing what-so-ever wrong with them.  In fact, they're great.  The fact that they are from China doesn't bother me any more than when I purchase corned beef from South American countries or beer from Germany.  If the product is good, it's good.
