I used to spend a lot for great liquor for my mixed drinks, and use whatever mixers were on sale at the grocery store.  Now that I've tried Fever-Tree, I see that great mixers are just as important as great liquors in a mixed drink (depending on how strong you make the drink, the mixer may be MORE important!)  Trust me, once you try Fever-Tree you will never go back to plain old mixers again!
