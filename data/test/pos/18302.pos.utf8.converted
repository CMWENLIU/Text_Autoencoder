... is the incredible price discrepancy for allspice on amazon, from this offering of a whole pound for $5.95 (plus $7.50 shipping) to a typical 1.5 ounce jar for $15.96! That discrepancy exists in the real-world markets of most cities also; allspice from an Indian or Caribbean specialty store will cost a fraction of what you'd pay in a 'gringo' supermarket. There may be some subtle grades of quality in allspice berries, and certainly freshness has to be considered, but freshness can hardly be guaranteed when you're shopping on-line, no more for the expensive than for the cheap product.<br /><br />Allspice powder loses its potency very quickly. A 1.5 ounce jar of the powder would be suitable only for those who know they'll use it up in a couple of weeks max. Obviously a whole pound of allspice berries is orders of magnitude for many home chefs also. Know thyself! At this price, it's worth cultivating a taste for the stuff!<br /><br />Allspice is the berry of a shrub, Pimenta dioica, a kind of myrtle. The berries look a lot like peppercorns but have a very different flavor. The shrub seems to have originated in the Caribbean, and accordingly allspice is a major ingredient in the spice melange of Caribbean cookery, especially Jamaican, included in virtually all barbeque sauces. It's also used generously in some "Middle Eastern" cuisines. Oddly, it's become a dessert spice in parts of Europe, an ingredient in "pumpkin pie" spice-mixes. In Sweden, allspice is associated with pork and veal; it's an essential spice in Swedish meatballs. Commercial sausage-makers in Scandinavia and Germany normally use lots of allspice in their higher-quality sausages.<br /><br />You can pound the berries easily enough in a mortar, but the simplest thing is to have a plain 'dedicated' pepper-grinder filled with allspice berries near your stove. One grinder for black pepper, one for cardamom, and one for allspice. Good to go!
