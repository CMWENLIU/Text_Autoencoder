I have been using this product for over a year. I was scheduled for hip replacement surgery. I use 2 tsp of the Geletin in a hot drink twice per day plus Osteo Bi Flex. My pain is gone and so glad I did not need the hip replacement with all the problems with the replacement. I felt it was worth a try. This helps all joints. I think I will take it forever.
