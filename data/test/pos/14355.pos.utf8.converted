This product was recommended by my sister's OBGYN.  She found that these berries helped relieve her heat flashes and night sweats as going through "the change".  I began taking a handful of these each morning over a year ago.  Since then I have had only a few minor heat flashes, have had rare instances of waking at 4 AM as was usual, and less mood swings.  Being an elementary teacher I am exposed to many germs. As a benefit of taking these I have noticed that I jump back more quickly when sick, and am not sick as often.  The dry bitter taste doesn't bother me as I take them while eating breakfast.  My sister mixes them with craisins and other dried fruits.  Several friends have also seen the benefits of these berries.
