My wife convinced me to stop using cooking oils and butter and try extra virgin coconut oil.  After much reluctance, I did and am so happy that she convinced me to do it.<br /><br />Coconut oil is an excellent substitute for butter when pan frying or sauteing.  I've replaced butter in recipes with great success as well.<br /><br />This product has great flavor, but does not overpower as one would expect.  If you need to lower your cholesterol, this is the way to go!!
