This is the perfect combination of chewy/gummy combined with a "peppy" soft core.  It is really quite hard to explain; but just trust me, go buy one some day and you'll understand what I mean.<br /><br />My candy arrived promptly and securely (shrink-wrapped).  Absolutely nothing to complain about.<br /><br />As a note, if you tried a Kazoozle at one of the big chain movie theaters...do yourself a big favor and buy *these* "large" versions instead; they are soooo much better!  That is, the "8-pack" they sell you at the movie concession stand is really a rip-off in my opinion because the size of each stick is seriously only 1/3 the thickness/volume as one of these "full-size" Kazoozles that are sold at Amazon.  I point this out because the skinny "movie theater version" has little to no zippy core; instead the vast majority of the product is the red licorice exterior.  Don't get me wrong, the red exterior is great...it's just that the candy doesn't show it's true colors unless it is in the proper proportion as it is here at Amazon.<br /><br />Finally, the cost of the item here at Amazon is actually a better deal than what you would pay at a gas station or a supermarket (if you could even find them).  They are actually about 25%-40% cheaper when you buy in bulk at Amazon.<br /><br />And as a final point, I must say that these "Cherry Punch" versions are WAY better than the other flavor that has the crystal sugar on the outside of the licorice exterior.  Truly though, the other flavors of Kazoozles don't even hold a candle to Cherry Punch!
