It's not easy eating a whole grain snack these days.  Most whole wheat products are not as healthy as they same.  Many contain saturated fats or corn syrup.  Those marketed as whole wheat often are 50.1% whole wheat, 49.9% white and they are within the law, thanks to food industry lobbying.  Truly 100% whole wheat snacks that taste great are a rarity.  This is one of them.  I'm not just a healthy snack addict, I'm also a doctor.....this is good as long as you don't have an issue with sodium.
