My Ortiz tuna came in perfect condition.  I'm wondering what happened to the previous reviewer's order---delivery truck must've run over the cans of tuna or something haha.  In any case, Ortiz tuna is simply the best canned tuna out there and this is just the right size for me.  I wake up most mornings craving for Ortiz tuna for breakfast.  I just wish this size was available in the subscribe and save option.
