Originally purchased these at Costco, and proceeded to wolf down the entire Costco-sized bulk-box in under two weeks. Made a special trip back to Costco to resupply, and whap-whaa it was a Roadshow. Looked everywhere Whole Foods, Ralph's, Gelson's, ALbertson's, Henry's the list goes on... As usual Amazon has it all! I you had to imagine the perfect fruit snack, this is it!<br />Please note: you don't need offspring to enjoy them, thanks.
