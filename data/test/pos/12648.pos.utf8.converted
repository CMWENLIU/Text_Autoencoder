I'm hooked on this stuff!<br /><br />I keep some ground in the fridge alongside the whole seed... dump it on any kind of cereal for a fiber/omega infusion.<br /><br />I've added it to so many recipes, from banana bread to mac n'cheese, you'd think I was nuts!<br /><br />As it turns out, I find the addition to be mild/complementary enough that you can get away adding flax to so many things.<br />Salad or cereal are obvious choices but it is a pleasant mellow addition to pasta sauces, mac n'cheese, cookie recipes, you name it.<br /><br />And it works!<br /><br />My buddy didn't believe me until he added it to his morning oats...  he had been having some intestinal issues, let's just say, and now he's as regular as an atomic clock haha.<br /><br />Sort of showing off, I took a handful of seed and popped 'em in my mouth, and started munching away. I thought I might regret it but they were great! Easily satisfy any craving for a nutty snack and there's something satisfying about grinding the seed in your mouth... I know, I can be extreme. But these are just so PLEASANT.<br /><br />And you get a whole lot for cheap... try Prime and Subscribe and Save (you can always cancel) and you get a lot for a little.<br /><br />I was going to give some away as gifts but they kind of make you want to horde them.<br /><br />Easiest fiber infusion ever.<br /><br />Have fun.
