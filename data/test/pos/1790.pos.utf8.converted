This is for serious HP sauce addicts. I admit, I'm one of them, and this is overpowering for a bachelor. I can plow through half a bottle of the regular HP sauce with fish and chips or a burger or any meat/fish/potato product. However, this is a different animal altogether.<br /><br />When I fill up smaller HP sauce bottles to make it more manageable with this big boy, the big bottle haunts me and stalks me as if to say "Nick, you need to consume me." Have you ever had what you thought was the greatest thing ever and then get a ginormous amount of it? It's *that* intimdating. No single man should ever think about condiments in terms of pounds, let alone double digit pounds. But this is an amazing value, and you can never have too much of a good thing. HP Sauce is like dating a super model: no matter what size you get, it's still a super model.<br /><br />It'll take forever, but I'll consume all of this HP sauce. I will be the Morgan Spurlock of HP sauce.<br /><br />The only downside is that you really need to get one of those pumps for the HP sauce due to the viscosity of the sauce. Viscosity = good.
