I have two senior dogs that were on a raw natural food diet for many years.  I had been hard pressed to find something that would fulfill my pets nutritional requirements while being comprised of healthy ingredients.  This is it!  Even my vet, a fierce advocate for raw food, approves of this.  My dogs love it, I no longer have to mix my own ingredients together, and I have peace of mind knowing my beloved pets are being fed high-quality food.  They devour every last particle!
