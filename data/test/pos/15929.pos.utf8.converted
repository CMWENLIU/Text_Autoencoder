I love stevia and was looking for a little something to add some different flavors to my coffee. This stuff smells fantastic! It is great in my coffee, but I discovered an even better use for it. I slice up a granny smith apple and put just a few drops on the slices and stir them around a little. It tastes just like a caramel apple! I was surprised how good it tasted on top of food like that as I've only tried it in liquids. If you put too much it will be bitter and not good. Three drops is plenty. I'd imagine anything that is good with caramel or toffee would be great with this. Stevia makes it easy to cut white sugar completely out of your diet and not feel deprived at all. Great product!
