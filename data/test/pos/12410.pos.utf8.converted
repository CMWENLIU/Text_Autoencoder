In Comprison to Maruchan Ramen, Nissin's Top Ramen tastes like crap. My favorite flavor is the beef and then oriental. The Chicken flavor is more popular for kids because its hardely spicey at all when the others have a slight zing to it like medium salsa. When i cook it i like to drain out practically all the water before adding the flavor powder to make the taste stronger and i don't eat it like soup, more like a pasta dish.
