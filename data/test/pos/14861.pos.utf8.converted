I love this water!  I was offered it on Amazon Vine program but have already received 4 more subscribe-and-save cases!<br /><br />It is always good to know a little about the reviewer and so I should say most people would consider me a nutrition nut and a water connoisseur.  I have spent thousands of dollars on equipment to improve my whole-house water, shower water, tap water, and drinking water.  I do not drink soda more than twice a YEAR and coffee not more than once a DECADE!  I drink water as my beverage of choice and have tried every water carried by my healthfood stores.  Other than my personally treated tap water, I have preferred a couple brands of spring water bottled in glass.  I was happy to see that Essentia is in BPA and Phthalate free recyclable bottles.<br /><br />My diet is the best money can buy and I naturally maintain an 85% alkaline-forming diet with my food selection.  When I agreed to receive this Essentia water on the Vine program, my plans were to drink a couple of bottles to review and save the remainder for emergency situations such as what happened only months ago in San Diego when our county lost electricity and the water became questionable to drink with the water treatment plant not operating without electricity.  However, after my first bottle of water, I desire no other drinking water, and have subscribed to 4 cases which I have already received from Amazon.  BTW, they arrived each in their own box each weighing a little over 30 pounds.<br /><br />Why did I switch to Essentia?  Just like the manufacturer says "Try it for the taste.  Buy it for the benefits", it tastes great!  My diet/water choice criteria is not what tastes best with some health-benefit but rather what is most health beneficial that also isn't unpleasant to drink/eat.  Although my diet/water has been optimum for most of my life, I am going through hormonal changes because I am "of that age" uh-um.  I started having severe hot flashes that wake me up at night and cause me to strip down naked and cold shower during the day.  I tried all the remedies known that are helpful without side effects.  No relief for me!  I was surprised beyond description when the Essentia water resolved my hot flashes!  It feels very cooling and soothing going down and as long as I keep that cool smooth feeling inside, I have merely mild flashes and those only occasionally. I am so thankful to Essentia!  Drinking the water I had on hand that I thought was optimal had not helped the hot flashes at all even when treated to supposedly be alkaline.  So I do not know exactly what it is about Essentia that is working for me as I have not scientifically experimented with it to see if it is one of the ingredients or what.<br /><br />Thank you Essentia for resolving my hot flashes which were really wearing me out!<br /><br />Although Essentia water is a little more expensive to buy it on Amazon, I decided to purchase here.  My local Whole Foods offers 20% off cases and my local Jimbo's offers 10% off cases and I have not asked Henry's, Sprouts, or other grocers what their discounts are; so it would actually be a little cheaper for me to buy it locally but then I have to carry it to the car and from the car to my home and it is much nicer for me to pay a little extra and have it delivered by UPS so I do not have to move the bottles by the 30pound case but only by a bottle or two at a time.  Also, Essentia gives healthcare professionals, such as myself, 30% off but require a 10 case minimum purchase and I do not want to store 10 cases at a time as in California as space is at a premium and in high demand.  4 cases is optimal for me and I am willing to pay a little extra to not have to carry it myself.<br /><br />Thank you Essentia and Amazon!  You make my life better!<br /><br />UPDATE:  Sprouts sells this for $1.89 for each 1.5liter with 10% discount for a case - no sales tax.  If you don't have great spring water locally (google findaspring), I prefer this bottled water to everything else at Sprouts and most local grocers.
