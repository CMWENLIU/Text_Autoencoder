If you're used to paying the price for "Albacore Tuna" thinking you're getting the best tasting tuna out there, think again! This "Natural Value" brand tuna is high quality chunk tuna just like the fancy albacore brands (except the price) and tastes GREAT! At only $1.71 per can it is an AMAZING VALUE! Also, tongol tuna is naturally lower in MERCURY than other tunas, like albacore. You'll be sold on this brand if you try it! (FYI: The HIGHEST mercury levels are found in SUSHI grade tuna!)
