I bought this product as a gift for my brother. It was delivered about 5 days later and he was amazed at the size of the gummy bear! It was chewy, but tasted better then regular mini gummy bears. It has now been almost a month since I bought him the gummy bear and there is still 3/4 left. It is also still as fresh as the day it arrived (zip lock bag). I just recently bought the smaller version for my nephew therefore, I would definitely recommend this product.
