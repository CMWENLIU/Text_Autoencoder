Ever since I tried coffee in a Turkish restaurant, I have been trying to replicate it at home. It is stronger than espresso, but without the bitterness. I tried getting the finest grind at the store, but I was still getting a bitter coffee, with little froth. Then, a friend recommended this one.<br /><br />The coffee is amazing! It starts out with a light colored froth that eventually turns to a darker colour, and the taste is just like I remember. If you want to get authentic Turkish coffee, this is the stuff to buy! Don't waste your time trying to grind it at the store - it won't be the same. The only alternative is to get a burr mill, and grind it yourself. Unfortunately, I don't have time for that.<br /><br />How I make it: Take cold filtered water, and use coffee cups to measure out water into the cezve. Then, add 1 level teaspoon of sugar for each coffee cup. Finally, add 1 heaping teaspoon of coffee for each cup. Set on a light-medium flame, and start stirring. Stir until you can't feel any resistance with the spoon (about 2 minutes), which means that the grounds are completely suspended, and sugar is dissolved. Froth will now be on the surface. As the coffee heats up, the froth will start to rise around the edges. Wait until the portion of the froth that has risen is about 1/3 to 1/2 of the total area - this is the most critical time point! Immediately take the cezve off the flame, and pour a little into each cup so that there is equal amount of froth. At this point, you can either split the coffee between the cups, or thoroughly stir it, and put it on the flame again until the froth starts to rise. The latter will give additional flavour, but will add some bitterness.<br /><br />Edit: Still using this stuff, and still have not found a better alternative. Most crucial point about preparation: DO NOT ALLOW THE COFFEE TO BOIL!!! Rising froth = good! Large bubbles coming up through the froth = BAD! Ideally, take the cezve off the flame just before any large bubble appears, and you will not have bitterness.
