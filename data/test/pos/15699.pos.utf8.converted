I just wish this was still in stock! The water came (free shipping) in a shrink wrapped carton.  I pulled out several for survival tests with my grandkids; the upside of the blox packaging is they are stackable, and of a size that one (as compared to several bagged waters) actually holds enough water to drink or use for rehydrating. Because of the cardboard outer and mylar inner, they are almost indestructable.  They also survive freezing very well; once thawed, no leakage.
