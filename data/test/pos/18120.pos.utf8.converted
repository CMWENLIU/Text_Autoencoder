Saw this on Dr Oz then started researching. Amazing superfood high in all the B Vits & C AND 16% protein. try Googling it. About this product, signed up for Subscribe and Save. Very good, plumper than when I purchased at local HFS. Sort of like a tart raisin in size, but with a little of a grit (seeds)like figs. The also have a property the thst seems to satisfy sugar cravings for a while. The fellows in the house (weight trainers w an eye on health) first turned up there noses due to tart suprising flavor. Now they are disappearing, only one 6 pack left out of my supersave delivery of 4  six packs!  Well I want my family to be healthy so better increase the frequency or number of bags!!!
