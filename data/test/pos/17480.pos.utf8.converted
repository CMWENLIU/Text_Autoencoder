I'm a long time low carber, and have written 8 low carb cookbooks (The latest is<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592334148">1001 Low-Carb Recipes: Hundreds of Delicious Recipes from Dinner to Dessert That Let You Live Your Low-Carb Lifestyle and Never Look Back</a>)  I've tried a *lot* of sugar-free chocolate.  This Valor 70% dark sugar free is, hands-down, my favorite.  No comparison.  Guylian's sugar free dark is wonderful, and Dove's sugar free stuff is quite nice.  I even like the sugar-free Reese's peanut butter cups.  But the Valor?  Man.  Just the best.  If you're sugar-free and craving chocolate, you've got to try this.
