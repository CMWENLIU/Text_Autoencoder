I have been on  Atkins for 5 weeks and lost 14 lbs.  This mix is a wonderful substitute for the real thing. I use an "oil free spray"  and add a little seltzer water to the mix to get lighter thinner pancakes ( I also use two egg whites instead of one egg.) They brown up beautifully and taste great. I sometimes will take them from the pan an microwave them for 20 seconds to get a little better texture, but all in all they are my saving grace to stay "legal!"
