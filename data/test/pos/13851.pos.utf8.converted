Very creamy. I can see making a cream paste out of this. Takes some tact to absorb into coffee but waiting allows it to blend. Used in some hot chocolate made with powdered skim milk which made it nice and creamy. I bought it mainly to experiment with and have cream around without having to run to the store.
