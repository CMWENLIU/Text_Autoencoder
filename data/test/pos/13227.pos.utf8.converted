Versatile says it all - I have yet to use it for a pancake mix - however, have used the mix to make southern style cornbread (my southern born husband loved it!).  One of the best ways I have used it was to make fried chicken tenders by making a batter with the mix then roll the battered chicken tenders in the dry mix and fry in a deep fryer - another big hit with my southern husband - and use honey mustard as a dip for the cooked chicken tenders.  Check out Pamela's website for several recipes for the mix.  For gluten intolerant folks - this products is heaven sent.
