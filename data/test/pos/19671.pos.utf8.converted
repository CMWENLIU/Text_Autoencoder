I drink a lot of tea, always loose, always as high a quality as I can get.<br />This stuff is quite flavorful, I'd actually say that it is the most robust English Breakfast I've ever had.<br />The package is sealed, maybe they updated their packaging lately, but it arrived an an air-tight one pound bag.<br />It is strong and tasty. Which is what I want in a breakfast tea.
