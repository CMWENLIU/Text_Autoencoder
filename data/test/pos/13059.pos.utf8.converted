*****<br />This is a yummy and unique tea. It's sort of creamy (the real vanilla is a luscious taste), but not spicy like chai. It is absolutely perfect and I'm drinking it all the time because the taste is beyond belief, plus there is no caffeine!<br /><br />Indian Night is certified organic and contains fair trade certified organic Fatrikcherra Estate black tea, and organic vanilla beans---that's all---and oh, what an incredible combination! There are no oils or natural flavorings used at all, unlike many flavored teas, and thus no funny aftertaste.  It is also kosher. This tea is sustainable in that all packaging materials are biodegradable and recyclable, the carton is made of 100% post-consumer waste, and cello wrap is not used.  Numi says that all their tea bags "are made of natural fiber paper, not the trendy, "silky" see-though nylon tea bags". The reason it is called "full leaf" is that Numi black teas do not contain tea dust or fannings, which tend to make tea taste bitter; instead, they contain the full leaf, expanding when they are brewed, "releasing a robust and long lasting experience".<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Inspired by an ancient Aztec culinary secret, Numi has chosen aromatic whole vanilla beans to blend with premium organic black tea. The tea grows in northern India on a bio-dynamic and Fair Trade garden surrounded by beautiful tropical forests. It is decaffeinated by a revolutionary organic CO2 process, called 'Effervescence', the only chemical-free method that does not extract flavor or health properties. As Indian Night steeps a vibrant bronzy hue, its seductive fragrance, flowery yet familiar, flirts with your senses. Magnificently smooth, exotic vanilla harmonizes with black tea for a creamy, rich and satisfying cup." This is a new (as of 2007) tea for Numi, and this description romantically describes the tea experience, and doesn't oversell it at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****
