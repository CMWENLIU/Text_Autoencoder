I bought this to use on my hair, because I had heard it does wonders and it was only about $7, so why not try it? My hair is curly, and naturally dry and delicate. I've dyed and flat ironed it too many times, so it was pretty damaged and breaking off. I'm getting married in 8 months and really wanted to get my hair healthy again!<br /><br />I have used this as a deep conditioner, by wetting my hair and applying a liberal amount of the oil all over my head, concentrating on the ends. I then put on a plastic shower cap and let it sit for at least 2 hours. When you shampoo, make sure you use a clarifying shampoo and wash it at least twice to get all the oil out. It leaves my hair so silky and hydrated! And it's not like some deep conditioners out there that only give you results the first day and after that your hair is dry again--this stuff really works!<br /><br />I also use it as a leave in conditioner in my hair, especially when I'm wearing my hair curly (I let it air dry). I have also used it as a styling product (for shine or pomade) and plus it conditions your hair all day. Works great! My hair is so infinitely healthier in only a month!<br /><br />The oil is kind of a solid, but as long as you keep it in a warm room you're fine. Rub it between your hands for about 2 seconds and it is liquid again. Not a problem at all. It smells great, kind of nutty, I love it. Best "hair" product I have ever found, and I've tried many.
