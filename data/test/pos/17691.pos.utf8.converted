Love the GoPicnic ready-to-eat meals.  Most days, I find myself running from back-to-back meetings and don't have time to stop for lunch.  These store conveniently in my desk - I just grab and snack away - no waiting in line for the microwave. It has 12g protein, 2g fiber, and 290 calories. On the down side, it is high in sodium....890mg - 37% daily allowance!  Expiration date was June 2011.  Meal was tasty and I would buy again.
