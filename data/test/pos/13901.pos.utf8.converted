I really like the Nuun tablets. They are not as sweet as others and they have a little fizz, not too much, but enough to give it a little zip and keep it from being too sweet. The orange is my favorite flavor. They dissolve easily and provide the optimum electrolytes needed to sustain me on long rides. I wil use 1 to 1.5 (they are scored and you can break them in half) in a 24 ounce water bottle and it works out great. They have recently come out with some new flazors so I will be trying more.
