I've been buying these mints regularly for the last year or so. They're really nice to have in general, especially when I'm studying or at work. They have one of the best winterfrost (sweeter than peppermint with less mint overkill) flavor of all the mints I've ever tried. It's not an overwhelming amount of mint flavor; it's just right. The mints are easy to chew if you choose to (I definitely do), they're a bit soft so it won't hurt your teeth if you like to chew your mints instead of just licking them. Since I can easily pop a mint every few minutes, it's a good thing each tin has a whopping 50 mints inside.<br /><br />The tin is really cool, this product's only flaw is that it is a metal tin filled with mints so it will make a bit of clanking noise if you're not careful. Not too good if you're at the library or in class. Just be slow with handling the tin and most of the noise can be eliminated. That's basically the ONLY flaw here, in my opinion.<br /><br />I try to buy these mints at Target (usually about 2 tins for $2.49 in the candy isle) or at Walmart (1 tin for like $1.29). I haven't ever seen a bulk package at Sam's Club, but Sam's does carry Eclipse gum and other Wrigley's products in bulk. I'll probably order from Amazon and see how the order goes, since 16 tins for like $20 is a pretty good deal by comparison. This product is really inexpensive so I suggest you try it!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Tastes great<br />-Breath freshener<br />-No sugar (not much of anything really, nutrition facts show 0's down the line)<br />-Chewable or lickable<br />-Cool tin<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Tin can be a little loud at times if you're not careful<br />-One mint won't noticeably cover up your breath, I suggest two mints at once for that (i.e. the mint flavor is not overwhelming per mint)<br /><br />Enjoy!
