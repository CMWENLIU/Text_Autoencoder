Foremost: ~99% soluble fiber is great for you.<br /><br />These noodles will-not get soft. I would not recommend for marinara sauce of any type. These noodles are made for stir fry type dishes. I did not feel they were rubbery at all. Make sure you blanch (toss in boiling water for a few minutes) before eating them.<br /><br />Overall, just ordered more. Taste? There is none to the noodles themselves; though they don't smell nicely right out of the bag ( you are supposed to rinse then blanch).<br /><br />Anyone who has the need to be 'full' and wants to 'diet' or just wants more fiber in your diet easily... GET THESE!
