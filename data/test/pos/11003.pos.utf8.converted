plant arrived very much on time. packaged very well.  no damage. and it stil looks great almost a month later. lots of new growth.  looks exactly like the picture, maybe even a little better.<br /><br />UPDATE>>>>2 years later. I have managed to throw everything possible at this poor little plant in an inadvertent attempt to kill it. It dropped ALL of the leaves about a year ago (due to under or over watering) but has bounced back nicely. Still hanging in there even if it isn't quite as nice as it was.<br /><br />UPDATE  1/3/11>>>> this thing is still alive and kickin. it never fully recovered from the earlier abuse, but oh well.
