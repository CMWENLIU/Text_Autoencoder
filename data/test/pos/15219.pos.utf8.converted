This is a good snack to carry in a purse for when I need a quick snack.  It is high protein and low sugar which is good for my diabetes requirements.  Also it is easy to eat because of its small size.  I like the zip lock bag so that I can eat two or three and close up the bag.  I am always looking for quick and easy snacks for my diet requirements.  This hits the target and also hits the taste spot, too!
