I love Dreamfields products. I am someone who has trouble with higher glycemic foods like pasta so I tried Dreamfields on a whim and it is great. I love the flavor-just like regular pasta and there isn't that horrible uncomfortable feeling after eating regular pasta. I'll never go back to regular pasta again. My local supermarket only carries the lasagna and rigatoni noodles so I'm buying the elbows here online. 5/5 stars.
