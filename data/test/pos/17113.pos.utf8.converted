Folger's scores another coup with their awesome Cinnamon Swirl ground coffee. The taste is delicious. It keeps a long time in your kitchen cabinet or your freezer, too. If you do choose to keep it in your freezer, however, remember to let it thaw out a few hours before using.<br /><br />The canisters are very well constructed to keep the ground coffee fresh and the safety seal on the top of each unused canister gives you peace of mind. The packaging overall is excellent.<br /><br />But of course it's the coffee that we're really interested in here. The freshness of that distinct Cinnamon flavor strikes your taste buds and makes you really, REALLY want that second cup of coffee. It's a delicious way to wake up in the morning; and of course it's good at any time of the day or night as well.<br /><br />Obviously, coffee contains caffeine. If you are sensitive to caffeine in any way you might prefer to drink decaffeinated coffee instead of this product. If you have any questions at all about your specific medical situation consult your doctor.<br /><br />Overall, however, this is one great Cinnamon coffee. If you love Cinnamon flavored coffee you can't go wrong with the Folger's brand. If you like your coffee even a bit sweeter you can always add sugar or any sugar substitute.
