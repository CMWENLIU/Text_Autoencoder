The Muir Glen line of fire roasted tomatoes are the highest quality domestic canned tomatoes you will find. The flesh is deep red and flavorful and the Smokey notes from the fire roasting are incredible! I use the diced tomatoes for everything, but the homemade salsa we make with them is to die for, actually better than what we make with our own home grown tomatoes. Very highly recommended.<br /><br />Homemade Roasted Salsa<br /><br />3-cans Muir Glen Organic Diced Tomatoes, Fire Roasted<br />2-cups Roland diced roasted red peppers (drained)<br />Roland Roasted Red Peppers, Diced, 27.5-Ounce Can (Pack of 5)<br />1-large sweet onion diced<br />5-cloves chopped garlic<br />1-teaspoon cumin<br />1-teaspoon chili powder<br />2-tablespoons Empacadora San Marcos Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H27MYI">Empacadora San Marcos Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce, 11-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />Use a stick (or other) blender to puree the Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce (these things have wonderful flavor, but are very hot. They are what will be providing the heat in your salsa so adjust according to your taste). Mix everything together in a sealed container and set in the fridge overnight so the flavors can marry.
