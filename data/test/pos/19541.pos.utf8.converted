A co-worker introduced me to this wonderful tea and I am hooked.  Let me see if I can describe it.  I like Chai Tea, but sometimes the "smokiness" of the chai can be overwhelming to me.  This tea combines the lovely sweetness of coconut with the dark rich quality of the chai.  The aroma is a treat as well.  Everyone I have made this for LOVES this tea.  When I brew this tea, I am able to use one tea bag for 2-3 cups of hot water and it still is flavorable.  I drink it with a small amount of cream and one artificial sweetner, but many of my friends like it without any sweetner at all.  I highly recommend this tea.
