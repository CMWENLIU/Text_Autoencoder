I've purchased the Farmers Organic canned Pumpkin the last few years from our coop & paid up to $32.00 per case.  I purchased the pumpkin from Amazon for $12 per case, wow was this a great deal!  We use the pumpkin to make the most wonderful pumpkin cupcakes with cream cheese icing & we also feed it to our boxers on a regular basis.<br /><br />I ordered 6 cases & they were delivered perfect, no dents at all.  Boy was I happy after reading all of the reviews of others that had a bad experience.  The price has jumped to $16 per case since last Friday so I will wait until the price goes back down again before I order more.<br /><br />I thought I would share my recipe since I mentioned it &lt;smile><br /><br />Pumpkin Cupcakes<br /><br />Pumpkin cupcake recipe with optional cream cheese frosting.<br />INGREDIENTS:<br />2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, or your favorite flour<br />1 tablespoon baking powder<br />1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br />1/2 teaspoon salt<br />3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br />1/2 teaspoon ground ginger<br />1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br />1/2 cup butter, softened<br />1 1/3 cups sugar<br />2 eggs, beaten until frothy<br />1 cup mashed cooked or canned pumpkin<br />3/4 cup milk<br />3/4 cup chopped walnuts or pecans<br />PREPARATION:<br />Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg into a bowl.
