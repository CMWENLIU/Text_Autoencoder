We not only loved this mix as a pizza crust, but it has become our favorite gf dough for other recipes.  We cut the dough for donuts and fried them, then coated them with powdered sugar or cinnamon- best ever!  And the dough fried and then salted with mustard was the perfect replacement for my mall pretzels.  With garlic and butter, these were the best breadsticks.  I subscribed to 2 cases per month!
