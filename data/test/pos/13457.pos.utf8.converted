I have a zojirushi rice cooker that has a GABA (sprouted rice) setting. It was not easy to find sprouted rice, but recently found it at Whole Foods in Portland Oregon. I would recommend that you try a single pack before buying the 6-pack on Amazon, since it tastes alot different than regular brown rice. I love it and it is a lot easier to digest than regular rice. TruRoots has a very good, fresh product. I get their huge bag of quionoa at Costco and wish they would sell a big bag of their GABA rice as well. You can't go wrong with any of their products and absolutely love this one too!!!
