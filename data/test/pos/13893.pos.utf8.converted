You have no idea. I've researched cheese powders for 7 years (all provoked when the original Kraft Grated Cheddar was pulled from production and rocked my world). This newer version is not QUITE as pure as their grated cheddar was (that was a gold can, and it was borderline-illegally heaven), but this one is close.  It's certainly better than any of the myriads of powders that "claim" to be cheese (which are predominantly fillers, sodium, food coloring, anti-caking agents and preservatives...and taste like it). If you're looking for the best tasting cheese powder out there, this is it. It's great on popcorn!
