Since moving to the US from England, there are a couple of food items that I truly miss..  one of those is good English Cheddar Cheese.  I have tried many cheddars from the supermarkets but nothing comes close since I prefer a sharp taste.  Some cheeses are supposedly English but you find they are made in the US.<br /><br />Recently I ordered this particular cheese from igourmet (their website is exceptional btw). The items are shipped in special containers with ice packs to keep the temperature low.  This particular cheese is covered in some food wax so when you peal it aware, you receive a very fresh looking cheese.  The taste of this cheese is outstanding and a very nice sharp cheddar.  Highly recommended.
