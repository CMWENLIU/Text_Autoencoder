I just got this stuff in the mail for my birthday. I know, an odd Bday gift, but I love this kind of fare. First thing is, shake it up really well or even stir it before you pour it because all of the oil builds up at the top and you wont get the full effect if you don't thoroughly mix it. Let me say that I am a heat eating heavyweight, so to say. I knew this stuff was going to be HOT. I reminded myself to be wise about the amount I used. I normally carry cayenne pepper in my purse as a personal condiment and I use a stockpile of habanaroes every week. Everything I eat is not just spicy, but tongue numbing hot. I will say. I bought two cups of chili and added ONE TEASPOON of Dave's 2009. I thought that would be a good place to start. Wow. Not so bad at first. Spicy, but pleasant. Then it hits the back of your throat and you have to cough. Then your nose is running. Then you are sweating. Then your ears and hair start to burn. It sounds nightmarish, I know. But, I love it and this was totally worth it. This stuff goes a long, long way. In no way should you use this stuff as a dip or drizzle it on top of anything, like your pizza. I believe it is best enjoyed when you combine it in small amounts (or large if you're F-ing crazy) to dishes like soup, pasta sauce, chili, bbq sauce, mashed potatoes, or any blended side dish. I think that is the best way to enjoy this. Anyways, I love it. I don't know if I wanna dropkick Dave in the nuts or give him a bear hug!
