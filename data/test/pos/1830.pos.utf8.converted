I was glad to find this on Amazon after learning that my local wholesale grocer no longer carries it.<br /><br />Not too many people know that gelatin contains both chondroitin and glucosamine, both of which are used widely to relieve arthritis pain. I prefer the whole food, besides which it's cheaper. I start with a mug 3/4 full of bouillon or apple juice, and put in a coffee measure (2 Tablespoons) full of gelatin. It does not need to be stirred as it will slowly absorb the liquid. Then I put a lid on the mug (my lid came from an old candy dish) and place it on a low-wattage candle warmer or mug warmer. In two hours or so I have a hot yummy protein drink ready to stir and enjoy. I do this twice a day so a 1-lb can will last a month or so. I really notice a difference in my pain levels from doing this.<br /><br />Note: make sure the lid fits inside the top edge of the mug.
