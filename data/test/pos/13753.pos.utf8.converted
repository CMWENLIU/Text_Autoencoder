We've had a Francis! Francis! X3 Espresso machine for well over a year now, and have gone through about a thousand ESE pods. We've tried hundreds of Illy, Espressione Arabica, and Espressione Classic pods, but these Lavazza pods are the best so far. The taste is consistently smooth, without the varying levels of bitterness we tasted in the other pods. We ordered 150 Lavazza pods about a month ago and I'm about to put in our next order. This is definitely the fastest we've ever gone through an order of 150 pods.
