Ever since having Vietnamese coffee at a restaurant in St. Louis (and then returning regularly to have Pho and coffee), I have wanted to buy one of these filters to use at home.  The one at the restaurant uses friction to compress the coffee grinds with the insert, so this kind is a bit different in that you actually screw the insert down, but I haven't had any problems with it.<br /><br />To use this properly, make sure to not screw the insert down too tightly - it should be snug, but not tight.  It might take a couple of tries to get this right.  The coffee grounds need to be able to expand a bit.  Once the insert is screwed down, pour a little bit (less than a cm) of water into the filter, and let that drip through.  This allows the grounds to expand.  If you don't do this step, sometimes the grounds actually escape from the filter up into the water chamber.  Not too big of a deal, but the water runs through too quickly when that happens.  After the small amount of water goes through, then fill the filter almost to the top with water, and cover it with the cap.  About 4 minutes should pass before all of the water has gone through.  Then, enjoy!
