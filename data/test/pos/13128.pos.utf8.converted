Rich but smooth taste. Crunchy toffee and nuts. I have a hard time finding Butter Toffee Peanuts in my area and found a plentiful selection on Amazon. I tried the Bergin nuts first and don't need to try any more brands. Bergin has the perfect blend of toffee and I have allready ordered and recieved my second order of six bags. The first one went fast. Kudos to Bergin. Try them, they will grow on you.
