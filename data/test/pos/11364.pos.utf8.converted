I knew when I first tasted fiji water years ago that it was different, better.  I loved the taste or lack of taste.  It felt smooth and moist in my mouth, even after I swallowed it.  I would drink this water forever if I could afford it.  I loved the bottle-asesthetically it is beautiful.  It reminds me of Bora Bora Tahiti, where I have been, not Fiji where I haven't been.  I have heard they are similar though from those who have been to both. (How lucky can you get!)<br /><br />The tap water where I live tastes good, but has too much lime. We bought a faucet filter for this problem. So, I only bought Fiji water when I was out and about, as a special treat.  Just couldn't justify buying it to drink all the time. I could not see buying drinking  water we got from the tap for almost free.<br /><br />Then, I read recently about clinical trials involving Fiji water and the positive affects it has on health<br />That did it for me.  I did my research. I can now justify buying this beautiful water to drink on a regular basis. My son is very happy about this too, as it is his favorite bottled water.  With Fiji water around we notice that we drink less sodas, etc. which is good.<br /><br />The silica in it is what gives it the soft, smooth feel. Turns out silica is also very  good for you. I am hoping it will help my joints and connective tissue (I have osteo arthritis), skin and overall health. There is even proof it might raise the good cholesterol in your body and so many other things.  I am gong to give it a shot at helping me.  I'll do a follow-up later. Google clinical studies on fiji water to get all the facts.<br /><br />The price on Amazon is good.  My first case was delivered with Amazon Prime shipping in two days. I ordered the 16 oz bottles. Almost ordered the 50 oz ounces but just a little too large. I do wish they had the 30+ oz bottles. I did notice the price per oz on the 16oz size is incorrect. My son likes this because UPS or Fed EX delivers it and he doesn' t have to lug it in and out of the car.<br /><br />Here is info I got on the web-site regarding what's in Fiji:<br /><br />What are the natural contents of FIJI Water?<br /><br />FIJI Water contains the following in milligrams (mg) per liter (L):<br /><br />Silica: 91 mg/L<br />Silica is an important trace mineral that may positively benefit bone formation and connective tissue, as well as other salutary benefits .<br /><br />Fluoride: 0.26 mg/L<br />An important element found in FIJI Water is natural fluoride, which helps fight tooth decay.<br /><br />Bicarbonate: 140 mg/L<br />Bicarbonate plays an important role in maintaining our bodies' pH levels.<br /><br />Total dissolved solids: 208 mg/L<br />The term "Total Dissolved Solids" refers to the amount of dissolved minerals found in water.
