My elderly dog has always been a super-picky eater.  She loves this stuff.  It's easy for her to eat (she doesn't have many teeth left) and it looks and smells downright appetizing even to me once it's hydrated.  It also does not appear to aggravate her sensitive digestion - a nice perk for both of us.  I love that unlike canned food, it doesn't have to be refrigerated once you open the package.
