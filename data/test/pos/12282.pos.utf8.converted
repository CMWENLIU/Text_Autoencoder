<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NBQUNW">Benecol Smart Chews, Caramel, 120 Soft Chews</a><br />Product is great! I take 2-chews in the morning & 2-chews after my last meal for the day and for approx. 2-months now. The chews have been working to reduce my high cholesterol and so far they are worth it. Benecol also makes the butter spread, but it is very expensive for one small tub of butter. I recommend the chews because you can have them anytime especially if you have a craving for something sweet. It's like chewing a caramel candy, but remember it is not a candy so do not take/treat the product like one or leave them out in the open especially if you have young kids. Take the chews/dosage as it is recommended by the manufacturer.
