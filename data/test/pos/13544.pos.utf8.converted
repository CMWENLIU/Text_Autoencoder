I just finished my first year of college. And I must have gotten sick 5 times. Vitamin pills always have an unappealing smell and vitamin gummies are pretty expensive. I just bought Vplenish but I'm already addicted. There is no weird-vitamin taste and I actually feel like I'm preventing sickness. I'm bringing all my leftover packets with me to college in the fall. It'll be really easy to mix them into my canteen of water or cranberry juice before classes.
