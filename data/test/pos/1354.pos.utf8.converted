I have been using this mix for about 8 months now. It makes all types of incredibly good breads. I throw in all sorts of things such as nuts, cranberries, raisons, etc for variations. I have added ground almonds or peanuts for a hearty filling bread. I have purchased and tried about 20 other mixes and many were inedible so it was such a treat to find this mix. I set my bread maker for just plain white bread. I do not use the gluten free setting since the white bread setting gives me the best bread.
