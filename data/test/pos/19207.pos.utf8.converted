I ordered this shortly after getting my Keurig. It was the first bulk order of K-Cups I had placed, and I am very pleased with the results! True to their word, there were 35 completely different selections. I put them all on my K-Cup Carousel.<br /><br />When I wake up I generally am too dead to the world to peruse a wide selection, so I generally stick with the store bought boxes of one of my favorites for that, but this selection has been a conversation piece and source of much joy when I have company over. Lots of "ooohs" and "hmmms." The only downside is that I am going to have to start cutting off/charging my friends!! I just ordered the 50 pack Sampler and I'm almost giddy about it.
