We switched over to these after seeking out some natural treats.  We were growing tired of the poor quality of ingredients in mainstream products.  Our dogs took to these treats immediately.  We started with Turkey and Taterz and have also given them the Chicken and Cherries.  The mini bakes are bite sized, so they are great for training.  If you have a smaller dog, the treats have a mild indentation so they can be split in half.
