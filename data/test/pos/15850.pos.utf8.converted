After the popularity of the Slim Jim waned in the years following revelations that the alleged "macho" of its celebrity endorser was merely spray-on tan, we endured a series of tasteless and unsnappable tinkerings to the original recipe.<br /><br />Sadly, by the early days of this century, the original recipie had been lost. Even a team of scientists hired to reconstruct the glory of Slim Jims past failed in their efforts. We feared we would never see the likes of the "skinny james" of our youth.<br /><br />Happily, a warehouse cellar of the original was located near Hoboken, NJ. How the store had gone missing more than 30 years ago is not known. But, like fine wine, these Slim Jims have only improved with age. Get yours before they're gone!
