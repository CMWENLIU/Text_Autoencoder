This bread is soft and flavorful. Full of raisins and candied orange peel the bread is similar to raisin bread with an orange flavor. It is really good and is more of a breakfast or dessert bread as opposed to a fruit cake or something like that. Bread is light and fluffy and moist. It is really good so I recommend it without hesitation. The family has gone through 3 this holiday season alone!
