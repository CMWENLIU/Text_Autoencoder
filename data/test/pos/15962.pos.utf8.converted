Okay, so they aren't as chewy as the wheat version of a ginger molasses cookie.  They don't quite *snap* like the wheat version of ginger snaps.  Like a lot of gluten-free cookies, they're more crumbly than chewy.  On the other hand, they do give a good kick of that ginger taste I have missed since I have began avoiding wheat years ago.  I also like that these don't have corn in the ingredients list- just rice and tapioca for flour.  So many of the GF alternatives use corn flour, which might work for Celiacs but doesn't always work for those of us who have intolerances that include corn.  I am pretty keen on the idea that I could pulverize these in the food processor and use them for a graham cracker crust.  I think they'd be phenomenal in a trifle or as a pressed crumb layer of a layered cookie.  I've been pretty happy with the Pamela's line of GF products, and this one did not let me down.  This product is going on my permanent Amazon shopping list.
