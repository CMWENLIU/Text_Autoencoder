I am a black licorice lover.  Over the years, I have eaten licorice products from around the world.  My sister sent me Black Licorice Scottie Dogs as a gift, and I fell in love with them.  I next found them in The Fresh Market, where they are sold by the pound, at a price that caused me to buy them only on a periodic basis.  Then I did some research and found that Gimbal's makes them and that I could by them through Amazon.com.  I ordered a box, which is a supply that can last a very long time.  My friends and neighbors discovered them in the small candy dish my wife keeps on the large island in our kitchen.  I had to order 2 more boxes to fill all the requests to have a bag of the great little treats.<br /><br />A box contains two (2) 5 lbs. bags.  The bag is plastic and sealed tightly, so the licorice remains fresh for a long time.  When you compare the price of a 10 lbs. box versus what specialty food stores charge per pound, the box is by far the better deal.<br /><br />According to experts:<br /><br />"Licorice is in fact a powerful antiviral that contains 10 antioxidants, at least 25 fungicidal and 9 expectorant compounds. Licorice also includes MAO inhibitors, several XO inhibitors, and natural estrogenic ingredients. But this is not all that helps to form licorice. Licorice is also made up of beneficial components such as phytochemicals, magnesium, and sodium."<br /><br />Enjoy the benefits and the treat!!!!
