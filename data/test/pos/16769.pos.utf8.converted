This roasted nori has a lite, spicy flavor that our kids love.  We take lots of packets with us when we go out just about anywhere, because they're healthy and we don't mind letting the kids have as many as they want when they ask for a snack - especially compared to nasty, processed, non-nutritive kids' snacks like chips, cheese puffs, cheese crackers, etc.  If you've never had nori, this is the same stuff that sushi rolls are wrapped in - it's just served crispy here because it hasn't absorbed any moisture from the rice and sushi roll that it is otherwise wrapped around.<br /><br />There are lots of health benefits to eating nori, and the light spicy flavor in the Ajitsuke brand is just right - give it a shot, you'll like it!
