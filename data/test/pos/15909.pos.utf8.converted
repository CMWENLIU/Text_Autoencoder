First, if you haven't tried this marmalade, do so!! I am a connoisseur and this really is terrific, one of the best of any marmalade and certainly by far and away the best blood-orange variant on the market.<br /><br />The lack of the fifth star is NOT a comment on the quality of the product but on the company's hidden shipping costs. The charges are well above average and well above actual cost if you only buy a few jars. Even if you buy five jars, the most you can get against a $15 shipping fee, please note that actual UPS Ground shipping costs was really $9.95--or so the UPS web site told me. I sort of wish these people wouldn't hide fees this way--it demeans the product.
