I have a Weimaraner that Loves to chew up most items in a few seconds.  Zeus has been chewing on this toy for 4 weeks and it is still intact.  There are few strands of rope removed, but overall this has lasted longer than any toy we have purchased, even the black Kong is no match for him.  Zeus and I both love this toy so much that I just ordered a second for when this one finally dies.
