After first trying this great product from small package bought in  health food store, I quickly realized we need to stock up and save. Here comes amazon with the great auto-ship feature which keeps our stock perfectly replenished each 6 months. The seeds come fresh and tasty. I love them, my 7 year old daughter loves them too, we take several teaspoons straight every day, I wouldn't want to loose any tossed over the salad. Taste is better than hemp oil. Perfect protein and EFA source without sacrifice to the taste!
