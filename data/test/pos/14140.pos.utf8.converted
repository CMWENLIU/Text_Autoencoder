We're relatively new to farro, but after just one taste, we're completely hooked on this delicious little grain. It's super easy to cook, and it has a wonderful nutty taste and chewy texture. It's high in fiber, and it doesn't need much added to make a complete dish. I cook 1 and a 1/2 cups (dry) in 6 cups of water for 30 minutes on medium high heat, drain, and then add 1/2 a jar of Trader Joe's Bruschetta mix and a can of white beans. Voila! 6 servings made, and it tastes great cold, room temp, or warm. I've tried some other brands, and Roland's is the best. I buy and use a 3 lb bag monthly; we love it THAT MUCH. It's great for picnics since it doesn't need to be refrigerated, and it can be used as a side dish or main dish, depending on the size of your appetite. Try it; you'll like it.
