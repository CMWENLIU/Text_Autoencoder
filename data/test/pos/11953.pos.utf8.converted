My husband converted to drinking tea about 6-7 years ago and has been quite particular in what he chooses to purchase.  He used to buy the Lipton Black Tea with Honey and Lemon and it was no longer available.  Finding a substitute that would be equally satisfying became quite problematic.  He tried a box of Twinnings Irish Breakfast tea and added his own honey.  He found it to be better than anything he could imagine.  While it is not my first choice, I certainly put it in second place on my list, as I like English Breakfast tea.  Nonetheless, this has a great flavor and warms the spot when looking for something special to drink.  I highly recommend it!
