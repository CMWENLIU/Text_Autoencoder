Yes, we're very pleased with the flavor and size of these mushrooms, but even  more amazing is the cost!  16 oz. of Shitake mushroom caps costs 7 times this at our favorite grocery....yes, seven times!<br /><br />  True the mushroom caps in our local grocery had  all the stems removed and there are some stems in  this package, but gracious!  For the difference in price I'll gladly remove stems if we  don't want them there.  (And hum happily while doing it)<br /><br />  Further the order arrived in only 3 days without expedited shipping, and it was extremely well packaged so there was absolutely no crushing of the product.<br /><br />  You can bet we'll be buying our Shitakes here from now on!<br /><br />  - Gail Cooke
