I am 6.5 months pregnant and often feel tired and fatigued.  When I drink this product (and I just use water) I am shocked how instantly great I feel.  I brought it into my OBY/Gyn and she okay'd it.  It is a great pick me up and actually puts me in a better mood.  When you are pregnant and not drinking, not smoking, no caffeine your system is pretty clean so you can actually feel the results faster.  I did use this product when I was not pregnant got great results as well, as this product does alkaline your system and helps your skin stay clear of pimples.  Yeah the taste is acquired but imagine if you had to eat vegetables all day long to get the same results...hope this helps!
