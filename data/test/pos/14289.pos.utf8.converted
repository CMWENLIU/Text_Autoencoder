I'm one of those lucky individuals allergic to everything under the sun, so I'm hard-pressed to find a cruchy, salty, food-safe snack. These are one of my favorites, namely because most plantain chips are coated with sweet-this product is not sweet. I give this product a 5 star rating, however, I can't understand why they are charging so much for them. The in-store price $1.69 per 6oz. package. If you order them from this website, they would amount to $4.41 per 6oz. package-and that doesn't include the S/H they charge!  Find someone who lives near a Trader Joes to pick some up for you and ship it for waaaay cheaper.
