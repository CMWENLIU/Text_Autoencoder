Bought some of this salt at a boutique shop about 8 years ago and have not been able to find it since.  Now its on Amazon and I'm excited.  This is a amazing salt and I love it compared to all other salts I have had.  Makes for the best on fresh tomatoes and balsamic vinegar, you will not be disappointed.  Easy to sprinkle with large light grains that melt instantly.
