I had previously tried and loved an expensive balsamic vinegar but could not locate it locally to buy it. I decided to purchase the Mussini Crema, Glaze of Balsamic Vinegar to see if it was in any way comparable to the brand I had been using. It was as good and better, and best of all considerably less expensive. I am thoroughly spoiled and will never again use a supermarket brand of balsamic vinegar as a dressing. I use this drizzled on fresh tomatoes with just a touch of salt, pepper and fresh basil, in my salad dressings, drizzled over chicken, and even over strawberries. Also, since you usually use only a small amount, it goes a long way. It is syrupy with a touch of sweetness, totally unlike the usual balsamic vinegars. I am still trying new ways to use it, and so far everything has benefitted from its use. It has now become a staple in my pantry.
