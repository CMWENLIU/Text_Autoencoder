This flour makes the most delicious wheat bread.  I ordered it expecting it to be more white than wheat but it actually has a very wheaty color.  However, after reading about it on the Great River Milling website, I learned that it is in fact wheat but has had 80% of the bran removed.  It bakes up nicely and does not have that sour taste that I have often associated with whole wheat bread.  So, if you are looking for organic white bread flour, keep looking but for a light wheat alternative, this is perfect.  I would also suggest checking out the company website for info on all their different flours.  You can also order individual bags there if you don't want to get 20lbs of something when you aren't quite sure you are going to like it.  Amazon rocks for bulk purchase and the free shipping and discount through subscribe and save is awesome!!!  I'll definitely continue to use Amazon every chance I get!!!
