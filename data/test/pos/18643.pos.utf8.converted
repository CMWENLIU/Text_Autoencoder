We found Jacobs Kronung coffee in 1991 when we visited our son stationed in Bitburg Germany. They don't drink coffee so we had to find coffee and visited a local grocery store. The rich green bag looked inviting. We don't speak or read German and in the States, a green bag denotes decaffeinated but we decided to give it a try anyway and were we ever happy we did. Jacobs Kronung coffee is a fine ground coffee and it took several tries to get just the right amount but it was wonderful. We loved it! (And we were hooked!)<br /><br />We mailed several bags home before we left Germany and then hunted for places in the States to buy more. Once in awhile we would find Jacobs in the Air Force Commissary but it was not a given that we could find it regularly. (We did ask our son to send more from time to time as a special treat.)<br /><br />We've tried several of the blends but prefer the Kronung blend. Jacob's Meisterr&ouml;stung is stronger and the Night and Day is a decaf version. I was surprised when Jacobs was purchased by Kraft, which shows they know a good product too. Thanks to the Internet, Jacobs Kronung Coffee is easily found and the price here on Amazon is the cheapest I've found.<br /><br />My daughter-in-law just gave us a Frieling Stainless Steel 35-Ounce French Press from Amazon and I'm going to buy the Jacobs Kronung beans because I KNOW it will make a super combination.<br /><br />Try it! If you like a wonderfully flavorful coffee at a bargain price, you won't be sorry!
