Having consumed Himalania Goji Berries for over one year, the Navitas Naturals Goji Berry is a great addition to the exotic food market. The Navitas Goji is harder and drier than the Himalania Goji, but the flavor is much sweeter and better tasting.<br /><br />I love the fact that they're raw, vegan, sun-dried, and free of chemicals and pesticides! Goji berries are believed to strengthen the immune system, increase energy and reduce fatigue, and reduce the threat of free radicals (due to HIGH levels of antioxidants). Gojis have highest ORAC score to date! The ORAC scale is a standardized test used to measure the total antioxidant potency of foods and nutritional supplements.<br /><br />Definitely, one of my favorite foods!
