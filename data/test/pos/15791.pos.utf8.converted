I tried the other liquid kind, but it killed my young plants. I was not able to measure it properly. I thought I would try this brand just because I was tired of messing with the yucky, power plant food. Guess what? It works great. My plants seem to really love it. The dropper adds a nice touch and helps to make sure you are consistent with giving your babies the right amount of good nutrients. I give it five starts, because a few drops is really all you need for a great pick me up.
