I received this product in a very timely manor, in perfect condition no dents. I immediately opened a can and tasted it, very nice thick and smooth coconut milk.<br />I have since had it cooled in the fridge and it is still nice and no separation at all.  I made a shake of it with protein powder and I was delicious.<br />I would like to comment on some of the reviewers here if I may, no insulting just making observations.<br /><br />1) It is sad that the cans came in dented but that is not the fault of Amazon the case comes from the manufacturer in a sealed box, Amazon does not pack it, so if the product is dented inside the box it is the fault of the packers.<br />2) Why would you believe that there is no BPA? just because someone's friend read it somewhere? It is not stated on the can along with, the claims of NON GMO, Kosher, USDA organic, Vegan, Gluten Free.  If it were indeed BPA free they would want to put it on the label with these other claims because it would boost sales.  So it is not BPA free.<br />3) the expiration date is clearly marked on the bottom of each can as well as the case it comes in, mine reads this way: Best Before : 21 FEB 2013, under that it has a number of 05, I think that is where that person got the 07 from he missed the real date or it was rubbed off somehow.  It is hard to believe that all 24 got rubbed off.<br /><br />We all have different tastes  and unfortunately in a business this large there are mistakes, contact the company but please do not give negative reviews if you have not tasted the product at all. This is the review of the product itself not he way it was shipped.<br />You are not hurting the company but you are hurting the people like us who are buyers and count on your true opinion.
