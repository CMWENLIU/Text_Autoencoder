Okay, I never leave reviews, but I have to say that this was my favorite almond butter. It tasted a lot like non-raw almond butter. And I love the big chunks of almonds in it. I have bought artisana and living tree community, and their's is sweet, but this one was just, right down my alley, LOVE IT!
