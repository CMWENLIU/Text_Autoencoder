I have a stressful job where I work around sick people and their often unprotected coughs and sneezes.  Davidson's green rooibos tea is what I reach for at the first sign I'm coming down with something, or those times when my own immune system just feels fragile and run-down.  I make the tea strong (2 heaping teaspoons to a cup), bring it to a boil then steep at least 6 cups on the stove (lowest setting on the burner so it's just gently steaming) for a half hour to an hour.  Sometimes that's enough to knock out the oncoming cold, sometimes I stay on the tea for a few days.  Bottom line:  my coworkers have been sick this winter, most several times; I haven't been sick once.<br /><br />I sometimes drink green rooibos straight but generally mix it with either Davidson's Spring Fruit and Flowers or Davidson's Spiced Rooibos Chai.  Good luck!
