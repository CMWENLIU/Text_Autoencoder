I bought these sheets to try out with my Cricut Cake machine. They work wonderfully. Use some Crisco to attach them to your cutting mat, and then place in your freezer for 10-15 minutes before cutting for the best results. Once you have them cut, it helps to attach them with piping gel or royal icing. After a bit, they will meld with your icing and look perfect.<br />These even taste great! They don't have the chemical taste the the Cricut sheets do.
