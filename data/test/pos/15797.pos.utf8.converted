Delicious olives, and lots of them, simply processed, without excess favorings. No hot peppers, no excess garlic.  Although many of the olives are ripe (brown and black), they are soft---not similar to "American" ripe black olives (which are slightly crisp and packaged in brine only). If preparing a mix for a luncheon, etc. a few "American" black olives mixed-in make a nice contrast.<br /><br />The similar "Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto"  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAKUP0">Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto, 5-Pound Bag</a>  is the same product but with tasty capers, a few garlic cloves and a few peices of bell peppers (for color), perhaps a slightly larger ratio of ripe olives, and perhaps saltier. I like the flavor of the "Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto" better, but it is a close call.<br /><br />The packaging (into a heavy plastic bag) apparently consisted of draining the olives and then coating them with olive oil. Amazon packages the bag (folded in half) in a standard ca 3" x 8" x 12" cardboard box. The packaging works well, however, shipment is hard some of the softer types of olives.<br /><br />The olives are salty. You may be tempted to soak them in plain water to reduce the salt content. Unless you plan to eat the olives in the next few hours, resist the temptation. First, you'll leach out too much salt and flavor. Second, the olives will rot in a few weeks. Really.<br /><br />I suggest gently rinsing the olives when you receive them (e.g., in your colander), and repackaging them in your own light brine and white vinegar mix (and jars), and refrigerate. The light brine will reduce the saltiness of the olives to an appropriate level in a day or two. It will take about 5 cups of water, about 1/4 cup (4 tbsp) of salt, and 1/3 cup (6 tbsp) of white vinegar to your taste. It is best to use "sea-salt" or pickling salt, because brine made from regular processed salt can get cloudy.<br /><br />Some of the olives are firm, some are soft---that's simply the nature of a true mix. Most Americans (like myself), raised on pimento-stuffed queen olives think that they don't like soft olives. Indeed, mushy queen olives are yucky. However, some types of olives are meant to be soft, and are best soft. It is an acquired taste, worth acquiring. The mix includes a large variety of olives, both firm and soft. It is said that the key to oriental cuisine is variety---a variety of colors, textures, and flavors. The same is true of an olive mix meant for snacking or as the basis of a light meal.<br /><br />Recommendation 1: A half-can of chick-peas, a diced tomato, a half-cup of these mixed olives, all mixed together with a little olive oil is a wonderful, tasty, health, lunch.<br /><br />Recommendation 2: There is a whole world of olives out their worth exploring. As just example, Grabers Ripe Green Olives are more different from stuffed queen olives than you can imagine, but are marvelous. Mild and nutty.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P8HPCI">Graber Olives Size 14 7.5 oz. Can</a>
