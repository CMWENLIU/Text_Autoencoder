According to my extremely finicky Cocker, Blue Buffalo Dog Food is the best.  I have been trying to switch her over from prescription food, for her allergies, for a long time; I couldn't find anything to agree with her palate.  Blue is just the ticket, from the very beginning.  It doesn't contain anything that you can't pronounce, or any other fillers.  Try it, your dog will love it!
