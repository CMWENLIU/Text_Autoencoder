My family went gluten-free 9 years ago and organic 2 years ago. This is an exceptional product at an unbeatable price. I make my own GF baking mixes and GF baked goods. I've made breads, cookies, crackers, donuts, waffles and other various baked goods and all have turned out with a beautiful "lumpless" texture. I truly recommend this product to anyone doing gluten-free baking.
