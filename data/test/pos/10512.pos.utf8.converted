When I was a kid, my family frequented an Italian pastry shop that made the best cannolis, sfogliatelle,and a cookie that they called "nut bars." I've only found "nut bars" in two bakeries, one in New Jersey, one on Cape Cod. Although biscotti is an okay substitute, it just isn't the same. Ferrara Cantuccini are exactly like the "nut bars" I remember. Crispy, crunchy, and full of almonds, the texture is quite different from biscotti. The only problem with them is that I could eat them by the boxful. Each piece has about 33 calories, which makes me love them even more (if that's at all possible).
