I puchased this today at costco for 38.28 total. I took one bottle before i went to the gym cus i was exhausted from a hot long day at work. I was skeptical about this cus ived tried many imitations or 5hr energy. But nothing has worked till i tried this. It kicked in with minutes and it had the effects just like 5hr energy. I heard this is made by 5hr energy and just repackaged for costco as their kirkland brand name. Worth the $$$ and will by these instead of 5hr energy brand from now on!<br /><br />Its almost the exact same as the 5hr energy extra strength. Only difference is the niacin which is 30mg instead of 40mg. But has 2150mg of energy blend compared to 2000mg. It also has less soduim at 15mg compared to 18mg.<br /><br />Dont hesitate and buy this product!!!<br /><br />Cheers- DP
