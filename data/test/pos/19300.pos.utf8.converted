Vegan. Natural. Kosher. Big cookie. Mild delicious chocolate flavor. Very soft with some chewy oats mixed in. Kind of big for a snack, but is nice for quick breakfast or meal replacement. Substantial. Vegans will especially find these cookies useful, nourishing, and convenient. 310 calories per cookie. 6g of protein. This cookie was a Vegan Grocery *** TRIPLE+ *** in the 24 pack, which is no longer available. Hopefully the good word will again flourish for the benefit of everyone. Also really like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N33NSU">Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookie Peanut Butter Chocolate Chunk, Vegan, 3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> which has been popular with the Community.
