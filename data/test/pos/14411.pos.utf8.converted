I was burn in Turkey and now live in sunny Myrtle Beach SC.I used to live New Jersey which has alot of middleastern shops sells olives and you pay alot of money for it.Since we moved to Myrtle Beach I have to buy mail order Roland oil cured olives from amazon which sells lover price then NJ stores and I loved it. Those olives are the best oil cured olives in this side of the Atlantic ocean or the other side of the Atlantic ocean.Some time I have to order two 5lbs bags of olives to save on shipping fees or for when amazon runs out of supplies so I never run out of my olives.
