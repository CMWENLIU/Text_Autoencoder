I was really excited when I found this!  I've been drinking the other water additives that have aspartame in them and have been trying to wean myself off of them.  Well, this is the ticket!  It's really good!  And way healthier than those other brands out there because this brand uses stevia instead of aspartame.  It's very sweet, so I recommend using less than the recommended amount.  Enjoy!
