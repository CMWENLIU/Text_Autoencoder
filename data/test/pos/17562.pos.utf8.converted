Bought this at Menards for two dollars cheaper. Had a serious mole problem. This sucker was tearing up the yard. I found his main tunnel going back and forth between the woods and the house. Did a lot of reading. Placed two traps on his tunnel, after pushing the ground back down. I set the trap as it is supposed to be set. Leaving him room to go underneath and push the dirt up again. One day later, and I got him. No more tunnels! Pulled them out and stored them for the next guy, if he dare comes. I am telling you, if you set the trap correctly and wait a day or two with a fresh tunnel, you WILL get him.
