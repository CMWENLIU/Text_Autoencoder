Hands down this is the best chicken stock on the market. Forget about Emeril's and Wolfgang Puck<br />or the generic crap you get at the grocery, this is far and away the king of the commercial stocks.<br /><br />A good stock is the key ingredient in soups, marinades, sauces and is used to flavor veggies like<br />green beans and potato and rice dishes. This stuff is just perfect for all of the above, especially<br />for making soups like roasted garlic, white chicken chili, and kitchen sink vegetable soup. It just<br />doesn't get any better. Available locally for between $3-$4.<br /><br />One other thing I like about this product is that it is heart healthy, low sodium, and the entire 32oz.<br />only carries 96 calories with zero fat!
