Purchased an 8 pack of Adolph's Marinade in Minutes (Original) because I can no longer find it in local markets.  Have tried researching it and much of what I have read seems to indicate it has been discontinued.  I am so saddened by this.  I have used it for many years and it does such a wonderful job of tenderizing and flavoring meats ( I use it mostly on sirloin tip steaks before cutting up into kebabs for the grill.  Everyone always raved about how good my kebabs were!  I hope Adolph's will reconsider if they are indeed discontinuing this product.
