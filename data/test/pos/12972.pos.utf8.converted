I had searched far and wide for this scotch bonnet pepper sauce nearby where I live...but it just seems that the midwest doesn't crave this particular flavor.  I fell in love with this stuff in the Caymen Islands and finally found it through Amazon.  It's a fabulous flavor-- mixing the 'zing' with a bit of unique sweetness.  Unbelievable on most everything...meat (pulled pork, hamburgers etc.),pizza, soups (especially chili), with snacks and appetizers (like hummas), and in pasta (my favorite....mac n cheese for a nice variation).  I bought three bottles this time, to make sure I have enough to last for a while.  One thing to be aware of is the thick texture.  I added about an once of filtered water to bring it to a more desirable consistency for myself, after having used a small portion...I just added the water and shook it up.  To me, this sauce is not just HOT like some of the others out there that have no flavor attached to the heat, instead, it just has a fabulous, dynamic flavor that I simply can't get enough of.  At less than four dollars a bottle...you CANNOT pass this JCS scotch bonnet sauce up!
