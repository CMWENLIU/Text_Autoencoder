These organic Cacao Nibs are my secret weapon against night eating and stress nibbling. It turns out that Cacao (aka chocolate in its original organic form)is GOOD for you. It's one of the best antioxidants God made naturally for us to enjoy! I put these Nibs in a mini-bowl by the TV and when there is a desire to nibble or snack, I nibble on these. I am satisfied and its healthy at the same time. I believe that this little action step of nibbling on Nibs brought about the loss of the last few difficult pounds to lose. Nibs are also great to use in cooking as a substitute for chocolate morsels in just about any recipe. I am really hooked on these. I can't live well without them!
