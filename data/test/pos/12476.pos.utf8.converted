I'm a vegetarian who takes protein basically wherever I can get it. Most pre-mixed soy varieties you find in the grocery store, other than silk, don't agree with me. The price of these canisters where pretty good on amazon and I was looking for an emergency supply of soymilk for those times I can't run to the store. so I gave it a shot. And now I love it so much I basically have a can with me wherever I go.<br /><br />I have always have soymilk when I need, it taste great (some people may find it a little bland, but a tablespoon or two of sugar mixed shaken with 32 oz of water before adding the soy will take care of that), it convient, doesn't spoil, and I can add it to anything since heat doesn't affect it. A tablespoon or two in hot tea (with sugar) and another in some instant whole wheat oatmeal in the morning, and you have energy to burn first thing in the morning without taking the time to cook!
