<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMAZQ8">Lipton Instant Tea Mix, Diet Raspberry, 2.6-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)</a> is delicious.  We like it iced, and it is also good hot.  Just heat water and stir in a heaping spoonful.  Adjust the amount to your preference.<br /><br />It has only 5 calories per serving, which is 1 tablespoon tea mix.<br /><br />Ingredients include malic acid.  Let me tell you that this piece of information is not a recommendation. Neither is it meant to be considered medical advice.  I'm merely telling you about my experience. Malic acid is included in this tea to provide tartness. There is no other reason given on the package for the inclusion of this ingredient.<br /><br />I have a mild case of fibromyalgia, which is helped by malic acid.  When I drink a cup of this tea hot or a big glass of it iced, I get quick relief for muscle pains.  On the achy days, I drink this tea constantly. Lipton diet lemon flavor tea also has malic acid, and I like that one too.<br /><br />A friend of mine has the same problem, and she finds that this tea helps her too.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.
