Jocalat bars are made by the Larabar Company. The following applies to all Larabars and Jocalat bars:<br /><br />* All natural.<br /><br />* No added sugars.<br /><br />* No chemicals/preservatives.<br /><br />* No soy.<br /><br />* Nothing bad/only healthy ingredients.<br /><br />* Vegan-friendly.<br /><br />* Convenient. (No measuring, cutting, pouring, mixing, cooking, etc.)<br /><br />* Because they are healthy and convenient, they are good to have for when you are hungry and have no means to cook or buy something. They can curb your appetite and give you energy. They are also good for snacks.<br /><br />If I were to have an emergency food supply, Larabars and Jocalats would be in the box, (even though I don't know what the shelf life is for them.)<br /><br />Now about this particular flavor, Chocolate Mint Jocalat:<br /><br />I love this flavor. It is a rich spearmint flavor, and of course, chocolate.<br /><br />If you are used to eating candy bars, you might not like these bars at first. I do not eat candy bars (I can't remember the last time I've had one), and I am used to "healthy-tasting" foods; therefore, the taste of these bars are perfect for me. I love them.
