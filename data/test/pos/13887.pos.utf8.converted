This powdered milk mixes easily with the water if you do it this way. Start off putting 1/3 of the water in measuring cup or container, add desired amount powdered milk & mix with a wire whisk to make a semi-thick paste. Gradually add the rest of the water while whisking, and you will have no lumps and delicious milk!
