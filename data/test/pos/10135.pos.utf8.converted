You can get real licorice in New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, The Netherlands, Sweden, England, Finland and even Denmark. But not in the US. We use anise oil. Real licorice is found in RJ's and it makes a huge difference. The flavor is akin to dark chocolate and very nice if you are a licorice fan.
