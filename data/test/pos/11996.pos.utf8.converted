Having discovered Green Tea Latte's at Starbucks not too long ago I read with great delight the comments on Amazon regarding Matcha Green Tea and decided to purchase it and try making my own.  I am very happy that I can't tell the difference between Starbucks and the ones I make.  Yes, green tea has many wonderful properties to it but I'm more into the taste and saving money.  I think the taste is very good and saves me a bundle not having to buy them from Starbucks.  I use 2 cups skim milk, Splenda and a rounded measuring tsp of Matcha powder and I can't tell the difference between the store bought latte and mine made in my hot chocolate machine.  Definitely a good buy.
