This is a great product.  It is fairly convenient to make, and I found the flavor to be very authentic.  I have been eating at Vietnamese restaurants for a long time, and the flavor of the soup is right up there with some of my favorite places.  Having tried my hand at recreating the flavor at home, I can assure you that the soup packet is much easier.  Yes, you do need to add your own meat and vegetables, but would you want that stuff to come out of the box?  I've been using chicken broth and chicken (note that the meat option says to use beef).  I also recommend adding a thinly sliced onion to the broth when you start to get that authentic flavor.<br /><br />This is the perfect product if you have celiac, as it is gluten free and you can control what goes into it.
