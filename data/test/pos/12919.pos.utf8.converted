I found this coffee to be a great start to every day. It has the rich body and just the right strength( using the 12 oz size). Never bitter either even if you have to nuke it to warm it or leave it on a mug warmer. I love this blend !<br />In this 24 package it is a great value, saving me 30 cents per cup over buying it at my local big box store.<br />I had found it hard to find a good decaf in these k-cup's until I tried this, it is now my favorite.
