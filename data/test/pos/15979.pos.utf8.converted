I used this brand of mushrooms to make a delicious and "meaty" mushroom bourguignon. These porcinis added a very rich and complex taste to the dish and the soaking liquid is a great mushroom broth. The texture of the reconstituted mushroom is good. I originally bought these at the supermarket but this price on Amazon is about 30% cheaper. Great deal, good product.
