When I was a kid, you could go into a drugstore and sit and get fountain cokes and floats.  Aboslutely one of my favorite memories as a child, was to get a bag of my pepitos (it was about $.25 for bag--and my sister and I got a quarter each) and they were fresh roasted.  Then we would go see a movie--the theater was on the other side of the drugstore.  Yes, over the years I have tried others types and brands only to be very disappointed.  THESE ARE PERFECT!  As the other review said, not too salty, just absolutely right.  My husband as already confiscated 2 of the 4 bags from me--he loves them too--so I am having to order more!! LOVE THEM!!
