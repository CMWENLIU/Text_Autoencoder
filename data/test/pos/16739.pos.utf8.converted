Imagine...you've just sat down to enjoy your favorite sandwich (complete with your favorite Baconnaise spread) and next to it is a tall, ice cold glass of Tuscan Milk.<br /><br />As you enjoy your repast, you're transported as if floating on a cloud and all thoughts of a poor economy, anti-American sentiment, Korean nuclear testing, global warming, bailouts, bankruptcies and foreclosures melt away as if magically being swept away by the creamy folds of Tuscan milk and the sweet, sweet aroma of bacon.<br /><br />As you apply the bacon lip balm, you feel refreshed and ready to create the utopian state we all desire. All is right with the world.
