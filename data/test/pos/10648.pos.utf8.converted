Being a long time low-carb lifestyle fan, one of the hardest things to find is anything that even somewhat resembles bread! Well, these guys have come up with a recipe that is awesome!! Carb Krunchers "Everything Bread" makes a plain hamburger come to life again! It tastes great with butter and as a grilled cheese sandwich, it is fantastic. Give it a try, its worth every bite!
