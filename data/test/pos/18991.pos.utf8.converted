This Coconut Oil is super good, so good I have it on auto order. It is organic, tastes great, smells great, very fresh, ships fast..I love it. I use it in place of butter or margarine on my food, I use it to stir fry, I also use it on my face. I am a vegetarian and would recommend it to others. One of my favorite dishes is baked sweet potato, I cut a large one in half after baking and put Natures Way coconut oil, cinnamon, and pecan pieces on top. Everyone that eats one of these says "I taste fresh coconut on this, how did you do that?". I don't mean to rant but this product is something to rant about! Just try it, you will like it.
