You can walk through the spice bazaar, through the streets and past the storefronts amidst the crowd and crush of Istanbul's market bazaar, until, near the Bosporus you come to the Mehmet Efendi window and smell the sweet scent of Turkey's greatest coffee.<br />What Illy is to Italy, Mehmet Efendi is to Turkey, and let's remember-the Turks started it! Oh, what sweet scents, what delicious varieties. I always bring home as much as my suitcase will carry. This year I may throw away all my clothes to make room for more Mehmet Efendi. Oh, and if you are not hitting Istanbul, isn't it nice that you can get it on Amazon?
