I orginally found the quick wild rice in a gourmet grocery store, about a year ago. If you backpack or do other outdoorsy pursuits, this is a great item to pick up.<br /><br />In most of my recipes using it, I use 1/4 wild rice to instant white or instant brown rice. A nice change of texture, flavor and color.
