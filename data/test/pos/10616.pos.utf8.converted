I recently found this candy in a local TJMax store. Unfortunately, they don't always carry the same products. I thought I'd try Amazon. I'm thrilled to find that you carry this!! Being a diabetic, I'm always looking for a "good" treat. Another nice thing about this hard candy is that it takes a while to eat. It doesn't melt too fast and it's very hard so you won't chew it up right away. This is one of the BEST sour hard candies I've ever eaten!! It doesn't taste like a sugarfree candy at all.
