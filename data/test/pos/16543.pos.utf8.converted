Wheat Chex Cereal has been the favorite at our house for years.  My kids and husband could eat it daily.  They eat it dry as a snack, the traditional way with milk, and even crushed up and warmed with a little margarine (a dish my husband's family calls "crackled up").<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is usually double the price of sugary cereals.  Amazon's price for Wheat Chex Cereal, 14-Ounce Box (Pack of 6) is less than I have found at any store.  Subscribe & Save makes it even better!  I highly recommend a subscription.
