I am in love with these food colors!  They don't water down my icing, they don't taste funky, and the colors are vibrant and beautiful!  I bought these so I could sample the Americolor brand at the recommendation of a food blogger and I am not disappointed.  Once I get the money, I'm going to be buying the large set of Americolor 41 4-oz size bottles that I found recently on Amazon.
