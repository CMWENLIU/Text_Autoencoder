This is genius!<br /><br />I purchase Angel hair first and after that bought a big box of angel hair and fettuccine! The product is AMAZING! Don't get fooled by all these negative reviews!<br /><br />If you like Asian food, you probably already know that their pasta doesn't taste like American/European kind. it has a different texture and taste. So these noodles taste exactly like the ones you order at Big Bowl :)<br /><br />The comments about the smell are ridiculous! How many raw uncooked food smells good? Are you kidding me? For instance, I love steamed broccoli but it smells bad while steaming! :)<br /><br />PLEASE follow the instructions: rinse in cold water for at least 15 seconds and boil for one minute, dry in paper towels. if you don't follow instructions, you will ruin ANY food, even your most favorite!<br /><br />Since the pasta is 0 calories, I finally could indulge myself with a really good pasta sauce ( no low fat anymore ) or some seafood Alfredo! the possibilities are endless. Please note that the noodles even better the next day since they easily absorb all flavors.<br /><br />Absolutely delicious and guilt free!
