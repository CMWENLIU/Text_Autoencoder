Awesome!  These are pretty healthy for a sweet snack and they don't taste "diet" at all!  You get lots more in these bags than most 100 cal snack packs.  I like the fact that they use evaporated cane juice instead of processed white sugar too.  If you're a sweet tooth and need a good healthy crunchy snack you will love these!
