I drink my coffee BLACK, but as a treat or wanting a cold iced coffee, I will add creamer and make my own rather than purchasing expensive coffee drinks. This flavor is perfect. Has a nice taste without tasting overly sugary, which I personal can't stand. I would recommend this flavor. I cannot get it on my store shelf either , so the subscribe and save is a good deal. I get six containers and the expiration date is in June of 2012. So it's a ways out there. I also add this to warm milk or boost a cup of cocoa. It is versatile and really good. Two thumbs WAY up!!!
