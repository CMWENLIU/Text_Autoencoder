These mushrooms are great!  I add them to a sauce if it is a little runny, and it soaks up the extra juice without making the sauce simmer.<br /><br />These are great in any italian dishes.  They are a little expensive compared to buying fresh mushrooms, but the ease and quickness of adding these to any recipe is great!
