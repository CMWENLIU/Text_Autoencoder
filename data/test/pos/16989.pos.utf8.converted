Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Delightful ready-to-eat sweet golden corn kernals. High quality. Ready to enjoy as an organic side dish. Or easy to add to any soup or other of your organic kitchen creations. Tender. Flavorful & sweet. A year-round treat of beautiful organic sweet corn. 280 calories, 3.5g fat, and 7g protein per can. Made with organic golden sweet corn, organic cane juice, and sea salt only. Labeled "vegetarian," but is vegan also. Westbrae is a top brand. Also really like all the Westbrae bean choices such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKXRUO">Westbrae Natural Vegetarian Organic Soup Beans, 15 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZLQ2">Westbrae Natural Vegetarian Organic Salad Beans, 15 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out "Vegan Grocery Favorites" and "Vegan Grocery Top Ten" in Listmania.
