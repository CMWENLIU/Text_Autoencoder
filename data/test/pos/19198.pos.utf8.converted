As an ex vet tech, i have to say that this is a great dog food.  This food is very high quality and is worth the price.  The contents are healthy and are meant for promoting a soft and shiny coat in conjunction with providing healthy optimum nutrition rather than cheap filler.  Treat your pooch right, get em the best.
