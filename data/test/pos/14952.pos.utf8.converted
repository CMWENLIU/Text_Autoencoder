Was suffering from extreme pain in the gastric region and nausea for weeks. It was hard for me to attend public functions without being sick...I have no medical coverage for now and ordered this honey.<br />According to instructions on jar.... 1-2 tsps of honey prior to eating. I am guessing that this creates a coating of the stomach intestine or whatever so that it's antibacterial properties can go to work. Who knows! All I know is that I am completely fine now!! The honey tastes wonderful! I have eaten organic honey with comb from Union Square that I purchased from a beekeeper who harvests his own honey...although it was nice to know it was organic, it was still very sweet. Store bought honey is very sweet too...this honey is sweet but mild so that you can enjoy it without being overwhelmed.<br />Also, the packaging is in a plastic container. There have been many reviews where people have complained about it no longer being in a glass container, but if you read earlier reviews, people were complaining about receiving broken jars of honey so that is how they remedied the situation.<br />Oh, and I only take the honey 1x a day before breakfast and it worked! Do not hesitate to buy!!
