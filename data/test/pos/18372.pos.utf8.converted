I have only taken this magnesium product for three days; however, within that time my heart palpitations have decreased significantly......as has my constant awareness of my heart beating.  Some people had mentioned a problem with diarrhea when using Natural Calm; however I have not been experiencing that - possibly because I am taking only 1/2 teaspoon daily.  I am satisfied with the unflavored product, likening it to a tart lemonade.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I am SO glad that I took a chance on Natural Calm!!!  A complete cardiac work-up revealed no major problems, and both my cardiologist and myself were at our wits end, trying to come up with a non-prescription remedy to address my unnerving heart beats.
