The packaging has poorly welded zipper-strip, so you'll need to clip or rebag any leftovers.  Aside from that, the product is excellent.  Onion moves quickly, so you're getting a fresh product.  Frontier does quality control and stays on top of their products and batch numbers.  Their dried onion flaks are good sized pieces, not just crumbs or powder.  The taste is good, with a faint sweet flavor, not cardboardy.<br /><br />We have used Tones, Frontier, and several others.  It's a commodity product, so there's a limit to the variety you'll find.  Where Frontier really wins out is that it's inexpensive, conveniently packaged, and you can get it on subscribe-and-save.  That's even less expensive, and saves from having to remember where I picked up my last order.<br /><br />This product is two 1-pound bags, and that's a good size for home use.
