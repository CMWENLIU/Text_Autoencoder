I like bold coffee and usually drink Starbucks when I'm out and various Bold varieties that are available for my Keurig Coffee Maker when I'm home.  But - I had quit drinking coffee in the evenings because of restless sleep if I drank it too close to bedtime.  I can drink this right up to bed time and sleep without problem - AND - it tastes GREAT!<br /><br />Good job Emeril.
