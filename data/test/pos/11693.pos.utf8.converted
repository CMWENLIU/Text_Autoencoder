This pot roast is cooked to perfection!  And it's flavor is fabulous!  I've bought this a few times and each and every one is just as fantastic as the first.  I always use the oven as directed to heat it and it always comes out soooo tender and tasty.  Omaha Steaks has a great reputation but a few of it's food items are just not that great.....except this one....I love it despite the relatively high cost.  It's on sale right now and has 20% off on Amazon so give it a try....you'll be very happy you did -- if you like pot roast of course!
