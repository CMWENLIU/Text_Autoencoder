bai juice is made from the "superfruit" of a coffee bean.  it's the fruit between the bean skin and bean itself.  i guess it's measured in orac units.  this drink has 4000 orac units compared to acai which only has 100.  not too sure what orac units are, but sounds something like what scotty would say on star trek ("but captain, we're giving it all we got but we are out of dilithium crystals and have only 4000 orac units left!").  anyway bai juices come in a variety of flavors.  i enjoy the blueberry drink the best.  it does only have 10% juice though.  calories about 140 for bottle, 18 g carbs.  it's a good alternative to all those sugary, nasty tasting energy drinks.
