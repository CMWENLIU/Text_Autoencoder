This is a very good basic flour that can be used in recipes to substitute for wheat flour. It is based on what is called the "Wendy Wark" recipe. For those who don't want to go mixing up a lot of different flours this is a good choice. I tried it and then went out and made the mix myself. However, doing this required going to three different stores for flours. As I was setting up a gluten-free pantry I didn't mind but for those who want less hassle buying the mix is a good way to go. I use it for scones and quick breads.
