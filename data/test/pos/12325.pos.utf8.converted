Our baby has been on this formula and breast milk for a few months now.  She doesn't have much gas from it.  It does take some vigorous shaking to totally dissolve the formula.  I let it settle a bit prior to giving it to her so that there are less bubbles in the formula which in turn is less air in her belly.  I love the larger can, more bang for your buck and am hoping that Amazon puts this on Subscribe and Save soon.  I purchased it for 86...it was in the Friday sale section one week.  So look there a couple of weeks if you are not in a hurry to get.<br /><br />4/14/11 It is cheaper to get get the smaller can on subscribe and save rather than this one!<br />25.75oz can with subscribe & save is 0.772/ounce (4 can pack) at 79.57/case (on subscribe and save)<br />31.75oz can is 0.858/ounce (4 can pack) at 109/case
