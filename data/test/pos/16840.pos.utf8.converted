I have tried many dried apple chips including all the varieties carried by Bare Fruit including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017I753O">Bare Fruit 100% Organic Bake-Dried Cinnamon Apple Chips, 2.6 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017IAMU2">Bare Fruit 100% Organic Bake-Dried Granny Smith Apple Chips, 2.6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>, my favorite of these all are the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017I96LI">Bare Fruit 100% Organic Bake-Dried Fuji Apple Chips, 2.6 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>.  They have a delicious nutritious flavor and satisfy that I wanna-crunchy-chip craving and are great right out of the bag or as an accompaniment to a sandwich or entree or on top of yogurt/ice cream, etc - well i can't think of one thing that these fuji apple chips wouldn't taste great with combo!<br /><br />I ordered mine from Amazon and they arrived with 11 months to expiration - that means we need to eat one bag a little more frequently than once per month - no problem!  We signed up for subscribe-n-save as we can eat them faster than that!  I can't imagine who wouldn't love these!  They are available at my local Jimbo's for $2.59/bag so I appreciate saving money buying them in bulk from Amazon subscribe-n-save!
