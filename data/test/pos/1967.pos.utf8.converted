We have two very critical and expressive adult female cats -- if they don't like the food, they go through the motions of burying the food as though they are covering up their messes in the litter box.  They may walk away from the food, but return to eat it all up -- they are the true reviewers of this product.  While they can't write or subscribe to Amazon's cat food subscription, they send us very clear messages about what they like and don't like.
