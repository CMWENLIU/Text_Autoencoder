I have Crohn's disease and eat an almost entirely starch- and sugar-free diet (which does wonders for the Crohn's). As my gut healed I began reading about how the sprouting of flours breaks down the starches in the flours. I decided to see if I could tolerate it. That was a year-and-a-half ago. I now regularly use this flour from this company (usually with a sourdough starter, and often with almond flour added) for pancakes, waffles, pizza crusts and sourdough bread, periodically. It tastes great and IS much easier to digest than normal wheat flour, which I simply can't eat anymore. Spelt, not incidentally, is somewhat lower in gluten than regular wheat flour also.
