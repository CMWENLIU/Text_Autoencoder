It doesn't happen often that I say this but this product SACO Cultured Buttermilk is better than the real thing.  I first used this over 10 years ago.  I love buttermilk waffles and despite my love for buttermilk on it's own to drink I seemed to consistently end up throwing away some before I used it all.  Not with SACO Cultured Buttermilk.  It mixes well in the dry ingredients and all you do is add the recommended about of water to hydrate it; that is in addition to whatever liquid the recipe calls for.  I've found that even the flavor is better, richer.  Just as with the real deal you must refrigerate it but the shelf life is HUGELY different.<br />I am now using this to make scones but I have made biscuits, dressing, pancakes and cakes with it and all have come out perfectly.<br />Give it a shot you wont be disappointed that it's better than buttermilk.
