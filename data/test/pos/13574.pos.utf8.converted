I purchased a package of these to take on a camping trip this last week.  I've tried other brands but they all tasted like cardboard.  I knew they were going to be ok when I was mixing them up, they actually smelled like...eggs!  I used just a little salt & pepper for the taste test; I didn't want anything else to hide their true taste.  I'm pleased to report that they were, for powdered eggs, great.  I'm planning on purchasing more and as good as these were, may not feel the need to take fresh eggs again.  So, if you're looking for something to take backpacking or car camping.  Trust me when I say these are worth the money and you won't be disappointed.
