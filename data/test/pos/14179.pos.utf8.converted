Please do not listen to the writers who had bad experiences. These seeds in cans are a good product, but additional information will help you to be successful. I have purchased a dozen of these cans and I have gotten plants from every can. You must be patient and keep the cans in a warm area of your house. I keep the can under a grow light and near a heat vent to keep it warm. The seeds do not need light to sprout but warmth helps a lot. Experts say ideal is for the dirt to be 80-90 degrees F. Germination can take 1-6 weeks so do not throw your cans away. Be patient! I have gotten 3-6 seedlings from every can. Water the seeds, then re-water when the top of the planting material is dry. The last can I bought I successfully got 4 plants started, and my current can just sprouted a plant after a week because I concentrated on keeping it warm.<br /><br />After the seedlings sprout let them grow for a time in the can. Water when the material they are growing in is dry on the surface. They hate too much water and will die quickly if over-watered. Wait until the seedlings have 4 leaves before transplanting. Dig deep when getting the seedling out of the can to transplant because the roots go straight down. Scoop down twice as deep as the plant is above the ground. They need to grow inside for 8-10 weeks before planting outside, and they take 160-180 days from planting to harvest. So calculating the time needed for germination and inside growth you need to start 12-16 weeks before you plan spring planting, then an additional 5-6 months for harvest. Total time can be 9-10 months start to finish. So if you plan to plant March 15th you need to start now. These chili peppers take a long time but are definitely worth it if you like hot chili peppers. Good luck, have fun.
