Wow, I don't know what to say about the "bad idea" review, and it's interesting because the company actually claims the lava salt has positive health effects. For what it's worth, we haven't noticed any change in our health, good or bad, since using this product.<br /><br />About six months ago a friend gave us some Palm Island Salts (black, red and green) as a housewarming gift and we really love them all. He works in one of those hippie/dippy health/organic foods stores down near Santa Cruz, owned by some very health-conscious people. I'm a meat-lovin' (grass-fed only), organic-produce-eatin' moderate, and it's the taste that causes me to buy this salt and the organic produce I eat, not the health claims.<br /><br />It's true this salt has activated charcoal as the third ingredient, behind "Natural Pacific Sea Salt" and "Premium Hawaiian Sea Salt," and ahead of "Hawaii Kai Ocean Essence," a trademarked blend of "ocean electrolytes, trace minerals, and elements." Sounds like health-nut market-speak to me, but it sure tastes good!<br /><br />Our favorite is the black, which is just amazing, but the red is a close 2nd. It's incredible what a difference it makes in the food we cook, compared to other sea salts we use, and all our guests take notice when I use it! We like the green too, but don't use it much. We still use Redmond Sea Salt for day-to-day cooking, and it's very good too, but whenever we want to add something special, we add the black or the red.<br /><br />We use it very sparingly, as it is quite strong in flavor. A single 6-ounce pouch is only half-empty after 6 months, so a little goes a long way. We actually use the red a little more, as it is nearly as good in taste and much better in appearance.<br /><br />Not that I doubt the above reviewer about the danger of activated charcoal, but it seems a safe product to me just judging from personal experience, and it is put out by a company that actually seems to have a conscience. You can check out their website at [...]<br /><br />If you have concerns about the charcoal, try the red!
