You know, they used to say that smoking was good for the lungs.  Now, we're told that a greasy little snack in a bag is "healthy."  But, while this isn't an apple or a cup of yogurt, Snapeas are a far cry from bright orange Doritas or Ding Dongs.  They are baked (not fried), and perhaps there is merit to the pea foundation, as opposed to the potato or corn chip format.  They are major addictive - full of unique flavor, a pleasantly crisp but foamy (as in styrofoamy) texture, a dash of saltiness, and just enough oilyness to satisfy.  Try these and then spread the word.
