This is a good, basic medium-full bodied olive oil. It has a nice smoothness to it with no pronounced taste....which is fine with me.<br /><br />It definitely is unfiltered!!  Be sure to shake it vigorously to get the full benefits....oodles of 'stuff' float'n around in there!<br /><br />UPDATE 11/13/2011: I just received my 2nd bottle of this really nice oil and I have upgraded it to 5 stars because this one has a nice pleasant "olive taste" to it. Also, I like how the glass bottle is made to minimize light getting to the oil.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/22/2012: I just read the other reviewer's comments about the "unfiltered" being suspect. Actually, I had reordered another bottle of "unfiltered" recently, and guess what!!, they actually sent me a bottle that was not marked "unfiltered". So, I can see how the reviewer received a bottle that is filtered. I contacted Amazon and they gave me a full refund and I was allowed to keep the one they sent me. I will not order olive oil from Amazon again.
