Like the other reviewer noted, never eat soy lecithin, despite it's claims it comes from GMO's soy which is very harmful, and soy is not meant for anyone anyways. [...]<br />I started buying this when I began making my own nut milks, mostly hemp, which gives it a nice creamy texture and prevents separation. (which is why it soy lecithin in about all processed foods)  Love sunflower products and eat them often. Very healthy, sustainable food source and great for the environment.  This is a great product, lasts a long time, depending on how you use it.  I put a spoonful in for my nut milks which lasts me a couple days.
