I started using Benecol Chews in June 2007.  I just recently had my cholesterol checked and I dropped significantly.  My last count was a total of 233 and the most recent count was a total of 190.  I was very thrilled.  I purposely wanted to get a new test before I ordered more Benecol Chews to make sure they were actually doing something for me.  I don't have to question the effects Benecol has had on me.  I attribute the drop in my total cholesterol to the Benecol Chews and adding more soluble fiber to my diet via oatmeal.  Look for oatmeal that contains at least 4 g of soluble fiber.  Most have just 1 or 2 soluble fibers.  Quaker Weight Control has 4 g of soluble fiber  and if you are familiar with Trader Joe's they have a Heart Healthy Oatmeal (Blueberry and Cranberry, Blueberry is my favorite) that also has 4 g of soluble fiber.  I also exercise regularly at least 4 time a week.  So I personally feel the combination of the above was the result of my drop in cholesterol.  I have highly recommended the Benecol Chews to family and friends.  Thank you.
