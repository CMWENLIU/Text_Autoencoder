When i opened the package, i was shocked to see half pound Reese's peanut butter cups. They look so big, its hard to think about eating one lol. Well after ten minutes, one was gone...and i felt so bad that I gave the other one to my sister. These things pack over 1100 calories each so make sure you had a light lunch!
