I originally bought this flour for pizza dough when I bought two heavy baking stones for my oven.  I was a total novice at the time, and the pizza dought came out superb.  This is indeed the flour that is required for a true Neopolitan pizza, according to the international standard promulgated in Naples.  When I found that I had a decent mastery of pizza dough, I decided to try my hand at baking ciabatta bread.  Once one acquires the discipline to actually follow the recipe, even though the hydration ratio seems impossibly high; and once one has the confidence to attempt what seems like folding water, one will be rewarded with a truly magnificent ciabatta.  The texture, the elasticity, and the airiness of the crumb are perfect, and the nutty flavor is addictive.  I can't recommend this flour highly enough.
