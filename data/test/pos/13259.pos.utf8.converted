Have been feeding Avoderm Lamb & Brown Rice to my German shepherds for many years.  Makes their coats silky and soft.  Saved the life of one of my shepherds who had open wounds, scabs, and welts from allergies of unknown cause.  Canine veterinary dermatologist/allergist could not help.  Special prescribed foods did not help.  Boiled potatoes and fish did not help.  Six weeks after starting Avoderm, my shepherd's skin problems were completely healed and have not returned in eleven years since then.  Would not ever consider buying anything else.  Amazon.com has the best price anywhere, worth the wait on shipping.  Thank you, Amazon.com, for offering this wonderful product at such a wonderful price*!*!*!*!*
