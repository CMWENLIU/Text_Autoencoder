My sheltie was starting to snub rawhide bones, even the flavored ones, and I was trying to find a chew she'd like as she can always use something to clean her teeth. I'd seen the Dingo bones before, but the bright red chicken jerky turned me off. Well, now I was willing to try anything. I first gave her a Dingo Dyno Stix, and watched her devour it over the course of a half hour. She meticulously pulled it apart and ate it until she'd gotten every last bit of chicken jerky. Only part of the innermost bit of rawhide remained. Success!<br /><br />So, she'd had a couple Dyno Stix, so to mix it up I gave her a Dingo Ringo.  More success!  She loved the ring shape, and it took her about 45 minutes to get all the chicken jerky out, so it was a bit more difficult for her to get the jerky than it was in the Dyno Stix.  However, once she'd gotten all the jerky out of the Ringo, more rawhide remained behind that she didn't eat.  I tossed it in the trash.  Despite more rawhide left behind, my dog still had a great time chewing on the Ringo, and I'll continue to buy them.  Also, they're a good single serving size for my sheltie.  However, if you have an 80 lb lab, these are probably too small, posing a choking hazard for a dog who likes to "gulp".<br /><br />For those wondering how big my dog is, she's a 30 lb sheltie, to give you a better idea of how long it might take your dog to eat a Dingo Ringo.
