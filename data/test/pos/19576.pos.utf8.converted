Purina Healthful Life Cat Chow is the only food that my cat, Sophie, will eat. I tried buying a few others when they went on sale and she just hated anything else. Sophie is a very picky eater; she'll refuse to eat cat food that she doesn't like. I'm not sure what makes this cat food taste so much better than the others, but Sophie loves it.<br /><br />Someone mentioned that they found insects in their cat food. This is a common problem with cat food. I haven't found any infestations in Healthful Life food yet, but I always toss a new bag in the freezer for four or five days before I feed it to Sophie. I read that this kills any insect eggs that may be in the cat food. It doesn't hurt the cat food to freeze it. If I stock up on more than one bag at a time, I keep the extras in the freezer until they are ready to be used.<br /><br />Amazon has a great price on this cat food; I've bought my last 4 bags online from Amazon and I'm thrilled not to have to go to several stores to find it. Many of the stores in my area don't carry this brand anymore.
