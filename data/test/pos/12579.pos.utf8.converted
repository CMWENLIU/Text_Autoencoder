Like most people, I was very skeptical about purchasing baklava online. From my experience, if one leaves out baklava out for a long time, it tends to get extremely hard and the honey drips all over the place. Not the case with this baklava. I received it in the mail a few days ago (I live in University housing and the mail system here takes a couple days to process) and the baklava tastes fantastic. Fresher baklava of course tastes slightly better, but I don't think it could get all that much better than this in terms of mail-order baklava. Highly recommended.
