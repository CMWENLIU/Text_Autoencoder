Listen, it all happened a few years ago.  I felt pretty good the night before, but when I awoke I had shooting pains in my left hip extending to my testicle.  Well, I went to the Doctor and as all regular doctors do, he pretty much told me to take an Advil and get back to him.  Well, not only didn't it help, but he billed my insurance over $400!  After extensive google searches, I decided to check out a Chinese traditional physician, and after checking out my Chi flow and other such things I won't bother you with, he wrote some scribble on a note (it was Chinese) and when I asked him what it meant, he said "RABBIT! You eat!".  Aha! Perhaps this was the cure I was looking for, and decided to procure one.  Needless to say, Pet stores were pretty horrified at my request of "One medicinal rabbit", and sent me on my way.  The next thing I tried was going out in the woods to hunt a rabbit.  But let me tell you, they are pretty FAST!  After trying many methods, such as a home-made spear, rocks, and just trying to chase it through the woods, not only did I not catch a rabbit, my Left hip and testicle hurt more than ever!  Finally, I found this rabbit on Amazon, and despite it being more expensive than Kobe Beef, I decided, "What the Heck!" and ordered it up.  When it arrived, it did not look very appetizing, but I cooked it up in something called "Hassenpfeffer" and when I told my roomate, he just said, "Whatever floats your boat, dude...carry on."<br />I ate my rabbit while watching an old rerun of "Man versus wild" and went to bed with a full stomach but not much hope that rabbit meat would cure me.  However, within just a few days, my hip and testicle were as good as new, and I will never question Chinese medicine again.  I already have an order in for a tiger bone, which supposedly is amazing in the dept of virility.<br />Bravo, rabbit meat! Excelsior!
