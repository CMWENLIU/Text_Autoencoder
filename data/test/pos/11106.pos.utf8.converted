I love coffee--not so much for the caffeine, but simply for the taste...or maybe it's just a habit that I can't break.  Every so often I decide that I'm going to "kick the habit" and I try to switch to green tea or some other tea that is naturally caffeine-free.  It never works, though.  I found Cafix in a health food store some years ago and I really liked it. It did the trick for me--a little soy milk and I was good to go.  However, when I ran out of it, I started drinking coffee again because the local retailer stopped carrying Cafix.  I just found Cafix here on Amazon and I'm going to order some since I'm back on my "giving up coffee" rant.  As long as I am, I know I can rely on Cafix for that coffee fix to which I am so accustomed.
