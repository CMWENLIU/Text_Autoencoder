I have fond memories of growing alfalfa sprouts as a kid. I had no idea that you even could sprout all these until recently. I eat pretty healthy -lots of organic and natural foods. A friend showed me this kit and I bought it right away! I've already sprouted the bean salad mix, alfalfa and peas. So far I love it. It is fun and easy to grow them and the best part is eating them! I think the alfalfa tastes better than store bought by far! It is organic and no worries of something "icky" being on them like in the store. I also got this kit quickly and well packed. Everything is labeled and in resealable bags. Very happy! Whenever I finally eat all these I'll be back for more.
