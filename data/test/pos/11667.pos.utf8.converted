After several attempts with gel colors I finally broke down and bought liquid colors.  I heard a lot about Americolor and I am so glad I listened!  I got the best red and black fondant colors for the graduation cake I was making.  I HIGHLY recommend this product for everyone who wants rich deep vibrant colors.
