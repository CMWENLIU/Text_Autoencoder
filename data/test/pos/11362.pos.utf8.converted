I've been buying this stuff since 1967 when you could buy a box of six packets for $.79.  I grew up on the stuff....every morning M-F for 40 years....well I miss some every now and then when travelling.  I am glad to see Amazon stocks it because it is sometimes hard to find the bulk cans in the local stores.
