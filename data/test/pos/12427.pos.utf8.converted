I'm an old guy and I've used whey protein for a lot of years.  I tried "Complete Whey Protein Vanilla Bean" about 3 years ago and I haven't used any other brand except one time when I ran out.  That just made me appreciate CWPVB even more.  I'm in my 70's and have always stayed in pretty good shape.  I can truthfully say that my muscle mass is as good as it was 40 years ago.
