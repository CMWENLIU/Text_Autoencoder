Perfect blend of spices with just a bit of oil to keep them firm yet dry. Perfect for salads, salsa, even a Martini. Too bad they never made it to a dish, so good just eat em right out of the pouch :)<br /><br />A side note, these olives would be great served on airplanes, they keep and they have a good design. They would also be great to take along hiking.<br /><br />Best  Wishes,<br />  E.A.C
