This 16 UMF does just what people are claiming it does..<br />but Beware of overuse..<br />I used this product along with apple cider vinegar,lemon and cayenne pepper...<br />to get rid of an aggressive sinus infection...<br />worked so well I avoided antibiotics and physician expenses..<br />but after taking 2-4 Tablespoons(Not Teaspoons) of manuka honey each day...<br />I found my nasal passages uncomfortably dry and bleeding...<br />next time i wont use it so liberally..<br />otherwise Works Wonders!!
