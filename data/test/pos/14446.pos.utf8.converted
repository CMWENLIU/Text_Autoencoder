Ever since Unilever bought Best Foods/Hellmann's and watered it down, I've been looking for a suitable replacement product because I refuse to buy Best Foods ever again. I tried several different products including Duke's, Blue Plate and various store brands before finding this obscure brand by Reily Foods, makers of Blue Plate. This is the richest and creamiest mayo available and is basically the same as what is called "heavy duty" in commercial settings. The taste is eggy (not oily like Duke's), not too tangy (Blue Plate is much tangier) and somewhat zesty due to mustard powder. The 4 main ingredients are soybean oil, egg yolks, vinegar and water which is how mayo is supposed to be. If you think I'm a bit obsessive about this, it's only because I HATE it when food makers change their products-didn't Unilever learn anything from the 1985 New Coke debacle? Find a winning formula and stick with it!
