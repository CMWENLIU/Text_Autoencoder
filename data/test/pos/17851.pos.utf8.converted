I initially purchased this because my daughter wanted homemade chicken noodle soup. Just when I thought that I couldn't have chicken noodle soup again ( being vegan) I find this seasoning. How pleasantly surprised I was too. I made my faux chicken noodle soup and the results were amazing! Not only is this base gluten free, low sodium, but vegan as well, and I can use this seasoning on other items as well, like salads and other soups and stews! A bit pricey, but well worth it!
