I began to gather my ingredients to bake a Tiramisu at home and needed Ladyfingers.  I went ahead and called three Local supermarkets (shoprite being the first) and two local bakeries to make sure I don't go out in vain.  However, no one had ladyfingers, nor a clue as to what the heck I was talking about. At this moment in time, I am very grateful to Amazon and online shopping, but yes I had to postpone baking the Tiramisu until the ladyfingers arrived.
