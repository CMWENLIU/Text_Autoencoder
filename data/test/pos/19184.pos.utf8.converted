I don't see how I lived without this!<br /><br />I let my coffee addiction subside (one cup a day but every day) and I needed some kind of caffeine alternative. What better than green tea!?<br /><br />Get your caffeine AND your anti-oxidants!<br /><br />I used one of those ball infusers and then a plastic one until I finally got a Finum stainless basket.... perfect combination... I put a cm of tea in the bottom and it blossoms up 20x by the time it's infused!<br /><br />I let it steep and steep and steep and make a nice strong tea! It's an acquired taste but delicious (and powerful!)<br /><br />My buddy says he doesn't like gunpowder teas generally -- I think he must have been traumatized by smoke-flavoured foods as a child. The tea IS smoky but not terribly or undesirably so. I love it.<br /><br />People who mix it with honey or milk etc can probably make a really lovely tasting green tea out of it... mellow and tasty.<br /><br />The beauty of this is that you just get so much tea for such a good price! Quality, delish, does the job.<br /><br />Can't recommend it enough.<br /><br />I'm hooked for life.
