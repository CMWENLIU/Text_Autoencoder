There is none finer than Peter Pan Peanut Butter. As a kid my Dad used to take a kitchen knife to mix the Peanut Oil into the Peanut Butter. Peter Pan, you can still see the peanut oil. The rest of the stuff on in the market is DRY and just crap. As I finish typing this review I will switch over and order more Peter Pan! Thanks for many years of something, not just good, GREAT!!
