Unlike some flavored k-cup coffee blends, Green Mountain's Wild Mountain Blueberry gets it just right! This blend is smooth and surprisingly "authentic" tasting.  Blueberry and coffee flavors don't immediately come to mind as the most compatible combo, but believe me, they we born to blend!  I highly recommend this coffee and it is definitely one of my all time favorite coffee flavors. However, since it is a milder brew, I wouldn't recommend it being brewed in the largest size.  Enjoy!
