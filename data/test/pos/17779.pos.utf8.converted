no doubt, after trying most honeys, this is the best (although everyones tastes may vary). two things set it apart from the next best one on the market, "really raw honey":<br />-organic<br />-firm texture<br /><br />  if you want a softer honey with the propolis (wax and some other pollen granules that are full of nutrition) go with the 'really raw' brand.  keep in mind, though, that its not organic and may have pollen from GE crops.
