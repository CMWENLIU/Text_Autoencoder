I have loved MarketSpice Tea since I first purchased it while on vacation at Pike Place Market in Seattle some years ago.  Because I live in the midwest, I was happy to see that MarketSpice tea can now be purchased at Amazon.com.  If you like a great, hearty tea, full of character, I recommend you try MarketSpice.  One whiff while it is brewing will convince you that here is an exceptional tea. Once you have tasted MarketSpice it will be hard to settle for any tea that doesn't have the great taste of MarketSpice.
