Rum cakes are a holiday favorite of mine.  I ordered directly from the Tortuga Rum Company last year, christmas 2008, and got the golden original 33 ounce and the blue coffee 33 ounce.  I really loved the original, the coffee wasn't as much to my liking.  The original was really moist while the other tended to be more dry.  I also had to pay shipping.<br />  This year I ordered thru amazon and saved over $10 on the cost of the cake and I got free shipping.  The rum cake itself is sealed in plastic inside the box to retain it's rum content and freshness.  I am an occassional drinker; rum, tequila, bourbon being my favorites.  I didn't think that the rum was overpowering; yes you can tell its there, but also the flavor of the cake complements it.  I think they have an excellent "Rum Cake" and this would be a great indulgence for the holidays.  Highly recommended.  I will have to order another before christmas cause mine is already gone.
