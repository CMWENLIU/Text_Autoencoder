Vitamuffins taste good, are healthy, have a lot fiber, and are low in fat and calories. It's rare to find this combination of traits. Unfortunately, the muffins are fairly expensive - around $1 per muffintop in the store. The upside is that Vitalicious sells the mix, which enables you to make many vitamuffins for an affordable price. I bought a muffintop pan, but you can also just put muffin top liners on a baking pan.<br /><br />These are the perfect afternoon stack when I'm craving something sweet. They're filling, tasty, and guilt free.<br /><br />The chocolate flavor is my favorite. I actually don't like any of the other flavors.<br /><br />Note that the muffins are recommended by weight watchers and hungrygirl.
