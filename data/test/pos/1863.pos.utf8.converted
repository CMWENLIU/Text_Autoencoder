I drink this daily - I mix it with a regular green tea that I brew all night and then make ice tea in the morning.  This tea is perfect for ice tea.  My sister says that it is the only tea that soothes her sore throat when she is sick.  This tea definitely has a unique flavor -you will either love it or hate it.  I love it.  I also love all the health benefits of Kombucha.  This will be a tea that I drink for the rest of my life!
