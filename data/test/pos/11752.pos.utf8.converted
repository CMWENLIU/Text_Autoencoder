I've loved Japanese green tea my whole life and have not found one yet that tastes as good as this one at this price, except for cups of tea served in Japanese restaurants. A couple reviews here mentioned how it compares to gourmet green tea.  I don't know what classifies a tea as gourmet, unless it's the price, and I don't know if I've ever had such a tea. But this Kirkland tea is so flavorful that I don't see why it matters whether it is gourmet class or not. It only matters that it tastes great, and it smells wonderful too. Even my spouse, who drank green tea only occasionally (and usually prefers Earl Grey), is thrilled with this tea and now drinks it almost every night. Don't worry about finding a better bargain.  It's only 19 cents a bag through Amazon, so what difference does it make if you can get it a few pennies cheaper elsewhere?  With such a great flavor, it's a bargain at almost any price.<br /><br />This tea has a wonderful grassy flavor -- the mark of a good green tea -- that is missing in so many commercial brands, and even many Asian brands you find here (and the tea is actually green, which isn't the case with all "green" teas).  Chinese green tea looks and tastes different from Japanese green tea -- less green and less grassy in flavor.  The box says there is green tea powder added, which must be part of the reason for the rich flavor.  The instructions say to add the excess powder inside the wrapper to your water. Generally, over-steeping green tea leaves it tasting bitter, but this one doesn't seem to get bitter when I do (any purist will tell you that adding sweetener or lemon to green tea is just not acceptable ;-).<br /><br />Each teabag is individually wrapped in a plastic pouch. The teabags themselves are nylon, which is stronger than the usual paper and less likely to tear. I admit I am a bit conflicted about buying this tea because I love the flavor, but the environmentalist in me is disappointed the bags and wrappers are not biodegradable. I also wonder if I should be concerned that it's not organic, but  I may never find out if it matters.
