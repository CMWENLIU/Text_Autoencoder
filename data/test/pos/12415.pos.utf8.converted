I grew up drinking authentic Moroccan Tea in Morocco. I recomment Davidson's Moroccan Mint Green Tea with full confidence that you will enjoy it too. The Quality Quantity and Price were all excellent. The delivery time and condition were impressive. I'm new to Amazon Online and to Davidson's products, but I will be a customer for a very long time now.<br /><br />Traditionally Moroccan Tea is made the following way:<br />1st Boil the Water untill bubbles form a ring on surface.<br />2nd Add Tea Leaves and Sugar (about 1tsp of leaves to 24oz of water)<br />3rd Boil a second time on low and monitor to prevent overflow.<br />*** wait about 5min before drinking to allow the process to finish<br />PS. if done correctly, the tea leaves should settle at bottom, so no infuser will be needed.
