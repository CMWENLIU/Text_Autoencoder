I have a very picky eight year old dauchand who would never eat regular dog food. We tried everything from Iams,Science Diet,and Eukenuba and Gretchen would have none of it. She hated "dog food". I read about Natural Balance while on the internet and went to the pet store ASAP and bought her a beef roll. When I got it home and opened it I was surprised that it actually smelled good just like a summer sausage. Gretchen loves it!! For the past three months this has been her primary food and she really loves it and it does not end up in the trash like all the other dog foods that she has tried that she would have nothing to do with. This really is a great product for a picky dog.
