Yes, you might pay a little more per cup but you also don't have to worry about getting stuck with 23 K-cups you'll never use. Pumpkin Spice anyone? I received ten different flavors in the this variety pack, some winners, some not, but at least now I know. This is a repackaged item, mine was packed in a brown paper bag, so keep that in mind if it matters to you. I'll order again.
