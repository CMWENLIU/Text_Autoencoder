I heard of this chocolate pb through a friend who raved about it. So I decided to give it a go. I wasn't exactly crazy about it at first, and wasn't too sure what to make of it. This PB is a grower.  The more you eat it, the more delicious it is. It has a wonderful balance of chocolate and PB and the plus is it's all natural. No hydrogenated oils like most commercial PB brands. My husband can't get enough of it. Amazon has the best price around. It goes for almost $6 a jar in NYC. It's a must have for us now.
