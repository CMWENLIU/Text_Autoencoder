You are getting the best Kimchi you can get if you live in a rural area<br />as I do.<br /><br />It's expensive because it's made fresh, delivered to your door in 24 hours<br />you even (i did) get a call from a very nice gentleman confirming that you got<br />your kimchi !<br /><br />5 STAR SERVICE IS hard to come by anymore.<br /><br />If you are having a dinner with more than 2 you should double your order unless<br />you  are going to combine you kimchi with some soups or other dishes/ side dishes.<br /><br />I suggest learning how to make your own.. which is the quest I'm on.<br /><br />maja
