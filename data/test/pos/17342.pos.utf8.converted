The first time I bought this, I accidentally bought the "human" version which I ended up saving for myself.<br /><br />I bought the pet version for my two cats the day of our cross country move, which included a day of flying in the cabin for my two cats.<br /><br />The product either worked really well or my cats were just so terrified they were absolutely silent the whole trip. We heard not a peep out of either one the entire 7 hour journey.<br /><br />The human version also works well for me - or it's psychological. Either way, I've had good results with this product (for both humans and pets).
