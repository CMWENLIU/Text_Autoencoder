I bought this coffee from Amazon on a whim because while I love gourmet coffee, I don't always like how much it costs locally. I was delighted to find that this whole bean coffee is absolutely delicious, with a fresh, rich, robust flavor. In fact, I just visited this page to buy another bag, it's that good! Highly recommended.
