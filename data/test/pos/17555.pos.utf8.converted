Crunchy, chocolatey with that coconut. Low glycemic with the agave. This treat is absolutely fantastic and it's organic to boot! It's wonderful to have a treat that is low in calories, good for your body (none of that overly processed low calorie snacks) and good for the earth. This is a staple of mine! Will definitely buy it again and again.
