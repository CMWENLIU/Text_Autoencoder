It would be difficult to find a better pure extract than this Nielsen-Massey offering.  Like several other reviewers here, I use a lot of this product in baking.  Over the years I have used quite a number of different brands, some out of necessity, and some out of curiosity.  I have yet to find a better one than this!  I do not want to sound like a snob, but the few dollars extra you pay for the real thing is worth it.  I cringe when I see the imitation vanilla on the shelves of grocery stores, as I know how much difference the flavor of the final product will be when using it.<br /><br />Quite often, even with the better grocery store brands, you get a strange and rather unpleasant after taste.  Not so with this stuff!  It should also be noted that the flavor here is extremely intense, so slightly smaller amounts are called for in some recipes.<br /><br />It always seems a shame to me to got to all the trouble of making a cake, or any dish for that matter, and not strive for perfection, giving it up for a relatively few saved cents.<br /><br />In addition to cooking needs, I have found that if you moisten the tip of your finger just slightly with this product, and rub just a small amount in a small area on the bulb of your bedside lamp, you get the most marvelous and sensual aroma...not overwhelming, but just slightly lingering.  Wow!<br /><br /> I really cannot see how you can go wrong here.  The price is equivalent to what I have been paying locally and an 8 oz bottle will last quite some time with reasonable use.
