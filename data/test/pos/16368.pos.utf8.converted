I'd started buying this product a long time ago from a local organic/natural food store.  I don't allow any other brand in my house because of what's not in it.  My kids love the crunch and taste.  Food tastes so much better when it doesn't have the added preservatives and artificial flavor enhancers.  Some of those flavor enhancers that you find in other food can be found in shampoo and conditioner and those companies will say that they're flavor enhancers when it reality those artificial things keep them fromturning rancid.  If you have children this is a great healthy snack and MOMS' don't have to worry.
