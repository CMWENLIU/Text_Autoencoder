I own a small bulk/natural food store and my customers were asking for almond butter. I didn't want to start out by carrying large jars of nut butters if I wasn't sure they would sell so I purchased Justin's squeeze packets just to give them a try. Each packet, whether peanut butter or almond is around 200 calories and is SALT-FREE. I love the convenience of little packets and my customer apprecaite trying a small quantity before buying a large jar. I love the almond butter, and hope at some point they will make it certified organic.
