I'm not nearly as picky about the variety of flavors so I'm not unhappy about the duplications.<br /><br />When I first bought them, I started with Root Beer, Watermelon, orange oil and cotton candy.  I used too much and wasn't pleased with the flavor results.<br /><br />What I've learned since:  Use a dropper to measure the amount of flavoring!  Use orange oil with only SIX DROPS PER LITRE. It was my error in the beginning that made the products seem bad.  Root Beer in particular is very bitter if you use too much.<br /><br />I purchased these to use with my Soda Stream soda maker and Sweat Leaf Stevia sweetener.  The vials seem small, but they make quite a bit when you use them sparingly.  I now keep a dropper handy for measuring.<br /><br />I'm simply having a ball choosing what flavor of soda I am drinking for the day.
