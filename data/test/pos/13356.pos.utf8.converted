I actually bought this honey to wash my face with because I have heard raw honey helps with acne.  My cousin washes her face with this every morning and evening and it completely cleared up her acne, so I thought I'd give it a shot. The main reason i wanted to right this review though is because i recently had to have a spot that looked like skin cancer on my back removed and the instructions to take care of it were to cleanse and put vaseline and a new bandage on it twice a day.  Ofcourse, it got infected after about a week and a half even though I was following the instructions (telling someone to put vaseline on that kind of wound to heal is dumb anyway and should not have followed that).  I'm not prone to getting infections in cuts and what not and usually heal pretty quickly so I was surprised. When I called the dermatologist they told me I had to take antibiotics. I don't feel that antibiotics are always necessary for an infection and decided to try to heal this by myself first and if absolutely necessary turn to antibiotics. I decided to put the raw honey on it after I cleansed, it actually has almost the exact same texture as vaseline and after about an hour of it being on it started to feel itchy and like it was healing.  I woke up the next morning and it already looked so much better.  I'm on day three of doing this and it looks like it is almost healed. This honey has basically healed and cured an infection which is amazing and I believe that this product actually has all the enzymes, vitamins, and antibacterial properties it says it has. I'm truly impressed!
