I had no interest in Halvah. I hated the texture and the taste. But my wife likes it, so when this went on sale, I bought a box of the pistachio and a box of the "deluxe" for her. She was pleased with the products, but to my great surprise, I found I also enjoyed both flavors very much! The texture is slightly crumbly; it is not cloyingly sweet; the bars contain real pistachios or other nuts. This was a terrific buy, given the price and quality.
