To be completely and 100% fair, I have tried this product before and enjoyed it.  The only part that concerns me is that this product is manufactured in China, with no information on the sources of the fruits. On their website they say they "source fresh fruit" and that " We are not concerned about issues surrounding where our product is produced because we take great care to ensure the quality and food safety of our products."  I'm not suggesting that this product is bad (which is why I gave it 5 stars) but I share more of a concern than evidently the company does, as to where they are getting this fruit, processing it and shipping it.  With the history China has had with kid's toys/formula/etc in the past, let's just say we don't feed these products to our child.  I would love it if the company would provide a tour and exact explanation of the process and sources, rather than discounting that information all together.
