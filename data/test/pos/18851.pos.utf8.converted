My favorite milk beverage. The local supermarkets don't stock this any more. Not sure why -- maybe it's old fashioned or something. Thanks to Amazon, I now have my malted milk again. The large container is about 3 times the size of the typical jar at the grocery store.<br /><br />This product is slightly different than the product sold in the plastic jar at the grocery store. The grocery store product dissolves instantly in cold milk, while this product does not. The ingredients seem to be the same. The trick I use is to put the powder in the empty glass and add a *very* small amount of milk. Mix until it's a thick liquid, and then fill the glass with milk while stirring.
