I had read the reviews, decided to order this despite some other peoples views and I am so glad I did! This doesn't have the horrible smell and taste of the instant powdered milk. This product tastes just like milk, using reverse osmosis water straight out of the tap, room temperature. I have a Vitamix so lumps, dissolving issues that others complained about, were non existent. This milk is so creamy! How can it be non fat and so creamy? It seems creamier than the whole milk I buy. I see some serious yogurt and cheesemaking in my very near future. Buy this, you'll be very pleasantly surprised. I'm going to test this on my teenagers, bet you they can't tell the difference from the $4-$5 gallons of milk I buy daily, either. Thank you Bob!<br /><br />UPDATE:  I tested this milk on my teens, they suggested I add a teaspoon or two of sugar to every gallon. I did, and now they beg me to make it. Very creamy, very good milk with a lot less calories than the red cap milk I normally bought. I was wondering what another reviewer meant when he said there was foam underneath, I know what he meant now  &lt;laughing>.  If I put a higher milk powder to water ratio, it makes terrific cream for my coffee. I ordered this milk to be delivered monthly as well.
