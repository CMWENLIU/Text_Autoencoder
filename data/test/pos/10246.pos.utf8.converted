It's the best! No one other brand compares. My Mom first discovered it a few years ago, when my older sister and her family took a trip to France. They brought back the Milka bar, and Mom and I fell in love! Now every time they go to Europe, my Mom always requests the premium "Milka Alpine Milk Chocolate" bar.<br /><br />Milka is produced in several European locations (i.e., Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Turkey). Unfortunately, availability in the US is slim; best bet is thru an online candy merchant or perhaps any of your local international stores. Nowadays I don't enjoy most American based products, as they are usually artificially flavored. In contrast, Milka is 100% natural! The taste and quality is superb--rich and creamy. No one beats it.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!
