With 5 effective "net carbs" (take carbs subtract fiber content= net carbs), this pasta is the poster child of the diabetic eating clinic. How does it taste? I donated all my other pastas and stocked up on this stuff! It's delicious! It doesn't require much to make you feel full. Add a tomato with some pasta sauce, yum! Remember to weigh or measure your portions as you don't need a lot of this to make you full!<br />If you are diabetic and really want a delicious pasta, buy this, don't delay, you won't be disappointed. I gave it to my family and nobody knows I've changed a thing. They never liked the high fiber pasta's either (the pastas were gritty and brown). Dreamfields isn't like this at all!
