As we all know, the world is about to be consumed by a massive blob of crude oil gushing out of a hole in the floor of the Gulf of Mexico. The oil rig that made the hole in the Gulf floor in the first place was owned by a little Mom & Pop concern called British Petroleum. "BP" is a scrappy little underdog of an oil company that was just trying to compete with the other giant, evil oil companies. They are the noble little corner grocer whilst other oil companies are analogous to Wal-Mart and as such the oil rig used by BP didn't have all the bells and whistles of the oil rigs used by the "Big Box" oil companies, bells and whistles like a simple battery that was supposed to have powered the alarm system that would have stopped this entire disaster from happening. You just know those batteries have got to be VERY expensive if it's cheaper to take a chance on a disaster that will cause untold and possibly global economic and environmental damage. We can't hold the lack of obviously expensive safety equipment against BP however, as oil companies operate on the slimmest of margins and usually don't return much of a profit to The Stockholders, who are people too.<br /><br />  BP tried to stop the gusher with something called a Top Hat and then a Hot Tap. These didn't work so they moved to their well thought out and scientifically tested Plan C, which was to stop the oil gusher by shooting golf balls into it. Surprisingly this didn't work so they attempted to shoot other things into the hole, up to and including: tennis balls, those tiny sponge dinosaurs that grow to enormous size when you get them wet, Swanson Hungry Man dinners(abandoned when deemed more dangerous to ocean life than the oil cloud), a gelatinous sludge vacuumed out from behind Kirstie Alley's knees and the entirety of Rush Limbaugh.( Adding Rush to a monstrous cloud of oil only resulted in a larger and more powerful Limbaugh, which is still being combated by the military as I write this).<br /><br />  Luckily, those feisty little can-doers down at BP hit upon a sure fire idea. They are going to shoot thousands of tons of fresh whole rabbits into the hole. Why will this work when the other methods failed to produce results? Let me answer your question with a question of my own...What is the universal symbol of luck in modern society? The rabbit's foot. And these whole rabbit carcasses are lousy with them. BP engineers have determined that these rabbit carcasses, because of the association between rabbit feet and superstitious luck, have a greater chance of plugging that hole than almost any other method. A wise man once said that any problem the mind of man can set, the mind of man can solve. So I'm not worried folks, this time things are sure to work out. If they don't however, I'd warn any leprechauns you care about to leave the country for a long, long time.
