I love wehani, have eaten it for years and go out of my way to find/buy it.  Have never had a guest who didn't love it too - my experience has been that people who don't care much for brown or white rice often clean their plate and ask for more.<br /><br />I'm a rice eater, and have a preference for simple preps.  Typically it's just steam and serve as a side dish.  It is a bolder and more complex flavor than many rices are, so I tend to serve it with red meat or pork, not chicken or fish.  That said, it's spectacularly beautiful and really yummy.
