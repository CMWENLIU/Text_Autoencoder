I was very pleasantly surprised when I first tasted one of these cookies!  They were soft and tasty--much like my home-baked peanut butter cookies--only better since I tend to over-bake mine!<br /><br />I have many allergies so it's difficult for me to find pre-made cookies I can safely eat.  Barley and corn starch, which I am very allergic to, find their way masked in many ingredients for pre-made food products.  I was very glad to find the ingredients in these cookies are safe for me:  Peanut Butter;  Molasses; Eggs; Rice Syrup and Grape Juice; Flour Base (Brown Rice Flour, White Rice Flour, Tapioca Starch, Sweet Rice Flour, Xanthum Gum); Dry Roasted Peanut Pieces; Gluten-free Natural Flavor, Baking Soda; Sea Salt. This means they are gluten-free as well.<br /><br />With only 11g of carbohydrates, 7 g of sugar, and 3 g of protein, I can indulge with 2 for a mid-day snack without the guilt!<br /><br />If you are too busy to make home-baked cookies yourself, these are certainly a viable alternative...and they're quite healthy, too!  Highly recommended!
