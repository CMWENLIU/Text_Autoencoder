These are the best brazil nuts we have tried! They are large, fresh, sweet-tasting nuts. I like that they are natural, not soaked in oil and coated with salt! Brazil nuts are very healthy and we eat some every day. The price is excellent. All of our containers were intact and tightly sealed. The packaging may not be fancy, but who cares - it is the nuts you are buying! I would not hesitate to include these in a gift basket - just wrap the package in a little sheer fabric tied with a bow. These are a pantry staple for us.
