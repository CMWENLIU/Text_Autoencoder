Nevermind what was said about the lemon..Hummus is supposed to be seasoned with lemon???...ans LOTS and LOTS of Olive Oil too!  This is by far the BEST "instant" Hummus mix ever, and I have tried quite a few in my time.  It makes a party size (15-20 peeps) serving and leaves the bowl licked clean..everytime!  Try it you won't be disappointed..unless you don't like lemon??? (Who doesn't like lemon?)  By the way, I squeeze a BIG OL' HUNK of lemon all over mine after it has chilled :)
