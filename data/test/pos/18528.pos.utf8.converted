I was never a really big fan of ZICO natural before ... until the bottle came out. Honestly, I absolutely LOVE, LOVE the nuttier flavor and can't drink enough of it. It's significanlty more drinkable for someone who's never had coconut water a part of their daily diet.  The original flavors are great, Mango and Passion. I first fell in love with ZICO by drinking the Passion, then I started to wanting less flavor and transitioned to Mango. But never full latched onto natural. Though, I've been wanting to make the switch.<br /><br />With the bottle now, it's what I've been waiting for. I LOVE IT!!! It's amazing to just chug it cold after a hard work out, and you know it's packed with natural electrolytes, potassium, and so much more. Great for your skin and internal system. Overall it's just an amazing beverage. I can't stop raving about it to all my friends, family, and fellow athletes. Currently, I'm training for an aquathon, and I don't know how I did it before. But there's no going back now.<br /><br />My other favorite in the bottle is Lima Citron. It's so tasty. It just brings me back to my childhood since the smell reminds me of Fruit Loops! And it taste just as yummy, but sooo much better for you.<br /><br />Look I'll be honest. The bottle isn't tetra, and it's not meant to be. Tetra is great in it's own right, but this new line has proposed another fabulous alternative to all those who love coconut water but needed more versility with the on-go lifestyle. So credit is due for that.<br /><br />I'm super stoked that ZICO gave us consumers two options: tetra and bottle. And I'm going to enjoy both fully!! It's just wonderful to switch up the flavors. Somedays I'll have Natural others Mango. When I'm training, it'll be the bottle. At the office, it'll be the tetra. Any way you look at it, ZICO is helping me be healthier whether it's in the bottle or tetra.  It's just a personal preference at this point. So try it and be your own judge.<br /><br />Besides when I found out that the bottle is actually more environmentally friendly, I was happily surprised. Tetra isn't recylced by many plants nationally. 30% of the bottle is made from recylced materials and is 100% recylcable(including the cap - unlike water bottles). Personally, this is important to me.<br /><br />And I agree with the other reviewers with regards to the concentrate and the decrease of their carbon foot print. It's true and relevant.<br /><br />ZICO, thank you for the amazing products you continue to give to us, and most importantly thank you for promoting a healthier, more hydrated lifestyle in a fabulously tasty way via bottle or tetra. Here's to you in breaking the mold and trying to help more people with your new bottle while still keeping tetra for those who've become so loyal. Hat's off!!! You've now acquired another fan for life!!!<br /><br />Cheers!!!!<br /><br />P.S. ZICO is still amazing.
