I actually conducted an informal POLL of people's opinions of the best instant coffee over on Recipezaar's "Community" chat forum and 8 out of 10 cooks there opted for this one! There were many respondents, 30 or 40, to my poll. I, too, was of that same opinion, having tasted every major instant coffee available. "Taster's Choice" brand was a way-back second place winner. It IS good coffee but it's usually the most expensive brand at the average grocery store.<br /><br />This is one of the few products which is not only the best in quality, it's also nearly the cheapest. I buy mine at The Family Dollar Store chain -- they always have it. The seven-ounce size fits nicely in one's cabinet and last a pretty good while, (I'm the only coffee drinker in my home, 1-2 cups per day). This is usually the size that I buy.<br /><br />If you haven't tried instant coffee in awhile, you should give it a go because it has improved 100% over the years. The key is to make sure that your water is actually BOILING as it is poured into a pre-warmed cup, (just run hot tap water over it for a few seconds). Also, experiment with the amount of coffee that you use. I use one "slightly heaping" teaspoon, (which is a very inexact measure), but you will soon determine how strong or weak you like it.<br /><br />Another tip, treat WATER as an INGREDIENT in any form of cooking! Don't boil plain tap water for your instant coffee -- use pure "spring (bottled) water". Read bottled water labels closely to assure that you're not just buying "purified" water, which usually originates from some polluted river source, (municipal water treatment), and which is a huge bottled water ripoff and a very widespread problem!<br /><br />If you want to go to the ultimate extreme for excellence and you drink your coffee with cream, then use REAL CREAM. It will keep much longer in your refrigerator these days because the producers are now using a process called "ultra-pasteurization" for most brands. Reach into the very back of the cooler at the grocery store and get a good "sell by" date on your dairy products when you buy them. The best dates are always in the back of the inventory because grocers rotate their stock that way.<br /><br />For sweetener, I often use "Pure Organic Tupelo Honey" which is twice as good as common clover honey. It can be obtained online from apiaries in the Florida panhandle.<br /><br />Nescafe is a superior product and a superb bargain and I give it my highest recommendation.
