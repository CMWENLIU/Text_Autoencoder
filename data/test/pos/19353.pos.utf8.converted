Canella is REAL cinnamon from Sri Lanka, not the cinnamon most Americans use which is actually a cousin of canela, called Cassia. Real cinnamon (canela) is milder and has no heat, so will not upset your stomach. Usually canela is ground right when you need it, but the powder is also available. (If the spice is called cinnamon on the label, but is not from Sri Lanka, it is probably cassia.) If you want the "punch" of cinnamon (say in curry) this is not the kind to use. But in baking, sweets, hot cocoa, it is PERFECT! We use the stick as stirrers, too, to let the spice gently infuse itself into the drink.
