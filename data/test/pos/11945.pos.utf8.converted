These come out to about 1$ a bar or less, and if you consider them about a third the size of a 'normal' bar....it's about average price in raw bar world.  Granted, the bar is tiny, only 60 calories and thin; but I LOVE that!  It's easy portion control and just the right size for me when I am on the trail or in between meetings. Don't expect a meal replacement, it's just a small snack; but it works out for my lifestyle quite nicely. It's also raw and delicious!
