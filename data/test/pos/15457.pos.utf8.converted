I was looking for a good source of crab meat over the internet and happened to see this item on Amazon.  I took a chance on Miller's and I'm glad I did.  The meat had not only great visual appeal but was tender and sweet--easily as good as Pacific Cove ($30 per pound) or Blue Star ($40 per pound). Highly recommended.
