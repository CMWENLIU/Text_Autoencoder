I'm training for my first marathon, and order a package of these after hearing good things about them on a message board about marathons.  I have to say, I've been very happy with how they work for me.  I was really having problems maintaining pace after the two hour mark, and had tried various gels, etc. but always seemed to lose about 2 minutes/mile off my pace after two hours.  It may have been training breakthrough, it may have been strictly pyschological, but after I started snacking on the beans at the 1:45 mark, I started sustaining pace, and have actually been able to knock out my last mile on the same pace as my opening mile.<br /><br />Of course, not garunteed to work for everyone, everyone's system processes these things differently, but for right now, I'm believing in the magic beans.
