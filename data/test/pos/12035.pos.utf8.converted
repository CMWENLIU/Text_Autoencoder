Grand children, and my wife, love the flavor of these snack crackers and so do I.  This is a perfect individual size for putting in soups or just snacking.  We like to have lots of these on hand and with these individual bags they are just about perfect.  No worrying about them drying out or not making it back to a closed container by little hands.
