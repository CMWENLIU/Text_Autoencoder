A healthy diet is important to me so eating whole grains and fiber is a priority. Of course, like a lot of people, my morning routine is usually scheduled with me spending as little time as possible on each chore.<br /><br />Problems: I want fiber and whole grains. I'm rushed in the morning.<br /><br />Solution: Fiber One.<br /><br />Fiber One is a whole grain, high fiber cereal that contains 14 grams of fiber per serving (60% of the daily value), 0 grams of sugar and just 60 calories.<br /><br />The taste of Fiber One is just fine, but I usually like a little more variety, so I use it half and half with my other cereal. I fill the bottom of my cereal bowl with Fiber One, then layer in my usual whole grain, high vitamin and antioxidant cereal. Just pour in some low-fat milk, and it's ready. With a glass of orange juice and a slice of 100% whole wheat toast, it makes for a tasty and healthy start to my stress-filled and difficult day!
