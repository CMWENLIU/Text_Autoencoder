Sent for this after reading some info on its benefits. Wasn't sure if I was being duped for another old-wive's-tale or not.<br /><br />Taste was really good, but did take some getting used to since it did have a lot of the plant/flower taste left.<br /><br />If you think sucking down all of those cups of coffee is carrying you through your day, ditch 'em and try a spoonful of this in a cup of tea- you'll not only be ALIVE, but it will laste for quite some time- like... one cup and a few hours later you'll be wondering, "why am I so on fire today?!" ... like I did. :)<br /><br />Really wish that I still had this around, but unfortunately the giant ant hill that is San Diego took this as its prisoner- I forgot to screw the lid on all the way one night and woke up to find a small universe of ants swarming the entire container, inside and out.<br /><br />Will be ordering again, and again.
