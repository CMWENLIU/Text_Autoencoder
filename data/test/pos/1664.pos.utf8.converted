Okay, so I heard about the amazing Shirataki noodle and decided to give it a try.  After MUCH research and deliberation I decided to try both the "miracle noodle" (zero calorie, glucomannan, no tofu) and the House Foods (40 calorie per bag, tofu and yam flour) varities.  BOTH arrived today, so I decided to try both and give an unbiased review.<br />#1 - Anyone who says these noodles have a repulsive odor, has never eaten fish before.<br />#2 - anyone who says these noodles have a repulsive texture, has never eaten ramen, or udon noodles before.<br /><br />I put a small pot of boiling water on the stove, brought to a boil.  Opened the bag, put noodles into a strainer, and rinsed 10-15 seconds under cold water.  Then I put the noodles in pot of boiling water.<br /><br />I purposely sniffed the bag.. and yes.. it has a medium to mild "fishy" odor, nothing worse than salmon.  If you don't like this, then don't sniff the bag.  The "miracle noodle" had slightly less of this odor.<br /><br />I purposely sniffed the boiling water after about 1 minute, and yes, it had an odor, not so much fishy anymore, as almost plastic-y.. kind of hard to describe... again, don't sniff the steam if this bothers you.<br /><br />After 3 minutes of boiling (for the House foods brand), and 2 mintues (for the miracle noodle brand), I poured into the strainer again, and rinsed with HOT water for 10 seconds.  I then drained, and put back into the small pot, and added half a flavor packet from a pack of ramen noodles (chicken flavor).<br /><br />IT TASTED JUST LIKE RAMEN!  I was very excited.  The noodles (as other reviews state) have no flavor on their own, but take on asian flavors nicely.  As for being a "spaghetti substitute," these would probably do the same as if you put ramen noodles under some spaghetti sauce.. not quite right.. but not the fault of the noodles, just not the intent of an asian noodle.<br /><br />As for the texture, these noodles actually get FIRMER as you cook them, instead of softer (like regular noodles).  If your're a fan of "al dente" pasta, then this is for you.  YES &lt; they are a bit firm, but not hard like rubber bands (like other reviews have said).  And not slimy in the slightest, I don't get why people have said this (again, felt just like ramen noodles in my mouth).  I love al dente pasta myself, and found the texture preferable to normal ramen noodles.  The "miracle noodle" is slightly firmer, and more transluscent (like more tradition ramen noodles).<br /><br />I ate one bag of each, and loved every bite of both.  This was also about 4 hours ago, and I felt full this whole time (not uncomfortably full, just not hungry).<br /><br />I'm VERY glad I took a chance on this.  Perhaps if you have a picky pallet, this isn't for you.  But if you like Ramen noodles, then I'm telling you give these a try.  One bag (of either) is about the same volume as one packet of Ramen noodles, but at a fraction of the calories (or zero in the case of miracle noodles).  I plan on experimenting with other spices, such as bullion, and asian "flavor packets" found at the grocery store.<br /><br />Hope this helps!!
