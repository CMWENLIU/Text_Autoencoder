I make a meal using one cup of raw rice heated in olive oil, then cooked in water with three cups of frozen mixed vegetables and four Tyson chicken thighs.  There is no seasoning added.  When I used this rice instead of ordinary white rice, my husband commented on how delicious it was compared to the usual.  Texmati brown rice added a delicate perfume to the dish which complemented perfectly the mild flavors of the other ingredients.
