I get this as a birthday or Christmas present every other year or so.  I was sad to see one user returned this unused and said it was a bad value.  It's true, it is not a value item.  It is however, a luxury item.  If you go to the grocery store and buy a $5 or a $10 bottle of balsamic vinegar and then taste this then you will understand the difference.  If you like Vodka, it is like the difference between a fifth of Popov's for $5 and a bottle of Grey Goose for $40.  If you are looking for value, don't buy this.  If you want something you can use on salads, breads, sandwiches, strawberries, or even ice cream, then this is the finest balsamic I have ever tasted.<br /><br />My last bottle went quicker than normal because I will not go back to normal salad dressing.  Yes it's that good.  I am going to buy some more today because the prices at Williams Sonoma can range from $24 to $50 for different brands.  Hope this helps.
