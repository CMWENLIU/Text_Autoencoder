I'd been without pizza pie for so very long and going pizza free was one of the hardest parts of becoming gluten free. Now I make pizza every week!<br /><br />GF foods are never going to act exactly like the wheat varieties, you probably know that by now. When I roll this soft dough on my pizza stone, my hands and roller must be wet with water. A gentle touch is all it needs. I find that using a circular motion as my final move gives me a little 'ditch' to catch any errant sauce.<br /><br />The dough bakes a few minutes without toppings. I find pricking the dough with a fork prevents excess rising. After this first baking, I think one could fill half and fold over for a large calzone, but I've not tried this yet. Normally I top with a Picante sauce, precooked sausage, broccoli, sliced carrots, onions, peppers of several varieties and whatever else is handy. As I'm also casein/dairy sensitive, I use Nutritional Yeast in place of cheese. NY will never be stringy as it's a powder; but it adds a unifying color and extra 'cheezy' taste. The second baking is about 15 minutes. Because my 'cheese' cannot bubble, I use steaming and color of the crust's edge as my done guides.<br /><br />One box of mix makes two crusts. I freeze the uncooked one for the next week. This way a 4-pack lasts me two months and works perfectly for the auto-ship process.<br /><br />Note: If you use raw shrimp on your pizza... drain them very well and pat dry with paper towel. They are delicious even if you don't :-)<br /><br />Love and Light,<br />Pat
