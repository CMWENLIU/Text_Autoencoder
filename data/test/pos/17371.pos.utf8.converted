With K-Cups being so expensive, I haven't ordered much for a while.  Most prices are over .60 per cup.  That's a lot of money a month for two daily cups of coffee.  Nothing is cheap, and neither are these at about .50 per cup.  I remember the good ol' days when the K-cups were not more than about .35 each, and it wasn't that long ago.<br /><br />I have been buying K-Cups at Costco most recently, and the Tully's they carry are okay.  Newman's Own are just okay too.  Those run .475 per cup, so that's been a little better.  This Martinson coffee comes close to the same price as the ones at Costco, but the flavor is superior.  This is the first cup of coffee I have in the morning. It's got a richer flavor, fresher somehow, than the others I have tried.
