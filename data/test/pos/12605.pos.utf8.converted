PLEASE NOTE: The product reviewed here is MUSSINI BALSAMIC GLAZE, two 5.7 oz bottles for $21.54.And it IS available. (also available as two 16.9 oz. bottles for $32.55) A while back, when it became unavailable, Amazon let my review for it remain on my personal review pages, but chopped off the product name and price so nobody reading it would have a clue what it was I was reviewing and what it cost. It's been back in stock for over a year but try as I might, I STILL I can't get Amazon to fix the untitled, not-available version of this review on my personal pages. (Obviously those of you reading it on the Mussini product page know full well what it is and what it costs, so  apologies for the digression.) Now...on to the review for this marvelous product. --SharonIsch 5/27/09<br /><br />This glorious glop is the new absolutely indispensable addition to my pantry. A friend brought me some from Rome recently (different brand, Leonardo, which I'd prefer if only I could get it, but the Mussini's close enough and the price is right). It's rich and thickish, just a tad sweet, comes in a squirt bottle and instantly jazzes up--in both taste and looks--just about anything you choose to drizzle it over. It's my new salad dressing of choice--perfect over mixed greens with some nuts, fruit and feta, wonderful over steamed or grilled veggies like squash. The label suggests you can even use it over ice cream, which I tried once just to see and it actually wasn't bad, but I'll probably not do it again. It lasts longer than you'd think from the size of the bottle, as you'll only use a little at a time. I'm planning to try one of the flavors next. And come December I'll doubtless be giving lots of it as Christmas gifts. When I was running low on the stuff from Italy I went online trying to find a source for more and, wouldn't you know it, the only place outside Italy I could find it was on Amazon. Can't imagine sometimes why I ever bother looking elsewhere for anything (well, the new refrigerator maybe, although Amazon did even have a few of those, believe it or not.) Update, August 2008: Also try the fig flavor. It's especially good on fruit and salads containing fruit.
