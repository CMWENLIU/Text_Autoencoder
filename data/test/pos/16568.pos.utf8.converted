Since my roommate brought home a bag of these, they've been eaten nearly daily in our house! They've got a great texture and can satisfy a meat eater without being so overly meat-like which might bother some vegans and vegetarians. We use them in stir-fry and fajitas, but I'm sure you could toss them in just about any recipe that would call for something meaty. We use Better Than Bullion <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N7YKQK">No Chicken Base</a> in the water and the curls soak the flavor right in to them. They're great. They're loved and eaten by the two vegans in our household AND by all of the meat-eating family and friends we have over!
