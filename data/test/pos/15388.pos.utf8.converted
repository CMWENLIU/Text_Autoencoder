First off i think this is a great value.  The bag is huge and lasts forever even if you make a shake every day.  My husband buys isopure protien and that stuff is so expensive and contains all kinds of sugur ect.  but this hemp protien is great for smoothies.  I like to add it to skim milk, rice milk, coconut milk, some berries, maybe a bannana & i add a tbsp of psyllium as well.  it taste great in my opinion, not like a  sweet sugary smoothie, but like a nutty flavor.  even my kids like to have a little scoup in there milk, they love it!! A great buy :)
