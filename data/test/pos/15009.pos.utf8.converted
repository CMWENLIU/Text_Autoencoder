B&M Brown Bread (in cans)- with or without raisins...I sent for these cans because I'd eaten this brown bread many, many times years ago.  We had it at home every time we had baked beans for dinner.  They just go together.  I had kind of forgotten about the bread until my sisters and I began reminiscing recently about our favorite childhood meals. We all remembered how much we liked the brown bread and hadn't bought any in awhile. Then we went shopping for this brown bread and nobody carried it in the stores around here. How disappointing! A whole new generation will never know about this bread or how good it is...and how well it goes with baked beans.  I ordered several cans and shared them with family.  I will have to order more pretty soon. It still tastes as good as I remembered.  They almost need to reintroduce it to the public...the younger generations don't know anything about it. I hope they keep making it and I sure wish they still had it in our local grocery stores. (Portland, OR)
