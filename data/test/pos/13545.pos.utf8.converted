I love Vplenish!!  I always seem to forget to take my vitamins.  But now I leave a bowl of the packets on the counter and I just sprinkle it into my coffee every morning.  My kids 7 & 9 help themselves to a packet with their juice every morning.  I plan on leaving a bowl of Vplenish out all the time!
