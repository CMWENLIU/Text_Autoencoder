Both my nursing baby and I have to be on a gluten-free, cook-from-scratch diet right now, and millet is about my favorite of the non-gluten grains. I cook it like rice--1 cup grain to 2 cups water, bring to a boil, cover and simmer for 20 minutes--although I have found that millet needs more salt than rice or quinoa. It has a pleasantly chewy texture, and the taste reminds me a little bit of corn flakes, especially when eaten with goat milk. You can also cook it in a 1:3 or 1:4 ratio with water, and then it resembles corn grits or polenta in both taste and texture.<br /><br />I have been using Arrowhead Mills millet for years. It is always high-quality, odor-free (I have had some trouble with big-chain health-food store bulk grains trapping odors while in storage--other people might not really notice, but we are sensitive enough to smell someone's laundry detergent when they pass by a few feet away, so this was a big deal), and clean (some sources suggest you rinse millet and quinoa before you cook them, which is rather a pain, but I don't need to with Arrowhead Mills packaged millet). Given our rapid consumption of gluten-free grains, the 6-package box is a convenient and economical way for me to purchase. Add in Amazon's fabulous free shipping, and I was on cloud 9... while the offer lasted, anyway!<br /><br />Amazon, please bring this product back!!!
