I have already gone through 2 lbs. of ZSweet, and I think it's the best sweetener I've tried.  I don't like Stevia, and the common ones-Aspertame and Saccharin- are just too controversial in perhaps causing health problems. I am a member of Weight Watchers, and have always used Sweet & Low in foods such as oatmeal.  Since using ZSweet, I'll never go back to S & L.  Zsweet is terribly expensive, but I believe it's worth it, since they claim to have no chemicals in it. I do recommend it, if you want your sugar substitute to taste just like sugar.
