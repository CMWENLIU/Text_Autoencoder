Contrary to popular belief, these are not just for baking. Not only are Oregon Blueberries loaded with antioxidants, they are delicious right out of the can.  I buy them in bulk from Amazon.Com. I add two or three tablespoons over my Total cereal every morning, along with a heaping spoonful of crushed, honey-roasted almonds and some Splenda. Float the heavenly mixture in skim milk or light soy milk. Add in a glass of orange juice and a banana and you're in for a treat.  Eating healthy can be fun.  This comes from one who was raised on a daily breakfast of bacon, saugage, eggs, whole milk, grits or hashbrowns and biscuits all dripping with homemade butter.  Granted, this was wonderful at the time, but it's a miracle that anyone survives past 50 on such a diet.  However, no health food is any good if you sit on your butt all day and do nothing.
