I bought this milk for my toddler so I tasted it first for a couple of days...I just love it and so does my little one. It is a great substitute for cow's milk and soy milk and it tastes great. I think that the fresh goat milk has a little bit of smell but this powdered one is just so rich, creamy and delicious. It does not mix easily with cold water so I use a small mixer/blender to mix it for a few seconds and it comes out even better!!
