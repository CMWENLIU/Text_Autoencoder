OK, it's a bit more pricey than Maxwell. In fact, my husband was irritated that I would spend so much on organic instant coffee when I could pick up a generic brand at the grocery store. That was until he tasted it.<br />The taste is similar to a good fresh brewed. It's smooth and totally lacks that acidic bitterness that one often associates with instant coffee.  Some buyers, like me, will be attracted to it because it is organic. However, it is the taste that sets it apart from other instant coffees.
