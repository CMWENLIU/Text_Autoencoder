I try to eat healthy, but it is hard to eat both healthy and cheaply at the same time. I've been looking into ordering Quinoa for years, hopefully the world is finally learning that this is the new super-food, and thankfully I can now finally order it at reasonable prices fairly easily too, so I gave this bag a try. The red because it tastes better according to the critics, and well quite frankly, everything I have read about it is true. It tastes like nuts, is a little crunchy, and the seeds pop when you cook it turning into little snail looking bead sprouts. It is a lot smaller than I expected, but slightly more than doubles in size when you cook it. It was a lot easier to cook than rice which clumps together too easily. Because of the nutty taste I can even eat Quinoa as is, nothing added, something I would never do with rice, and Quinoa because of the high nutrient content makes a completely healthy meal all by itself! Heads up though, WASH IT SEVERAL TIMES IF IT SAYS WASH ON THE BAG. It is not like rice that you wash just to get rid of the dusty powder. If you don't wash Quinoa well before you eat it, then it will taste very acidic like putting a penny in your mouth at first. I really like this stuff and will eat it all until it's gone.
