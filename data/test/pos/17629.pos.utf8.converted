This one is the Best of all the chai teas I've tried, and I've tried bunches!<br /><br />Numi - almost as good, but very pricey<br />Twinnings - all you taste is black tea, no chai spices<br />Stash - too cinnamony<br />Good Earth - great chai spice taste, but not enough black tea taste!<br />Yogi - see Good Earth<br />Celestial Seasonings - see Stash<br /><br />I've even tried the Marsala Chai at Cost Plus, which was pretty good, but can't compare to Tazo!<br /><br />Tazo has the perfect blend of black tea and chai spices and is reasonably priced.  I alternate this one with Stash Holiday Chai (my 2nd favorite).<br /><br />If you don't want to buy this much tea just to try, then go to Target.  They have individual boxes of this tea for under 4 bucks.
