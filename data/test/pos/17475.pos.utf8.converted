We have had so much fun with this product. I actually bought the Candy Crate 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s retro candy boxes for a dinner party in September where we were celebrating 4 birthdays. Between dinner and dessert, I put the boxes on the dinner table and let everyone participate in opening the candies. Everyone laughed and talked for an hour or more about the candy and memories of growing up. Since that time, I have done the same thing with school friends on a recent vacation, my brother's birthday and will be using once again at an upcoming dinner party. The Candy Crate candies are well packaged and you get plenty of product. Be prepared however; the shipping cost is as much as the candy. I have to say that it is worth the cost to see friends and family have such a good time!
