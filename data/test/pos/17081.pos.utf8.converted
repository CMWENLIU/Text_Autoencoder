The bottom line is, I pretty much test the limits of what our cat can tolerate regarding changing of the litter in the box.  I don't want to incriminate myself, but it's just not my favorite chore...This litter, although easily 3X the cost of what we used before (lately the newspaper remix versions), it lasts at least 2X longer between full changes of the box, so do consider that.  I think that the odor control is a little better, but there's no magic.  It must control the odor better from the cat's point of view, because she's OK with it.  I haven't noticed any downsides or trade-offs.
