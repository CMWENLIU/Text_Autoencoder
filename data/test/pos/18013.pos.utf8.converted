This pink salmon is just perfect for a protein punch in the morning! FISH, canned fish, for breakfast?? YES!! This delicately flavored, not too salty, American salmon from Alaska is pure salmon - NOT packed in oil, just gently salted and canned. Excellent value, too, at under two dollars a can! I find a protein punch in the morning gets me started right and keeps me strong and NOT HUNGRY all day. The Omega fatty acids in salmon are reason enough to eat it at least twice a week, and the convenience of this size can makes it an easy meal to go. Per can: 270 calories, ZERO CARBS, 36 grams protein, 15 grams fat (the good kind) and just 810 mgs sodium! Recommended!
