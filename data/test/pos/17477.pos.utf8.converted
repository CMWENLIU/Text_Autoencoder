I became a fan of dried shiitake mushrooms upon receiving a sample at Costco (rehydrated in warm water and saut&eacute;ed with a dried garlic parmesan mix).  Delicious but after a year my Costco stopped carrying it.  These are the best value on Amazon and excellent quality.  I've ordered 4 lbs. for myself now.  They keep for ages, just clip the bag shut.  There are big slices in the bag but they can be easily crushed by hand into recipes where smaller pieces are desired.<br /><br />In the winter, my most convenient use is to drop a handful into 8 oz. of water in a small pot and bring it to a simmer (I include a big pinch of rolled oats if I'm really hungry).  Stir for a minute, then turn off the heat and add a can of Campbell's condensed chicken noodle soup.  The final temp. is just right for me this way.  Total prep. time 5 minutes, 1 pot, 1 spoon.<br /><br />Here's the interesting part.  I'm an inventor.  I always have a few challenging projects going at a time. They are ambitious so I often run into problems of an engineering/math/physics type.  They can seem insurmountable, so when this happens I switch projects to give my subconscious mind a chance to work on the problem.  Anytime, I'm stuck in traffic, standing in line, or just bored, I roll out the problem and ponder it.  It's been my habit for decades.  What I noticed by accident is that 24-36 hours after eating the dried shiitakes, my problem solving yield goes way up.  At first, I was just happy to have the new ideas but then I noticed this happens more in cold weather.  That corresponds to the soup trick, and after many trials I have to say it seems reliable.  I even save up problems now, in my head, have the soup and wait in happy anticipation for progress.<br /><br />To be clear, there is no "high" experienced here.  I feel perfectly normal after eating these and I wouldn't have noticed a thing except for my habit of always having some problem in the back of my mind to work on.  Also, the effect is not immediate.  Ideas, start at about 24 hours after ingestion and seem to peak at 36 hours fading gradually by about 56 hours.  If I were still in college, I would want to time ingestion for peak problem solving on tough exams.<br /><br />I would be very interested in anyone else reporting this kind of effect (or lack of it).
