I bought this item because I was at a loss for an idea on a Mother's Day gift to give my wife. I saw this item and its 1-star rating, and that piqued my curiosity. How can a purchase of tea bags be given only one star?<br /><br />I received this just a few days before Mother's Day and my wife talked me into giving it to her right away. My wife and I are quite pleased with both the nice, partitioned box (it is just like the picture and description I saw before ordering it) as well as the large assortment of teas.<br /><br />In this particular case you are getting the following:<br />A handsome tea chest that is lined with red velvet.<br />120 bags of tea; 20 each of Orange Spice, Raspberry, Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Peach & Green Teas.<br />Each bag is individually wrapped in foil.<br />The whole thing cost less than $20!!!<br /><br />Neadless to say, the five stars is partly for the great value we got in the box plus teas as well as to partly offset the ridiculous 1-star rating it had previously received.
