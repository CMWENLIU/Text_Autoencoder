A friend told me about this product. She is very health-conscious when it comes to food for her kids. One of her kids has allergy, so she has also been looking for good gluten free food products. She first found this line of soup base in a high-end food store in the East Coast and tried it out. Her whole family loved (and still loves) it. She sent me one as gift a few months ago and we tried it out and my kids love it too. We used to boil meat and vegetable or 2-3 hours and used the soup to cook food for the kids. This was very time and energy consuming. We tried other soup bases in the past but the kids complained about being very thirsty after drinking those. This one is great. It saves us a lot of work and the kids still get healthy delicious soup! I recently found it on Amazon & bought 5 different flavors. The order arrived within 2 days with my Amazon Prime membership and we now can enjoy the different flavors.
