This grain free formula works great for my male cat who has/had a sensitive stomach and trouble with digesting grains; his major gas and litter box issues got better in a few days and cleared up in a few weeks.  He's a real chow hound also, and doesn't always chew his food well, so the smaller pieces help tpp.  I'll definitely purchase this product again.  As for shipping, this item arrived on time and in good condition.
