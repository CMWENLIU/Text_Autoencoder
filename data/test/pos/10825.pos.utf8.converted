This is an amazing product. Gelatin is pure collagen protein, 9 grams of collagen protein per tablespoon. And the best thing is that it's hydrolyzed collagen which makes it easily digestible. When I heard that the Guiness Book of World Records for weight loss was a woman who lost over 300 pounds by taking collagen, I just had to try it. I've been taking collagen for one month and my sagging skin is noticeably firmer. This is so thrilling to me that I will be taking this for the rest of my life. I also noticed some research online that said ingesting hydrolyzed collagen will tone and tighten sagging skin, reverse wrinkles, get rid or cellulite, keep bones and cartilage strong, and ease<br />arthritis pain.<br /><br />I started taking a liquid collagen product but decided I could no longer afford it, so I was excited to learn that gelatin is the same thing, except you simply mix the powder in water or juice. You need at least 8 grams of collagen per serving once daily to see skin toning. The best time to take it is before bed at least two hours after eating. If you search for unflavored gelatin on amazon.com you will see one of the reviewers of another brand said she was taking it to get rid of cellulite and that it is working. I decided on this particular brand because it is not made from porcine/pigs. I like that it is kosher and made from beef bone. Just as a side note, in the olden days people always boiled bones to make broth or soup and that's how they got the needed collagen to keep their bones from getting brittle.
