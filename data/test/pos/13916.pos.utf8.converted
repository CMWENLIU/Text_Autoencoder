You have no idea how many times people ask me how I can stay so composed. When I tell them that it's because of my breakfast cereal, they just shake their heads in disbelief and continue to dog me for the real answer. But it's because of this cereal that I can accomplish anything. Not only does it have that zesty taste that people love, it's also got a gorilla. A GORILLA. You tell me when you last saw a gorilla on a cereal box. Look at that calm gorilla. He's composed, he's cool, he's confident, he's in the zone. He's not here to impress you, he's here to eat his cereal and scratch himself. Don't YOU want to be like that? Don't YOU want to be a gorilla?<br /><br />You have jimmies? You want them to keep from getting rustled?<br />Gorilla Munch is your answer.<br /><br />Keep a box on the table, and you'll keep your jimmies stable.
