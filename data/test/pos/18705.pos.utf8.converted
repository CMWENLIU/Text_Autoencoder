Not much to review except it's the usual Carnation in the delicious strawberry flavor that I drank as a kid. It seems all the strawberry available in the stores these days is in a mixed/variety package and only 2-3 packets of this flavor are put in the usual 10-packet variety box along with 4-5 packets of 2 different chocolate flavors. After searching a half dozen grocery stores for the strawberry only box, I gave up and turned to Amazon, which thankfully stocked it. I'll be ordering more soon. Cheers to Amazon. (note: this item requires 3 boxes--so minimum order appears to be 30 strawberry packets for the $12-13 price.)
