this company makes the absolute best sea vegetables. and the prices when you buy in bulk can't be beat! just about half the price than in the local health food store.<br />i go through bags of these all year round, because i eat a lot of soup. fantastic! they add flavor and not really any fishiness. and there is a lot in each bag, so you can make many batches.<br />they're so good for you and you can barely taste them (i use an immersion blender so they get incorporated, for skeptical family members who wouldn't normally eat seaweed)-why not get a whole bunch?
