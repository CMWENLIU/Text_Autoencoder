Thanks to goat milk my son doesn't have asthma. Two months ago he was having problems sleeping and eating. He would drink cow milk and in a half hour he would start to have what doctors call dry cough syndrome. He would cough nightly, have  mucus in his nose,will cough out a heavy clear saliva when he coughs it out. First they stated he had allergies. he was prescribed with singular for his allergies. My wife and I went to a specialist and he came out negative. He was then prescribe with pulmicort to inhale. Even 911 ambulance declare he was asthmatic when we  explain to them his syndrome. Then one night my wife went on-line to do research about cow milk, and behold a pale horse the site stated the allergies systems is similar to asthma. So parents if your child is acting totally different when he drinks cow milk. Don't jump to conclusion that your joy in life is asthmatic just because the doctor says so .Doctor's are not always 100% right. Do your research and they will be a answer waiting for you not a "I think he has" answer. Your judgement can be just as important. THANK YOU goats for being just as delicious and helping my son to be correctly diagnose by doing research. 1 point for parents zero points for the medical field.
