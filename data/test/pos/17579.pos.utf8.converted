Boil some water, throw it over the bulgur (add some broth powder if desired), cover and walk away. How easy can it get? And make a large batch if you want because it tastes great and leftovers can be stored in the fridge for future meals. Again, how easy can it get? A substitute for whole-wheat pasta, brown rice, faster and lighter for summer dishes and salads or just add some salt and butter, or sour cream or dill dip and eat when the day has been a horror and all you want is your jammies and comfort food. A marvelous standby in the pantry.
