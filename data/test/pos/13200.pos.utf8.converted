This is some great popcorn.  I first got this popcorn through Quinn Popcorn's kickstarter campaign and ever since I tried it I have fallen in love.  I am not by any means a healthy organic person but I read their campaign watched the videos and thought it was worth supporting and I am glad I did.  This is some of the best microwave popcorn that I have had.  The parmesan and Rosemary is my favorite with the Vermont maple second and lemon third.  It is amazing thing to know you can take an idea, flesh it out and really create something new and be able to sell it to the world.  To know all the details of the organic-ness of the popcorn and stuff like that just go to the website, but for me two cool things are that to bag is compostable and you add the oil and seasonings after you pop the popcorn so you can control if you put all of it on or just some.  It is very yummy.
