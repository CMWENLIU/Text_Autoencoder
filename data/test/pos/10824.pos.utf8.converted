A friend brought us back the Original Slap Ya Mama from New Orleans a few years ago.  When I ran out, I thought I would try the extra spicy also.  They both are highly recommended.  Great for popcorn, eggs, porkchops, you name it.  The spicy is SPICY.  If you're not sure, try the original in the yellow container first.
