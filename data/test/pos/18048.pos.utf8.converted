I have recently been on the Optifast medical weight management program, and a full pint resembles protein-calorie levels of one of the RTD meals or powdered shakes. If you opt for the 1/2 cup serving size, you can add some Walden Farms calorie free topping <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVEJEE">"Walden Farms Chocolate Syrup, Sugar Free, Calorie Free, Gluten Free, Carb Free, Fat Free, 1 oz. individual package"</a>  (caramel is my favorite, but chocolate and marshmallow work) and add some fruit or nuts and have a very reasonable diet-worthy snack that does not feel lacking in any way. The initial taste impression does not say 'ice-cream', but if you let it soften, the mouth texture and taste are good, and it is dense enough to fill you up! I am a convert. I have gone through a 10-pack in about 3 weeks, and my only complaint is this: I would like a low-price online option (the 10-pack pricing, at about $5.60 a pint is reasonably low) where I can select what flavors comprise my 10 pack. I would probably get 3 coffee, 3 peanut butter chocolate, 3 maple vanilla and 1 strawberry in my ideal assortment. Hopefully, Amazon will offer better variety at quantity pricing, or my local Whole Foods Market or Lunardi's market will start offering more flavors.
