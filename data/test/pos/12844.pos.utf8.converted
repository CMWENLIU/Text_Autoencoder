If you are used to Peet's Coffee & Starbucks...don't bother with this coffee. By now you are going to be used to overly-roasted (burnt is not synonym of flavorful) coffee and anything mildly roasted is going to seem flavorless to you.<br /><br />If you, on the other hand, haven't compromised your taste buds with horrible coffees like Peet's & Starbucks- feel welcomed to enjoy this jewel of a coffee.<br /><br />It's chocolate-y, not fruity like Kona or Blue Mountain, without a hint of bitterness (even if you brew it ristretto-style), it produces a rich, caramel-colored crema, and it's actually lower in caffeine than it's burnt-roast counterparts. That's the beauty of the medium roast.<br /><br />I learned about this coffee while living in Sicily and got hooked ever since. It's the best of Lavazza's line of coffee (Blue has a deeper taste, Rossa is even milder) and it's my favorite.
