I tend to not believe the catchy phrases in the ads and was skeptical when I read "Drinking Zola 100% Pure Coconut Water is like cracking a fresh coconut and sticking in a straw" on the can. I expected something that tasted artificial and sweet. But when I drank it I was very impressed, I remember drinking from real coconut with a straw and Zola coconut water really did taste like that (I guess it's supposed to since it's really 100% pure coconut water). It was not overly sweet and the subtle coconut taste lingers for a little while on your tongue which is very pleasant. Upon examining the nutrition facts (which I always do when I eat/drink something) I was very pleased that it had high amounts of electrolytes. I think it would be a healthier alternative than other juices or sodas after exercising, or even just when you're dehydrated. I wasn't even halfway through the can when I felt full, and I was pretty thirsty (and hungry) when I opened the can, too. For those of you coconut water lovers or someone looking for healthier alternatives than soda/juice/etc, I would definitely recommend buying. One last personal opinion- making the can smaller and therefore reducing the price would make me even more willing to buy it, not that it's really that expensive if you consider the healthy side of it.
