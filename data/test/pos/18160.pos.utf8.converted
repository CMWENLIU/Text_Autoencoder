My paternal ancestors were from Hangzhou, and I savor it's native Dragonwell tea with special fondness.  Numi is no watered down import, it is as authentic as the local brands.<br /><br />It's so hard to find truly organic dragonwell tea, as China's still immature market economy is wide open for abuse.  Numi's holistic sourcing practices alleviates most of my concerns.<br /><br />My wish is for them to vacuum pack their teas, as a pound of tea can grow moldy pretty fast in a warehouse or kitchen pantry.  (freezing unused tea in airtight containers does the trick).  Also, there should be a "Organic" label on the tea if it is organic as the bullet points indicate.<br /><br />For those new to Dragonwell- I recommend about half a teaspoon in a tea ball or meshed tea pot per 12 oz of water.  For those who don't enjoy heavy tannins, pre-brew and stir the leaves in a little hot water for 10-15 seconds before brewing for 5 minutes.  Experiment with pre-brew and brew times to find your ideal mix of flavors.<br /><br />Update- Amazon finally pulled the "Organic" claim from it's  description.  For a pound of tea, this is still a great deal, but I will look else where when shopping organic.
