I'm a huge fan of using Meyer lemon juice in just about everything. But the fresh fruit can be really hard to find, especially during the off-season. This is the answer to my prayers! I use this when cooking seafood, making drinks, salad dressings, baking... you name it! Always tastes fresh, and it's such a convenient way to keep this precious elixir ready to use! Thanks, Perfect Puree! :D
