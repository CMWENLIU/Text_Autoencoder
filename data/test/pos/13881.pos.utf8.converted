I bought this milk for making mozzarella, ricotta, and paneer cheese (which it does very well) and have ended up using it for everything.  I mix up a quart at a time in a blender for daily drinking and add a tablespoon or two of heavy cream.  A hint for mixing:  put 1/2 the water in the blender, add the milk powder and pulse blend a few times before adding the remaining water.  Once blended, it can be very foamy.  Stir cream in with a spoon and allow to sit in the fridge for a day before decanting into a glass bottle.
