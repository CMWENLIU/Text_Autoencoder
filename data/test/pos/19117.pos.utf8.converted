I agree with the other positive reviews here.<br /><br />This truly is the one of the best organic unrefined virgin coconut oils on the market, all things considered. Even after many years of research I've done on coconut oil, TT's stuff is still coming out at the top.<br /><br />I also love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VWLQE6">Tropical Traditions Organic Coconut Cream Concentrate - 1-Quart (32 oz)</a> - which is simply ground up organic coconut meat. It's almost like fudge if you warm the jar, pour it out into a shallow pan, smush it around to even it into a block, then refrigerate for a short time so it firms up again. Just cut off small squares and it's such a yummy, filling low sugar treat. You can add a few toasted nuts or bits of chocolate or whatever you like before chilling, but I like to eat it straight. :)
