Obviously pricey outside of Belgium (or Europe for that matter) however the quality is unmatched.  I bought these for my wife on Easter instead of the traditional (and dare I say highly repetitive) chocolate box brand.  First, the milk chocolate is obviously of higher quality and retains its creamy taste even if regrigerated.  The fillings and cremes are superb.  The only problem I have now is that my wife wants them on every insignificant occasion now!
