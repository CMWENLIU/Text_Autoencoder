Yes, this flour is not as fine, however it is absolutely the best for my favorite banana muffins. The muffins come out angle-soft inside, have nice texture, and a good-looking golden crust. I use<br /><br />2 eggs<br />1 cup of buttermilk<br />2 ripe mashed bananas<br />1/4 cup of oil<br />2/3 cup packed light brown sugar<br />1 cup of organic coconut flour<br />3/4 cup all-purpose flour<br />1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder<br />1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br />1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br />1/4 teaspoon salt<br />1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br /><br />bake about 20 min
