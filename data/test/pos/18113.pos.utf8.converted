After the cat food scare, our family decided to take a very close look at what we were feeding our three cats and two German Shepherd Dogs, and for a while we made all the food for all the pets. Finally we found Solid Gold Barking at the Moon dry dog food, and we now mix the appropriate amount with rice and vegetables so the dogs get enough bulk to be full, but not more calories than they need. The dogs have become so much healthier after four months of this new feeding plan!<br /><br />Here's the recipe: 16 cups water or flavored stock, boiling. Add 8 cups  brown rice, stir, turn heat to low, cover and cook 45 minutes. When rice is done and still hot, stir in five bags frozen vegetables and two cans tomatoes broken up. I use diced butternut squash, cut green beans, cut spinach, cut okra, zucchini, or whatever vegetables your dog likes except corn or lima beans. Mix two cups rice mixture with 1 & 1/2 to 2 cups Barking at the Moon kibble twice a day for a dog weighing approximately 100 pounds. This amount of rice lasts about six days for our two large dogs, and we can't believe how much healthier they are! Our older dog has regained the power to jump into the car--and up on our bed--which may or may not be a good thing!
