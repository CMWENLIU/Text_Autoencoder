I bought this for my kid, so he could have original, never-seen candies in his advent calendar.<br />THe box is beautiful, the candy were just right as described, and since I live in Montevideo (Uruguay, South America), it goes to the company's credit that the box arrived perfectly, not a single candy crushed or damaged...WOW!!<br />Will certainly buy again from them, this time the 50s!!
