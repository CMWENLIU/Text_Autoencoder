This is one of the best peanut butters I have ever tasted. A bare minimum of sugar and exactly the spice level I would have expected. To the person who gave it a one star, common, that is ridiculous. You should have atleast given three stars for innate quality and being a product that actually lives up to the label. OMG spicy peanut butter actually being spicy, who would have thought!
