Every so often you try a product and wonder, "why did it take forever for someone to invent these?" Well, this is that product!  If you've ever had the joy of having fangs come down on your hand while giving medication to a cat, well, try these!  These things are one of "those" products that everyone should know about.  My cat has to be on medication for the rest of his life and these things are a true God send.  He LOVES them and never knows there's a pill inside of them.  They have a hole in the center, you place your pill in there, then seal it up, feed it to your cat.  They just think they are getting a treat, not a pill.  It's the consistency of cookie dough so it's like putting a pill in cookie dough and squishing it together.  I just LOVE these things and so does my cat. He already loved the regular Greenies treats and well, this was an obvious solution.  HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Great price here too on amazon with the buy 4 get one free thing. Made it cheaper than my local store and WAY cheaper that the vet!
