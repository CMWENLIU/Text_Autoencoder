I was leery about purchasing a variety pack because there had been a lot of negative reviews about duplicates and boring selections for the other variety packs available on Amazon. I took the chance, anyway, and this purchase was exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />Inside there were 35 different flavors, as advertised, including about six teas, two hot cocoas and six flavors of decaf. Yes, there were a lot of flavors from Green Mountain and Tully's, but there were also some really cool flavors from Coffee People and other brands, as well.<br /><br />I was expecting the package arrive in a box, however, it came in a brown paper bag that was simply stapled and shipped. Everything arrived in good condition, though, so who am I to complain.<br /><br />If you're looking for a true selection of 35 different flavors, this one is the one for you.
