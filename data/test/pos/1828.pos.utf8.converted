You will see other reviews criticizing this syrup as not being like Lyle's.  Different uses!!  Lyle's is excellent for baking and making desserts but not for beverages.<br /><br />I like this Monin syrup to sweeten drinks!  It is awesome for that purpose.  I make fresh limeade for Margaritas with this ----way way better than a crummy store-bought Margarita mix.  Ever try to sweeten a beverage with granulated sugar?  Gross.  It doesn't melt.  All you do is add this syrup and it's great.  Great to add into iced tea too.<br /><br />Get the pump if you think you will use it to sweeten by the glass.  Otherwise you can just pour out of the bottle for larger batch drinks.  It's also really good to add into whipped cream if you are making that from scratch - but I actually prefer to use the vanilla flavored Monin for that.<br /><br />Monin syrups are high quality - I've been using them for years in my coffee (caramel, vanilla, almond, etc.) and the fruit flavored ones to make Italian sparkling sodas.
