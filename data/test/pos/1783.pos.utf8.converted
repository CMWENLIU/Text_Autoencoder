I bought these to go with my sugar free syrups that I bought in a sampler pack.  The pumps work very well and make sampling or mixing the syrups with my coffee a real treat.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that they would ship 6 instead of 5 to match the sampler pack.<br /><br />A tip: Before inserting the pump fully into a newly opened bottle, pump the pump to load the pump with syrup...otherwise it will overflow.  If you pump it full of syrup (2 pumps on mine) before inserting it fully, you won't waste any syrup.
