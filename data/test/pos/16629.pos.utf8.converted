I purchased this item to put near my chicken coop.  At first I thought it wasn't working.  No action for a few days.  Within a week the thing was half full.  It's so easy to use.  Add water and hang it up.  The best part is that there are no poisons to deal with and the chickens won't be eating poisoned flies.  Excellent product!
