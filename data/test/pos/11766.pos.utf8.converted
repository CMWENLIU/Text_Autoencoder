I enjoy green tea of different varieties, and typically drink the jasmine tea under the Kirkland Signature brand at Costco. Looking for something different, I was pleasantly surprised at the Acai Blueberry Lipton Green Tea. When the package came I boiled some water and went on to brew the tea. The scent is VERY aromatic, and the tea was great. Although it contains no sugar nor artificial sweeteners, the tea tastes sweet naturally (not like candy or juice, just a very delicate sweetness). I brewed some more to try it cold the next day, but I think it tastes better hot (brings out the flavor more).<br /><br />I think there's something wrong with the reviewer who gave it one star and couldn't tell the difference in flavor. Maybe he/she got bad batch, but it's the same tea as mine, that reviewer probably can't tell the difference between Earl Grey tea and English Breakfast tea.
