I made scones for work as a surprise and took along the English Luxury Clotted Cream and strawberry preserves. People were licking their fingers and moaning like you would not believe. It was not a pretty sight :) The Luxury cream is excellent. People's table manners just went by the wayside. They could not eat them fast enough. At first I wouldn't tell them what the cream was until they tried it. After they tasted the cream I had to tell them to protect myself. LOL<br />Luxury Clotted Cream is wonderful and I will definitely be ordering more.<br /><br />Cheryl
