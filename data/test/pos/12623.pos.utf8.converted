I was reluctant to try this out, because I've had so many terrible jarred pasta sauces and no one had reviewed this product yet, but my fears were quickly put to rest.  This is the BEST jarred pasta sauce I've ever had.  Actually, it's probably the best pasta sauce I've ever had prepared by someone else, period.  Only a super-fresh homemade sauce, made with wonderful ingredients (San Marzano tomatoes, roasted onions and garlic, etc.) can compete.  Considering that such a sauce really takes hours to make, all told, I'm thrilled to use this instead.  This flavor in particular is an excellent base to use for other sauces - it won't overpower the other ingredients you add, but it has such a fantastic flavor it can easily be used on its own.  One of my favorite things to do is use a half-a-jar of this sauce over organic prepared ravioli - it's a super-quick, somewhat healthy meal that tastes amazing.  The heat from the freshly boiled ravioli is sufficient to warm up the sauce, so there's no need to even cook the sauce separately - you just pour it on and you're done!<br /><br />The jars are very nice, thick, reusable polypropylene (#5).  I use them to bring my lunch to work everyday - it's pretty surprising how nice they are - they are definitely not disposable junk.  There are some reports of an occasional jar arriving broken if this item is shipped via ground, which is honestly hard for me to imagine.  I use Amazon Prime, so mine arrive via two-day, and the packaging is always flawless.  To address this problem, Amazon had a "Pasta Lovers Gift Set" from this company with extra packaging, but it doesn't appear to show up in searches anymore.  It contained four flavors - Marinara, Arrabbiata, Tuscan Vodka, and Barely Bolognese, if I remember correctly.  All delicious - the Arrabbiata is fairly spicy, though.<br /><br />Anyway, buy this sauce!  The more people buy it, the more wonderful flavors Amazon will presumably carry.  One final note - this is a GREAT DEAL for these sauces.  If you don't believe me, take a look elsewhere on the web for this company's sauces - five bucks a jar is an absolute steal for an all-natural product of this top-notch quality.
