Made some beef jerky with this as the liquid smoke using my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFVJ3C">Nesco FD-75PR 700-Watt Food Dehydrator</a>.  Added a definite rich mesquite flavor without being overwhelming.  Use lightly though, too much and it will overpower the rest of your flavoring.<br /><br />---------------<br />Update:<br />Still good after a couple months, here's the recipe I been using for jerky and it works well, slightly modified from something I found online:<br /><br />1/2 tsp liquid smoke<br />1/4 cup soy sauce<br />1/4 cup teriyaki sauce<br />1/4 tsp sea salt<br />1 tsp garlic powder<br />1 tsp onion powder<br />1 tsp cracked black pepper<br />2 tablespoons molasses<br />1/2 cup barbecue sauce<br />1/4 cup yoshida marinade (from costco, optional)<br /><br />Mix in a big bowl for a minute or so, toss in meat, slather around, soak for 2 days.
