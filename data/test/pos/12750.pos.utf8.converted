These tablets are the best brand I have tried so far, and they work very well. THe tablet itself does not taste so bad, and the effects last about a half hour with constant eating probably longer if you are not eating as much. I definitely recommend cutting up your food beforehand... or while you are waiting for the pill to dissolve (it takes about 7 minutes). Of the four people who I had try this, all of them felt very profound effects. Some recommendations:<br />>Oranges (my favorite)<br />>Lemons<br />>Mix lemon juice and water, it tastes like really good lemonade.<br />>Limes (still pretty sour, but still delicious).<br />>Grapefruit (NOT white grapefruit). This tastes like sex.<br />>Apple Cider Vinegar (Just a sip, it is still very strong, but it is worth trying it).<br />>(Mangoes Do NOT work very well)<br />>Lemon Juice tastes really good, still slightly sour but like a lemon drop candy.Put. It. On. Everything. EVERYTHING.<br /><br />Warning: Eating tons of citrus in a short period of time may give you a stomach ache, acid reflux, the runs, or death. It is totally worth it.
