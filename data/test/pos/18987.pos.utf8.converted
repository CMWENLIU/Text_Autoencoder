grea t product i have been searching for extra virgin organic coconut oil.And i couldnt find it anywhere.so i went to walmart and bought this bottle of blue magic coconut oil and i was happy.until i read the label,it had petrolatum in it. i harmful chemical that damages the hair and stops it from growing. i was so upset. so i found some organic virgin coconut oil and then decied to order it.i wish it would of costed a litle less but its okay.and guess what you can use this coconut oil in baking as a subsitute for butter,shortening,and margarine.you can also use it on your hair and skin.and you can take it daily for a dietary suplement. great product!
