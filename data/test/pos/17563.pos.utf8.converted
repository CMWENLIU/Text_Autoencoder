I felt compelled to write a review for the Sweeney's Mole Trap because it has rid my yard of pesky moles.  Both times I have used it I have impaled a mole within 24 hours.  I didnt even have to move it around in different spots to get my kills either.<br /><br />The first one I got, the trap had been triggered but there was no mole to be found under the ground.  I pulled out the trap and saw blood on one of the spikes and knew I had got him.  The second one I got I found the lifeless body of a mole under the ground beneath the trap.<br /><br />This is truely a GREAT way to rid your yard of moles.  I read bad reviews of the different types of poisons and electronic pulse thingys and decided to go right for the trap and I am glad I did.
