Like the previous reviewer, I also purchased these snack bars because they don't contain the usual bugaboos: high-fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, artificial sweeteners, etc. However, they're mighty hard to chew. And that's *probably* a good thing.<br /><br />I'm a hardcore fan of Quaker Oats granola bars, because they're a quick snack and they're heavy-laden with sugar, but they also have the HFCS (bad, bad) and hydrogenated oils (bad, bad, BAD). However, they are easy to chew. I am striving to slowly back away from the QO granola bars because of their unhealthy and lengthy ingredient list.<br /><br />The Kashi brand snacks are agreeable to the palate and they do have enough sugar for my personal tastes, but I have a couple crowns and I wonder if my over-priced prosthetic teeth can survive this healthy eating experience.<br /><br />That being said, these are the snacks of choice for long car trips. For one, I'll never pig out on them and two, they're good for the tummy. They provide a little energy boost and they're high octane fuel for this four-layer bio-suit we call a human body.
