If you think horseradish only goes with roasted prime rib you're missing out on some great culinary pairings. Creamy horseradish is a delicious addition to mashed potatoes (and as a topping on baked potatoes), cole slaw, sausages and smoked fish. It also adds a nice kick to party dips.<br /><br />I recently matched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EY5T8A">Beaver Brand Cream Style Horseradish</a> with a couple tri-tip roasts. BTW: Tri-tip roasts are one of the beef industry's best kept secrets. Cooked correctly, they are juicy, flavorful and offer a great value if you're trying to cut your grocery bill.<br /><br />I like Beaver Brand (Made in Oregon!) better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1FY06">Kraft Horseradish Sauce</a>, which tastes more like a flavored mayonaise than a creamy horseradish. Not surprisingly, Kraft has twice as many calories (20 calories per tsp serving) than Beaver Brand (10 calories per tsp serving)!<br /><br />In addition, the squeeze bottle is handy, making it easy to carry this condiment for a picnic lunch of smoked fish, goat cheese and a crusty baguette on the Oregon coast. Backyard barbecue? Enjoy a dab of creamy horseradish with your grilled bratwurst and add a dab to your potato salad recipe.<br /><br />According to the Beaverton Foods web site, the company has received more than 100 certificates of excellence and awards for quality--more than all the other mustard manufactures combined. Beaver Brand also produces <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EY3OLO">Inglehoffer Cream Style Horseradish</a> (I recommend this hotter version, too!) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019ZE1VO">Inglehoffer Extra Hot Horseradish Mustard</a>, which was named Grand Champion in the World Mustard Championships.<br /><br />In summary, Beaver Brand creamy horseradish is great addition to your menu, providing lots of flavor without piling on the calories.
