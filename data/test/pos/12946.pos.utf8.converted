Whole Foods got me with this when I wandered through at a time they were offering free tastes. Wow, world's tastiest chicken breast! So I bought a bottle of Borsari Seasoned Salt - Original Blend (the black label bottle.)<br /><br />Unlike most "free sample" induced purchases, Borsari seasoning is something I've bought again and again. I hate to buy large spice bottles and then wonder how old they are when I go to use them again. (My mother has spice bottles in her kitchen that, I kid you not, came with her spice rack at her 1960's wedding...) The Borsari blend works very well for simple dishes I like to cook--pot roast, roast turkey breast, chicken breasts...<br /><br />Recently, we invited friends for dinner who have severe dietary restrictions. My friend and her daughter can't eat any gluten, soy or dairy. I was cooking the chicken and only after I sprinkled on my Borsari did I realize it doesn't say anywhere on the bottle in an explicit way if it is allergen-free!<br /><br />So I wrote to the contact email on the company website. Within a few hours, I had this response from Betsy:<br />"Borsari is completely gluten free and free of soy ingredients.  Borsari is produced in a gluten and soy free facility.  It is 100% natural."<br /><br />For those like the previous reviewer with other allergies, here are the complete ingredients:<br />Sea salt,<br />kosher salt,<br />fresh garlic,<br />fresh basil,<br />fresh rosemary,<br />black pepper,<br />nutmeg.<br />(No preservatives, MSG, Gluten or dehydrated ingredients.)
