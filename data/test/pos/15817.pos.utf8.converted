Lawry's makes an excellent brand of seasoned salt. This type of salt can be used instead of regular salt; but it really spices up your meal nicely when you use it for cooking as I do. It keeps forever in the plastic container, too.<br /><br />One warning: this type of salt contains sugar. If this is an issue for you, discuss it with your doctor before using this brand of salt. On the bright side, this product contains no M.S.G. and there is a mailing address in case you wish to contact the manufacturer for any reason.<br /><br />Overall, Lawry's makes excellent seasoned salt. I recommend it highly.
