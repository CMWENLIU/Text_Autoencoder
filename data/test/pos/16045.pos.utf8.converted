Who knew bread could make me cry!! With a new diagnosis and a grumpy picky 15 year old son.... I was at my wits end to find something, anything he would like.  I literally held my breath when I put this mix together in my bread maker (2lb wellbuilt - and it actually overflowed my bread pan!!) anyways... signs on the doors to be quiet for fear the bread might fall.... sniffing the air every 10 minutes thinking "Yup smells like bread... could it be??".  It had just cooled when my son walked in the door starving.... (being in high school, football, and lunch time have been rough!!) I ask him to sit down I've got something for him.... holding my breath some more - watching his first bite and him jumping up and down, "Mom is this for real? This is AWESOME!"  Let me say that again, "This is AWESOME" now when have any of us heard those words from our teenagers mouth in relation to anything.  I got huge hugs, kisses and high fives, I think he even was dancing!!! My other 4 kids in the house tried it and couldn't believe it wasn't "regular" bread!! That is saying something cause let's me honest there are some out there that you just can't  fake liking, even a little bit!!  The other kids are so happy that he is happy cause these last couple of weeks have been rough on all of us, mostly on him.  Thank You Thank You Thank YOu - you won't be sorry with this mix!!
