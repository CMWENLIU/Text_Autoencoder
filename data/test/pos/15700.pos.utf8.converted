I have been drinking this tea for months now along with the Tazo Zen green tea. I love both flavors and have found that they make a wonderful iced tea (the only way I like to drink tea). I have found that if you cold brew this tea and the Zen green tea, they do have the flavor undertones that the box states. It almost seems to have a "solidness" to the flavor that seems to fit the breakfast concept well. I definitely recommend it if you like a nice smooth flavor to your black tea. I use the Starbucks Classic syrup in this tea and the flavor is perfect together (you can buy classic syrup in a bottle from almost any Starbucks location).<br /><br />Just as a side for those who are interested. Cold brewing just means that you place the tea bags in the fridge in water and let it set, usually at least 3 hours. It's that simple! It maintains the full subtle flavor of the tea much better and is almost impossible to turn bitter or mess it up unless you use too many tea bags. This only works if you plan to have iced tea of course. I use 4 "Awake" tea bags in 2 quarts of water and let it set overnight. I don't remove the tea bags until I have drank all the tea. It's delicious and super easy. I would recommend trying it to anyone who likes iced tea!
