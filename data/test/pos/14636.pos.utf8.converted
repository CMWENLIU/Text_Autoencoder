Compare the per serving price of this oatmeal to any "superfoods" touting breakfast cereal concoction, I dare you.  You'll be able to have the oatmeal and few fistfuls of multivitamins for the 1-serving price of the multiV. drenched food-like product.<br /><br />Our household is trying hard to correct breakfast - and breakfast skipping - habits these days, and we face down the common issue of just not having the time or inclination to fuss with anything not pre-prepared in the morning. However, you can do an internet search and find a zillion good ways to start the oatmeal the night before.  This idiot-proof method works for us:<br /><br />1 cup oatmeal, 5 cups water.  Put in pan on stove, bring to a boil, turn off heat and cover pan.  In the morning, add any fruit, nuts, cinnamon or sweeteners (we use Splenda), however you like it.  Bring to simmer and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  (You may need to add a bit of water - these oats are VERY absorbant.)  Serve topped with yogurt, fruit or milk, and with extreme satisfaction that you aren't feeding the family sugary junk or mass-produced enriched cardboard.<br /><br />Between this and McCann's, I don't perceive a difference, although I guess some reviewers favor one or the other.  Going on price, as of Feb 2012, this is a definite "best buy".
