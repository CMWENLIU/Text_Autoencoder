I also picked this up at a local Big Box Store and LOVED IT! I was surprised because I don't care for the usual Instant Coffee flavor. But this is different! It is smooth, rich, has a great flavor and I can make it as strong as I want by adding more of the coffee to less water.<br /><br />I was surprised and delighted because I needed something to replace my $4 a cup addiction from 'you know who' and this certainly does it. It is actually better than 'you know whose expensive cup of coffee."<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend this coffee. And it is Organic, what a bonus!!
