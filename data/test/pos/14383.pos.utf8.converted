This is amazing tasting vanilla and contrary to what others are saying it does not contain artificial vanilla. Vanillin is the crystalline substance that forms on the outside of the beans as they ferment. There is also an "artificial vanillin, but that is NOT what is contained here!. The following quote is from "The Joy of Baking": The beans are first plunged into hot water and then the 'drying' and 'sweating' process starts.  The beans are dried in the sun during the day and then wrapped in the blankets at night so they can sweat.  This process can last anywhere from 2 to 6 months until the beans become a very dark brown color and develop a white crystalline substance (or frost) on the outside of the bean, called vanillin.  The vanillin is what gives the beans their wonderful flavor and aroma and these beans are prized.<br /> [...]<br />So PLEASE, disregard these other bad reviews and try this. It is a STEAL!
