There are plenty of reviews here to tell you that this tea is good.<br /><br />If you are like me though, you are a value shopper.  And the price of this tea is obviously expensive.  So after trying this Rishi tea, I thought I'd be able to find something similar that is a better value.  I ordered the one pound bag of Numi Jasmine pearls because it has pretty good ratings and is a better value per pearl, and surely I won't be able to tell much of a difference...<br /><br />If you are thinking of doing the same, save your money and order Rishi.  My experience is that there is a big difference in taste.  Rishi is just a lot smoother, I found the Numi to be kind of musty/moldy compared to Rishi.  Maybe I got a bad bag, I don't know.  But I would say don't try Rishi if you are satisfied with something else because you will probably be hooked!  I will probably end up dumping my Numi Jasmine Pearls because I already restocked on Rishi (actually I felt highly favored to find the one pound bag of Rishi Jasmine Pearls on sale for half price on the Rishi web site during their one day Christmas sales).<br /><br />I drink tea pretty much all day long (without any sweeteners) - usually starting with two big cups of this (two 16 oz infusions of the same tea made in the brilliant IngenuiTEA infuser by Adagio tea), then two cups of Rishi silver needle white tea, then some herbal teas in the afternoon.  I mix it up sometimes with Rishi Wuyi Oolong or something else, but Jasmine Pearl is a very clean and smooth tea that is a classic for me.  Multiple infusions increase the value.  Just be sure to use the right temperature water and steeping time to get the best value.
