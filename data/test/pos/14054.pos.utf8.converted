The bottle containing the small amount of saffron notes that this product is "the most expensive spice on earth." I don't know much about that; the price for this doesn't seem so unreasonable to me. But I leave that issue for others. . . . The small plastic bag with the red strands of saffron in the nice bottle is actually kind of attractive to the eye.<br /><br />I use this when I make risotto. Risotto, for those who haven't tried it, is an extremely rich and delicious rice dish (normally using Arborio rice). If you are hosting a dinner party, risotto makes a welcome and mnormally well admired dish for the guests. Saffron is one important piece of the final product.<br /><br />Wasn't it Donovan who once sang that he was "wild about Saffron"? Well, when I cook risotto, so am I!
