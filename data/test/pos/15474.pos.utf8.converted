I started eating healthier one yr ago. THe biggest 1st step was to change my sugar intake. I have a HUGE sweet tooth. I needed to replace the sugar in my coffee, desserts, etc without having to use artifial sweeteners which are bad and taste awful. M. Agave nectar comes from a plant and it is sweet and yummy. Now nothing replaces the taste of good old white sugar but agave does great. You can googel info on agave in the internet. Great for those with diabetic life styles. It also does not give you a sugar high or low like white sugar does. Its worth using it , I love it and order now by the dozen.
