My chiropractor recommended Himalayan Sea Salt as THE salt for salt lovers, as it contains the minerals that were taken out in processing the (he calls garbage) table salt, and I love it.  Glad I got two grinders; one for home and one for the RV.  It was a mite pricey, as I was able to purchase some more salt to refill from the chiropracter for a lot less.  I would recommend the product.  The grinder was not too big and cumbersome, but was a good size.
