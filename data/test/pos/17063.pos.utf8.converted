After reading the reviews and looking at the pictures I decided I wanted to try these.<br /><br />Compared to Regular Gummy Bears by Haribo one of the most noticeable things about them (aside from the color difference) is that they are about 1.5x bigger than a normal gummy bear. The next thing you will notice different are the flavors. They flavors are a nice twist on an amazing food, but since some of you guys might be worried you might not like the flavors (like I was) I have tried and below is a list of the colors and the coordinating flavor:<br /><br />Pink: Cherry, I guess<br />It taste almost exactly like a Normal Red Gummy bear.  :p<br /><br />Orange: Orange<br />What else would you expect  :p<br /><br />Yellow: Lemon (kinda Strong)<br />Almost taste like a Lemon Head.<br /><br />Green: Apple?<br />I believe I've been tasteing just (to me) the slightest hint of apple.<br /><br />Blue: Sour Rasberry<br />Upon trying them yes you will get a semi-tart taste, almost exactly like the flavor of a Sour Punch Straw.<br /><br />Purple: Pineapple<br />Exactly like a white Life Savor. Yes it might be an odd twist but due to that flavor it is my favorite out of the whole bag.<br /><br />And Again since they are Haribo they will have the extra stiffness most people have come to love about this particular gummy company.
