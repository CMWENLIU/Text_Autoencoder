This coconut oil absorbs into the body without leaving a "layer" like I experience after eating butter with my bread.  I feel good after I eat it.  My boys and I eat it straight from the spoon.  I use it as a butter replacement.  It has only a slight coconut flavor.  My friend who reccommended it to me gargles with it because it is "anti" bacterial, viral and yeast.
