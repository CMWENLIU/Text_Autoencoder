I switched from chemically flavored, non dairy creamers to Silk (Soy) or So Delicious (Coconut) several years ago when my family made the decision to become vegan and stay away from processed foods.  However, upon squeezing about half a dropper full of this flavored stevia-based sweetener into my 20 ounce coffee cup, I don't need creamer at all anymore.<br /><br />I've read periodicals citing that Sucralose and other sugar-derivitives can cause your brain to melt by killing off your cells by the millions, so I would rather just moderately use sugar than any sugar-replacement, except stevia.  My wife even found stevia leaf powder at our local grocer that is so minimally processed, it's still green.<br /><br />In fact, the only concern I have about the ingredients of SweetLeaf sweeteners are the "Natural Flavors" which is an FDA approved way for manufacturers to hide what they are putting into their products.  I know this sounds a bit nit-picky, and nearly impossible to stay away from, as every processed food product on the market has Natural Flavors in it.  Below is the definition of "natural flavor" under the Code of Federal Regulations, which says that it could be derived from virtually anything in nature by just about any scientific means necessary:<br /><br /> "the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional"<br /><br />That being said, I give this product 5 stars for zero calories, taste, and (hopefully mostly) natural ingredients!
