I purchased this product at a little shop in Venice last year. I had been looking everywhere for a &quot;traditional&quot; bottle. This is simply heaven over ice cream or cheese. I use this for very special occasions and it has never disappointed.<p>The packaging includes some very nice recipes and other serving suggestions.
