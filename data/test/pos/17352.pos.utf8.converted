I like tea (but not in the morning anymore, not sure why) and I like a cup when I get home from work. But caffeine of any kind now after 12:00 pm keeps me wide awake until the wee hours. So my favorite cup of Irish tea is right out ...until now. Barry's Tea is pretty good; I like it as well as Lyons, and both are strong, Kenyan-Indian blend teas guaranteed to drive away sleety weather from your bones and even cool you off on a hot day.<br /><br />This is about the best decaf tea I know of. It is not quite as aromatic and snappy as Barry's Green Label or Red Label, but it is decently strong (I put two bags in a full four cup pot.) It stands up to evaporated milk and it is good on its own--very smooth. It does oxidize in the cup rather quickly, going from a beautiful golden russet liquor to a dark brown but that doesn't affect the flavor. Now I can have my tea and a splash of milk when I get home and not be watching the ceiling for half the night. Bravo!
