I love this Special Dark cocoa for BAKING, but NOT for hot chocolate. I have always kept regular Hershey's cocoa powder in my pantry; however, I used Hershey's European Dutch Processed cocoa (silver can) for hot chocolate.  It makes a much smoother and creamier drink. When I saw the Special Dark chocolate on the store shelf, I decided to buy it IN ADDITION to the one in the silver can because I love dark chocolate (the darker the better).  I used it to bake a cake and frosting for a family gathering.  The cake & frosting was black, but was so delicious and moist.  My family loved it, even though we all joked that we had never seen a black cake.  In fact, a nephew who never eats cake ate three pieces!  When I went back to replenish my cocoa in the silver can for my nightly hot chocolate, the store said that it was no longer available and that the special dark cocoa had taken its place, using the same bar code.  They are nothing alike, and I used them both for different things.  I started mixing regular cocoa with special dark cocoa to make hot chocolate. It was better than using just regular cocoa alone, but not as good as the cocoa in the silver can.  Later, when I went back to the store to replenish my special dark cocoa, that was no longer available as well.  All that I seem to be able to get is the original regular cocoa.  I'm so upset.  I don't know why Hershey's can't have all three. Each one was good for different things.  I even called Hershey's, only to get a weak, noncommital excuse with no solution.  I noticed that only the original regular cocoa appears on Hershey's website now.<br /><br />I am now going to try to find other brands at other stores and/or will order my cocoa online.
