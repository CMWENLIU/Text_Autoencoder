My kitty has IBS and we had to take her to the vet to get special food for her to eat. Well, she downright refused the prescription food. So, the vet recommended that we try a few different limited ingredient food brands until we found one that she would eat. And....BINGO, this was it. It is great for her sensitive stomach and she just loves the food. Her coat condition has also improved. Great product.
