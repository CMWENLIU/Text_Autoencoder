How do you review a brown lunch sandwich bag?  To start - it's large enough for an overstuffed sandwich.  I love the crinkle sound of the bag, it holds a crease at the top.  It is going to make the same old sandwiches seem to take on a new life with this new bag - nostalgic. It will be good to put muffins I bake in the 'donut hole maker' into this for quick grab snacks.  This won't cause any moisture mushiness like a plastic wrap will.  No waxy feel - all biodegradable.  I like it.<br /><br />UPDATE Sept 13: I've been using these bags since they arrived...they are wonderful.  My brother gives them 5 stars.  I make him 2 sandwiches a day, one for breakfast and one for lunch.  When he returns home, I notice he carefully folds the bags up for me to reuse.  I can use the same 2 bags, every day, for a week without a problem.  They are sturdy and hold up well.  Even with crinkles in the paper, they still hold a good crease.  I make the sandwiches the night before and they don't dry out nor become soggy in the fridge over-night or until his last sandwich at lunch.  I notice when I use plastic wrap or foil he throws those away...these bags are nicely folded and brought back home, so I guess they are a money-saver in the long run.<br /><br />UPDATE Aug 22, 2012:  It's been a year since first trying these bags.  I've upped the stars from 4 to 5 stars.  I absolutely love this product.  It's come in handy for so many things.  It works almost like parchment paper, too.  I've baked in these for wrapped meals, knowing it is all safe against foods.  Tomorrow I'm trying large diced potatoes, cheese and bacon put into the bag - pop into an oven and bake about 45 minutes at 350, top with fresh green onions (scallions).  So many uses for these bags.<br /><br />UPDATE Aug 23, 2012: Do not use these as a substitute for parchment paper.  When I cooked the potatoes in the bag with cheese and bacon - the cheese stuck!  I think it would have been okay had I not used cheese.  I invested in their parchment paper: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZIC8I">If You Care 100% Unbleached Silicone Parchment Paper, 70-Foot Roll (Pack of 4)</a> and will use this either alone or added into the sandwich bags when I bake with them.  The sandwich bags did hold up well in a 425 degree toaster oven.<br /><br />**I LOVE their paper cupcake liners.  I have the large and Jumbo. (large equals a standard sized muffin cup)  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAIR96">If You Care Unbleached Large Baking Cups, 60-Count Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>  NOTHING sticks to these at all.  Your baking cup paper will peel right off of your cupcakes and muffins with ease, never tearing at even the most delicate cakes. I give a box for a little gift when visiting.  These are the best and with the initial investment you won't be buying them for a long time.  The brown paper is excellent for us adults who are tired of fake inks and cutesy flowers...the color is very becoming and stays the same before and after the oven.  I love the "If You Care" brand.
