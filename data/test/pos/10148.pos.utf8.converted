I started these in cardboard egg crates last spring, then transplanted in my back yard garden.  The stalks were HUGE - be sure to have something to stake them to.  I saw traffic slowing as they turned the corner on my street to get a view of the huge sunflowers over the surburban fence lines.  I live in a fairly new - barren - subdivision, but squirrles appeared and feasted on the flowers, and decided that my yard was a good place to hang out - which is fine by me.  The blooms were breath-taking!
