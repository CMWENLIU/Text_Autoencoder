As another reviewer pointed out, this is NOT the same salt cellar as AB uses. I have both, and this one is better.<br /><br />Unlike AB's this one has a silicone gasket on the inside of the lid, which effectively seals out moisture, and more importantly, smells in.<br /><br />I purchased this one to use as a sugar bowl, hoping the seal would keep the ants out. My previous sugar bowls did not have air-tight lids and had to be retired during the summer, lest we find black six-legged critters happily munching on the contents. For the past two summer "ant seasons" this bowl has kept the critters at bay.<br /><br />While AB's is fine for salt, this would be better than his for that, too.<br /><br />Choosing between AB's and this one? I recommend this one. Well worth the extra $1.06!
