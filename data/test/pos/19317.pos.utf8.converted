Do some of your own research on sprouted flours and you'll find that your body treats it more like a vegetable than a grain.  The carb content is fairly high,  but the glycemic effect doesn't seem to be even close to regular wheat flour and it seems to be much easier to bake/cook with than regular wheat flour.  My wife makes all kinds of stuff with it now.  Pizza crust, cinnamon rolls (with whey low as a sweetener,  another miracle product), she even makes bread in a nice panasonic bread maker.  One of the keys for her is that she sifts it in every recipe.  Another miracle product we use is Extra Virgin coconut oil.  These are all more expensive but being unhealthy is way more costly in the long run.  Back to the flour,  man does this taste good.  She experiments with recipes,  but everything has been good and much healthier.  Some more things that are amazing with this flour are coffee cakes, did I mention the awesome pizza crust with permasan cheese in it?, she actually makes a chocolate cake that seems evil and is so good,  but is NOT fattening or unhealty! (substitute EVCO for some of the butter)  I am no nutritionist, but I know what the scale says and after we make stuff with this flour,  whey low sugar,(look it up online,  its AMAZING and does exactly what they say) and EVCO,  I feel better,  have better skin and have more energy and can eat freaking chocolate CAKE.  The scale and the way I feel are enough for me.  These three products are phenominal and can change the way you and your family eat.  We extensively researched it before using it and are here to say it does what its supposed to and with some work you can make some amazing healthy stuff as well.  And,  our cinnamon rolls have amazing icing made with why low powdered sugar with pecans in them!  I didn't even start about the ice cream with coconut milk,  heavy cream and whey low.  Amazing stuff and no weight gains!  (still have to have some moderation,  but wow!)
