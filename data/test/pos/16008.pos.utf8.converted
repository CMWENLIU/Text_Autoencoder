A Ming Dynasty (AD 1368 - 1644) creation believed to lower cholesterol and promote longevity, jasmine tea consists of Chinese green tea leaves - usually green teas from Fujian province, which is also home to the semi-fermented Oolong and smoky Lapsang Souchong - scented with jasmine flowers. Traditionally, the flowers are harvested during the day and stored in a cool place until nightfall, when they develop their full fragrance. They are then layered over the tea leaves, which have previously been steamed or heated to prevent their oxidation. The tea's quality is determined both by the quality of the green tea used as its base and by the effectiveness of the scenting process. Brewed, it has a delicate, silvery color and a rich fragrance reminiscent of a flower garden in bloom.
