Happy hippos are one of the best cookie/candies I have ever had. They are  a tad expensive but they are well worth the price. With a nice crunchy outside and a soft and a hazelnut chocolate inside you will be in heaven of tasty food. If your looking for something for a friend or just some kind of new snack food I highly recommend Happy Hippos.
