Over the years I've reviewed a number of sea salts but I keep coming back to this one for the superior flavor this salt gives to all my recipes. I use it just like regular salt but crush it in a mortar with a pestle. Some people are shocked by this, in fact they have left comments saying I should not use it this way.<br /><br />The truth is I've noticed quite a few chefs calling for this ingredient in their recipes - even when baking. I find that when I grind this salt it dissolves better and leaves a more uniform salty taste.<br /><br />Most people feel this salt is too expensive to use for anything else instead of just a finishing salt. I think it gives more flavor to everything I use it in or on. I first started using this particular salt in chocolate cake and then started using it in soups and sauces.<br /><br />Fleur de Sel is a  moist, caviar of salt that is hand raked from the surface of salt ponds on the coast of France during July and August.  This salt has a distinct salty-from-the-sea flavor that is unique to these salts. The flavor just fills your entire mouth. Normal table salt will pale in comparison and almost has a chemical aftertaste.<br /><br />You can also sprinkle this salt onto anything you want just before serving, especially good on steaks or freshly cooked vegetables. Also delicious with butter and rosemary on freshly baked bread.<br /><br />So, yes, I do recommend using this salt instead of regular salt in "all" your recipes. Once you try it I think you will be hooked on the gourmet flavor. This should be a verified purchase but I guess the seller I originally bought it from at amazon is no longer in business, at least not here.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
