I am a veterinary technician and work at a clinic that sells Breathalyser. I use this product for my cocker spaniel as well. It is a great product IF USED CORRECTLY! If you take the time to read the back, only 1 cap full goes into 1 pint of water for small breeds and 2 cap fulls into 1 quart for large breeds. Yes Xylitol is an ingredient but it is NOT fatal if you take the time to portion the product right and read the container. If you are concerned if your breed falls into the large or small category, chose the small dose to keep safe. Another fact is to not let the Breathalyser settle, once it is in your animal's water bowl. After 24 hours, replace the water and clean the bowl out before giving more. Adding more water and Breathalyser whenever it gets low is not how it is intended.
