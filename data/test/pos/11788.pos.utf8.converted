I ordered these from a tip from a friend that these were some of the best gummi worms on the market.  I was hesitant - if I did not like them that would be a LOT of junk worms.  I was pleasantly surprised - the flavor on these is better than ANY gummi product I have ever had - and I have had a LOT over the years - and have the waistline to prove it LOL.<br /><br />This is really a LOT of Gummi worms, and I can't really speak as to how long they will stay good.  I decided to vacuum seal one bag into more reasonable sizes and it is working REALLY well.<br /><br />Just make sure you understand - this is 2 bags of 4.5 POUNDS of Gummi worms - a LOT.<br /><br />I have tried a few other things and so far every product is of phenomenal flavor above and beyond any other candy products I have tried.
