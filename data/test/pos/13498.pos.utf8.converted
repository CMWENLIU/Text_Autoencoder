I have every food allergy in the book - I can't even add the eggs necessary in the directions. This Namaste line of products are the only ones I have found to taste almost exactly like the real thing! I put a teaspoon of vanilla in the liquid mixture(along with using an egg substitute of flaxseed and water), and I added cinnamon to the dry mix and I baked them 10 minutes longer than the package said, and came up with THE BEST Gluten free, allergen free muffins I've ever tasted - they actually tasted like little cakes! I sprinkled sugar and splenda on top. I can't praise this product enough!!!
