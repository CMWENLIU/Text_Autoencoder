I had struggled with gas bombs, flooding & metal traps.  These work....in time.  I'm far too impatient & frustated by seeing my yard destroyed while gophers out smart the above methods.  The Victor black box has been great!  I have a 100% kill rate for the last 2 weeks and generally get my gopher within 4 hrs of placing the trap.  Also, you can see if the trap has been tripped without disturbing the trap.  Unlike the metal jaw style trap, where I had to trip it when pulling it out of the hole (because most of the time I had nothing.)  I put a little bit of carrot in the bait hole in the back of the box & so far, I'm very happy.<br />This trap appears more humane in terms of a rapid kill (snaps the spine) & it less messy as the gopher doesn't have any wounds to deal with.  It's worth the money.  There is no way you are going to lose this thing underground either.
