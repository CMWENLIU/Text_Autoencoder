Excellent for use on band-aids with cuts and scrapes. I fell on a sharp bamboo shoot a little while ago and got a big gash in my knee; I used manuka honey on it and it healed up very quickly with little scaring! It also tastes great in tea or on bread (however you would use honey), and helps with a sore throat. Google "Manuka Honey" and you'll find a multitude of uses for it.
