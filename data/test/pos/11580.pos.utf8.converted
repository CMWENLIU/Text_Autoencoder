Tasty and strong 'tea', even with only two teaspoons per (large) cup.<br />Rosehips, crushed, yes, but neatly sinking at the bottom, there is no problem with drinking.<br />And in my case, nothing get to waste, when I'm done with the tea, I find myself scooping the rosehips from the cup. Juicy and tasty...
