I have two finicky Burmese felines with very sensitive stomachs.  My girl cat will not even eat cat treats.  They've been on dry food since kittens and I've yet to find a brand they don't eventually throw up from.  They both suffer from runny eyes and occasionally nasal discharge.  I recently started them on this 95% organic food.  Both my cats, even the girl, devour it like wild animals.  And to our delight, they have stopped vomiting.  Both of them have bulked up slightly, have even healthier coats and less eye and congestion problems since this change in diet as well.  I hope this review helps.
