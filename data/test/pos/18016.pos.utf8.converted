I've gotten 2 packs of 12 of these so far.  Recently, I bought a large container of dried Goji Berries (and other stuff.. cranberries, sweet yoghurt pieces, bits of semi-sweet chocolate, crunchy soy nuts,...) from Sam's warehouse.  The Sam's snax contained bitter Goji Berries. All of the other sweet bits in the mix couldn't mask the bitterness.<br />THIS BRAND that I'm reviewing here... not bitter at all.
