We've tried so many different brands of peanut butter in our home in recent years, from store & national brands to all of the natural/organic varieties available these days, but we've settled on our top choice: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M22TA4">Smart Balance Omega Natural Peanut Butter, Creamy, 16-Ounce Jar (Pack of 6)</a>. It has a very hearty peanut flavor & contains no trans-fats, hydrogenated oils or refined sugar ( it is very lightly sweetened with a bit of molasses.) It is low in impact carbs and even has a bit of dietary fiber for good measure. Another great nutritional bonus is the fact this peanut butter has 1000mg of Omega-3 fatty acids per serving, making <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M22TA4">Smart Balance Omega Natural Peanut Butter, Creamy, 16-Ounce Jar (Pack of 6)</a> a great source of one of the good fats essential to optimal health. For all the great taste & nutrtional value, you couldn't make a better choice than Smart Balance Omega Natural Peanut Butter. Defintely worth a try!
