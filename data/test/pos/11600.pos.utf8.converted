SodaStream soda syrups may be a bit more expensive than off-brands, but this sampler pack is a great way to try out their different offerings and decide for yourself which (if any) flavors of theirs you like the most without committing to an entire 12 liter syrup bottle.  Included in this pack are one trial-size, single-use "vial" of the following flavors:<br /><br />-Orange (Like "Crush)<br />-Diet Dr. Pete (Like "Diet Dr. Pepper")<br />-Energy (Like "Red Bull")<br />-Diet Pink Grapefruit<br />-Diet Lemon-Lime (Like "Diet Sprite")<br />-Root Beer (Like "Barq's")<br />-Diet Cola (Like "Diet Coke")<br />-Dr. Pete (Like Dr. Pepper)<br />-Diet Cranberry-Raspberry<br />-Fountain Mist (Like "Mountain Dew")<br />-Diet Root Beer (Like "Diet Barq's")<br />-Lemon-Lime (Like "Sprite")<br /><br />Each "vial" makes one liter.  The instruction say to "twist-off" the tops, but I find this impracticable and it is much easier to simply cut the tops off with a pair of scissors.  Also, though the box states that it contains "Dr. Pete" and "Diet Dr. Pete," it actually contains "Pete's Choice" and "Diet Pete's Choice."  The name may be the only difference, but I find that these flavors taste more like "Mr. Pibb" than "Dr. Pepper."<br /><br />Finally, if you like "Red Bull," you will be pleasantly surprised with how close this syrup comes to the real deal.  If you buy the SodaStream solely as a "Red Bull" maker, you can save alot of money!<br /><br />All in all, this is a great way to try out the best flavors SodaStream has to offer.  If you do not mind off-brand flavored drinks, you will not be disappointed.  A name-brand soda purist may be able to tell the difference, but I find these quite palatable.
