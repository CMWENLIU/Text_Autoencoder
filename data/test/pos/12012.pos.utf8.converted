I enjoyed having the opportunity to stock up on this Thai Red Curry Paste, which I've used before but which tends to be more expensive than I'd like when purchased in the local store.  It keeps well, and with a couple of cans of coconut milk and plenty of veggies, I've always got the makings of a good, spicy, satisfying meal on hand.
