I fell in love with flowering green teas from our local tea shoppe, but I was very dismayed with the price ($4/ball!!!).<br /><br />I was elated to find this listing since it amounts to about $1.50 per tea ball and it tastes great, better than what we get at the fancy store. It has a light delicate flavor that doesn't get bitter at all! You can make five pots of tea without degradation of  flavor or any increase in bitterness.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
