The best honey ever!!!  I have hated honey all my life...used to gag on it as a child when my mother would try to give it to me for a cough or sore throat.  This stuff is different, totally.  First of all it is not a syrup.  It is a creamy pale yellowish mass of ecstasy....finely crystalized goop almost custardlike that I have found myself eating spoonful by spoonful right out of the jar.  It is that good.  And it is the purest of the pure and most nutritious.  So it pleases the senses as well as the mind.  Delicious stuff.  Try it.  Buy it before all the bees die due to Monsanto's Genetically Modified crops which are killing them off world wide.  Hurry buy cases of it.  You won't regret it.  Can even be used on wounds.<br /><br />I have some that I let sit in a storage bin where it got too hot and must have cooked it.  It is now melted and darker and somewhat separated between a lite syrup and crispy crystals.  It is still the best though with a little more of that traditional honey flavor.  I use a teaspoon of it in my hot oatmeal.  Ummm yum. A little goes a long way.
