I recently purchased 12 bags of this gum.  It took several weeks to get here (backordered).  It is a wonderful product, but still unclear as to why you can no longer buy it in any stores (only online).  I paid over $50.00 for 12 bags of bubble gum for an uncle who loves it.  I'm sure I will purchase it again, but it seems that something this popular should be made available more places (especially for diabetics like my uncle).
