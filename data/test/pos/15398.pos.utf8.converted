I love this stuff, and now, I can get them for half the price as the grocery store on amazon.  There is a wonderful selection of fruit and I, for one, love that it is slightly moist.  If you're looking for fruit chips then this is not the product for you.  Great stuff.  Give it a try if you're looking for a healthy way to kick the chip habit.
