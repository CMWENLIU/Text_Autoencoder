I'm a huge tea fan and was thrilled to see Melitta makes tea pods to use in the new one-cup pressure coffee makers.  I've got a Senseo, and these pods work just fine, so I assume you can also use it with the other similar single-cup makers.<br /><br />The tea is great and the brewing process ensures that you get a nice, dark and flavorful cup.  I'd love to see more flavors eventually, especially orange spice.  For now, the black tea pods along with a flavored honey stick from Stash tea does the trick.<br /><br />Highly recommend for tea drinkers with the one-cup brewers.
