I just received a case of this stuff with some degree of anticipation, as the website for this product did an effective job of selling me on it.<br /><br />One of the interesting claims the site made about this was that the coconut trees were grown on or near fresh water, instead of salt, and that this would make a difference in how the coconut water tastes.<br /><br />Well, after looking at the can and seeing that these are from Thai coconuts, I figured this would taste a lot like Amy & Brians coconut water, and it does!<br /><br />Based on the one can I've consumed so far, I would say that it's a touch sweeter than the aforementioned coconut water, and maybe just a tad bit fresher tasting.  Otherwise, they are hard to tell apart.  Even the cans are pretty close to identical.<br /><br />All in all, I'd be happy with either brand, but given a choice, I'd lean towards the C2O.
