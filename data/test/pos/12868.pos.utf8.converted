I have been a coffee 'connoisseur' for years. I have gone to great trouble to find the best bean...grind it perfectly...and brew it to perfection with the perfect, spare no expense, coffee maker. All the while my mom used this INSTANT coffee (blasphemy!!) called "Taster's Choice", despite my constant ridicule. Well somewhere in a weak moment, or perhaps I was out of my Jamaican blend that day...anyway, I tried her dreaded INSTANT coffee. Well....long story short...my grinder & pot are in the garage now, and although I still have guests that politely pass on a cup of coffee when hearing that it will be INSTANT, THIS COFFEE IS PERFECT EVERY TIME, MATCHES THE TASTE, AROMA, & FLAVOR OF ANY EXPENSIVE BLEND & IT IS ABSOLUTELY TERIFFIC !!!! Thank you Taster's Choice Gourmet Roast, and please accept my apology for ever doubting my mother.
