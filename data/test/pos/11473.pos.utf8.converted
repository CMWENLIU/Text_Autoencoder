With 7 large Greyhounds of my own plus fostering new Greys from the track all the time, this house has a minimum of 10 Greys in it at all times. I own and foster only special needs Greyhounds (never a shortage of them),  mostly due to broken legs and hocks at the track. I make glucosamine a daily staple in their morning meals (with my Vet's approval of course), regardless of their ages. I've tried countless products, some they liked and some they turned their snouts up in rebellion. Even my 3 older ones who have about 7 teeth total among them like these. (For my toothless wonders, I crush them before adding to their  bowl-break into pieces in my hands then use a small 'smack and chop' chopper on the cutting board and scoop the small pieces into individual bowls). My other 4 who still have most of their teeth wait for me at the top of the cellar stairs while I'm filling their bowls and placing one of these peanut butter biscuits on the top of each. While 1-2 try to distract me as I'm hauling all these bowls up the stairs, the others bob and weave in attempts to steal the treats out of the bowls as I near the top of the steps. Have to admit defeat on occasion when I'm not paying attention :(<br /><br />In any event, haven't met a Greyhound yet who does not love these. Not only that, I have seen remarkable improvement in agility, desire to play and romp, renewed interest in toys, consistent improvement in ease in pouncing on the beds, serious athleticism in swiping the tomatoes from my topsy turvys in the yard, even stealing a 3 lb pumpkin off the back step to munch on behind the tree in the back yard. The younger ones have resumed 'running laps' around the yard while the older ones (2 are 11, 9, 8, 5 and 2 are 4) seem younger and instigate play more often than before. They are energetic, not as stiff after a nap or nighttime, want to do more, play more, walk more/further and, while it may be my imagination, the older ones seem to be eating better. (They had gotten to a point where sometimes they would eat, sometimes not, sometimes just nibble a few bites and walk away).<br /><br />All in all, they like this product and I am thrilled already with the positive changes I see in my 'kids' who are always with me and the fosters who arrive in rough shape but leave for happy, responsible homes upon adoption. I dislike pumping meds into any pet when something else will help. I'm sticking with this product. It works for me and mine. I wouldn't purchase 7-10 6 lb bags of this product at a time if my pups weren't exhibiting such remarkable improvements. Their quality of life has definitely improved. Packaging says to allow 4-6 weeks for best results but it took less than 3 weeks for me to begin seeing significant changes in all of my guys and gals. Can't wait to see what 6+ weeks of using this product will produce!<br /><br />Each ALL NATURAL biscuit contains 500 mg glucosamine and is a substantial 'treat'. Biscuits are approx. 3-4" long and perhaps .75" high and quite crunchy to promote strong teeth and healthy gums. They are a bit difficult to break other than in halves. After that initial break, they are too tough to break into smaller chunks, thus the need for my abovementioned 'chopper'. Each bag purchased to date has arrived in excellent condition. Out of 14 6-lb bags to date (2 separate orders), only 2 biscuits were broken in half; nothing was crushed or broken into small chunks. Very little residue at bottom of resealable bags. Unfortunately, I did count the biscuits in the first 2 (original order) bags to determine whether or not I would stick with this product pricewise, but I've forgotten now what that count was so I cannot share that at this time. And because I'm back to order more, if I remember, I'll update this review when I count them again. Directions for use: 1/2 wafer/biscuit per 40 lbs body weight twice daily.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: Some (not all) of the statements on the reverse of package - thought I'd share before you buy:<br /><br />- Administer during or after the animal has eaten to reduce potential incidence of gastrointestinal upset.<br />- An exam from a vet is recommended prior to using this product.<br />- Keep out of reach of children.
