This stuff really is very good.  The picture says it makes 15 waffles but the bag you get makes 37.  That's less than $0.50 each for a jumbo waffle!  Unlike other mixes, you only have to mix with water and let it fluff for 15 minutes.  No need to add egg and oil.  It makes it much more convenient to wip up some on a whim.  The first batch scared me a little bit because it mixes up really runny but it cooked up great.  I recommend it highly.
