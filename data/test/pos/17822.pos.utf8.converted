I ordered this on accident. For some reason I thought I was getting Steel Cut Oats that I buy all the time. I was disappointed when I saw my mistake. AND THEN! I tried it. I absolutely, positively love this cereal! It has changed my morning routine. I put the required amount into the microwave with water-in less than 2 minutes it is done. I mix it with Almond milk(I love cow's milk, but it doesn't love me :(  ) I sweeten the mix with a dusting of stevia sweetener. You don't need very much stevia as it is very sweet. This makes a thick satisfying "shake". Easy to drink and take as you drive to work. I have also added various add-ins and it just gets better and better. I have added cherry juice concentrate/raisins/cranberries/almonds/flax seed...the list goes on and on. But no matter what I add or don't add I love the texture and the taste. It is the best mistake I ever made. Thank you to the universe for this serendipitous mistake. Oh yes, it reminds me of when I was young and my mother made us Cream of Wheat "shakes" for breakfast. I can't have wheat anymore either...so this makes me so happy to find this product!!! YAY!
