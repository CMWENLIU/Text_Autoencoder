I recently bought an Euro Cuisine yogurt maker and resumed making my own yogurt.  There is no comparison - homemade is MUCH better.  Starter matters.  I tried Dannon plain yogurt as my starter.  It worked, but the yogurt wasn't nearly as good.  The Euro Cuisine yogurt starter tastes much better, and after the first batch, it "brews" up in only three hours.  I think the bacteria are really lively, which is probably a bonus for our gut, too.
