The Soda Club machine is great.  We enjoy all the flavors (excluding the mango one).  I read the other reviews, my family doesn't understand what after taste they are refering too.  I have been drinking Pepsi all my life.  It is finally great to have soda without aspartame and corn syrup!  Plus, I am saving lugging 2-liter jugs from the grocery store and have cut down on the amount of garbage I throw out.  There are a lot of flavors at [...].  Yeah for Soda Club!!
