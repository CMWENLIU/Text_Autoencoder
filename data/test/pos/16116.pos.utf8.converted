Exported from Japan, this is a very good "fake" wasabi powder (nearly all tubed and powdered wasabi is actually horseradish). 25g of powder is a lot, so this can will last you a long long time, making this a very economical choice for sushi lovers. I bought a tin of it 2 years ago and have still not gone through it all. To prepare, just mix with a bit of cold water and wait several minutes for the flavor to develop, then enjoy with sushi or sashimi. My directions are vague as to how much to use and how long to wait because the can's directions are not specific. Reconstituted, it's every bit as good as tubed wasabi. I find that a teaspoon of powder is more than sufficient for one person.<br /><br />Make only as much as you need and right before you are about to use it. The chemicals that give horseradish (and real wasabi) its pungency are very volatile and will dissipate quickly when exposed to air (15-30 mins). Don't think you'll save time by making a big batch of it and refrigerating it until next time. All you'll taste is a coarse paste of green goop.<br /><br />Be aware that the product description is **WRONG**. This is not an all natural product. Ingredients listed on the label: horseradish, mustard, Vitamin C, ascorbic acid, and artificial colors (Blue #1, Yellow #4). Blue #1 (Brilliant Blue FCF) is a commonly-used synthetic dye derived from petroleum. You can see it on the right side of the label in the photo if you read Japanese: chakushoku-ryou, coloring agent.<br /><br />Another excellent brand is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CNU1X">Hime Powdered Wasabi (Japanese Horseradish)</a>, or if you prefer it in a ready-to-use tube, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YGSAU">S&B - Wasabi in Plastic Tube (Family Size) 3.17 Oz.</a>, a very popular brand.
