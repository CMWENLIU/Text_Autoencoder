WOW!  I grew up hating oatmeal - thought it was slimey and reminded me of wallpaper paste.  Could only tolerate it when used as an ingredient in cookies, meatloaf, etc.  First time I ate Silver Palate Oatmeal I was amazed at the difference.  There was actual taste and texture that was good!  I've since tried other rough cut, minimally processed oatmeals but I keep coming back to Silver Palate.  Sometimes I even get a craving for this oatmeal - which I would never have imagined could happen to a confirmed oatmeal hater.
