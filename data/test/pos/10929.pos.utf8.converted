I tried these little gems while on vacation in Italy. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find them in the U.S. so I bought 15 of them at the Rome airport. Now that I can order them here I won't be so stingy with my remaining stash of Hippos!<br /><br />What's so great about them? Well, first they are really cute and who doesn't like cute food? Second, the flavor is nice--sweet, but not too sweet. Third, the combo of crunchy shell and creamy filling is brilliant. Finally, the portion size is perfect--about four bites and I'm done.
