NO MSG. NO SALT. Only REAL spice ingredients. But... and here's the amazing thing... it tastes great! We use so much of the various mixed blend Spice Hunter seasonings that we buy this stuff by the box at The Spice Hunter online. As someone who is allergic to MSG and sensitive to too much salt, this seasoning is perfect.<br /><br />I also recommend: the Fajita seasoning (we use the Mexican seasoning and the Fajita seasoning together in fajitas and tacos), the Steak Grill & Broil Seasoning Blend, the Seafood Grill and Broil Seasoning Blend and the Chicken Grill and Broil Seasoning Blend.  We also enjoy the Spice Hunter "Cowboy BBQ" blend, Hickory blend and Mesquite seasoning. These blends are excellent and will save you time when cooking. [FYI: I only recommend Spice Hunter BLENDS, not their single spices (e.g., garlic powder) because the single spices are too expensive to justify the cost in my opinion.] Recommended.
