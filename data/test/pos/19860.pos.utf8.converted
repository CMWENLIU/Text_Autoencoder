I bought this kit because I am a college student and a Pre-Med Biology Major, and needed to do a multidisciplinary project on bacteria plus I had been very interested in cheese making before, but never had a real excuse to get into it. Let me tell you, this kit is AMAZING! Essentially this kit comes with everything but the stock pot, and while you are on amazon you can pick up one of these for rather cheap also!<br /><br />This kit includes everything you will need to begin your journey into cheese making, it also provides a book that will not only guide you through the process of cheese making, but will also, help you to learn new and exciting recipes. I recommend doing some basic home cheese making research before you buy this kit so you can get the other things you will need to start (Basically just the pot and a few other small inexpensive items).<br /><br />Other wise, I love this product and am considering buying them for others in my family who want to start cheese making after my example! This is a great product I highly recommend it!
