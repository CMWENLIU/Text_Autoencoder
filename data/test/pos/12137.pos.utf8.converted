Wonderful product.  Cooked perfectly. The spices are...don't laugh, reminiscent of a wonderful Coney Island smell memory. If you love hot/spicy, then you might be disappointed, but if layered flavor is your goal, you will be in love. The balance of spices is beyond easy description in text.  Hard to duplicate on your own, I think.<br /><br />I put these on baby spinach salad, and WOW, yummy.  I look forward to being even more creative with them.  Price is a "tad" high, but in line with other like items from manufacturer and like products.  I will have to try more of Tasty Bite's products.  I wonder if there is a sample pack?
