Love It!!!  Fast Delivery, wonderful product.  I use root ginger in cooking and drinks, but this is a very potent substitute and really convenient.  If you are not familiar with the myriad of health benefits of Ginger, I recommend taking time to research it(lots of info on the web)  Menopause symptoms become a thing of the past, kills parasites, regulates diabetes and blood pressure...on and on...it is so valuable that it was used as a standard of currency in the past...thanks.
