We love this canned salmon. Delish. Low in sodium. Very fresh tasting, considering it's from a can. And of course, it cannot be compared to wild caught fresh salmon. But it's a tasty alternative to the ubiquitous tuna fish.<br /><br />Even better, I can't find this brand and packaging in my local stores. So ordering this from Amazon is a major hoot.
