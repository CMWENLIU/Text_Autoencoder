I was introduced to Crystal Lite Peach Tea by my friend Jane.  The tea is fabulous!!  If you want a little variation on the tea, instead of all water, make the tea with half water and the other half using lemon-lime drink, such as Sprite Zero, Sierra Mist Free, or 7-Up Diet Soda.<br /><br />You will be asked for the recipe the next time you serve it...as least that is what happened to me.<br /><br />Betty W
