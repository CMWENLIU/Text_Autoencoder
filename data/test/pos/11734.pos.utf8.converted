I have been using this flavor wheatgerm for 37 years and now find myself living in an area where it is not sold anywhere. I have asked 2 managers of 2 different grocery stores to order it for me and they said they couldn't. When I was in Florida a couple of years ago I bought every jar they had in the local grocery store just so I would have it for awhile. A few months ago I ran out and decided to see if it was on Amazon never imagining it actually was. I was so pleasantly suprised to find it here. Now I never have to worry about running out again! My son and I use this product to sprinkle on stew, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese and macaroni salad. It adds a nice flavor and texture. It is a staple in my life just as much as pepper or ketchup.
