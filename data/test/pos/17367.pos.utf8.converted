I have been using Now's Stevia Extract for a year now and am totally satisfied.  I like sugar, but not the fat.  Nutra-Sweet and Equal have negative health issues and are expensive.  I use Stevia in my iced tea, on my cerial, and I bake pies with it.  Other than slightly clouding my tea, it tasts wonderfully sweet with no calories.  I like buying it by the pound, and Amazon has the best price.
