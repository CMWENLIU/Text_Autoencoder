This stuff is super hot! That's what my family wanted though. Unlike a lot of the other hot pepper powders, this one has a great flavor that is almost fruity and smoky. My family loves to put it on everything from ribs and noodles to even cantalope. (Hey, don't knock it thill you try it.) We would highly reccomend this powder to "hot pepper" officinados.
