As I opened the package, the coffee aroma was very pleasant. The items were attractively presented. There is a box with a variety of coffee samples and other items listed here under product features, so I won't list them again.<br /><br />It's a gift basket for coffee lovers.<br /><br />The package reminds me of the welcome basket one might find in a luxury hotel. It's fine for what it is. It's definitely a luxury item. It doesn't contain anything necessarily practical, but that isn't usually the goal in mind for the buyer of a gift basket.
