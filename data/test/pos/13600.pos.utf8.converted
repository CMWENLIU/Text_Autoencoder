After many fits and starts, I 've totally switched my two Flat coated Retrievers to Orijen.  Fantastic quality food and although price per pound is higher in reality w/o the cereal and other fillers of so many other dog foods, its actually only nominally more expensive.  I weaned my K-9s (ages 2 and 6) off other commercial foods and  have found their stools now on 100% Orijen are  normal, not  odorous (during the transition there is some  how do we say "stink" as this food contains  beneficial probiotics that initially are  dealing with  the  grain based old  foods in the K-9s digestive tract).  Also my k-9s  sleep inside at night and travel quite bit with me to training and searches - nothing worse than a dog  flatulance and  there is none and I mean none of that with this food  Yeah!  My K-9s are my Search and Rescue partners and this has given them  excellent stamina,  better coats and they both  relish  it.  I'm using New Zealand dried lamb  bits for training and reward treats but occasionnally  use just a few  Orijen  kibbles instead and you would think I was serving them  prime rib.  Wish I could find a local vendor in RI - shipping is a little steep but many of the vendors will offer you a  significant discount on the second order so I order two bags at a time and  change-up the flavors  from time to time so the  K-9s don't get jaded.  Can't say enough how pleased I am with food.
