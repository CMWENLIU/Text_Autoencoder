I've purchased Nutiva hemp seed many times over the last year, and so far it has been delivered fresh and good tasting. Be aware that it turns rancid quickly and needs refrigeration. I use it to make hemp seed milk. I find this to be the most efficent and effective use of the product. I blend 1 cup of hemp seed, 3 cups of distilled  water, a small amount of kelp powder, and 3 pitted medjool dates, that have been soaked overnight, in my Blendtec blender. I then strain it through a nut milk bag. The blending is so complete that the only thing left in the bag are a few hard shells left over from Nutiva's mechanical processing and small amount of fiber. The Nutiva processing is pure mechanical and kept under 104 degrees F. They then store it under 40 degrees F. The plastic shipping bag is vacuum sealed. Hemp seed is a nutritionally complete food. It has all of the essential amino and fatty acids. 3 tbsp. supply 11g of protein. In order to keep it fresh I store it in a plastic tub in my freezer.
