I have used the Keurig machine and came across this product. I've never used a French press before but was pleasantly surprised how well this product worked.  The first thing I noticed was how much stronger the coffee was.  The Keurig machine can make the coffee a little watery.  When using k-cups, I prefer using the My French Press over the machine. Great product!
