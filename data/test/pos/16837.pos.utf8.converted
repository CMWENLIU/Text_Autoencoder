The product gets 5 stars.<br /><br />This review is more of an FYI.  The product amount is not the same as what is typically found in grocery stores (see uploaded image).  In the grocery store, you can usually find the 1.8 Oz can that contains 6 packets that makes 12 quarts.  That is not what you are getting here.  You are getting four 1.2 Oz cans that each contain 8 packets that make 8 quarts.<br /><br />The packets of the store-bought can make 2 quarts each.  The Amazon-bought can packets make only 1 quart each.  It may take a little math to ensure you are getting a decent value.  At the store, it is about 25 cents per quart based on a 3 dollar sale price.
