Who would know that dried cherries can vary so much in quality? These cherries are exquisite. They are sweet yet tart, soft yet firm, and have fantastic cherry taste. I bought the 4lb box. You can pour them into a large jar and keep them in your kitchen. Note that these are much better than another brand of dried cherries sold here. All the positive reviews are perfectly deserved.
