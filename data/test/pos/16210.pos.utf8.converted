I have been using the Berry flavor in smoothies regularly for about 10 months, and Amazon is the best place to get it. The first couple of times I tried it, it was okay. By the third time, I was really looking forward to it in a yummy way and missing it if I didn't have it. I started on it after a friend was treated for breast cancer, and her cancer doctor told her to get and stay on a green superfood. My husband had lung cancer and needed all the help he could get. I researched green superfoods on the Internet, and preferred the contents of this one because it had both fruits and veggies (most have only veggies) with great extras and minimal filler. I bought all the flavors to test, but he didn't like the smell (friends say it smells like wheat grass) and refused to try any of them. My daughter and I tested each and preferred the berry flavor in daily smoothies. The chocolate flavor tastes good, but has less fruit/veggie value. In blender: approx. 1/2 cup of orange juice, 1 banana, squirt of honey, 5 +/- frozen strawberries and Amazing Grass green superfood. Add ice cubes if you like it thicker. It's great! On the cancer subject, I studied cancer survivors and what they attributed to their survival. Result: Consume lots of Flax Seed or Whey, lots of fruits/veggies, remove stress, and remove white sugar and processed foods from the diet. Cancer loves white sugar and fake sugars (Splenda, etc.). The American diet is killing us. Amazing Grass Green Superfood contains flax seed along with lots of natural antioxidant and immunity building fruits and veggies to ward off illness. I used to average two colds per winter. Since taking this (10 months), I can't remember the last time I was sick. My body feels good taking it, and yes, it does keep you regular in a good, natural way as it flushes the toxins out of your system. Just what the doctor ordered. Unfortunately, my husband refused to do any of the things learned from my studies and he succombed to cancer. I'm staying on the Amazing Grass Green Superfood because I don't want that to happen to me. And because it keeps my body feeling good.
