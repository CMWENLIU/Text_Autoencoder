These are a must for fans of the perc. They work perfectly, but die-hard percolator users know the key is to run the basket under cool water before inserting the filter, so it clings to the basket before scooping in the ground coffee. If you haven't tried a perc and have memories of grandma's bitter and stale percolated coffee, you owe it to yourself to try it....WITH filters!
