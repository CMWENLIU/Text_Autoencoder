If you've ever tried to make good hummus, it's not the easiest thing to do - until now.  I'm thankful others had tried this before me, because I wasn't too worried since the ratings were so high.  And they were absolutely right!  OK, it's a powder in a box.  How good can it be, right?  Unbelievably good, I tell you!  The flavor is NOT bland - you can taste the lemon!<br /><br />I followed the directions and used a wisk, and I have to agree with another review - a touch more water makes it a nicer consistency.  I also have to agree that you need a big bowl.  One package of this is listed as 17 servings which seems about right for a small party of 6 or 8 people.<br /><br />But the nice thing is you can easily mix up just the amount you want.  I found that 1 tablespoon of powder mix and a like amount of water makes just the right size for a snack or as a side for lunch.  And you're going to want to do that, because otherwise you'll just keep eating it!  There are only 50 calories in a serving - but multiply by 17, and... well, so long, diet!<br /><br />Everybody eats it with pita; I like it with flour tortillas; try it with pretzel rods or (my favorite) Snack Aisle's Pretzel Crisps.  Truthfully, I like it with almost everything!
