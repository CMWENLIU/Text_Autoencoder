As a Chicagoan raised by Detroiters, I can guarantee you this is the best ginger ale in the world.<br /><br />My only warning; once you drink it you will likely not be able to tolerate the other brands again. This beverage has substance. It has bubbles that will make you sneeze. It stands up to bourbon and it laughs at ice. It might have supernatural properties as well - if I ever get a cold or flu and can't get any Vernor's &lt;knock on wood>, it might never clear up.I now live in New York; because I'm fed up with the other brands that are so very pale in comparison (pun intended) I will now proceed to spend more than is humanly reasonable on a non-alcoholic beverage because I want, I need, I must have some Vernor's and I can't wait until the holidays to get it. My husband didn't understand, he's from California. He has since been shown the way of the Vernor's, so when this case arrives I will have to hide it in the compost bin where he won't find it.<br /><br />John Henry, I tip my hat to your brilliant ode. And you, Vernor's, with your whimsical green and gold can and your spicy amber bubbles - you are the stuff of legends. I shake my fist at your strictly local distribution but admit in the same breath; only you would I spend $3 a bottle for.<br /><br />Please come to New York. I'm lonely and homesick without you.
