This is honey that any beekeeper would prize. Its rich, deep, complex layering of taste and unique to Tasmania wild flower(Eucryphia Lucida)aroma make this the perfect honey for that big flaky butter croissant or thick slice of brioche toast - even just a crusty roll and butter works well with it. It has the serious flavor that many honey's lack today and will hold its own with any import from Greece or France. On thick Greek Yogurt its a unique treat. I thought it was a great buy compared to those 8 Oz jars of specialty honeys selling for much more than the price of this 500 gram (1.25 lbs) jar. Definitley an "in the know" product at a bargain price.
