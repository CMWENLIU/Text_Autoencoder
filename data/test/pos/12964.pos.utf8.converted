This is the best instant coffee I've found.  Although I love excellent strong,clean-tasting brewed coffee, this more than satisfies me in the morning when I'm either too rushed or tired to brew it.  My order came just as stated:  4 jars.  I opened one and have three in the freezer to bring out as I need them.  I was so happy to find it at Amazon since my local stores don't always have it.
