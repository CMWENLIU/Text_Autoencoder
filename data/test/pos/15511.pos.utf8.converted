My little Westie, Benji,  was having heartburn, diarrhea, and upset stomach issues for quite a few months. He would throw up almost daily. We took him to an Internest who recommended we feed him a kibble containing only two ingredients before we proceed with other tests. This is one of the kibbles she suggested. It was in two days that his vomiting and diarrhia stopped.  I highly recommend this product. Thank you Natural Balance.
