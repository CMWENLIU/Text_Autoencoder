I wanted an alternative to what is disguised as milk in the supermarket but I also don't have much faith in the so-called organic milk they sell either.  I found Bob's Red Mill on Amazon and have never been sorry we tried it.  My family loves this milk, we never run out of milk and it never spoils because it doesn't last that long.  It is a challenge to mix, as someone else stated, but I just use my Magic Bullet with all the powder in the first run and it mixes great.  Whatever is stuck to the sides comes off in the next whirring of filtered water.  Wonderful product.  I have also ordered several other Bob's Red Mill products and I am just as pleased with those.
