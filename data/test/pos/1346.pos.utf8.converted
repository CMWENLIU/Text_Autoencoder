This is one of my family's favorite cereals.  Even my son likes it, and that's saying a lot.  It's light and crunchy, full of cinnamon flavor with just a touch of sweetness.<br /><br />Low in fat and calories, sugar is not too bad in my book (that's always debatable depending on who you ask, but I don't think 8 grams per serving is horrible).  It even contains fiber and protein and 9 vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />We love this cereal for breakfast, or any time we need a quick on the go snack in a bag.<br /><br />per 3/4 cup serving:<br />Calories - 120<br />total fat - 1.5 grams<br />protein - 3 grams<br />fiber - 2 grams<br />sugars - 8 grams<br />total carbohydrate - 25 grams
