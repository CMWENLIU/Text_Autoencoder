I've tried quite a few different types of Matcha in the last few months and this one is my favorite! I wouldn't call myself a connoisseur or anything but to me this one has the best flavor and price combination. I tried the SerendipiTea Matcha and I just couldn't get past the bitter taste... no matter how cheap it was. True this one is pricier but its cheaper than the DoMatcha first harvest (taking into account that this is a 2.82 ounce tin and the first harvest comes in a 1.08 ounce tin) and tastes just as good. Basically it has all the elements I'm looking for: smooth taste, organic, and at least a little cheaper than some of the other options.
