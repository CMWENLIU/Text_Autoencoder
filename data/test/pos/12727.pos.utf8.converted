After trying other couscous from the Amazon site I did not have my hopes very high, but I was surprised that this brand is very good. The packaging is awkward though--it is not resealable. I don't understand the references to Israel in the product description. This is NOT Israeli (pearl) couscous. The grains are slightly larger than my supermarket brands and quickly re-hydrates without becoming sticky. It is definitely worth a try.
