A lot of reviewers are calling this 'green tea' only, and it's not just green tea. Green tea and matcha green tea are very different teas, so the terms are not interchangeable. Matcha is generally a very expensive form of powdered tea used in tea ceremonies. This Kirkland brand is obviously not expensive, but it tastes pretty close to the really good stuff. I have had all kinds of matcha, because it is my favorite kind of tea, and I definitely recommend this tea. It's really quick to steep, less expensive, and doesn't require the whisking needed for real, high end matcha. I definitely still love the good matcha more, but this works for me as well!
