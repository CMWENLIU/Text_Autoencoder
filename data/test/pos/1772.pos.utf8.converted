I bought this salt after reading Suzanne Somer's books. It turned out to be great because this salt does contain more minerals than "NA/CL", meaning you get a supply of important nutrients and does not have to ingest anti-caking ingredients in regular salt. But I do not know if Himalayan does supply iodine. The food tastes great, you can feel the difference. Great product!!
