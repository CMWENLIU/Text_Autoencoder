I live in California and we arguably have some of the best cheeses in the world out here. I'm originally from New York where I worked 4 years in a Sicilian restaurant, and my taste buds prefer whole milk products with low salt. I've tried a lot of dried cheddar cheeses in my cooking and baking, but I have to admit that this cheese powder from Ohio of all places is the best I have ever used. I am 50 years old, but I also have to shamefully admit that by adding a teaspoon of this cheese powder to the mix, I am once again like a little kid and I now occassionally enjoy a box of Kraft macaroni & cheese.
