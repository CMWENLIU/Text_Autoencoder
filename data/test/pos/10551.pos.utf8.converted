A lot of my friends like to shop online, so I added this to my baby registry.  My best friend received one at her shower and she loves it!  So when I got TWO at my shower, it wasn't the disaster other duplicate gifts can be!  My little girl is now three months old and we are still getting a lot of use out of the Fresh Whole Rabbits.
