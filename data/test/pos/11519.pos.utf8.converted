I cannot say enough good about this dogfood - it is nothing short of miraculous.  We have a Westie with the classic bad skin, itchy, hot spots.  We have tried untold types of medication for month on end from the vet.  We even tried lamb food, garlic tablets, brewers yeast - everything under the sun.<br /><br />It was so bad that she carried her right foot up off the ground and hopped on 3 feet, she slept a lot and didn't interact with us much.  In desperation, my husband bought this food.  Thank goodness, because I know I wouldn't have.  I wouldn't have believed that just switching her diet could make such a dramatic change.<br /><br />Before we made it through the first bag, the hair was growing back on her foot, she was running and playing with her buddy, and "talking" to use again.<br /><br />She is a different dog after 2 bags - I've never seen anything like it, and I tell everyone about this food.<br /><br />If you have a pet with those coat conditions, just try it - its cheaper than the meds from the vet!
