First off, I don't think there is anything wrong with the taste of this tea. It has a subtle fruity/berry flavor.  I almost didn't order it because of some of the comments in the reviews.<br /><br />I've been using the Yogi vanilla energy tea in the morning and drinking this after dinner.  I do see a difference in my skin. It is more glowy and I haven't had a breakout since the first week of drinking the tea.  My husband has also commented on my skin so it must be working!!<br /><br />I would recommend this.  I will continue to purchase this even if I didn't get any results because it does taste really good!
