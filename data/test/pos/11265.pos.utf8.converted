Awesome snack, healthy and despite previous negative reviews these ARE gluten free and contain NO msg.  The product itself gets a 5 star review from me and my family.  HOWEVER, I have ordered these many times from Amazon and will never order them again in summer months or warm weather.  Even though they don't require refrigeration until after you open the package, my July shipment was mostly ruined from the heat.  I watched for delivery and picked them up within 2 hours of delivery at my mailbox but they had a smooshy and gross texture, a texture that remained even after refrigeration.  Alot of dog treats in this shipment, but I'll know for next time. I still gave them five stars because the snacks are great when kept in normal temperatures.
