I've been some combination of nursing and/or pregnant for a few years now, and trying to find time for a meal when chasing after a toddler or when morning sickness gives you many reasons to avoid every food on earth can be a real challenge. Because of this I sometimes feel like my pantry is some sort of test cabinet for a nutritional bar company. There are always at least a few kinds in there, ones that I've tried before and like and ones that I'm trying out for the first time. I finally got around to trying Kind Bars after all this time, and this specific flavor is officially on my "that's it, you've found a gold medal winner" list.<br /><br />There's usually something for my picky side to take issue with, but not this time. I love that they have extra protein, as they really manage to leave me feeling full and satisfied if I end up turning to one in place of lunch. The fact that it was packed with nuts made me suspect that I would find it too crunchy, but it has the perfect level of chewiness with a really pleasing-but-not-overpowering crunch. Unlike their sister bars (Passion Fruit Macadamia + B Complex, which I purchased at the same time) these are not cloyingly sweet. Don't get me wrong, they have sweetness, but I find that it's just the right amount-- you're tasting the nuts and other good things with just a bump of sweetness to help it along.<br /><br />I bought one box to try them out, now I'm back to load up on them while they are on sale. I'm going to be keeping these as my main bar with one or two other favorites for occasional variety. If you are the kind of person that is always on the lookout for a quick meal or snack fix, I really can't recommend this specific bar more!
