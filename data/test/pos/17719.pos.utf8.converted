The whole idea is keep fleas out of your house.  Once they have invaded What do you do?  I have tried every thing, sprays, powers you name it.  These have been temporary solution at best.  the best response to the invasion is to trap them.  Each of the invaders you trap is 200 fleas removed.  Once they are trapped, no kids.  Yes the trap works and it removes fleas with out the deadly chemicals.  If fleas get into your house and you prefer not to kill all the other residents of your house try the traps.<br /><br />Mike
