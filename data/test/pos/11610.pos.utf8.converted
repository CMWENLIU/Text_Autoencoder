I didn't realize these packages are full of water (didn't read enough info apparently). It is best to cut a corner off and drain all the water out over a screen of some type. I warn you, the water smells a bit funny. However, that smell does NOT translate to the noodle when in the meal so don't throw it away. The noodles are really really long and don't break as easy as normal pasta in your mouth so it is best to cut them up with a pair of kitchen scissors (i made them about 4" or less). The package says two servings and I didn't think that would be correct when holding a package in my hand. However, the noodles really have a lot of substance and it is definitely two servings when you add other stuff. Not what I expected (thought I would get a package of dry noodles that had more servings) but they are great and I love them! What a relief to get a good noodle for soups, Italian dishes, and stir-fry without any carbs or calories. I just wish I could get these every month on a subscription like with other groceries.
