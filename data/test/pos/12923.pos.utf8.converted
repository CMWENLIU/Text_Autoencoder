If you buy one tea, buy this one:  PG TIPS.  It is the workhorse, the best of the daily drivers, the most satisfing all round bagged tea I have ever had. Other teas might be more rarified and refined, good for special occasions- but I found them all to grow stale in my cupboard if this was in the house.  For a more astringent cup, now and then, add a pinch of green tea to your brew.
