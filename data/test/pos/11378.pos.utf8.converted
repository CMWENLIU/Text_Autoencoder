I was recently told by my doctor that I needed to begin a gluten free diet.  I love cookies & was SO upset!  I found these lemon shortbreads & fell in love!  I like to put them in my freezer & eat them cold.  My favorite thing to do is have a cup of English Breakfast Tea & these cookies in the afternoon.  Now that it is summer I have switched the tea for pink lemonade.  I definitely recommend these delicious cookies!
