I am a huge tuna fan, eating it at least three times a week. I used to eat more, before the government warnings on mercury.<br /><br />This is the best. It is pricey, but worth it if you want to splurge on that special tuna salad, tuna sandwich, or anything else that really emphasizes the taste of the tuna.<br /><br />Sometimes I just eat it straight right out of the can.
