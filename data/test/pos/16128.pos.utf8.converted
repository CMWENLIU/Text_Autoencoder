This coffee is really good.  I was hesitant about writing a review, but I have been through several types and brands of coffee on Amazon, other mail order sites, and local grocery stores offerings without anything that matched this coffee.  That along with having let several people try this coffee and everyone that has ever tried it goes on about how good it is prompted me to put in my 2 cents in on a review.<br /><br />The taste is full bodied without the bitter bite.  This coffee reminds me of the type of coffee you get and the end of a high dollar meal.  It has a richness of taste that comes thru unlike an over the counter type franchised coffee.<br /><br />I use this coffee at home with a drip coffee maker with screen only type filter and get great results.  I also use this coffee at the office with a French Press and get incredible results.  At the office, even the "coffee snobs" agree this is really good coffee and end up buying it for themselves.<br /><br />Personal tastes differ, but I think it would be hard to go wrong with this coffee.  The regular roast of this coffee seems a shade darker than other regular roasts and the beans arrive with that oily texture/sheen you would expect with a fresh quality coffee.
