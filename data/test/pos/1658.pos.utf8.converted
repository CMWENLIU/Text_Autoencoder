When I discovered these noodles in 2006, I was really excited.  But, I had no idea how to cook them in a way that'd make me want to actually eat them.  The liquid they're packed in stinks, they have a very strange consistency, and they have no flavor.  It took me about a year to figure it out.<br /><br />Drain the noodles and rinse them really well.  Place them in a microwave safe bowl and microwave them (I use the potato setting).  After the first round, drain them in a colander and check the texture, do they still have water in the noodles?  If so, put them back into the microwave and zap them again.  This process removes all of the liquid, and gives the noodles an actual pasta texture and consistency.  And, it allows them to reabsorb whatever sauce you're pairing them with to give them flavor.<br /><br />Once they're ready, you can combine them with ingredients to throw in the oven for an amazing tuna casserole, or throw them into a reduced pasta sauce for an amazing dry spaghetti, or add them at the end of cooking a phad thai.
