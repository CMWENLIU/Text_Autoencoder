I was just making pizza dough and noticed that I am down to about a 1/4 cup of this yeast.  Then it occured to me that I have been using this same package for TEN YEARS.  It is still vital, having been kept in doulbe ziplock freezer bags all this time.  It has even survived a move.  Is it a good thing to keep it around this long?- I don't know.  I can only tell you that it still works!  Keeping it dry and in the freezer must be the trick.<br />I go though phases of baking a lot, then not at all, but there's tons of yeast for your dollar, here.  It's a very consistent product, too.  It seems to have a much broader tolerance for temperature ranges, so that I don't need to be overly concerned with the exact temperature of the liquids I add it to, nor the temperature of the place I let my dough rise.<br />Really a great value.
