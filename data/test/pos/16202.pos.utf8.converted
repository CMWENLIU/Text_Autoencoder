These are the most delicious steel cut oats I have found, and they're certified to be gluten-free too!  They're yummy and satisfying and give me long-lasting energy all morning.  Since I'm always rushed in the morning, I put them in the pan at night and soak them in water.  I use more water than the directions call for (maybe about four times as much water as oats).  If you're going to add raisins, you can soak those right along with the oats.  Then in the morning I just turn the heat on, bring them to a boil, cover and turn down to the lowest simmer.  I like to cook them for 20 minutes, and they cook while I'm showering.  They don't need to be stirred at all as long as you keep the heat really low and use plenty of water.  Afterwards, I let them sit in the pan until I'm ready, and then before I eat them, I mix in a tablespoon of chia seeds.  Not only does this add even more soluble fiber and omega 3 fatty acids, but it thickens up the porridge perfectly.  Yum!
