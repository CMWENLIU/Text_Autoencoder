Because of acid reflux I could not drink coffee, even with using Nexium.  But this Folgers Simply Smooth was a wonderful find.  I can drink this every day and enjoy my coffee drinking again.  I brew it in a percolator with a double filter and it tastes just perfect.  Others who have trouble with acid reflux should give this a try before giving up on coffee altogether.  I hope you find the joy of coffee drinking once again.
