After much research into healthy wet food options for my cats I decided on Whiskas because of the nutritional value and the fact that the first ingredient isn't a by-product or wheat gluten listed. My cats love Whiskas and I know they are happy eating this everyday. The package can be a little tricky to get the food out without making a mess. I've mastered how to open it though - hold at the top and shake all the food to the bottom of the package. Open the top at the notch and squeeze the sides so it opens then shake out all the food! (I think those directions are right on the package but I apparently didn't see them until after my trial and error.)
