Being diabetic, I am always looking for snacks that have low carbohydrates.  Generally for diabetes they recommend 15-30 carbs per snack.  At only 7 carbs per cookie, you can eat 4 of these and still be within the recommended limit.  You probably will need to eat at least 4 to feel satisfied, as they are thin and not that filling.  They do have a nice blueberry taste; not artificial tasting at all.  The cookie texture is nice and crunchy; not too dry and not too moist.  Not exactly a brown sugar taste, but very pleasant.  I can't imagine anyone not liking these.  I liked them very much and recommend them.  They are not overly sweet either, which is really nice.  You could easily eat 1/2 a bag at one sitting if you are not careful, or even the whole bag.  If you have self discipline you can eat just 2 or 3 and satisfy your taste buds, although maybe not your hunger.
