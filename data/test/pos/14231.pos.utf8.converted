I love this stuff. I use so much of this stuff I have to buy the 32 oz jug. It dissolves easier in fluid than just the powder. I also use their extract. Between these two products and my raw vanilla bean powder, I eat vanilla like it's a food group.<br /><br />I've had some other vanilla bean pastes. They were okay. This one's the bomb.
