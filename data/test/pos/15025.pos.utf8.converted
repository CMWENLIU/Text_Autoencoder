I feed three large dogs and one small dog with this dog food.  I've used it about three months.  Formerly I used a well-known brand that I assumed was good since it was well-known and readily available at stores everywhere.  I decided to change when I did some internet research showing my old brand was considered to have inferior ingredients.  I have to say that I have seen good reviews on the ingredients of this dog food, but I cannot say I notice anything in particular about my dogs since changing other than they seem to enjoy it more and seem to be satisfied with less of it.  Perhaps one dog who has skin problems is better, but I can't swear the dog food is the cause.  So, relying almost entirely on internet proclamation of quality, I give this a hearty recommendation.  And, the price is competitive to lesser rated dog foods.  And it comes directly to your door.
