Well, it looks like Dagoba discontinued it's Prima Materia 100% cacaa bar, which was my favorite! Maybe, it was too strong for most people as a straight chocolate bar.<br /><br />However, I was thrilled to find this 100 percent "baking bar"... really it tastes the same as Prima Materia and unlike other baking bars there is no alkali added for processing (according to the packaging), so that means you get all the natural flavonoids and antioxidants in tact.<br /><br />So, for those of you looking for a substitute for Prima Materia... this is it...nice and astringent, strong and complexly flavored. I eat it right from the wrapper, but sometimes grate it over ice cream or in my tea.<br /><br />Will definitely purchase again.
