I have tried 4 different brands of wasabi peas on Amazon. (Fasig's Barry's, Hapi's and Kasugai) These are the best tasting. Having said that,<br />your tastes may not be the same as mine:<br />1) They are hotter than the others<br />2) They are less sugary than the others.<br />3) They are very crunchy.<br />ENJOY!
