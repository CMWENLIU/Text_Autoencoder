Everyone loved this product at my house! The taste is nice and refreshing. My teen son loves it and I feel good about him drinking something that is mostly juice, sugar and caffine free. The serving is a great size and easy to pack into lunches and even your bag for work. My husband is taking his to the office and likes the smaller size as well. I tried Izze when a friend came over as a mixer and it was a hit. I'll be looking for this at the grocery store and want to try other flavors as well. YUM!
