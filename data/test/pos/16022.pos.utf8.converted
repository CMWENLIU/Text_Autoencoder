"Erythritol" has become one of our favorite sugar substitutes since I became diabetic a few years ago. My wife uses a little bit of added sugar to bring the sweetness up for the rest of the family in things that need it, but I am happy with it as a one-to-one replacement for sugar in most things.<br /><br />I have not noticed any glycemic impact to my blood sugar or "laxative" effects seen with other sugar alcohol sweeteners (which is a very important consideration :-)<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />CFH
