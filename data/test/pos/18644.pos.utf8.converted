Received the Kronung today, and love it... however was VERY suprised to see 250 g (8 ounce) packages when the product features and description indicated it was the 500 g (17 oz) package. Elsewhere, you finally see an 8 ounce indication. The web page description is very misleading. That's why it was cheaper than the commissary.
