Vanilla is close to the top of the list of my favorite flavors -- my fave protein supplements have been mostly vanilla based.  Add espresso to that, this HAS to be a winner.  I got my hands on an advance sample of CLICK Vanilla Latte.  And, completely ignoring the fact that my espresso machine is dead, this was the perfect day to try it out.<br /><br />As with any CLICK protein flavor - the suggested method of serving is to add the protein powder to 12-14 ounces of water, and mix well either cold, or warm it up.  I added 14 ounces of steaming water from my hot tap on the water dispenser.<br /><br />It was lighter in color than the Mocha Flavored CLICK, more like a cappuccino.  It even frothed, but that could have been from the psycho blending I do to it.  It definitely tastes like a vanilla latte, perhaps not the way I order it (Hi there extra shots!) but very taste-friendly to the espresso virgin.<br /><br /> The verdict.  HELL YES.  Thank you CLICK, I loves it.<br /><br />Product - CLICK Espresso Protein Powder Vanilla Latte Flavor<br />Price - Amazon varies.<br />Via - Amazon<br />Pros - 15 grams of ass kicking protein that you could never guess was a protein drink.<br />Cons - Not as strong as it's big sister.<br />Rating - Pouchworthy, MM.
