I saw Dr. Oz and he said Tart Cherry was good for you. A lot of his good 4 u things taste nasty. But this is really good. I used two TBSP. is a tall glass w/ four ice cubes and filled it with water. Sometimes I will add a packet of Purevia for a little sweetness. But it is good w/o anything added. I only ordered 1-16oz bottle, now I'm going to get more b4 I run out. This is really good!!! There is no aftertaste, but it is tart like cranbery juice. Amazon said it would be 2 weeks for shipping, I had it in 8 days.
