My friends, Godiva is worth every penny.  Times have been tough and I've gone without "the G" for some time now, but if you have the disposable income I say: Go(diva) For It!  (New rap follows below)<br /><br />I'm a Godiva-eatin' ofay,<br />Wouldn't have it any other way<br /><br />The chocolate is silky smooth,<br />Too much'll make your bowels move<br /><br />It cost a lot - but please indulge,<br />Put on weight - call it 'Godiva-bulge'<br /><br />"Gold Box Fever" is what I call it,<br />Don't be a tight-wad - pry open yo' wallet!<br /><br />WORD.
