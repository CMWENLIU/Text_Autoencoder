Regardless of how it's packaged, it's great either way.  I've purchased the boxes of 20 and used them even two years past expiration (odd, yes), but the flavor hasn't weakened.  Here, I've outright bought a bulk-packaged box to reduce packaging waste.  You get 100 teabags, each foil-wrapped (same as always).  My review is identical to what I've written for the 6 20-count boxes:<br /><br />Simply stated, I've been drinking this specific tea for several years now after an experiment went (happily) well. Some friends have found it to be too sweet, but they needed to be corrected in that no sugar is required (because they inadvertently added some). The tea provides more than enough natural sweetness of its own with no aftertaste (albeit a pleasant one, if it turns out that you're a little ill and therefore a trifle phlegmy... there, I said it).<br /><br />It mixes exceptionally well with green tea, though I've found not so much with certain black teas like Irish Breakfast -in which case I'd recommend avoid adding milk if you're normally inclined to do so with any kind of black tea. It is decaffeinated, so this is a perfect "unwinding" drink before bedtime. Not "spicy" in the classic sense at all, either. I thoroughly and highly recommend this variety of Stash tea.
