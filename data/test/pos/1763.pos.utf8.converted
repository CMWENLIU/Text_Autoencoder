I like this stuff!  Good source of various vitamins (esp potassium) and it seems to give me energy without some of the adverse effects of other energy drinks.  Not a significantly high amount of caffine which I like.  Heck, this stuff might actually be good for you!  Taste is good, better than many other energy drinks and the price is good compared to anything you might buy in a can.  I prefer the orange flavor.  Probably good for hydration during hot sweaty work or sports events.
