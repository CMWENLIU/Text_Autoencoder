OK, not really magic, but it sure does make you feel better when you have a cold. It also does wonders at soothing a sore tummy.<br /><br />Honestly, the first time I tried this drink, I thought it smelled kind of funny. But once I took a couple of sips, the warmth of the ginger, and the sweet taste of honey, all combined and cleared my sinuses, soothed my sore throat, and made me feel really relaxed. Now, it just smells like ginger and honey to me, and I know it will make me feel better.<br /><br />I also drink it when I have an upset stomach. The ginger makes you feel like all your stomach muscles relax and it warms you up from the inside. It settles queasiness too.<br /><br />But don't just think of this as a medicinal drink. It's tasty, and is a great addition to my collection of tea. Even when I'm not feeling a cold or a stomach ache, it's a great way to warm up and relax!
