Black Panther 88%<br />I've tried about a dozen or so different dark 72-90% chocolate bars and so far, nothing has come even close to this bar.  It is rich and smooth, and not bitter at all. I've tried other 70%+ bars that were much more bitter than this. They obviously up the cocoa butter to compensate for the lack of sugar.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommended it if you enjoy other very dark chocolate. There do seem to be availability issues and I have had local stores either sporadically carry them or have older or heat damaged stock (white chalky coating). The company even sent me coupons to replace the older bars though.<br /><br />Do NOT buy this if you don't like other ultra-dark chocolate. I had to bust out laughing when another review said "I dont know why there are so many good reviews for this. Some people out there must really love to punish their tastebuds. Maybe they also like black licorice and black coffee?". Actually, YES, many people DO enjoy black coffee. So if you're the type that enjoy's coffee flavored sugar or tea flavored sugar, then this is probably NOT for you.<br /><br />But, if you enjoy rich non-sugary treats, then this may be a great experience. Honestly though, go buy a single bar before you invest in a whole case of chocolate you haven't tried yet.
