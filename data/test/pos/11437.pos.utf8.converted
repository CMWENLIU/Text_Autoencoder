My dog is picky and doesn't eat his food in a bowl, but the buster cube solved all of that. This keeps him busy, exercised and happy. We fill it up two times a day for him.<br />The only down side is filling the cube. You have to put the food in the hole, shake it for the food to slide through a hole on the side, and keep adding food. The whole process takes about 1.5 minute, which isn't too bad.<br />I recommend this to all dog owners.
