My 3 Westies will do anything for a these treats - they absolutely love these snouts!!  Since the snouts are pretty big, my husband cuts them in half with a tree limb cutter.  I use them as reward for good behavior or as treat after a nail clipping session which is their most hated thing in the universe.  I can get instant forgiveness with a snout offering.  I like giving them this treat because: 1). helps clean their teeth, and massage their gums, 2). they are baked so are not loaded with fat, 3). they are lightly smoked so that it doesn't stain their little faces, and  4). most importantly, they are made by an American company.  This gives me assurance that this product is made under sanitary conditions and that no harmful chemicals are used in the processing of the pig parts.  After the China pet scare, I am careful not to give my Westies pet food/treats not made in the U.S.
