I'm a pretty avid coffee drinker, often of mid to high end coffee. At a local restaurant, I asked for decaf coffee, and they offered Dandy Blend as alternative. I tried it, and it was awesome, but not at all like coffee.<br /><br />However, it is delicious, and I've served it to really fussy people who have loved it. If I had to describe it, I'd say it's more of a flavor halfway between coffee and hot chocolate, but it really does have its own unique taste.<br /><br />Best way to serve it: 12 ounces hot vanilla almond milk (sweetened or unsweetened with a little Splenda), a heaping tablespoon of Dandy Blend, and... drink. It's been my evening snack the past few weeks and what I look forward to eating the most in my day.
