The price is not obscenely overinflated for a "specialty" item like this. Keep in mind, this is the 16-pack, not the 8-pack (which commonly sells for about $3.25.) I say specialty because they are only manufactured in New Jersey and primarily available in the New England area. If you grew up nearby and then moved to California, like I did, you have an appreciation for such things. These are pretty much what you'd expect from a Hostess owned company. They're super sweet, super spongy, and super addicting! Sure, you can get your relatives to send you the 8-pack for $2 and ask them to foot the bill for shipping; but really, if you've got a hankering for these things an extra dollar or two won't really bother you that much. Surely it's not justification for the one star review it received from a previous reviewer.
