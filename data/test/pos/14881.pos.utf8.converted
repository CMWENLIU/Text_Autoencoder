I have tried both the Tony Charchere's Originial and the Tony Chachere's Salt Free Creole Seasoning.  This review is for the latter (salt free). It seasons very well. The ingredients listed are: potassium chloride, maltodextrin, red pepper, garlic, spices and silicon dioxide. There is a disclaimer that advised people with diabetes, heart or kidney disease or to those receiving medical treatment to consult a physician before using the product. The seasoning is not overpowering.  A little goes a long way.  It gives food a nice seasoned flavor, and salt is not missed.  There is no bitter,sweet or artificial aftertaste. The flavoring is not overpowering.
