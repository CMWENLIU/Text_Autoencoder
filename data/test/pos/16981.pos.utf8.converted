These freeze dried strawberries are fabulous.  I use them in everything from cold cereal to oatmeal and even as an ice cream topping.  Most recently, I've chopped them up and added them to a batch of Rice Krispy treats (receiving rave reviews in the process!)  They're also great to snack on plain.  They have a light, crisp texture but they are not crunchy and they absorb moisture immediately.  Although 8 ounces doesn't sound like much, you really get a very generous quantity of these lighter-than-air strawberries.  I recommend this item highly!
