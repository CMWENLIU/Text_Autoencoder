I first heard about this cereal 3 years ago and have eaten it EVERY morning since then! A delicious, filling but not bloated breakfast that gets me started every day. I take a little more than a third of a cup and place  it in a DEEP dish rectangular microwave safe bowl with about three quarters cup of water for 6 minutes and 10 seconds. Make sure the bowl you place it in is DEEP or it will bubble over and cause a mess. My bowl is over 3.5 inches deep. You will get to experiment with how much oatmeal you want to eat and how much water is right to mix with it but it will come out great for sure! As soon as it is out of the microwave I mix some sugar free hazelnut creamer and stir it up and I am ready for a great breakfast. I will sometimes mix in blueberries or raisins but this oatmeal is the best I have ever eaten and will have this the rest of my life;..it is THAT good!! Enjoy
