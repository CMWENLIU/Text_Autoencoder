I have been searching for a hair product since Keratase discontinued their moisture creme (nutri sculpt).  I've spent time and money with no success until I tried this TRESemme Hydration Lotion.  It's perfect for my natural curly hair.  Everyone has different needs to style their curly hair, so I have discovered that it is difficult to use other reviews to use on my hair.  This is NOT sticky!  It does a nice job of moisturizing my hair.  I add Gene Juarez Curl Creme to my ends for the small amount of stickiness that I need.  Perfect!  What's better?  I get a six-pack of this product for the price I used to pay for one 6-ounce Keratase Nutri Sculpt.
