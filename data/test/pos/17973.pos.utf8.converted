I initially had a hard time getting a good and consistant cup of coffee from the EZ cup.  To be honeset, I didn't buy the EZ cup because it was ecofriendly, or even because it would cost less per cup.  I bought it because I love a good cup of coffee.  They are few and far between when using K-cups, and even with all of the blends available in K-cups, there were some I liked that I still just couldn't get. I wanted this to wok, so I followed another reviewer's recommendations and cut the bottom off of a K-cup.  This was to slow the flow of coffe through the device. Unlike the other reviewer, I didn't find that a 3/8" disk did anything, so I experimented. I wound up with a plastic disk that was cut just inside the protruding rim that you find on the bottom of each K-cup.  It seems to slow the flow enough to strengthen the brew.  I also used 2 TBSP of coffee per cup.  I am getting a great consistant cup of coffee.  I can make it allot stronger which is one of the reasons that I have a problem with K-cups.  I used the EZ cup filter with fresh ground coffee.  I agree that the EZ Cup spring tamps down the coffee and it seems to work better with more coffee and the plastic K-cup disk. Now I finally can get a strong cup of coffee regardless of whether a dark or lighter roast. I really think this has made the difference between a convenient coffee maker with mediocre coffee and a great cup of coffee.  I hope you find this review helpful.
