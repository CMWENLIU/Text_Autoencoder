I really enjoy Douwe Egberts coffee.  My girlfriend turned me on to it about a year ago.  She would drive out of her way to some restaurant just to get herself a cup.  We later found out that Burger King's BK JOE was actually Douwe Egberts so we could get it pretty much when ever we wanted.  Unfortunately BK switched to Seattle's Best earlier this year so we would have to again venture out to that tiny restaurant to enjoy a cup.  When I saw this product, I figured I'd have to give it a try since I've tried the VIA freeze dried coffee from Starbucks and enjoyed it.  I'm happy to report that this product is better than VIA and significantly more affordable.<br /><br />I purchased this on 7/30/2010 and it was at my door 2 days later.  The expiration date on the packages is 1/03/2012.  I'm probably going to stock up on a few cases of this since I have a terrible track record of finding something I like once then never being able to find it again.<br /><br />200 8oz servings ($.23 a cup)<br />I would describe this as a medium/light bodied roast with a very slight nutty flavor.<br /><br />Remember, taste is subjective and I don't claim to be an expert of any kind on coffee.
