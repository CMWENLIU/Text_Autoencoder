Buying cereal on Amazon seems to be my new addiction. I've bought these Cheerios three times now, and they have been exactly what I expected; there's no news there. This cereal is low on sugar and tastes good, even if it is a bit bland.<br /><br />However, if you're considering buying cereal on Amazon, watch the price. It will fluctuate pretty wildly. I'm not saying this because I think a bunch of folks are going to spend money without realizing it. I say this because the price will occasionally drop to under a couple bucks a box, making it a great deal.<br /><br />Also, grab the 15% off using Subscribe and Save.
