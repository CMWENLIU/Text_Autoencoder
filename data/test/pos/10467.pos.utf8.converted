Okay, they're Dentastix, not much to say about them except that it's handy not to have to run to the store for dog treats and with Subscribe and Save, they were even less than Target or Petsmart.<br /><br />Our rat terrier is a rescue with not-so-great teeth. We had his teeth cleaned when we brought him home, but he's not fond of really hard bones. The vet approved giving him Dentastix.<br /><br />He eats an upscale natural dry food, but I like to give him something to gnaw on and he enjoys these. At his 14 pound weight, he can have 1 or 2 a day, but I usually just break one in half so he can have them more often.<br /><br />Beware of the SMALL size, they are for dogs over 25 pounds. Be sure to get minis for your extra small friend. :)
