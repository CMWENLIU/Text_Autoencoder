When we initially went gluten free I'd bought an SCD cookbook to help me with recipes. However, everything I made had an odd, gritty type texture and I quickly decided I wasn't a fan of things baked with almond flour. Fast forward 5 years later & I end up with a cookbook that uses almond flour extensively, but the author specifically insists that you must use blanched almond meal flour, and especially recommends this Honeyville brand.<br /><br />I was skeptical, but decided to give it a try, since the author insisted the type of almond flour made a difference. We bought the honeyville, made a few things and were amazed! This flour is really great! We've made a lot of different treats with this flour and everyone - even our gluten eating friends and family - have liked what we've made. It is so great to be able to cook with a more nutritious flour (vs. rice, potato starch, and other nutritionally deficient gluten free options) that also tastes great w/o a gritty texture.<br /><br />One of the cookbooks we like & use a lot is: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/158761345X">The Gluten-Free Almond Flour Cookbook</a><br /><br />If you've not been a fan of almond flour cooking in the past, give it a try with this flour - it really does make a difference!
