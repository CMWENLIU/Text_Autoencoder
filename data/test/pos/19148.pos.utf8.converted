I use arrowroot as a 1 for 1 replacement for cornstarch in my gluten free cooking.  It's a perfect replacement as I have diet where there is some sensitivity to corn.  I use quite a bit of it each month so going with the Subscribe and Save program is great as shipping is free.  From other vendors including Bob's Red Mill the shipping costs can be quite high and add a lot to the total cost of the product.
