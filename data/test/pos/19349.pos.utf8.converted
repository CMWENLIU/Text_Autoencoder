This is the genuine article Johnnie Walker Blue Label, packaged in a smaller, more affordable, 200mL bottle. On a per drink price, this is a more expensive way to buy Blue. If the price of admission for a 750mL or 1L bottle is too high or risky, this small size is a good deal for a first taste.<br /><br />Johnnie Walker Blue Label became my favorite Scotch whisky a few years ago when a good friend brought me a bottle as a gift for a party I threw (yes he is a great friend). I was a single malt fanatic, Lagavulin was my preferred Scotch, and I basically would drink nothing but single malt.<br /><br />Blue Label has changed my mind about blended Scotch. Right now, I would rather save my money for a bottle of this incredible drink, than squander it on other Whiskies.<br /><br />This is an incredibly smooth Scotch. There is a light smoke flavor, but the biggest notes are fruit, oak, and spices. There is nothing better than a glass of this, a fine cigar (Opus X), and good company. Not to push snobbery or useless glassware for this drink, but it does improve with a medium sized round glass. There's no need to go crazy with a huge brandy fish bowl, but a nice Riedel red wine stemless glass is just great.<br /><br />There is nothing in the world wrong with adding an ice cube to this whisky (I know purists will hate trying this). The interesting thing about ice, the first few sips are nice and smoky. As the ice melts and adds some water to the Scotch (adding a small amount of water to Scotch is an accepted way to bring out different flavors), the smoke flavor softens and other flavors come out. Then as the drink gets cold, the smoke comes back. Ice adds an interesting change to this beautiful drink - it doesn't just dilute. After all, this is your bottle of Scotch and can do what you will with it.<br /><br />Every single person I've ever shared this with has loved it. At one time Johnnie Walker had the most amazing sampler box - 200mL each of Black, Gold (sometimes Green), Single, and Blue. If you ever find that sampler, it is the best value around. This is the perfect method to compare four of the better blended Scotches made - each with their own unique character. Without fail, the fourth bottle in the tasting, Blue, is always gone by the end of the evening. Tasting is a strange word to use; it's more three people sitting around enjoying Scotch. Johnnie Walker Collection 800ML<br /><br />Cardhu is the single malt that makes up the backbone of most of the Johnnie Walker blends.<br /><br />A way to try this Scotch is to watch for Johnnie Walker events. They hold free tasting events in major cities across the country. Their website has details and a schedule.<br /><br />Is this Scotch worth the huge premium? I've tried a lot of amazing expensive and not so expensive spirits, and I say this is worth every single penny. It is the bottle I pour when something good happens and I want to celebrate, or the bottle I open when things don't go so well and I need to lift my mood. It is an incredible drink; I like to call nectar of the gods.<br /><br />There's another unique Sctoch made by Johnnie Walker, Swing. Swing is kind of hard to find, it is about half the price of Blue. It is a super smooth Scotch that's I've started to really like a lot. It's been nice in the middle of winter.
