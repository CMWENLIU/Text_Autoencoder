This is my favorite chocolate. I love the hint of orange flavor. It's very smooth and creamy. I just let it melt in my mouth. It's pure heaven...mmmmmm.<br /><br />It's hard to find in the local stores. It's very seasonal, and not many stores carry it. When I do find it, the price is usually $3.99 each and they would occasionally go on sale for $2.50 each.<br /><br />They used to have a raspberry version that I liked even more, but that is nowhere to be found. (I don't think they make it any more).<br /><br />I don't like the dark chocolate version. I prefer milk chocolate over dark chocolate in general.<br /><br />The only problem with this chocolate is portion control. I have a hard time not eating the whole darn thing in a single day! LOL
