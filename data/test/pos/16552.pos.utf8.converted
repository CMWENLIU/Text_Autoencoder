Erythritol is the bulk sweetener that the sugar free food manufacturers should be using. It has many advantages over the ones most used by the manufacturers such as maltitol, sorbitol, mannitol, lactitol and xylitol. First, Erythritol has only 5 calories per ounce while the others have between 40 and 90 calories per ounce. Also, Erythritol has a glycemic index near zero while the others can be as high as in the 50's such as maltitol syrup. A low glycemic index is highly desirable as it does not cause an insulin spike which is a problem for those of us who are prone to overeat. Also, and most importantly, Erythritol has a far better laxation threshold than the others. For the uninitiated, this means that one can eat twice (or three times) as much erythritol as the others before having to go to the bathroom. Some of the candy makers used to use Erythritol in their sugar free candy bars but they stopped and substituted maltitol. Hershey foods in particular should bow their heads in shame as they had the best product made with Erythritol and ruined it with maltitol. The new maltitol laced product has more calories and is more likely to cause the "Runs." I sometimes think the candy companies are in league with the toilet paper companies. I use erythritol to make my own sugar free candy along with a good brand of unsweetened baking chocolate (e.g. Callebaut, Valrhona) along with some fiber such as inulin or polydextrose. If you do not wish to make your own candy with this product you can find some excellent ones on the internet that use Erythritol such as choco-perfection bars or chocolite bars.
