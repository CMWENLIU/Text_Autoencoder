We stopped using non dairy coffee creamer a couple of years ago and started using dry milk instead. I recently decided to try this one as it was 'Bob's'. I read the reviews so when it came, I got out my magic blender. I pour a cup of hot coffee into the blender then the dry milk and give it a whirl. I then add it back into the rest of the coffee pot and stir! It's so frothy and creamy tasting, I'll never go back to instant dry milk again! Now I mix some up and put it in the fridge to use as milk and it's great too!
