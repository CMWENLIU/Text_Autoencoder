I guess this is a secret.  This is great at keeping the diet that you are currently on.  You get the sensation of a complete meal, like spaghetti, or any other meat with sauce that needs a noodle.<br /><br />These have no flavor but pick up whatever they are being cooked with.<br /><br />It is so hard to find these noodles.  I travel to my local health food store to get them.  I might just get them from the Sea Tangle website, which is much cheaper than advertised here.  $33/12-12oz.
