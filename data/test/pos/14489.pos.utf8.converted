These granola bars are crunchy, tasty, filling, and perfect with my morning coffee.  Two bars per package.  Although they are nutritious and convenient, each package equals 4 Weight Watchers (WW) points.  Kashi bars (honey and flaxseed) contain more fiber, are equally delicious, but have only 2 WW points!  Hoping to find this option in bulk on Amazon.com soon.
