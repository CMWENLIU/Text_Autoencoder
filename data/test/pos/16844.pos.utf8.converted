Each of the containers has a large serving of quinoa (but only 170 calories) that is already perfectly cooked. I am not much of a cook myself and cooking dry quinoa, particularly just a single serving, didn't work for me.  Since it is already perfectly cooked, but totally plain, I can use it as a really quick and healthier base for many things where white rice or brown rice would work.  It can also be stirred into any strongly flavored sauced dish that needs a little toning down or extra hardiness or texture.  I use it most often as a nice substitute for rice in what used to be a "rice bowl" with meat and other ingredients on top.  I have now bought this item 3 times.  As far as I have found, this is a completely unique product and no one else makes anything as flexible and convenient with quinoa.
