I also order this stuff from coffeeam.com but it is a concentrate; it says right on the carton to add equal parts of milk(or milk substitute - I use 1/2% milk to watch calories and cholesterol levels).  I also use the Krups espresso machine in order to steam my milk before mixing with the heated up Chai.  And as a result, it tastes exactly like Starbucks.  I can drink it at a much lower cost though by making it at home!  If your Chai is made this way, you shouldn't taste a 'peppery' or 'spicy' taste.  That means there is too much chai.  Of course, after reading the other reviews, I realize that some people enjoy the stronger flavor.  But for those who enjoy the Starbucks Chai, this is the way to go.
