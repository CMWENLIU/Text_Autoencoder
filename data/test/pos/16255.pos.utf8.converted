This Ras El Hanout is a wonderful, authentic  spice that is difficult to recreate yourself.  It's hard to find and really enhances Middle Eastern cuisine.  This blend  includes lavender and roses, as well as more common cinnamon and cumin. Ras El Hanout gives a distinctive Middle Eastern flavor to a dish.  I use it in my Moroccan chicken, which I prepare in a crock pot.  A tagine would of course be even better!  For my recipe, I use organic  boneless chicken, a few tablespoons of high quality extra virgin olive oil,  potatoes or sweet potatoes,  quartered onions, lots of "baby" carrots, chick peas, cans of whole or diced tomatoes, diced garlic, honey, diced/chopped dried fruit such as apricots and/or prunes, chopped preserved lemon (you can buy or very easy to make), and then some  additional cinnamon and cumin, plus black pepper in addition to Ras Al Hanout to taste.  You do want to add enough to really flavor the "stew."  Moroccan chicken is very healthy and  fantastic served over whole wheat couscous.  For a lower carb version, you can omit the potatoes and serve over greens.  My kids love it, but it's also special enough for company.  If you enjoy Moroccan food or experimenting with spices, it's a great addition to your pantry!
