I am pleased with the squash, though I was hesitant to order after seeing several reviews where dented cans were received and a review that said the consistency was liquid.  The case I ordered was double bubble wrapped, and not one can was dented.  Regarding the consistency, the squash is not quite a solid mass like solid packed pumpkin, but is much thicker than the kind of squash you can buy frozen.  It requires a knife or spoon to get it out of the can because of the thickness.  After reading the review that said the squash was liquid, I expected something runny, that would pour out of the can; not so at all.  The flavor is very good and mild.
