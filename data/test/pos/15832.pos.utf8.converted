This is a great product.<br /><br />I started with McCanns and then switched to the Whole Foods bulk version and found them indistinguishable from each other. Ditto with this.<br /><br />Since I'm not shopping at Whole Foods any more, this is a terrific substitute. Great stuff, good price etc.<br /><br />I couldn't care less about the packaging. It's fine and probably better for the environment since it's not made of metal.<br /><br />I make a bowl every night in my crockpot: 1/3 cup of oats and 2 cups of water. Awesome breakfast awaits when I get up.
