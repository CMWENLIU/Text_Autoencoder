I bought this tea, poured some in my tea press, added boiling water and brewed. Made enough to fill a pitcher.  I drink it EVERY day and it has now become my MOST favorite flavor.  It is also my family's and friend's favorite tea to drink, whenever they are over, I pour them a glass, and then another. It has an aromatic unusually pleasant and fruity/floral flavor that is far superior to any other tea I have purchased, and I have tried very very many.  Enjoy!!  (And hide, because your visitors will make it disappear!)
