I have been using coconut oil as a body/face/hair moisturizer for about a year now and it has made all the difference in the world for my health. After doing a bit of research, I chose this product in particular due to the description, reviews, pricepoint, and the fact that it is a brand I have seen in many stores and am familiar with.<br /><br />The non-processed nature of this oil meets my skincare and haircare needs, but also makes it perfect for cooking as well. I bought it to use in the shower but now I cannot stop eating it on everything! It has a wonderfully light coconut smell and flavor, which is clearly natural and not from any artificial colorings or flavors. This is the best brand of coconut oil I have ever bought and it blends into my skin quickly and softly without feeling overly oily, tastes amazing, and washes out of my hair easily.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that it is packaged in a plastic container. While I am not too worried about the plastic leaching chemicals into the oil itself, I will be buying this product for the rest of my life and I'm sure I will be accumulating a lot of these plastic jars! Though they're recyclable, a glass jar would get reused immediately in my house. Other than that, I am perfectly pleased with this product! For the price, this can't be beat, it's worth spending the ~$10 to try it.<br /><br />Note: I couldn't find where this coconut product was harvested from on Amazon or the EfaGold website, but the bottle itself says it's a product of the Phillipines.
