My first order of cherries was perfection.  So moist and flavorful.  Just delightful.  I hurried and ordered a second shipment.  I was so disappointed!  The cherries are coated with a thin film of oil to keep them moist.  Well, this time the oil was rancid.  Yuck!  So bad tasting.  I really was surprised, since the first order had been perfect.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon and they are sending a replacement right out, no charge.  So, we will see how this next box will be.<br /><br />I so hope it will be ok, since I really do love the cherries and plan to keep them on subscription to come at regular intervals.<br /><br />Did anyone else have this happen to them?<br /><br />I'm so sad about the box of wasted cherries.<br />********************************************<br />UPDATE:  Happy to report that Amazon quickly sent a replacement box and it was perfect.  So, I am happy with the cherries and will continue to order with confidence that they will replace any defective product.  Thanks Amazon!
