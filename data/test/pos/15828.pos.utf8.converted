These oats are a staple for breakfast at my house. I completely agree with the other reviews and wanted to add one small detail regarding cooking the oats. These are not instant oats. They take some time to prepare so don't expect a quick breakfast with this product. The benefit to cooking the oats for 30 minutes is that the long cooking time actually expands the oats to approximately four times their volume. One cup of oats expands to four servings of hot delicious ready-for-brown sugar and cinnamon goodness!! Also, these oats are by far the best deal when you take a look at the serving size and cost per ounce.
