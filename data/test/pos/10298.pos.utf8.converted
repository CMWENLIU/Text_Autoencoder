After seaching long & hard for Squid Ink Noodles, I found them Amazon.  I was not dissappointed by this product, it has lived up to my expectations.  I make them according to the package directions.  I reduce heavy cream in a pan & add lemon zest & fresh chopped Rosemary.  This is truely a great tasting pasta dish!
