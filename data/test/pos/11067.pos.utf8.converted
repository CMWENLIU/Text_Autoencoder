For YEARS, I have been a coffee snob, preferring Starbucks to any other brands.  Yet, my health issues have made it very clear that coffee and I must part ways.  I searched for all kinds of coffee substitutes online and read honest reviews before deciding to purchase the Mediterranean Java Teeccino at my local Sprout's.  At $8.29/bag, I knew I was taking quite a risk, but...it was totally worth it!  I enjoy Teeccino guilt-free without the unhealthy consequences of coffee.  I sure do miss that caffeine rush, but I sleep better now, my moods are more even, and I have more energy in the day as opposed to the highs and lows that coffee has done to me.  My coffee addiction did a number on my teeth, on my gut, and on my mental health.  I finally feel like I am almost free from this addiction!!!  Teeccino is a wonderful replacement for coffee and I don't have to feel guilty drinking it (though I'm going to try and find a better deal on it from now on).<br /><br />To be fair, not everyone agrees.  My husband thinks it smells and tastes like paint.  My hopes were dashed with the smell as the first pot brewed, but the taste is very full-bodied like coffee and I love it.  Can't please 'em all!  So, we just take turns using the coffee pot.  Works for us :D
