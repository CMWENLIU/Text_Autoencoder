I really like these vege hot dogs and have been eating them since I was a young adult( 1970's). I fry them and when they have a light crust I eat them with mustard, relish and onions. They are an acquired taste and don't taste like a real hot dog, but the taste to me is flavorful in a vege dog kind of way! If you have never tried them before you might consider a single can from Kroger food store. They sell them in their organic foods section. If you decide you like them and also the idea of no risk of meat borne disease, then the best way to order is through Amazon.com. The deliver is great, shipping is free, and a grocery discount available at this time makes buying them with Amazon cheaper than through the Kroger grocery store. Hope this was helpful to you! PS I also prefer them over the Vegelinks, however my 12 yo grandson prefers the vegelinks, so I buy both.
