We have lovingly dubbed these treats "kitty crack". Our 11 year old lynx point siamese goes NUTS for these treats. He will follow you anywhere and comes running if he even hears the bag being jostled. I like that they are natural, but would prefer if they were completely grain free. They are small enough to be eaten quickly, but just soft enough that they are easy to break apart for training. Definitely a favorite in our house now!
