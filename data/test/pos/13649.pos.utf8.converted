Let me first say that I am very impressed by this product ( I am a food snob to say the least).  My husband worked in a pizza parlor as a young man and is a pizza fanatic.  When he was diagnosed with a wheat intolerance he thought his life was over.  I am an accomplished cook/baker and have spent a great deal of money time and energy learning how to cook for our new lifestyle.  I refuse to give up taste and texture in anything I make.  If it doesn't taste exactly like or better than the normal wheat based products I will not make it again and it does not go into my recipe book.  We have tried all of the gluten free frozen pizza's on the market and those made in local pizza parlors and have been disappointed.  This product makes a wonderful flavorful pizza crust.  Here is how it is done.<br /><br />1.  Purchase a 16 non-stick pizza pan and a 16" pizza screen.<br /><br />2.  Heat your oven to 450 degrees (I have a gas oven) and place your oven rack on its lowest setting pulling your second rack out to be used later.<br /><br />3.  Mix the dough as directed (I use hot tap water).<br /><br />4.  Spray the pizza pan with PAM or your choice of a non stick spray and pour dough out onto the pan.<br /><br />5.  Spread the dough which is like a thick cake batter completly to the edge of the pan.<br /><br />6.  Bake for 20 minutes and then pull out of the oven.  The crust will have shrunk about 1" in from the sides of the pan and would have turn up slightly which is normal and a good thing to help hold in your sauce and toppings.<br /><br />7.  Use 3-4 heaping kitchen tablespoons of ragu traditional pizza sauce to lightly cover the baked crust.  Using to much sauce will cause your toppings to slid off the pizza when eating and contributes to a soggy crusts which many home pizza makers experience.<br /><br />8.  Cover the sauce with a light coating of mozzarella cheese.  By this, I mean you should still see 50 percent of the pizza sauce not covered in cheese.<br /><br />9.  Place your toppings of choice and then cover again with mozzarella cheese.  Many people place to much cheese on their home made pizza which will also ruin the final taste of the finished product.  I highly recommend you go light on your toppings the first time you make your pizza and then adjust up after you have established your baseline.<br /><br />10.  Pop this back into the oven on the lowest rack and cook for 10 additional minutes.  The cheese should have completly melted meaning it is smooth and you no longer see individual shreds.<br /><br />11.  Turn on your broiler and bake for an additional 3-5 minutes being sure to watch the cooking cheese making sure it does not burn.<br /><br />12.  This is VERY IMPORTANT.  When done, pull out of the oven and slide it onto the 16 pizza screen to cool for approximately 4 minutes.  Ensure the screen is placed on top of another type of wire rack....I use the rack I've pulled out of the oven since I do not leave my top rack in when baking pizza's.  You must let air get to the bottom of the pizza in order to let it release the built up heat and steam.  This is why so many home pizza pies have soggy crusts.<br /><br />13.  Slide onto cutting board and slice your pie and then return it to the pizza screen.<br /><br />14.  When reheating the pizza I would recommend you reheat it in the oven on a piece of tinfoil coated with PAM at 450 degrees for approximately 5 minutes.  The crust will be perfect.  I love this product so much I have purchased 2 cases through amazon.  Trust me....you will not be dissapointed.
