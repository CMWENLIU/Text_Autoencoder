This product is what it says it is. Packaging is what is shown. I have had my salt for a few months and the sealed bag keeps the moisture out.  This is REAL Organic Natural Unprocessed salt.  The flavor that it adds to foods is so much better than regular table salt. Organic vs. processed table salt.  After having this healthier salt with the nutrients still in it, I tossed my processed table salt in the trash.  I will go with this product from know on.
