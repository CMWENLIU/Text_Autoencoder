Lavazza coffee is wonderful but the different blends are, well, different. I really like the Caffe Espresso because of the heavier slightly bitter/strong but also slightly chocolaty-sweet taste and the aroma. I use a Mocha/stovetop espresso pot so that makes a different kind of brew too.<br /><br />Caffe espresso is 100% Arabica beans as is Oro. I find the latter a bit rougher/stronger. Then, the wise folks at Lavazza start blending in Robusto beans and for those of you that like super smooth, less bitter you need to try these...  Crema e Gusto is at the farthest end of the spectrum - 70% Robusto 30% Arabica and dark roasted (usually they make a medium roast I think), super creamy, nice as Americano or a straight, milder espresso, me I don't think it stands up as a cappuccino. Next in line is Crema e Aroma - 60% Robusto. I haven't had this in years. Middle ground? That's Rossa with its 30% Robusto and 70 Arabica...this might be my favorite as espresso.<br /><br />There's a few other blends but they are newer and I haven't tried them...<br /><br />Amazon should offer a taster pack!<br /><br />Happy espresso drinking!
