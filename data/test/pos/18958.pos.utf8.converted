I was so happy to find this oil on Amazon!  I had been ordering through a local restaurant in Massachusetts after seeing the small colorful cans on their dining tables and tasting it on salads.  I love the olive oil and I love the scenes depicted on the cans.  We toured Italy last year and this invokes such pleasant memories of our trip.
