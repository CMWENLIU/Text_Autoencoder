I've tried a lot of brands, store bought and mail order, and consider this the best so far. Especially nice to get this 3-pack so you can see for yourself the difference in flavor you get from just using a different corn variety.<br /><br />It pops a bit smaller, as is true for many of the gourmet brands. But this popcorn has actual flavor. I usually pop it with plain oil and a little salt and pepper, letting the real flavor come through.<br /><br />The corn is non-GMO a plus for me.<br /><br />Don't go for the "bigger is better" but bland that is all to common. Give this stuff a try and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Excellent and highly recommended.
