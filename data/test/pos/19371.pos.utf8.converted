One summer while we were staying at a house in Italy our housekeeper gave me this recipe for the best tirmisu ever. She warned me, however, that you needed to use Pavesini biscotti--no substitutes! I was unable to locate them at any of stores that carry imported items. I thought that trying to track them down through Amazon was a long shot but I should have had more faith. I located the cookies, placed the order and within the week had received the package.
