Wonderful oil, very pleasant smell of roasted hazelnuts. I used it to make french-fries, fry eggs, or used for salads - it's goes good with everything. If you want that roasty flavor to last - don't cook in it, but use it in salads. I love this oil, and will buy again!! It's healthy, tasty and packed in a comfortable to use can - no spills!
