I wanted to wait until I had a few weeks to try this product, but after the first drop hit my lips I just couldn't wait to share the news!<br />honey and green tea is my coffee of the morning and I can honestly say after trying at least 30 different varieties of honey, processed and unprocessed, This is the absolute best honey I have tasted to date!<br />right from the start, the aromatic fragrant from lifting the top off was just so arousing to the senses, the taste/consistency is so absolutely smooth and creamy.  So, I decided to go ahead and try it with my tea, I can honestly say without a doubt, I almost immediately felt an energy boost which is major for me, this delcious tasting honey and it's floral aromatic frgrance are just perfect, the way nature intended it to be.  Very Healthy, Very Delicious!  Try and and I almost want to guarantee that you will fall in love with it, but I'm not you so I'm not guaranteeing anything HaHa..  Enjoy the nectar!
