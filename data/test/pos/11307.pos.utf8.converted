If you like cardamon tea, this is an incredible deal.  When I placed the order I had no idea how much tea 500 grams was equivalent to, and when I opened the box I was more than a little surprised to find the tins to be so large!  I have been making one pot of tea a day with it for a week and I have barely put a dent into my first opened tin!  For the low price of $23 for three tins, this may very well last me the entire year and is a value that simply cannot be beat.  I've always loved cardamon bread and this tea provides all the flavor of that bread without the calories :) No need for sugar either, just a bit of milk.  Thank you once again Amazon, for unmatched value and a great product.
