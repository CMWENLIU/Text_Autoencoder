I may be biased, as I have helped create some of the recipes available on thevegg.com, but I think The Vegg is a terrific product!  I have been eating a vegan diet for over 20 years, and I can't think of any other vegan egg yolk substitute.  One of the coolest ways to use The Vegg is to make a spherified Vegg yolk.  You can drop a quantity of The Vegg (once mixed with water) into a 1% (by weight) solution of calcium chloride and the liquid will form a ball with a membrane around it - which looks and tastes just like an uncooked egg yolk.  Try placing a spherified Vegg yolk in the center of a ravioli with some tofu ricotta or sweet potato filling - vegan gourmet for sure!  Just this weekend I saw calcium chloride granules on sale at Lowe's - Ball brand packages them for use with canning.  If you want more information about spherification, there is a link to a video at thevegg.com.  Also, if you haven't made french toast with The Vegg - go try it, NOW!
