I bought this flavor of peanut butter after trying the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GQ3E3M">Peanut Butter & Co. Peanut Butter, Dark Chocolate Dreams, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)</a> flavor I found at Target. This flavor is good, but not as good. The flavor was a little sweeter than I expected. I'm still giving it five stars, because if I had not tried the other flavor first I would think this is the best peanut butter out there! I cannot penalize pb&co because they make amazing peanut butter and I love one flavor the most. :)
