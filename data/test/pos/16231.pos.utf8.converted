When hurricane season approaches, this is what we pick up for our emergency food rations.  The tuna salad is already mixed so there is no mess.  No can opener required.  This kit includes:<br /><br />2.9 oz. can of tuna salad<br />4.0 oz. snack cup of diced peaches<br />  foil wrapped pack of 6 crisp crackers<br />  chocolate chip cookie<br />  plastic fork/spoon<br /><br />It provides 500 calories.  I can assure you, having a chocolate chip cookie (even when it is dry) is a great comfort when your property is being shredded by howling winds.  These kits are packed well enough and light for travel, but not crush proof.  The soft lids peel right off without cutting fingers.<br /><br />I tried some MRE dehydrated hiking/hunting food.  Ugh!  I much prefer having my eggs in this tuna salad.  They are mixed with mayonaise, water chestnuts, carrots and celery.  The shelf life is one year if you can refrain from eating them that long.<br /><br />We enjoy eating these good tasting snacks when there are no emergencies.  We love premium quality Bumble Bee tuna.  It is Dolphin Safe.
