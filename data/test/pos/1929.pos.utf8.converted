This tea comes in vacuumed sealed foil pouches inside 6 cardboard boxes. On cutting open the sealed pouch, you are treated to the fresh scent of pure black tea. I like that there are six small pouches rather than one big one, so that I know the tea won't go stale before I can use it all.<br /><br />The leaves are definitely the highly prized top buds, and is "single-source" as the package info states (not blended with cheaper teas from other countries). You cannot over-brew this tea. It doesn't become bitter or acidic if you accidentally leave it brewing too long.<br /><br />So far, I've only had it hot but can tell it will also make a great iced tea.
