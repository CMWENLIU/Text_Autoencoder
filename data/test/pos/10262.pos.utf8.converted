Roland Foods pearled farro is quick cooking, versatile, and delicious.  I made a salad with farro, sun dried tomatoes, green onions, feta, olives, and olive oil.  Healthy and yummy.  I am a big fan of Roland Foods, good quality, great go to pantry items, and hard to find items.  I also love their capers, mustards, and vinegars (especially the Bruno red wine vinegar).
