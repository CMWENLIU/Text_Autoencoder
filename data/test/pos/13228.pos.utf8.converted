This is the best G.F. Pancake Mix. I have Celiac and my children don't.(not yet anyway) and they DO NOT like my food and I usually have to begg them to taste things and then they spit it out. But i made Chocolate chip cookies with this mix and They came home from school and at all of them even after i told them they were G.F. They said you could not tell they were G.F. I made pancakes with it and they ate them all gone. By far the best tasting mix out there.
