I love this rice!  It's a very healthy alternative to someone who doesn't want all the sodium from rice-a-roni or other packaged box rice!<br /><br />This doesn't come with any flavoring, and has tiny bits of dehydrated mushrooms and carrots in it.  Cooks in about 20-30 minutes - so quicker than normal rice!  1 cup rice to 2 cups water - to give it a little flavor, I put chicken broth in the place of water, so it has a very slight chicken flavor!  (when my husband is gone - this is all I need for dinner!)<br /><br />The only bad thing that I have to say, is I was slightly disappointed at the size of the jars.  I thought I was getting 6 large jars that you see in the grocery store - and instead these were the smaller jars.  Nothing about the product though, it was my mistake as it was clearly labeled how many ounces are in each jar.  But to put it in perspective for you - only 2 cups of rice per jar.  So each jar makes 6 cups prepared.<br /><br />Enjoy!  I will be ordering it again when I run out!!  =)
