My whole family loves noodles, due to my daughter being celiac we had to switch to cooking gluten-free. Much to my dismay and my families, gluten-free noodles overall taste like crap! They don"t hold up well, either no matter how long you cook them they are still hard and then mushy, or you cook them right, but when you wanna eat them or mix them with gravy they fall apart. I am a spoiled german, it is said about us that we are extremely picky about food- a brand like "Bionaturae" (suppposedly also from Italy is litterally a insult to my toung feelwise and tastewise. Tinkyada is close, but still comparably FAR away from Le VEneziane. The taste and texture is like real noodles, cook the same too and hold up thje same. My best friend tried the LaVeneziane (which I actually brought from a germany vacation), when I had to spend a week in the hospital with my boy, and she had to take care of my daughter. She called me in the hospital even to tell me how awesome those noodles are and that they taste just like regular noodles. The other day she even asked me if she would make spaghettiesauce, if I could bring those delicious noodles- so we all can have the same as my daughter. That was a first- usually everybody is glad to not have to eat glutenfree, with this it didn't matter any more. The WANTED glutenfree noodles! While in germany we cooked those for my daughter, my dad a trained chef even commented that there is no difference to reall noodles.<br />Try them, in any shape- you will not be dissapointed!<br />PS: Just so you know- in Italy Celiac-desease is a by LAW acknowledged desease (like peanut-allergy)- it has to be declared of everything, schools have to offer glutenfree meals as an alternative- and a standard schoolscreening at the age of 7 IS Celiacs. Italinas have a fine toung too and crappy food would not last.
