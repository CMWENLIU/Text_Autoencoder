With age, my tummy has decided it doesn't like me very much, and this product gives me a nutritious breakfast, that fills me up and is easy on my stomach.<br /><br />I enjoy this best when I soak 2 Tablespoons of the seeds in a cup of water or milk overnight.  It forms into a gel by the next morning.  If I've soaked it in milk, I add a tablespoon or so of Nestle's Chocolate Quick, and it tastes a little like chocolate tapioca pudding.  If I've mixed it with water, I add a bit of Tang the next morning, and it tastes like a fruity-flavored slush.  Sometimes, I also add shelled hemp seeds and/or cocoa nibs for a little more nutrition and flavor.  When I add these extras, I also run it through the blender so I won't have to "chew" my shake.<br /><br />I also like that this has lots of fiber.  It doesn't have much taste on it's own, so it takes on the flavor of whatever I'm mixing it with.
