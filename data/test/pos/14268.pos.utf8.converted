I bought this for my partner's 60th birthday. Of course, she had fun seeing all this stuff again - though she said that some of it does not look familiar, probably because it wasn't marketed in NY. Our 11 year old son also enjoyed picking out his dessert from it every day and so did all our elderly friends! I found it funny that all this candy has Nutrition Facts on it, something it didn't when it was first manufactured! We called it the box 'o fun, we loved it so much. A lot of the stuff has peanut butter in it so be careful!
