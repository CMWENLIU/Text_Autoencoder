This is the best canned ham for its price.  Any time my wife and I want to cook some fried rice and cannot find any meats, we will simply open a can, chopped them into small pieces and used in cooking fried rice.  If we cook breakfast and cannot find any meat, we will simply cut it up into large slices and brown them both side in the skillet and serve them with eggs. It is so tasty and convenient and the price offered by Amazon is actually cheaper than that of our local Wal-mart.  I love it!
