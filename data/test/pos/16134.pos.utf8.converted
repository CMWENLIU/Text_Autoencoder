If you like Nougat and Almonds, then this is your sweet of choice!  I remember these delicious little treats from my childhood.  Whenever my parents would take us for Italian food, they would bring one nougat for each of us at the end of the meal.  As a child i loved being able to open the little box for my own treat.<br /><br />I ordered a couple of boxes to share with my family, especially the grandkids and they loved them and i have to say that after all these years, i was not disappointed, they were just as yummy as i remember!
