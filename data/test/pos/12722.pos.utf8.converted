I mixed it as per instructions, then I put 1 tablespoon on the dough and rolled it around in the bowl. I then covered it with a towel and put in the oven for 5 minutes at 150 degrees. I sprayer pan Olive oil on my 18" pizza pan, then spread the crust out to about 12-13". I then preheated the oven to 425 degrees and precooked the crust for about 8-10 minutes. I then let the crust cool a little. I then put 1 cup of pizza sauce with oregano and Organic garlic sea salt. I put 1 small onion finely chopped with 1/2 of a red pepper finely chopped, then topped with 6 ounces of fancy Italian blend cheese. I cooked the pizza on the lowest rack at 425 degrees until the entire pizza was slightly browned. DELICOIUS. The crust was slightly browned and not soggy at all, without being too crunchy. Aslo check your oven with a real oven thermometer, mine was 30 degrees lower then the setting. I always wondered why the center wouldn't get slightly browned likt the edges. WOW perfect and delicious.
