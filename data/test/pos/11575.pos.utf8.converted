I wholeheartedly recommend this most delicious tea.  I started drinking herbal teas for the health benefits, but this tea is so good I would drink it whether or not I were health conscious.  The Rosehips come in a bulk form (i.e. they aren't in little tea bags), but I've discovered that does not affect the making of the tea at all.  They just sink to the botton and it is easy to drink.  The taste is very much what one would expect of an herb that is so rich in Vitamin C, which is  a taste I have to admit, I love.  The taste is pure and and delicious.  I definitely recommend this one!
