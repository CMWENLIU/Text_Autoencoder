Saw this item on Martha Stewart and decided to try it.  It's unusual but I love the texture.  Like cavier, without the salty taste.  It does get stuck in my teeth though.  I've only eaten it for breakfast so far.  A little of the raw grains makes a LOT.  And you need a strainer or cheese cloth to rinse it -- the grains are so small they go right through a colander.
