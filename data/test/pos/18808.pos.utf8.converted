I am not an instant coffee person, but after seeing a taste testing results pole, that touted the great flavor of the Cafe Bustelo Coffee Instant espresso, I decided to try it.  The first two times I tried to order it, it was out of stock, but I did not give up.  I finally was able to order the product, and I was very surprised at how good it was. Since the minimum order was 4 jars, I shared with my family and friends.  They also agreed it was excellent.  It is nice to have on hand for that quick cup of coffee, or an iced latte.
