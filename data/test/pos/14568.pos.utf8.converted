It could not be easier to enjoy refried beans. If you are putting a Mexican meal together on the spur of the moment, Santa Fe's Refried Beans are an easy to prepare side dish answer.  They are faster to cook than canned beans, and I prefer their taste and consistency to most canned products. Enjoy!
