Everyone familiar with seaweed knows that is has a high nutritional value and can be either used in cooking or as a snack.  There are several different varieties and this one is a green seaweed.  Each piece is rolled wafer-thin and is approximately 2 1/2" x 3 /2," a dozen pieces per tray.  They are in individual trays, each packed with a Samsung silica-gel packet to keep them crisp and dry.  There are nine sleeves with three trays in each.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Seaweed, corn oil, salt, sesame oil<br /><br />Nutritional Facts<br />(One .017 oz tray)<br /><br />Calories  30<br /><br />Total Fat 1.6g<br />  Saturated Fat 0g<br />  Trans Fat 0g<br /><br />Cholesterol 0mg<br /><br />Sodium 75mg<br /><br />Total Carbohydrates 2g<br /><br />Dietary Fiber 2g<br /><br />Sugars 0g<br /><br />Protein 2g<br /><br />NOTE:  Each package carries a cautionary note that claims that the seaweed is processed in a "facility that also processes milk, eggs, fish, crustacean, shellfish, tree nut, peanuts, wheat, soybeans, shrimp and sulphites products."<br /><br />There is a relatively low sodium content,but these have a very salty taste.  For the snacker who craves salt, but not the calories that other snacks offer, this premium roasted seaweed would be ideal.  After eating a package my salt craving virtually disappears.  They can also be used to add to soups or a side additive to your rice or sushi.  The trays are a little larger than I expected, but can be used by the gourmet on the go.
