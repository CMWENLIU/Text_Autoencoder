Them bees sure spit out a delicious concoction eh? Ok that's not the best image of honey but it is what it is! It's delicious bee spit, fantastic stuff! The honey you buy in supermarkets is mostly devoid (fancy vocabulary for does not have) of nutrients since it has been purged through the heating process. You want natural, organic, raw honey like Wedderspoon's honey. Like yogurt, it has active cultures in it, which is good for you. A lot of people do not like the concept of living cultures in one's food, thinking it's gross or harmful. But I tell you what... if you did not have the friendly bacteria living in your intestines then your pooper would have one heck of a time my good friend! Also, raw honey has antibacterial properties, which is good for getting rid of the bad stuff in our body. Wedderspoon gives you not 1... not 3... but 16+ active cultures! They sure are generous with their cultures! Also, for the ladies, honey is great for the face. A lot of girls use honey to make a honey mask. You get distilled water, a bit of honey, and make a paste out of it. Mix well and apply to your face. If some of it slips downward, you can catch some with your tongue and get a little snack :). I put my honey on my loaf of bread mainly, but sometimes I get inspired by Pooh Bear and go at it standalone with just a spoon. Let's just say you definitely want some bread. Make sure you keep this thing away from the sun as the UV light from the sun will kill your active cultures. Reduced cultures = reduced nutritional benefit. Here is the summary:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />-Organic and raw, not processed<br />-16+ live cultures that are good for you<br />-Can be used to make a honey mask as an external facial mask for the skin<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />-Does not come free<br /><br />SPECIAL NOTES:<br /><br />-Keep away from sunlight, the UV kills the active cultures.
