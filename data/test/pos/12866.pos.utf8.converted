I owe a Coffee Shop in one Mediterennen medevial city and have a lot of experience with various types of Coffees. LavAzza is the favorite brend of Italians (among with Illy) with a reason. It has the best Robusta type coffee ground while Illy has the best rated 100% Arabica blend. LavAzza's 100% Arabica, called Tierra, in Europe is not highly rated as the other blends, such as Grand Riserva (the best LavAzza's blend), but some robusta blend are the top on the market. In US market, Qualita Rossa is the best one I tried so far; it has 70% Arabica nd 30% Robusta ratio; with delicate flavor and creamy top (if you have a good espresso machine and knowledge of espresso making). It is good as well for Capuccino with it's 'sweety' note. Would recommend it definitely.
