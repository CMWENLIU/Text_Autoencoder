This tea is just what it  says it is...sweet and spicy! My husband & I both enjoy it. If you are looking for a sweet treat without added sugar or sweeteners, give this a try. Also comes in an herbal, caffeine free version, which is good, but we still prefer the Original. Each box is sealed, and each teabag is in a sealed pouch, so it is easy to take along to work, or when traveling. Since it will stay fresh in our pantry, we ordered a large quantity to take advantage of the super deal being offered on Amazon, and recieved free shipping!
