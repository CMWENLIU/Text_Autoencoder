No matter how many different types of coffee I try for my Keurig, the Sumatran Bold is always one of the ones I come back to.  Flavorful, rubust, rich but not bitter.  This is the one I go to when I want a nice strong cup.<br /><br />In milder times, I enjoy the Columbian Supremo from Timothy's and Breakfast Blend from Green Mountain.<br /><br />Give this a shot!
