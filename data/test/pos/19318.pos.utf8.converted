I tried this a few years ago.  I loved it.  The price and shipping were high, but was willing to use this sparingly, just in order to have a healthier alternative.<br />I did find some "sprouted" flour in my local health food stores, but the quality was not the same.<br />This is high quality, made to order (as I recall).<br />I now order the sprouted wheat berries and grind at home...I don't think I did this initially because I was afraid to burn the motor or something on my grinder...I attempted to sprout my own wheat berries, but they still had too much moisture in them and messed up my grinder.<br />I am glad to say that the sprouted wheat berries are not a problem for my grinder.  Very pleased and it does bring the cost down for me to have it in this form...plus I can store it longer if I buy bulk.<br />Thank you.<br />UPDATE  7/2012<br />I DON'T ADD ANY GLUTEN TO MY BREAD AND I USE 2 TSP OF YEAST INSTEAD OF 1 TBSP OF YEAST ON RAPID CYCLE OF MY BREAD MACHINE AND I GET BEAUTIFUL LOAVES.
