Even though I know it's important to eat breakfast, I seldom do it; I'd rather sleep a little longer. These breakfast bars are a nice easy way to solve the problem. I keep a box in the car and munch on them on the way to work in the morning...they're whole grain, nice and filling, and taste good to boot. They're also a nice treat on the way home. The Oats and Honey are my favorite, but the variety pack provides a nice change. All of the flavors are tasty: peanut butter, cinnamon, maple sugar - all yummy.
