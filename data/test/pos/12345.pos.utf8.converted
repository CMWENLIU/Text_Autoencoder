Vegan. Natural. Kosher. Spicy. Big chunks of carrot, cut green beans, & babycorns in a hot, flavorful curry sauce. Great over organic rice or with noodles. If you like spicy Southeast Asian curries, you will really enjoy this one. Reminds me of some great curries I've had in Singapore & Thailand. 240 calories and 6g of protein per pouch. Add some more tofu or your favorite beans for added volume and protein, if desired. Product of India. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference.
