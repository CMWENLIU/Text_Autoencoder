Bought these for the first time and absolutely love them. They arrived the next day after shipping, well packed and well frozen. The shipping company even called to confirm my address for delivery. Cooked the first package today and served with drawn butter. I chose the boiling water method. Bring the water to a boil and insert the langostinos and only cook 2-3 minutes if thawed; 5 minutes if frozen. Don't overcook or they will be tough and dry. I have a bad habit of overcooking fish thinking that it must need more time. It is so worth the money and I will be ordering these again.
