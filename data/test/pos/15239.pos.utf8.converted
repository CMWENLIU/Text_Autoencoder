I found these to be great if you know how to prepare them. First get a strainer and wash them with cold water, let the cold water run and run until must of the smell is gone.<br />I prepare a Puerto Rican "arroz con pollo" (rice with chicken) dish using these and it comes out very good almost as good as the real thing ;)<br />Here is the recipe,<br />2 bags Miracle rice(1 bag per person)<br />1 pack, chicken tights,4-6 pieces(no skin no bones)(Chicken breast drys out)<br />1/2 cup cut onions<br />Oregano powder 1/4 tsp<br />Lemon pepper or regular pepper (about 1/4 tsp)<br />1-2 chopped garlic or 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder<br />olive oil (1 tablespoon)(optional)<br />Red wine vinegar (or any other kind) 1 teaspoon<br />For color;use one envelope of Cilantro-Achiote Sazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B0ZEZE">Goya Sazon Cilantro-Achiote Seasoning</a><br />or 1/2 cup tomato sauce.<br />*3/4 to 1 cup water (or use 6oz of beer and 2oz water)<br /><br />If available use 1 tablespoon of adobo(replaces the pepper and garlic powder)for more authentic flavor.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TA9MDQ">Goya Adobo All Purpose Seasoning, 8 Ounces</a> you can buy it cheaper at many store that sells Latin products.<br /><br />Wash well and cut the chicken in small pieces, season with the vinegar, adobo or garlic powder, pepper and oregano powder, set aside.<br />Add the Olive oil garlic and the onions to the pot at medium heat, after a minute, add the chicken and cover in medium heat.<br />Cook in medium for about 8-10 mins, add *water (or beer)and cook uncover and let it boil for about 3-5 mins.<br />Meanwhile wash the miracle rice in a strainer under cold water, drain it.<br />Add the Miracle rice to the chicken and the seasoning packages, mix it well and let it cook uncovered for about 15-20 minutes or until water is evaporated. (sometimes I drain some of the water since I put extra when cooking the chicken)<br />For more flavor, add a little envelope or cube of Ham flavoring<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HQOSQE">Goya Concentrated Ham Flavoring, 8-Count Packages (Pack of 36)</a>or chicken <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SW1FYK">Goya Cubito En Polvo Pollo/Tomate, 2.15-Ounce Units (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />Try it, it taste great! You can also follow the recipe and use pork, or canned garbanzo beans, pigeon peas or beans, instead of chicken.
