I like oat bran because of its high soluble fiber content and low glycemic index.<br /><br />When I bought it, I thought you have to cook it but instead its delicious even with no cooking. I eat mine raw, with kefir, so you could use it for instance in yogurt, straight from the bag. This means less processing, so you wont increase its glycemic index by breaking down carbs through high temperatures, and you will preserve all of its nutrients.<br /><br />The price is good, with the subscribe and save it is cheaper than I could find in any local store.
