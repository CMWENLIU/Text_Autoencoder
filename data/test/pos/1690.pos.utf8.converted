I know a lot of people come on here and complain it has corn syrup. However, I have tried about 20 formulas and this was the only one that worked for my baby. When you find ones that works, you stick to it. The fact that she is getting nutrients from it and it stays down, that is what I am focused on as a mother. Other formulas made her gag and throw up. Just because she did not like them I am not going to go to the other formula pages and put them down.<br /><br />I have been buying this formula for over a year here. I just received an email that they no longer are doing the Subscribe and Save price. That is sad. The regular price of the item now is higher than my local Walmart store. It was so convenient to order from Amazon and have it delivered to my door. Plus, I would rather give my money to Amazon but as a single mother, I need to get the cheaper price.<br /><br />I hope they decide to add it back to subscribe and save again if enough people write about it. It was so much easier. I guess this will be my last purchase until they either lower the price or add it back to S&S.
