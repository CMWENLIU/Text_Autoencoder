I was mainly concerned with my triglycerides as they were astronomically high.  Was prescribed Tricor but refused it after reading possible carcinogen.  Here is my data with no weight loss or change of diet:<br /><br />Pre-Benecol:<br />Total cholesterol - 225<br />Triglycerides - 900<br /><br />After 6 weeks:<br />Total Cholesterol - 185<br />Triglycerides - 500
