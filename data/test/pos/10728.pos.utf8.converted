This is the best coffee available for a Keurig machine.  By far, IMHO.<br /><br />Since getting my Keurig brewer I have tested 30+ blends (keeping a spreadsheet with a ranking system of all things), and of all the K-cup varieties that I've tried this blend stands out as by far the best.<br /><br />The coffee is bold and strong, but not at all bitter or overpowering, and it stands up up well to cream and sugar.<br /><br />The flavor is woodsy but smooth and mellow, with a slight hint of citrus and a mild nuttiness.  The balance just works right.<br /><br />Every day I brew this K-cup first thing in the morning and although I love to experiment with new blends, this one consistently tops the charts and every other blend is simply a comparison.<br /><br />One more thing, if you are new to k-cups, please do a little research into the fair trade and organic origins of this coffee and that alone should be enough to make one a dedicated fan.
