This black rice is the most incredible tasting rice I have ever eaten.  I just love it.  I now use it instead of brown rice.  It just adds a zing to the taste buds that you'd never expect from rice.  I use it with my black beans so it is used a lot.  If you try this rice you'll probably not go back to traditional brown rice.  It is yummy.
