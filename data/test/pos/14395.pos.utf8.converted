I am amazed how horrible the marketing is on this wonderful product. Whoever designed the label with no instructions should be moved to another department or just fired.<br /><br />In the islands we use coconut oil on our skin hair etc. and this is used in a similar way with truly wonderful results. It is far more then a scalp moisturizer it is fantastic on your whole body! Here is the best way to use this product.<br /><br />Take it with you in the shower and wash as usual. Before drying off lightly touch this product with your wet finger tips (do not dip into it you, just want to lightly rub the surface) and rub it into your hands, you use very little. Then while you are still very wet rub your hands through your hair from scalp to ends. Also use it the same way on your face and body and then towel dry and comb through your hair. You use very little and it leaves your skin and hair like silk. I am caucation with straight fine hair and it leaves my hair silky and shiny and my skin as soft as ever even works great on dry heels! If your hair or body feel greasy you simply used too much.<br /><br />I love this product as a body and hair moisurizer, it's tragic how poorly this is being marketed with no explination whatsoever on what to do with it! Great product with the worst label ever. use a little and you will love it a lot!
