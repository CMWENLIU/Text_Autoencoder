I have to eat a gluten-free diet.  Most gluten-free "crackers or breads" are high in calories as well as fat, but not these.  I love them, and I particularly enjoy putting gluten-free fat-free refried beans on top.  I will be experimenting with many other toppings, too.  Oh, joy.<br /><br />I lost over 100 pounds on whole-grain, low fat foods.  Since having to go gluten-free, it has been difficult to find crackers, breads, etc. that satisfy as well as fill me, without all the fat and calories.  THESE FIT THE BILL!  Very happy here.
