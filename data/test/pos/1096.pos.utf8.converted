I am a fan of Izze sodas. I don't and never have drank any other sodas.<br /><br />They have natural fruit juice in them and carbonated water, that's it.<br /><br />Considering all the artificial flavors, colors, preservatives and other chemicals, this soda is nearly in a class by themself.<br /><br />I am glad other companies are also switching to more natural ingredients.<br /><br />Especially for children and their health. Children will always love sweet soda and this one is the most harmless one to keep for them. It is the only soda I keep at home.<br /><br />I have tried all the flavors, this one is delicious and not overly sweet.<br /><br />I love this company and their sodas.Highly recommended.
