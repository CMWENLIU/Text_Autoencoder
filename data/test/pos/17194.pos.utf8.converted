you'll eat this bacon and weep because you'll realize what you've been missing all these years ... nueske's bacon tastes as different (and as better) as good tuna sushi does to the canned stuff.<br /><br />butt-expensive, yes, but worth every penny ... the hillcrest farm, where nueske's is made, is so hardcore that they consider the f.d.a. guidelines for bacon too lax, so they abide by their own standards.<br /><br />makes a super-great present for any gourmand, gourmet, epicure, or carb-free diet head.<br /><br />nueske's also makes a pepper bacon, and this one is *much* better.  make sure to follow their cooking instructions to the letter (expect almost no shrinkage) and you will be set.<br /><br />keep an eye on the nueske's web site, they sometimes have sales and discounts.
