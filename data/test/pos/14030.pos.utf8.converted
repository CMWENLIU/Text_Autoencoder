I definitely wouldn't consider this a toy; as it is an energy drink. Very whimsical and perfect for an active gamer! Beautifully displayed on the shelf at present moment. No desire to drink it as other reviews say its pretty gross. Overall, I was very pleased with the size of the product. Not too small and not too big. Very understandable how characters in World of Warcraft carry about 50+ of these little things!! :o)
