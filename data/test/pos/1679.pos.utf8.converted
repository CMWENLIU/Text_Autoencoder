I have used the Native Forest coconut milk for years. I have tried many others and this one is by far the best tasting, plus it is organic. I go through enough of it that I signed up for a recurring delivery of a case. It is going to save me quite a bit over purchasing locally at my grocery store. I read the reviews talking about dented cans but ordered anyway. Some that I buy at the grocery store are dented so I didn't feel it was a big deal either way. I received my case today and not a single can was dented.<br /><br />Regarding the reviewer talking about the expiration date - please disregard. They do not understand the coding system that is used. As explained in my reply to that comment, the date code is a production code and is six letters. Those that I received today were BAAJCH which corresponded to a production date of September 10, 2009. This is only 5 months ago.<br /><br />Also the same reviewer talking about solids in the can may not realize that when coconut milk is colder (below 76 degrees), the oil will solidify. If you want it all liquid and smooth put the can in a pan of warm water for a while.<br /><br />This is an excellent product, even better with Amazon's special pricing and free shipping for recurring orders. This is also backed by Amazon's excellent customer service noted by the unhappy customer.
