My sister loved Fizzies as a child so when I found them online I just had to send her a box of the assorted tablets. When they arrived she was amazed they were still available. She said they are just as she remembered and they brought back lots of memories. She shared them with her office staff and they all took a trip down "Memory Lane" at their "Fizzies Party."
