Light Muscovado is a caramel light brown sugar with the flavors of earth and sky somehow infused into dreamy sweet perfection. All other light brown sugars can't compare to this quality and if you want the best light brown sugar for baking, I can't imagine anything could be more delicious.<br /><br />Light Muscovado is slightly moist, has a medium molasses content and is delicious in gingerbread, coffee cake, cookies and chocolate cake. It is delicious with a Farina porridge in the morning or can be stirred into tea.<br /><br />I first found this sugar while working at Larry's Market in Seattle. The India Tree company is also located in Seattle and has some amazing sugar products for baking and decorating.<br /><br />Also recommended: Dark Muscovado is also deeply delicious and once you use the Muscovado sugars, there is no escape. You will crave the rich flavors and high molasses content of this delicious sugar from Mauritius.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
