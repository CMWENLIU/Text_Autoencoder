I ordered this retro-candy box for my husband's 40th birthday.  The candies really were retro.  I was worried I'd get two or three pieces of candy that really were "a blast from the past" and then get a bunch of today's candy as filler.  The item arrived quickly and it was as exactly as described. Would highly recommend.
