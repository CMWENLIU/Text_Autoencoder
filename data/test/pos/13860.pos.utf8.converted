Love Love Love this product, a favourite of mine since childhood.  Great light dessert hot or cold. I've never tasted rice pudding in America that comes close to Ambrosia, it's fantastic, it's not heavy, even though it's cream, milk and rice, not overtly sweet.  You can add many things to it; fruit, nuts, or stir in's.  If you have a sick one, this is light enough to give them and know they have had some good nourishment.  Treat yourself, if you've never tried it.  You might very well enjoy it.  It's a heavy product so the cost for shipping makes it cost prohibitive to order from most places.  With the auto shipment option it costs even less and you can edit when you wish to receive it.
