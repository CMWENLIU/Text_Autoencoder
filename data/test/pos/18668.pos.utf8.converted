My husband likes his coffee extremely strong, so much so that I brew the 5 oz cups and double up on the kcups in a large mug. Basically, he likes sludge, lol.<br /><br />He had been drinking Timothy's French Roast, but the price has gone up again and I really despise the packaging. Really...they're kcups, not bone china, why the need for 2 packages, carboard, plastic and another box?<br /><br />I like the fact that these kcups come in a single box, not as much waste.<br /><br />Anyway, my picky husband said that this coffee was surprisingly good. I'm happy without the extra packaging and the lower price tag.<br /><br />Now they just need to put this on Subscribe and Save.
