Since I've started buying groceries at amazon I have discovered "taste great" is a pretty subjective thing.  That's obvious since everyone has different tastes, but even so I wonder about some of the great reviews on some things.  So I bought this because it was on sale with the 20 dollars off deal and didn't actually expect to enjoy the milk.  I bought the regular milk and this chocolate.  Well, I'm pleasantly surprised to say it actually does taste great.  The milk does have a very very slight different taste from milk you would get in your supermarket, but in no way does that take away from the milk.  I drunk it when it was over room temp and then when it was cool.  It tasted better cold, but it wasn't bad warmer either.  So I guess Horizon can consider me a convert to their milk and I will certainly buy again before the sale is off.
