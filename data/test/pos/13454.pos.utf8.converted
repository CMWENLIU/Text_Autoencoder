I have tried many espresso brands and grounds but none beat this one.  Kimbo Gold is genuine espresso from Napels, famed for its incomparable coffee, and uses only the best Brazillian coffee beans.  Its taste can be best described as potent with a real kick, but without any bitterness, and with a deep yet clear espresso flavour.  I prefer it to some of the better known premium brands, such as the otherwise excellent Illy caffe. Its flavour is much richer and isn't even lost in a capuccino or latte - the milk if anything seems to bring out the flavour even more.  I highly recommend this espresso to anyone who is looking for the real thing.
