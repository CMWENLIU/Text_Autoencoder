The cats seem really happy with this. Three different varieties all in one box. Two of the cans were slightly dented, but it could have been the shipping company. Not enough that I'd worry, though. The cans opened just fine. Not so heavily scented that you gag when you open a can, and pretty thickly covered in gravy that the felines are quite content. Will definitely buy this again and again.
