About 18 years ago when on vacation, I found this marvelous halvah bar that did not have any refined sugar in it.  It was made with honey, but the flavor and texture was marvelous.  Unfortunately, I have looked for the company and could never find their products in the US.<br /><br />FINALLY it is here!  My mom bought some of these and gave us a bunch and it was divine to taste them once again.  A different texture than the Joyva halvah, it is still superior and we love it.  It still has no refined sugar (and one of the rare products with NO SUGAR CANE IN ANY FORM) and we hope Amazon carries them for a long time to come.  We can not use sugar cane in any form and have been very upset with the so called natural foods people who have caved to the pressure of $ and started using sugar cane in their products.  HOORAY FOR CAMEL!  They still use decent ingredients in their products.
