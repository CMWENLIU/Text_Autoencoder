After reading all the reviews I decided I'd try this brand and another (Ancient Harvest).  I like pasta salad--and my husband loves it.  The biggest plus is the TASTE, very mild and yummy.  The biggest minus is it can be tricky getting it done just right, a minute to long and the pasta will fall apart on your plate.  So I'm learning as I go; I think slightly under-cooking it is preferable in all dishes.
