We were getting desperate! During the 30 years since we left England to live in the States, we have been unable to purchase Aromat here, and have resorted to having friends bring suitcases full of it to us when coming to visit. Now that it is available online through Amazon, we are delighted. We use it in every single meal we cook - wonderful on BBQd steaks, in casseroles, all kinds of sauces, but our favorite is tomato salad - thick-sliced tomatoes, drizzled with a mix of garlic oil, (lots of crushed garlic with black pepper and aromat) and topped with grated Romano cheese. Delish!
