I've been waiting for ages for this product to show up on Amazon so that I can review it.  I've been enjoying Mrs. Renfro's Mango Habanero salsa for quite a while, enjoying its fantastic heat/sweet ratio, and just wishing it was chunkier and a bit hotter.  Then along comes this stuff.  They must have been listening!<br /><br />I'm pretty sure this is the hottest salsa Mrs. Renfro's offers, and I think it's the perfect level for those of us who really enjoy some heat with our salsa but don't have a hot foods shoppe nearby.  I'll take this opportunity to kvetch that I have seen some reviews out there--video reviews--of people opening a jar of this stuff, dipping the corner of a chip in it, eating the whole chip, and going, 'Oh, it's not that hot.'<br /><br />Yeah, duh.  It's not hot sauce, people.  It's SALSA.  It's meant to be enjoyed in moderate SCOOPS, not in tiny little dollops like Blair's Sudden Death (excellent, btw).  SCOOP the stuff onto a chip the way you're meant to, and have yourself about five chips in this manner.  Now stop.  ...  Yeah, I *thought* you'd be reaching for the tissues.  Welcome to chips and salsa.  That's how you eat them.<br /><br />Onward: This salsa has a great texture--it could be chunkier, it's true (all the Mrs. Renfro's salsas have this issue), but it's chunkier than many of their others, and it's still thick enough to stick to the chip.<br /><br />The flavour is almost a head-scratcher.  When you get that first bite, right before the heat smacks you across the face, there's this moment of, 'Ooh.  Hey.  What's that?'  Some have called it curry-like, others chili-like (not as in pepper, but as in a pot of chili).  I realize this makes me a bad reviewer, but I'm honestly not sure *what* it is.  I think it's part garlic, part roasted tomatoes, and part... part... oh, I don't know.  Liquid deliciousness?  Yeah, that sounds right.<br /><br />Upon first bite, this salsa became my current favourite.  (I'd spell out the happy moan I let loose when I first tried it, but this is a family site.)  In the course of a month, I have finished four jars of it.  That is not an exaggeration.  I have been driven to unexpectedly have chips and salsa for dinner more times than a person should (should they ever?) for the love of this salsa.<br /><br />My local grocery put it on sale.  Oh, bad move, people.  I cleared them out.  Thank the chili gods that they restocked.<br /><br />I have tried a lot of salsa in my life.  Most of the really good spicy stuff is only available in chilihead specialty shoppes or online with massive shipping charges (but hey, the stuff is heavy).  To my knowledge, this is the hottest salsa (I repeat: NOT HOT SAUCE) that you can find in a regular grocery store.<br /><br />I've already recommended it to all my friends who enjoy hot foods or have people in their family who do so.  Now I recommend it to you.  Enjoy it!  I know I do.
