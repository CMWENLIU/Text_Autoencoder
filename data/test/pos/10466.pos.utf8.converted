A little more expensive than I usually buy, but this was on Manager's Special at Amazon, so I had to try it.  Outstanding coffee.  Each packet makes an 8-10 cup pot, depending on how strong you like it -- I used 9 cups, making a stong, but not overwhelming brew.  The variety ranges from Kenya AA to Hawaiian to Louisiana Blend, etc.  If you appreciate good coffee you won't regret buying this.
