These noodles are great! I use them for everything, including with spaghetti sauce. If you are trying to lose/maintain weight and are missing your pasta, this is for you. They are best with other toppings, sauces, stir frys, etc. because they take on the flavor of what you are cooking with. I sauteed spinach with 1/4 tsp of olive oil and garlic and the juices from the spinach mixed with the noodles - it was delicious. I am going to use them instead of egg noodles when I make beef stroganoff later this week. I agree with the review that these are probably best in Asian recipes but they can be used anywhere you would normally use a noodle or rice. These are ZERO weight watchers points. My plate of spaghetti tonight was 4 points instead of 14 points. How can you NOT have this as part of your diet? And I agree with the other reviewer - the fishy smell goes away once you rinse and flash fry. I buy this stuff by the case.
