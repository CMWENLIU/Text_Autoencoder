Since Amazon started carrying Nature's Path oatmeal I have eaten almost nothing but for breakfast. The price is better than I can get at the big warehouse store down the street. I am just logging in now to make another purchase.<br /><br />The oats are bigger and thicker than Quaker and other brands that I've tried giving it a better texture and flavor, but not dry.<br /><br />I recommend trying the variety pack (Amazon didn't carry this one until recently) first to figure out what you like before you buy six boxes of a single flavor. My favorite is the Multigrain Raisin and Spice.
