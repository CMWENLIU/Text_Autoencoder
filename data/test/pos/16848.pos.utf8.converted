These small packages of cooked quinoa are convenient for single servings.  It's easy to throw the quinoa into a pan after becoming to cook some combination of sauce/meat/veg.  I would also recommend adding some water to the quinoa if you're heating it up plain or else it will be really dry (similar to if you heat up cooked rice).
