I own a travel trailer and we travel most of the summer. These filteer packs are fast and easy clean up. clean up is important when you are limited for space in a camper. I got so spoiled having a great cup of a coffee in less than no time that we began using these filter packs at home as well. They are way over priced when compared to the grocery store price but they sell out very fast so you can't always get them.
