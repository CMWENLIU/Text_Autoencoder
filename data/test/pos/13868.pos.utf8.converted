These Peppadew peppers are the best, excellent on any type of sandwich or stuff with some cream cheese or we also spread some cream cheese on a Triscuit cracker "Cracked Pepper & Olive Oil"  that lay a peppade3w pepper on it, Delicious you'll love them. The Mild is sweet with a nice mild spicy taste. For those the like things a little hotter try the Hot sweet ones. These are the best pepper I've ever tasted.
