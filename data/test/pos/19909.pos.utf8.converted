yes, it's full of salt, msg and other lovely stuff, but it can't be any worse than what you eat at many typical restaurants. i can handle a LOT of spice. seriously. in fact, sometimes i add a squirt of sriracha sauce on each bite when feeling indulgent. but this noodle would be spicy for some - if you can't handle the heat, get the sapporo ichiban's ramen. (or add less soup base, but more on that later.)<br /><br />if you don't count the high-priced specialty brand that i can't remember the name of (eh, it wasn't that good), this product also seems to have the distinction of being the only vegetarian instant ramen, thanks to the more accurate labeling of international food products. in case you're a vegetarian searching for the ingredients, here it is as printed on the package, complete with spelling errors:<br /><br />noodles: wheat flour, modified starch, palm oil, salt, gluten.<br />soup base: salt, monosodium l-glutmate, sugar, capsicum, ginger powder, red pepper, bean protein.<br />dried vegetables: green onion, mushroom, carrot, red pepper cabbage.<br /><br />since one package contains almost 100% recommended intake of sodium for a petite person, this is what i do. besides adding my own fresh veggies, i pour the water out directly from the pot after cooking (thus leaving some in there), then i only add the half of the soup base. i have no desire to drink the liquid part, and i think some of the palm oil also gets release from the noodles. i skip the dried vegetable packet since they just look gross.<br /><br />you could probably find this at a better price at your local korean grocery market if you have one nearby, but you can't beat the convenience of amazon. for about $1 each subscribe-and-save, it's worth it for me.
