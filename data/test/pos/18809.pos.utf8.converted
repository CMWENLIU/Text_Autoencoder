If you are a fan of all-things-gummi (and you know who you are), the added marshmallow side of these mini-frogs make an irresistable combination of confectionary perfection. You'll eat them until you are ill, and still consume a couple more. These things should be on some diabetic organization watch-list.<br /><br />Another reviewer spoke of the economy of ordering the 5 lb. bag, but if you are like me and could possibly eat the 5 lb. bag in one setting (an exaggeration, but slight), the single-serving (haha) bags are a good portion check-and-balance, plus they stay fresher. I can't believe I am so under the mind control of these gummi frogs that I have taken the time to review them. Maybe I should be warning you instead of giving a 5-star rating.
