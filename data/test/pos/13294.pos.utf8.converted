Definitely the best gluten free cookies I've ever had.  I do eat gluten (my mother doesn't) and these are honestly as good as any store-bought cookies, gluten or no gluten.  1.25 oz isn't a huge amount (I usually eat two bags).  So far I've had the choc. chip, oatmeal and cinnamon and they're all great.  I have yet to try the sugar, but I have no doubts that they're good.
