I have two, 10lb, russel terrier pups that absolutely love these bite size treats. Training them using these treats as positive rewards has simplified my life. The chicken chips are crunchy and small enough to  give throughout the day, for good behavior. I never get the feeling that they won't eat their food because they filled up on these delicious treats.
