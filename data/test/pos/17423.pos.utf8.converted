I recently read about how awesome chia seeds are for your health. I also read that Salba is the variety to consume because they are standardized and are the variety of chia that has been so thoroughly tested.<br />We got these chia seeds not too long ago and we love them. They are smaller than sesame seeds and very mild in flavor. They are slightly nutty and quite easy to incorporate into foods. I've sprinkled them in the topping of a berry crumble, on top of my bagel and cream cheese, and in most of the dinners I've made they've ended up sprinkled on that too.<br />I won't make any bold health statements as I haven't had them in our diet for that long, but if you look into the research, you'll see why I immediately wanted to try them.<br />Psst: these seeds will grow (amazingly quickly) when planted as well! So they taste good and they're great for you. Sounds like a good recipe!
