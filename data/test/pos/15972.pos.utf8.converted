Don't the name throw you.  "Eat. Think. Smile" isn't the easiest brand to remember, but their baked nutrition bars are certainly memorable in terms of taste.  I tried two varieties through the Amazon Vine Program, Oatmeal Raisin and Orange Cranberry, and I loved them both.  The bars are soft, chewy, sweet without being sugary, and decently sized (a little bigger than a Clif Bar, perfect for a between meal snack or a before-exercise pick-me-up).  Best of all, they were satisfying without being too filling.  I was a little doubtful about how the addition of cocoa would affect the flavors, but as it turned out, the cocoa was only detectable as a pleasant undertone and didn't overpower the Oatmeal Raisin or Orange Cranberry.<br /><br />When deciding whether or not to recommend a food item I have sampled for free, I always ask myself, "Would I actually pay for this product?"  In the case of "Eat. Think. Smile" nutrition bars, my answer was a resounding "Yes.  I prefer these to some of the other bars I buy at the store."  Therefore, I am pleased to be able to recommend them to you.  Eat.  Think.  Smile.  And enjoy.
