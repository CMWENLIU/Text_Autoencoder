I have gotten these Rice Krispie Treats before - same size package - at that local warehouse store that starts with a "C" and ends with an "o."<br /><br />I decided to order from Amazon and have delivered right to the door (I love the convenience since my husband has grocery radar and is never to be found when groceries need to be carried into the house). Oh, plus I like getting packages.<br /><br />These are pretty tasty, almost as good as homemade. Which brings us to the problem. Yes, these are only 90 calories but that doesn't really matter when you eat three of them at once.  There's a reason I try not to keep sweets in the house. I love them and my husband is even worse.<br /><br />So, if you have good self-control, these are a nice snack. 90 calories each with 20 of those coming from fat.
