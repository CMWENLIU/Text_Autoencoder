I like to tinker in the kitchen and make my own chutney but when winter comes I fill my pantry with Patak's. Compared with other chutney brands, I find Patak's offers a bolder taste that is both spicy and salty.<br /><br />We buy Sweet Mango Chutney for the entire family because Patak's rates this blend at two chilies on a five-chili scale. Our sons, ages 7 and 5, have no trouble enjoying the chutney. I like hotter chutney as well but don't want to use up the refrigerator space by storing multiple jars.<br /><br />Chutneys - derived from the Hindu word chatni - have many variations and can range from sweet, sour, hot or mild. Chutney consists of fruits, vegetables or a combination of both that is reduced to a pulp that is roasted or simmered and flavored with spices, sugar and vinegar.<br /><br />Patak's Sweet Mango Chutney blends juicy mangoes with authentic spices and is served as a condiment to a curry but is also delicious on sandwiches (especially turkey, so keep it handy after Thanksgiving!) and hot salads.<br /><br />Aida Mollenkamp at Chow offers this recipe for Cheddar and Chutney Tea Sandwiches.<br /><br />TIME/SERVINGS<br />Total: 35 mins<br />Active: 5 mins<br />Makes: 8 tea sandwiches<br /><br />The question is not whether cheese and chutney go well together, but rather which cheese to choose. As a nod to the British, we've opted for an aged sharp cheddar to star in this sandwich, but snacking in the test kitchen revealed that fresh goat cheese is a close runner-up.<br /><br />Game plan: Let the sandwiches rest at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving, so the chutney has time to soak into the bread.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />8 tablespoons mango chutney<br />16 slices (2-1/2-by-2-1/2-inch) dark pumpernickel cocktail bread<br />4 ounces aged sharp cheddar, thinly sliced<br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS<br />Spread a thin layer of chutney on one side of each bread slice. (You will use 1 tablespoon per sandwich or 1 1/2 teaspoons [1/2 tablespoon] per slice of bread.)<br /><br />Top 8 slices with a layer of cheese (about 1/2 ounce per slice) and close sandwiches with remaining 8 slices of bread. Let sit about 30 minutes before serving to allow flavors to meld. Serve sandwiches whole, or if you like, slice each sandwich in half on the diagonal.<br /><br />Here's another delicious chutney recipe I found online:<br /><br />Chutney-Glazed Cheese Pate<br /><br />6 oz. cream cheese, softened<br />4 oz. sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded<br />3 tablespoons dry Sherry<br />3/4 teaspoon curry powder<br />1/4 teaspoon salt<br />2 green onions, finely sliced (optional)<br />Mango chutney<br /><br />Process the first five ingredients using a food processor until well blended.
