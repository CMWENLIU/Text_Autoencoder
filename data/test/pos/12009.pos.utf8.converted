I got this for my elderly cat with chronic renal failure (and diabetes). It has low phosphorus and sodium levels which is good for CRF cats. She's 16 and ill but still has her outstanding appetite, and she gobbled this up like it was ambrosia. I always add extra water to her food and make it soupy to increase her fluid intake, and this food is well blended and adding water is easy. It's a high-quality pet food and evidently highly palatable. It's far better smelling and looking (obviously I didn't taste it) than other CRF-friendly foods. If your cat has that condition and refuses prescription food or is finicky, give this a try.
