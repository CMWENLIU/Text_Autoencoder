These are great for people who want to enjoy the taste and benefits of sunflower seeds without adding extra salt to your diet. I am very careful about my sodium (salt) intake. These are unsalted, as well as hulled. I use them for cooking, but you could eat them right out of the bag. I have only found pieces of shell on about 4 occasions. I suggest you take a quick look at them in the pan before adding additional ingredients to check for the occasional shell that may sneak through. I add about 30 seeds to a meal, and the one pound bag lasts about 3 weeks. I have always recieved fresh, good seeds. I am a repeat buyer of this product.
