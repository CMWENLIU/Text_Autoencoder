Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those "pockets" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I've read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn't find this review helpful.  I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I'm just sayin...
