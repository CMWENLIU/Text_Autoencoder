I had been ordering another instant espresso coffee, but when I went to make and new order I found the price had almost tripled!  Wow! What a shock!  A little research and I found that there was a recent new owner of the company and, apparently, they were looking for a quick profit on their investment.  I also found out that this price increase was the cause of my local grocers no longer carrying that "gold" Italian labeled product.  My usual routine is to fresh grind my coffee beans and use a french press to brew my morning coffee.  I enjoy a full bodied strength more like a European than American weaker flavored coffee.  Ferrara was a good choice for my individual taste.  I own an espresso machine and make my own brew on occasions and, of course, that is the best.  But for an alternative, for me Ferrara has been an excellent price pleaser and a satisfying taste.
