This year I took a chance on this chocolate. I normally use a block<br />of chocolate but the callets are so much easier to work with and<br />melt even more easily. The one kilogram bag is enough to make<br />one recipe of truffles. You will have some left over for chocolate<br />chip cookies.<br /><br />Ingredients: unsweetened chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, natural<br />vanilla flavor. May contain traces of milk protein.<br /><br />Here is the recipe I made up for chocolates during<br />the holiday season. The addition of cinnamon is really delicious.<br /><br />Fresh Cream Truffles with Cinnamon<br /><br />A double boiler is not recommended for melting the chocolate. Use your crockery cooker for the best results. The creamy ganache (ga-nosh) is dipped in melted chocolate and should be stored in the refrigerator. Bring the truffles to room temperature an hour before serving.<br /><br />Ganache<br /><br />6 ounces Callebaut semisweet chocolate callets<br />3/4 cup whipping cream<br />1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature<br />1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />1 teaspoon Saigon cinnamon<br /><br />Dipping Chocolate<br /><br />1 pound Callebaut semisweet chocolate callets<br />Parchment paper<br /><br />2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar<br />1 teaspoon cinnamon<br /><br />1.  Place the 6 ounces chocolate in a medium sized bowl.<br /><br />2.  Heat the cream just until it comes to a boil. Pour over<br />  chocolate. Stir until the chocolate melts. Cool to 90 degrees.<br /><br />3.  Cream all the butter in a deep bowl with a wooden<br />  spoon. Stir  in tablespoonfuls of cooled chocolate,<br />  beating well after each addition. Mixture should be<br />  creamy. If the butter starts to melt, the chocolate is<br />  still too warm. Lastly, stir in the vanilla and cinnamon.<br /><br />4.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br />  Fit a piping bag with a size 807 decorating tip. Pipe a<br />  round the size of a quarter onto parchment paper,<br />  start piping second level then lift. Place in the freezer<br />  to chill for 20 minutes.<br /><br />5.  Place the one pound dipping chocolate in a 6-quart crockery<br />  cooker, heat on low. Stir a few times until all chocolate<br />  has melted. Turn cooker off when chocolate<br />  has melted. The temperature should not go above<br />  120 degrees. Pour chocolate into a medium bowl.<br /><br />8.  Mix the confectioners' sugar and cinnamon together.<br />  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br />  Use a truffle fork to dip chocolates. When all<br />  chocolates have been dipped use a sifter to sprinkle<br />  cinnamon confectioners' sugar over truffles.<br /><br />9.  Place truffles in the freezer for 20 minutes to set<br />  chocolate. Then, keep them in the refrigerator until<br />  about an hour before serving.<br /><br />Happy Holidays!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
