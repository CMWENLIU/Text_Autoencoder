I am actually embarassed to tell you how much I love these organic, sun-dried, unsulfured figs ~ they are too good!  My true confession ~ I can eat the entire 7-ounce bag of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0HY">Made In Nature Organic Calimyrna Figs, Sun-Dried and Unsulfured, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>... in one sitting!  I crave these sweet, moist figs and have absolutely no self control once the package is opened.  And the package says there are 5 servings to the bag...yikes!  Thank goodness I can purchase them at Amazon for a much better price than at my local health food store.  They are such a good value at Amazon, I buy them frequently.
