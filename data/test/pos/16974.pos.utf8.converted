If your looking for a sugary, sweet, mix with water powder, this is NOT it! This is a bit grainy and green. Why do I love it you ask? It has all the essential amino acids, it has no animal products, it's 100% Raw, loaded with protein and fiber and it's organic. What's not to love? I use it in my green smoothies and it works perfectly!
