I originally purchased this product in a specialty store in Alexandria Virginia while on vacation. I could not locate a retailer in my area who handled this product, so I went on line at Amazon.com and found it. I like unsalted licorice and this product is great. Small pellets that are big on flavor. Much better that most types available in stores and less expensive too.
