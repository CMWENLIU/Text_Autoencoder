PROS: Doesn't eat much. Unlike living rabbits, it doesn't poop in your magician's hat.<br /><br />CONS: NOT an appropriate prop when performing a show for a germophobe support group. I don't think I'm welcome at that Y anymore.<br /><br />It's been a big hit at children's parties too. Y'know how when kids get really excited they jump around and start screaming? By that logic, this little rabbit is the Justin Beiber of the mail-order-flesh world. Parents reading this- you can save a ton of money buying a FreshWholeRabbit instead of concert tickets:<br /><br />"MERRY CHRISTMAS, Timmy! What did Santa leave you under the tree?"
