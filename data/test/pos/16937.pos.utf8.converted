These cherries have good flavor, and are a great value compared to the fancy jars they usually sell them in (if you can find them at all). Just put them in your own glass jars and you can share with friends. And because of the high sugar content of the syrup they will keep well, especially in the fridge.<br /><br />UPDATE May 2012: I ate the last of the (refrigerated) 2009 cherries about a week ago with no ill effects. They were still delicious. And I just packed the new batch in six 12 oz. jelly jars, with a little syrup left over to drizzle on ice cream in the next few days!
