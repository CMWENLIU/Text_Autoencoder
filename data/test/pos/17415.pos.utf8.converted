I'm not able to buy Lapsang Souchong locally, and was pleased to find it on Amazon.  The price is good, and the quality of the Taylors of Harrogate is excellent.  It's stronger than the Twinings brand I've had before.<br /><br />Lapsang Souchang has a smoky taste; it's not a sweet tea at all.  It's interesting and different from other teas, but don't buy a big quantity until you've tried it for yourself.
