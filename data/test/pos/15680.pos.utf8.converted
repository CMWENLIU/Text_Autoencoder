These green olives (with seeds) are on the small side (bigger than picholines, but not by much) -- seldom much over 1/2 inch long. They're very nicely spiced with garlic, hot chilis, fennel, and bay leaves. Like most green olives, rather salty. Quite a good value at less than $5 per pound. Very authentically Italian (imported from Calabria -- toe of the boot), they're perfect for an antipasto salad. I would prefer that there were five bags of one pound each, but since they keep quite well, dealing with a five pound bag is not that much trouble. You'll want to pour off the liquid after opening, and transfer them to a rigid plastic container or ziplocks. Good deal for olive lovers!
