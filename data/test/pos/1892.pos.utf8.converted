I won't go into detail on how amazing this cereal is, because I feel the above comments say enough.<br /><br />What I will enlighten the lovers of this cereal about is its current availability. I wrote to General Mills Corp about this cereal, and this is what a representative from their Consumer Services department came back with:<br /><br />Thank you for contacting General Mills. Your comments are important to us.<br /><br />We are committed to making a difference in the lives of our consumers. Feedback such as yours is important to the nature of our business.<br /><br />The Count Chocula cereal is a seasonal product, available in the Fall. Please watch the store shelves this Fall for the product to return. The product has a long shelf life. If you would like to stock up in the Fall, check the dates on the packages to see how long you will have to use the product for an extra special treat throughout the year.<br /><br />We appreciate your loyalty and the time you took to contact us. Please be assured that we will share your thoughts with the appropriate individuals.<br /><br />In summary: If you're looking for this cereal to resurface, keep your eyes on store shelves once the weather cools down and the leaves start to change colors.
