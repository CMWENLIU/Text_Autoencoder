I have owned 3 of these with 4 different large (up to 16 lbs) cats and a variety of litter types.  I would like to echo Esther G.'s review - this box is amazing if used "correctly"!!<br /><br />I'll try and explain another way for the sake of repetition.<br /><br />This system comes with 2 bottoms: at any time one bottom contains the litter (let's call this the "active box") and the other is empty (the "standby box").  The boxes fit inside of eachother so the standby is stored below the active box.  In fact, the lid won't seal properly unless the boxes and sifter are all stacked together in a nice package.<br /><br />There are two major ways to use the system - the NASTY WAY and the AWESOME WAY:<br /><br />********<br />NASTY WAY (most people do this):<br />Most everyone leaves the sifter inside the active box so that the litter itself is sitting inside the sifter.  The sifter, in turn, sits inside the active box.  From top to bottom we have:<br /><br />SIFTER (contains litter)<br />ACTIVE<br />STANDBY<br /><br />When it's time to change the litter, people simply pull the sifter out and dump the contents into the trash.  The sifter then goes into the standby box and the (cleaned) litter is dumped from one box to the other.  What was previously the active box is now the standby box and everything gets re-stacked like before.<br /><br />This is the most obvious way and I think the product literature even suggests this.  However, there is a small gap between the sifter and active box which leaves room for liquid to gather below (and around) the sifter.  Clumping litter will clump *around* the holes in the sifter and create clogs.  This also allows for some small clumps to gather on the inside walls of the box - these get smeared over time.  After a week or two, you're left with a messy, stinky box and a sifter that needs lots of attention.<br />********<br /><br />********<br />AWESOME WAY (everyone should do this):<br /><br />You can eliminate the clumping inside the sifter if you don't leave the sifter sitting in the litter!!<br /><br />You can order the boxes like this:<br /><br />ACTIVE (contains litter)<br />SIFTER<br />STANDBY<br /><br />When it's time to clean, you simply pull the active box out and pour its contents (including clumped waste) into the sifter (which is sitting inside the standby box).  Next, you pull the sifter out like you would have done for the NASTY WAY.  The sifter now contains all the waste but, since it hasn't been sitting in the waste, doesn't have any clumps or clogs!!  Throw away the waste, put the sifter into the empty box, and stack everything up.  Voila!  You're done.<br />********<br /><br />I have 2 cats sharing 1 of these boxes.  I can completely clean the box in less than 1 minute using this method.  This allows me to clean the box every day without trouble.  I change out the litter once every few weeks, rub down the insides every few months and do a deep clean maybe twice a year.<br /><br />That's seriously low maintenance and I have the cleanest box of anyone I know!! That includes those with fancy auto-cleaning systems!
