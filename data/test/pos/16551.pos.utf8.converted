Erythritol is not nearly as popular as it should be, which is a shame. It tastes just like sugar with some differences.<br />-It sometimes has a cooling effect, like winter-green candies, but it can be countered with mixing it 1:1 with splenda.<br />-It does not have a nasty after-taste, but it is only about 75% as sweet as sugar, so splenda comes in handy for mixing here also. This mixture does double duty since erythritol counteracts the splenda after-taste. -Erythritol is heat stable so you can bake and cook with it.<br />-It does not get syrupy or sticky like sugar.<br />-It does not really caramelize like sugar.<br />-Some cookies still have that cooling effect even with the splenda mixture.<br />-It is possible to make powdered sugar by throwing it in the blender and blending for a bit.<br />-It does not dissolve as easily as sugar in cold drinks.<br /><br />Some good things to note.<br />-Does not give stomach problems like other alcohol sugars.<br />-It does not cause tooth decay.<br />-The calorie count is .2 per gram, so it is virtually calorie free and truly low carb.<br />-It does not raise blood sugar.<br />-It is not known for stalling weight loss on low carb. programs.<br /><br />BTW, Emerald forest is where I buy from. They have the best price and very reasonable shipping. I get 10 lbs. at a time. I love the stuff.
