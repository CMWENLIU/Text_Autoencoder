We've used this product for years, and have loved it's flavor & consistency - always something you can count on!  We used to add the same spices using various recipes, but chili would always seem to come out differently each time.  No 'hit or miss' with this product - individual packets of each spice give you maximum control, should you want to add less.  We love this stuff so much, that we panic when we 'run low' at home (less than 3 kits), in case we can't find the Mix at our local grocery store!  So, we bought a case!
