Who knew that mayonnaise could be so very, very yummy!  I don't know how they do it, but they make it so very good! Now I understand why in Japan it is popular to put mayonnaise on everything - including pizza.<br />I love to put some of this mayo in a bowl, add some shoyu (soy sauce) and use it for a veggie dip. Everyone loves it and it is a great way to get folks to eat more veggies. Try it with small chunks of raw green cabbage!!!!
