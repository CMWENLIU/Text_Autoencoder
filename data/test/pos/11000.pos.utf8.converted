What a wonderful mother's day present!  This tree arrived in excellent condition.  It looks just like the picture.  The tree was very well packaged, and the soil was still damp from the last watering.  The instruction pamphlet that came with the tree was not especially thorough, giving only the bare necessities, so I ended getting several books and videos from the library to teach me all the extra details and essentials.  I recommend buying at least one book of instructions, and I have found that the "Complete Guide to Bonsai" by Harry Tomlinson is the best out there.  The plant is doing wonderfully though, thriving in my window, and it even has new growth on it!  I smile every time I look at it.  For someone who was afraid she would kill the plant like I have done with several others, this one is doing great!  I am so encouraged I want to go out and get several more bonsai, and may even grow my own!  Great tree for a beginner.  Good luck!<br /><br />Update:  Four months later and the tree is flourishing!  There has been so much new growth that I have started my own jade forest from the pruned leaves!  I even gave a cutting to my friend and she is having great success as well.  This has been the most wonderful little tree, and has gotten me so interested in bonsai that I now have several other kinds of trees as well.  As long as you keep it watered and occasionally fertilize the tree, you will have a happy, healthy, beautiful little plant on your hands!  I still definitely recommend this tree, especially to beginners.  Happy planting!
