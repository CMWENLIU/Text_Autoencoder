Great stuff - interesting texture that starts out a bit more dense than petroleum jelly and then with not much heat, turns quickly to oil (that is, after pulling out a chunk with your finger, you have about 4 seconds to figure out what to do with it).<br /><br />Just be careful to store it below about 75 degrees F, as it will turn to a jar full of oil if you don't.  Cooling it back down should pull it back into its more manageable, firmer state.<br /><br />Smells amazing (if you like coconut)!
