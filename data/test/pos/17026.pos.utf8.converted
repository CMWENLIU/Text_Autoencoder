I ordered the powdered goat's milk to make a rich milk wash from Ginger Garrett's book "Beauty Secrets of the Bible".  I process it in a coffee grinder with oats, and it makes a great wash for my face.  The price I got on this can was phenomenal compared with our local health food, and the shipping price is awesome!  I was very pleased with this product.
