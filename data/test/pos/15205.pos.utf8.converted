High quality yogurt starter that has consistently produced results.  Does not contain pectin.<br /><br />Starter packets contain sucrose, and I found that when I re-used a culture from one batch of yogurt to the next adding a tsp sugar helped create firmer yogurt.<br /><br />Yogurt is very sour and strong in flavor.  Firms to slightly softer than Dannon plain yogurt after 8 hours of culturing.  Yogurt is a perfect match for Mediterranean and Indian dishes, but may require some sugar to mix with fruit effectively.<br /><br />I have successfully made both whole milk and skim milk yogurt with this starter.  Whole milk was considerably firmer and easier to use in cooking.  Consider adding pectin if using skim milk if you intend to eat it out of the cup.
