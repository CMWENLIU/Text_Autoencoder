Organic Coco libre is the highest quality coconut water I ever tried. The quality of this product is evident in the taste and very noticeable rejuvenating properties.<br />This is a valuable asset to have for after workout recovery, keeping a sharp mental edge, and over all healthful thirst quenching beverage. I plan on keeping it stocked.<br />Those artificial, processed "health/recovery drinks" are no were close to Coco libres natural quality.
