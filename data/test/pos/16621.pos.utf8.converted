I finally bought this Quinoa, and it is really good.  It is versatile; depending on how you season it depends on how it turns out.  For example, it can be seasoned with lemon, pepper, garlic, basil, etc.  It can also be seasoned with brown sugar.<br /><br />I am not going to write a long review; the grain itself is versatile enough to make it just about any way you want.  And it's easy to prepare.  And it's healthful (I'll get into that in the next paragraph).<br /><br />From what I'd heard about the grain, it is "old", "strong", "healthy, "wise" (even has built up a coating that is a resistance to insects).  This grain intrigues me; I plan to look up its history.<br /><br />Quinoa (which I recently found out) is what dieticians call a "complete protein".  Other than meat products, there aren't a lot of "complete proteins" that I know of, other than soy.  I do not eat soy.  So I thought I'd give this product a try.
