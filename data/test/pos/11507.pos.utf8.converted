First thing is I did not purchase crab legs from Omaha as the price  is 10 steps beyond gouging. Here in the NY area they can be purchased for $7.99 a pound, no S&H. There are 2 sizes of legs, larger and smaller [usually referred to as A's & B's] with the larger being approximately $2.00 a pound more.<br /><br />Considering that there's more shell weight than meat weight, $25 a pound is completely outrageous.<br /><br />Look elsewhere for your crab legs. I hope Amazon takes note of this review.
