My package looked almost exactly as on the picture. Great quality with no dead moss.<br />Ok, this will require your attention.<br />Before you buy this, as well as any type of green moss, you have to make sure it is either kept near by the water or just being sprinkled 3-4 times a day (at least in NYC). It WILL take some time for the moss to get rooted and used to your soil. Too High/Low PH might kill it. While adapting, the moss will partially get brown, it's ok. If you do not water it properly, it will most likely die. So take a good care of it and you'll be all set. And DO NOT USE ANY FERTILIZER, you will kill it.
