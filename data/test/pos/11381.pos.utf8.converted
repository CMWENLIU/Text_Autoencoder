What's to say about Lindor Truffles?  Yum.  There isn't a bad flavor in the bunch, although I was genuinely surprised to find out Nestle is making Lindt products now.  You do have to make sure the truffles are kept at the right temperature - too cold and the truffle gets stiff, too warm and they get gloppy.  It's a shame they can't make them a little more stable, but hey, it's chocolate, so you can't complain too much.  This is a nice assortment of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, white chocolate, caramel and peanut butter.  The caramel and peanut butter are way too sweet and I suspect a recent addition due to the Nestle connection (not there years ago).  I'd like to see some of the fruit truffles added in the future, but overall, big thumbs up for the big, big bag of chocolate!
