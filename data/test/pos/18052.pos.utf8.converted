We used to have two pomeranians - Autumn and Teddie.  Ever since we lost Teddie last summer, Autumn became very depressed and wouldn't eat.  We tried so many different brands including home-cooked, he would only ate a couple times and wouldn't touch it anymore.  He lost so much weight and got us so worried.  But that all changed when we found Organix and that's the only brand Autumn will eat.  Now he can't wait until I feed him every morning.  The cost Amazon offered is less expenisve than other retailers and you can't beat free shipping!!  Please continue carrying it!!
