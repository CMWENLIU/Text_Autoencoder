The original box caught my attention while I was tea shopping at the always busy Fairway on Broadway. Price wise this was almost double of what all the other teas were but I couldn't resist the temptation of a new tea. It was a good choice in the end and I can't wait to try all the flavors this brand carries.<br /><br />The mesh tea bag crinkles and sloshes like an expensive fabric as this single origin full leaf tea blooms once the water hits it. This tastes and looks like expensive loose tea with long graceful leaves that always remind me of seaweed in cold green sea. The taste is absolutely exquisite due to the single origin or pure Assam tea, meaning that small and delicate blossoms are selected with no fillers and cheap mixes to stretch the quantity of tea the company can package and sell. This tastes lovely on its own or is incredibly creamy and quiet dreamy with a splash of milk and always with sugar. For connoisseurs of plain black tea, this taste will soothe the taste buds and this will be something that they will reach for daily. I can't even recall how many times I pick this tea over coffee in the morning to give me will to live!<br /><br />- Kasia S.
