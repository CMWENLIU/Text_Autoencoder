I always said I hated white "chocolate" until I tried this.  I guess I never really had true white chocolate before.  This stuff is sweet, creamy and delicious!  You have to really want something sweet though.  It doesn't satisfy my craving for chocolate, but when dark chocolate just wont due (because I'm wanting something much sweeter) I like to nibble on both this white chocolate & intense dark chocolate creating a enjoyable snack!  The best of both worlds.<br />My one complaint is the non organic soy lecithin.  They don't say it's GMO free and soy lecithin is available in it's organic form (it didn't used to be) so there is no excuse not to make the switch.  Finding non-organic ingredients in certified organic foods is a big peeve of mine.<br />Aside from that, yum yum all the way.  If you've only had the cheap versions of white chocolate you don't know what your missing!<br /><br />Update:  Green & Black's is now owned by Kraft.  I will no longer be purchasing Green & Black's products.
