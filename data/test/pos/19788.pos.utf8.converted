I recently had to switch to canned foods because one of my cats was diagnosed with diabetes.  This has the right nutrition for kitties, none of that gluten or ridiculous amounts of byproducts and carbs which cats don't need like you find in dry cat food or poor quality canned foods.  Now both my cats look healthier, and their coats are smoother and shiner, and they shed less!<br /><br />There is nowhere you can find it any cheaper than on Amazon. I've checked at Target, Walmart, Petco, Wegmans, etc, and the cheapest so far is 0.50 per can (when it is on sale at Walmart).  By subscribing to regular deliveries on Amazon, I can get it delivered to my doorstep for 0.48 per can.  It really adds up especially if you have multiple cats!  Thanks Amazon.. I would not be able to feed my kitty without you.  &lt;3<br /><br />Update: By the way, in case this helps anyone.. My kitty went into diabetic remission and does not need insulin anymore after 1.5 months of eating FF. ;)
