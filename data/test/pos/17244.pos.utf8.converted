I have tried multiple organic foods for my sensitive cat. She gets dry patches on her skin from scratching excessively at what I call "phantom fleas" as she was flea infested when she went into the shelter I rescued her from. Blue Buffalo Spa Select is the first food that I have found that completely gets rid of the dry sores around her neck. It also leaves her coat softer and shinier than ever before. I would like to believe that the "LifeSource bits" are what is causing her to run around and play in the middle of the night; however, I am not completely certain about that. Nonetheless, Jemima is more active since we have fully switched her food to Blue Buffalo!
