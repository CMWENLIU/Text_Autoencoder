I'm currently working in Afghanistan for a private military contractor. I ordered a box of these bad boys on a whim and they arrived in a blur! What did I do next? I stuck that stuff in the FREEZER dude!!! 24 hour later I was in popsicle heaven bro. Grapes my favorite;) Since this box has 200 assorted flavors I tossed a bunch in a plastic bag and went around my base handing them out! Needless to say a free popsicle on a hot Afghan day will brighten anyones mood:)
