I bought this item to taste them and see how they were made. They are a bit pricey for the amount that you get, so if you like the cookies, I highly recommend requesting at your local grocery to stock them for you. They taste wonderful and are addictive! I've had a hard time not eating the bag! I highly recommend spending the extra money so as to at least try them!
