really delicious, much sweeter in taste (though no added sugar) than Vita Coco and O.N.E., the only other brands of coconut water I've tried to date.  Though the shipping problems and relative cost of the better selling tetrapacks may mean I end up getting those again instead of this.<br /><br />The nutritional label does indicate about 40% less nutrients across the board than the more popular, and cheaper brands though.  The company says the sweeter taste is due to the use of inland coconuts so it's fresh water not salt water, and perhaps that has something to do with it, or it's just a different variety, or maybe the label's wrong.  Regardless, the taste is just really out of this world good.  The cans are industrial strength sturdy and heavy, which is good because Amazon made sure every single one of the twelve was dented upon arrival.  Impressive considering the cardboard box and plastic wrap around the 12-pack itself seemed intact, yet the sides of the cans, all of them, were dented, even the ones surrounded by other cans that were actually fine on the top and the bottom.  A few airpack bags thrown in on one of six sides of the 12 pack, and nothing else, as I've come to expect from Amazon shipped items.  Even if you bought a few things at once to try to get them to use a larger box, it wouldn't matter.  Can't even count on items shipping from same warehouse, so that doesn't work.<br /><br />Amazon really needs to make changes to ensure safe shipping on these, with use of different packing material or additional padding so that they arrive intact.  Since I think it's a new product, I wasn't concerned with them having sat around in damaged cans for long, and the company even has some superdoop expensive nonreactive can liner or so they say, so I just drank em down anyway.  I really can't do the taste justice, it would sound preachy and inadequate if I did.  Highly recommend.  Horrible Amazon shipping care though with a casual disregard for the contents.  It's a shame to order gourmet coconut water that costs twice what decent beer would and have it arrive all dented.
