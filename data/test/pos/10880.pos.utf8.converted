On the Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Gold tea box it reads, "The Best Tea for Your Teapot."  It is.  And furthermore, since 1990 Taylors have planted over two million trees around the world, winning the Queen's coveted Award for Enterprise for Sustainable Development."  But most of all, their tea, blended for three generations for their family Bettys Tea Rooms in Yorkshire, England, does ensure that you can "always be sure of getting the best cup of tea no matter where you live."  It's all on the package, and it's all true.  Be careful to note that Yorkshire Gold and Yokshire are two different blends.
