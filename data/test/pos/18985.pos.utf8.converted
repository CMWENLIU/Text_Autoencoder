ordered this for face moisturizer as my skin is quite sensitive. I was looking for a natural and inexpensive product and this sounded like a good thing to try.  I have been very happy with it.  A small bit on my face after showering feels wonderful.  I am also trying it on fungused toenails as supposedly it has some antibacterial properties.  Too soon to know yet if that works.<br /><br />Also, it smells heavenly.  Love it!
