I love these fruit crisps.  They hit the spot right about 10:30am when breakfast is a distant memory and lunch is at 12:30pm.  I get the sweet taste of strawberry, the delicious icing and the crisp of the cookie.  What's not to love!  [notice this is not a question].  Remember if you are dieting or trying to stay in shape this is a great snack choice.  I'm on Weight Watchers and this is 2 points.  Love it!!!
