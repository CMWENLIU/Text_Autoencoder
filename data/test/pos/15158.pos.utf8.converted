You've just located the most healthy, tasty and useful vegetarian broth manufactured today! As a long time user, I can tell you that Amazon offers the best possible price for this item.  I use it for everything:<br /><br />a flavoring for plain rice, as a broth for stir frying (instead of oil), as a base for complicated stews and soups.  If you find it a bit too salty, just add more water.  It has no mysterious chemical additives. It is perfect for heart patients, diabetics, vegans, and folks who just like a fast soup treat.
