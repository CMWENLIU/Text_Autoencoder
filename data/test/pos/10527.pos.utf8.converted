I ate this rabbit raw while wearing my Three Wolf Moon t-shirt and my roommate's head consequently exploded from the pure awesomeness of it.  My landlord now pays ME to live in his apartments, and Union Electric has hooked alligator clips to my nipples in order to supply most of southeast Missouri with power.  I am all that is man.  Thank you, greasy mail-order bunny meat!
