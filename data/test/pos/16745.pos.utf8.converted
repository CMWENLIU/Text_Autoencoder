I know my green tea, and every single tea that I've had from a bag has been horrible..  So I was really scared to try this, but based on the reviews I gave it a go.  HOLY impressed..  I could swear I'm drinking freshly brewed $100/lb Gyokuro... only slightly more bitter.  Great stuff, and especially for the price!  Hands down the best bagged tea I've ever had!
