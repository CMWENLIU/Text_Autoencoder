This is a great, fast cooking whole grain rice. Lotus Foods sells a variety of these specialty rices. This "pink" rice is tied with Bhutanese Red Rice from Lotus as my favorite. The pink rice is not as nutty or dark and so it might be better for people who do not link the deeper flavor of the red rice. Overall the only negative about this item is the need to purchase 11 pounds at a time.
