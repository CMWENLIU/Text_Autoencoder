I personally like the taste of this product, but I can see that others may not. The taste is unusual, with natural tones.<br /><br />I definitely like the packaging. Standard aluminum cans often start to look pretty bad from rubbing on each other for a long time, but a box of Zico survived a 2-week road trip that included some nasty dirt roads just fine.
