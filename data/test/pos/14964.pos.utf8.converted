My son was 20 months when I started using manuka honey on his eczema. He had it really bad on his feet mostly where his ankle is and where the bend happens. I would apply an ample amount of manuka at bed time and put socks on his feet. I did this for 2 months and I havent had to do it again. Its now been 3 months since I stopped applying it and it has yet to come back! Not only has it not come back but his skin is SO soft in the area where it used to be so rough and dry! This stuff is miraculous! He also had mild eczema on his arms and legs and for that I used Nordic Naturals fish oil products for kids.. It has worked wonders for the rest of his body!
