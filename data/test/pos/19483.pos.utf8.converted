My experiences with these seeds, having bought them on several occasions, have been nothing but good. These seeds got criticized from the other buyer for their smell / oily residue on them, but in my opinion, this is what makes the seeds have that natural flavor and appeal. These seeds do have a very strong odor and spicy-taste to them, which is what  makes them the best I've used with my business. For the true and total experience of poppy seeds, I would definitely recommend this brand / type.
