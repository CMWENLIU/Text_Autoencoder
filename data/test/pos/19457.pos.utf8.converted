Okay so I only just thought to put Vegemite in the amazon search box - and found I could buy it. I have to say, as an Aussie I think it is hilarious to be reviewing Vegemite...:) I mean it is not like they are going to change it - maybe they will add it to a few more things like they have to cheese slices, crackers (aka bikkies etc). But we would revolt!!! Vegemite is vegemite (and we are Happy Little Vegemites) so, I mean sorry to all the Americans who keel over dead at the taste...So I think people can review for entertainment purposes only. I mean my friend thinks it is something they scrape out of beer barrels (he he). I am just glad there is another place to replenish in case of emergencies. Go Aussie Go!!
