I received a package today, intended as a gift for a family member, of<br />one pound of Blue Horse Kona Whole Bean Coffee. I purchased this coffee<br />through Amazon, and added one of their "free gift notes" to the order.<br />When I opened the package, I was greeted with a small orange envelope,<br />filled with what would be the best gift note I've ever seen. In addition<br />to a beautifully artful drawing of my internet handle and a cup of<br />coffee, attached was the note I had included, handwritten. For $30, I<br />received not only a pound of coffee with shipping, but effort and care<br />of which I have very rarely seen. I can't comment on the taste of the<br />coffee, as I've yet to try it (and I'm, gasp, not much of a coffee guy,)<br />but if it's as awesome as the note I had been greeted with, it should be<br />a great gift.<br /><br />Here's to you Blue Horse Kona Coffee Guys
