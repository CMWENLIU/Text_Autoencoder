On their web site, Coffee Bean Direct advertises this as their darkest roast. Previously, on Amazon, I reviewed Coffee Bean Direct's Italian Espresso Roast and find the Super Dark Espresso to be equally good and only slightly different. For my basic observations see the previous review; this review will serve to give the reader my observations made in a side-by-side comparison.<br /><br />I have uploaded an image of the two roasts, the Italian Espresso on the left, the Super Dark Espresso on the right. Both are, clearly, Espresso roasts as evidenced by the surface oil on the beans. Both roasts are slightly unevenly roasted, the Italian Espresso more so than the Super Dark. Not clearly shown in the image is the fact that a small percentage of the beans of the Super Dark roast are starting to break apart, a consequence of exceeding the usual roasting temperatures of the so-called "second crack." So what? It indicates to me that the Super Dark roast beans have been roasted to a point beyond which further roasting would not be possible without destroying the beans (yielding a charcoal-like product). However, as noted, the added roasting has produced a more even dark roast which, in turn, has produced a coffee that is slightly more rich than the Italian Espresso roast. Here I would emphasize the word "slightly"; apart from a side-by-side sampling, I doubt I could distinguish one from the other on a day-to-day basis.<br /><br />In a word, both roasts are superb and nicely priced. If I recall correctly, the Super Dark roast cost $3.00 more than the Italian Espresso roast, I should think a reasonable difference if one's palate is able to differentiate between the two roasts.<br /><br />In either case, I think anyone who enjoys dark roast coffees or Espresso will be happy with either of these blends.
