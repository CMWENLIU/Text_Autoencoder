Statins caused me muscle pain, joint cramping and headaches.  My cholesterol was 244 and my doctor said I needed to get it down.  I started exercising every day (with the Shapely Girl DVD's which are low impact and easy to do), started eating healthy (with advice from a nutritionist at my doctor's office), and started taking 3 Benecol Smart Chews after dinner every evening.  3 weeks later, my cholesterol was down to 222.  3 months later, it was down to 185.  The Benecol.com website says you can take 1-2 chews twice a day with meals, or 3-4 all at once with a meal:<br /><br />"Plant stanol esters should be ingested at meal times, because this is the prime time when fat and cholesterol in the diet is absorbed into the intestinal wall. Stanols are absorbed in place of cholesterol into the intestinal lining and also cause cholesterol to be secreted back into the intestine.  Studies show that peak benefits are derived with a stanol intake of approximately 2g per day...Studies also showed that once-a-day with a meal is sufficient as a daily dose of plant stanol ester, and that consuming the stanol as a food ingredient but not as part of a meal was not as effective."<br /><br />Benecol Smart Chews have no scary side effects because they simply pass through the intestine, but if you eat too many, you can get diarrhea.  The chews are carefully wrapped in foil so it takes a minute or two to unwrap 3 of them, perhaps to discourage children who might think they are caramel candy, or adults from accidentally eating too many.  Each chew has .7g of plant stanols, so you need to eat 3 a day to get the recommended dose of approximately 2g per day.  Benecol lowers cholesterol up to 14% in just 3 weeks.  I am glad I found the Smart Chews here at Amazon.com as they are only available online.
