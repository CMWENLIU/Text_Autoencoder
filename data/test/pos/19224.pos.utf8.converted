I have to drink decaf coffee for health reasons; and, frankly, a lot of them leave a kind of after taste.  Tully's was really AWESOME!!!  If you haven't tried this coffee yet, give it a shot.  It's REALLY good!!!!  The French Roast Decaf has a smooth flavor, and this coffee is one I will DEFINITELY buy again!!!
