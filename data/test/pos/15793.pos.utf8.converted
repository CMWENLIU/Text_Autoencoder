For those of you surprised, yes - it really is a pack of 4 bags for that low price. Yes, the chocolate is great quality. Shipping is $1.99 and it came in two days in a cooled box. For your information: one bag contains 35 pieces of chocolate. A full order contains 140 pieces. This was a great piece of information when I was purchasing these chocolates for wedding favors.
