I never thought I'd like these when I first ordered them but gosh they are sooooo yummy...  They have a great taste, texture and satisfying crunch! Plus they're high in fiber and protein which is like so kewl<br /><br />**Update**<br /> Since my original review above, I've ordered on average of 2 cases per month, a few cases I've recieved tasted very stale and deserve a rating of minus 5 stars so beware
