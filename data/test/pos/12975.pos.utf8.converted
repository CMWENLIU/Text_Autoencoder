I recently moved to the East Coast where I could not find good Asian food. I ordered Mamaeun galbi online and highly satisfied that it was delivered so quickly and came in the fresh unfrozen state. It includes an instruction how to cook and how to store the left-over. Most importantly, galbi was sooooo delicious. I have to say that it's better than my mom's. I became a facebook fan. :) I ordered 2 lbs which was a lot more than I expected, but I think that I will order more in order to save shipping cost.
