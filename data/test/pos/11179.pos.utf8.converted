This product is indeed excellent.  I talked to a rep at the store, and she said this product helps keep the the digestive tract clean by quickly sending impurities out of the body.  It has real duck and some blueberries and cranberries--not just pumace of these fruits like some other brands.  This product contains lots of good things.  I have bought it several times and my kitty really loves it.  My only gripe are the lifebites that she has a tendency to spit out.  These lifebites contain vitamins & antioxidents--they are a wonderful source of extra nutrition--the reason I buy this food.  Your cat might have some problem getting used to eating these.  I only wish they would incorporate the whole nutrition package into one single morsel--not have these separate from the rest of the food.  I don't know if this is a business decision (for taste reasons or nutrition reasons--they are in fact cold-pressed). (I have no idea if all the other morsels are cold-pressed.)  I don't know the true wisdom behind this decision to keep what are in the lifebites separate from the other morsels.  Maybe there is a good reason, maybe not.  I tried to e-mail the company and have gotten responses, but they seem to be avoiding my main question--besides the vitamins--what is in these lifebites that my cat may be missing?  Are there blueberries & cranberries--the color is darker than the rest of the food.  I would love for my cat to eat blueberries or whatever extra they put in these lifebites--besides the vitamins.  Where are the blueberries or cranberries?  Are they in the regular morsels or in the lifebites?<br /><br />(Note: dated 3/30/11:  The total list of lifebits ingredients are listed on their website.  My frustration remains the same.  I only wish they would make these lifebits even MORE tasty than the rest of the food.  The idea is very good, but the reality is frustrating.  It seems that the Chicken package rather than the Duck package has more lifebits.  This has been my experience only and may not be totally accurate.)<br /><br />You can try mixing a tad of warm water into the food to make some good broth & help bring out the aroma. Try warming up cold water in a pan. (Warm water straight from the tap might have lead if your pipes are prior 1978 & warm water has much more lead than cold water.)  Try mixing the lifebites with some tantalizing food.  These are suggestions to make your cat get the full nutrition package.
