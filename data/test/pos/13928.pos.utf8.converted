I have tried a couple of different yerba mate teas and this is by far my favorite. It consists only of freshly dried yerba mate leaves and nothing else-no additives, no artifical or natural sweeteners. Just pure yerba mate. I use my french press to brew myself a fresh cup. The taste is very green and has the familiar slightly bitter taste of yerba mate. Since this tea is neither smoked nor aged you will get all the vitamins and minerals that get lost in other brands. If you are looking for a coffee substitute this tea fits the bill. It provides a nice boost of energy similar to coffee without giving you the jitters after one too many cups. I discovered this tea when I needed to reduce my own coffee intake and I can only recommend it. I love that it is energizing as well as healthy for you. That's a combination that can't be beat.
