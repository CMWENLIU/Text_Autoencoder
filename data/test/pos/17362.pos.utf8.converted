While this product is more commonly used to make a traditional fish broth, I have been giving my kitties crushed up Bonito Flakes instead of store-bought treats  once or twice a week for some time now and they couldn't be happier with the switch!  This is all-natural, with no nasty dies for them to blorph up on your carpet and when given in moderation, a dirt cheap treat.  It takes a while for some cats to catch on to the whole idea of a lighter than air flaked treat but once they do, they'll do almost anything to get at the bag so make sure you keep them in a very secure cabinet with a baby-lock!  I gave some as a gift to my neighbors cats and they climbed the counter, pried open the cabinet door, tore into the bag and ate the whole thing in one sitting!  One thing to keep in mind, however, is that what is marketed as "Bonito" is in fact, Skipjack Tuna flakes and not the more expensive Bonito.  If these were actual Bonito flakes, the price would be unaffordable.  The reason you'll want to know the actual type of fish is to asses the mercury risk to your little friends.  Skipjack Tuna is considered a moderate risk to pregnant women and should not be eaten by them an large quantities.  Therefore, I limit doling these treats out to about two times a week for kitty and usually just a healthy pinch or two.  it's enough to make them the happiest kitties on the planet for the moment they are smelling and eating their flakes!  My friends call this stuff "Kitty Kat Krack" and it's best used as a special treat and not an every day treat.<br /><br />There are two ways to give this to kitty:<br /><br />1. When you get the bag open it up and set aside the biggest flakes to use as training or reward treats that you hand feed to kitty. ABout 2/3rds  to 3/4's of the bag are very large flakes that are good for hand feeding to kitty as a treat.<br /><br />2. Then, fold the open top of the bag over and crush up all the rest into a finer bunch of tiny flakes.  This form is easy to put into a special treat dish for kitty when she's been especially good or to maybe comfort an older kitty who's feeling jealous of a new kitten.  I use the fine powdery flakes in a bowl to lure my outdoor semi-feral kitty inside for health checks and to put his flea meds on.  it works like a charm!<br /><br />I'm very serious about this driving the kitties crazy.  Be sure to put a food bag clip on the open bag or store in a ziplock bag after opening. The smell will tempt a kitty to try and get at it wherever you store it!  I order the 4-bag shipment about 2 to 3 times a year, but I have 3 cats and I often give little snack bags away to friends.  Once or twice a year should suffice for a single cat household.  You may see these in small tenth of an ounce packets in pet stores going for $5.99 so you can see this price is much better.  You can also find this in your grocery store in the Asian foods Aisle but the price per unit can be almost double depending upon where you shop.<br /><br />Try some for kitty!
