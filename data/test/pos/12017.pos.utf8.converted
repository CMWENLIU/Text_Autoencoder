This medium roast blend has all the flavors of Kona or Kauai coffee, especially the chocolate notes, and at a much lower price. We used to buy Kauai Coffee beans at Costco in Lihue on our trips there, and then started ordering it directly from Kauai Coffee, but at over $65 for 5#, we looked for a less expensive alternative, and found this. Excellent coffee and great price! We still serve our favorite Kauai Coffee at holiday time, but for everyday use, this is perfect.
