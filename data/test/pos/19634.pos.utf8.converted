I've been drinking caffe d'vita coffees for about 20 years and the Hawaiian Mocha has a slight edge over the rest of the pack with it's distinctive COFFEE flavor instead of added flavors I've used like orange, amaretto, cinnamon, rasberry chocolate, english toffee, pumpkin spice and almond mocha which tends to give you a sweeter aftertaste.  The Cappuccino comes in a close seceond to the Hawaiian!
