I purchased a can of Planter's Digestive Health Mix because I was looking for a healthy bag/can of mixed nuts/berries/etc. All of the other products on the shelf have carmel coating, cheesy coating, covered in salt, etc. I wanted something that was natural, had almonds, and hopefully some type of decent tasting berries. I am HOOKED! I buy one to two cans a week - they are about $4.50-$6 at my local grocery stores. I wasn't interested in the "digestive health" label and didn't think it would help. I usually "go" every other day or so...well let's just say I have been "going" everyday with ease. Forget painful laxatives or crazy cleansers...this product will help your own body to naturally do what it's suppose to. If you love the taste of healthy granola cereals, you will love the granola clusters in this mix. There are also delicious green pistacios. The cranberries are not too hard, not too soft, and taste great. If you aren't interested in your health, eating better, and you still prefer cheese puffs and coca-cola all day, you may not like this product. If you are like my family and I (seen members have heart attacks, diabetes, and learned junk food just isn't worth it anymore), then you will love this product. As you know, almonds are a great source of the healthy fats your heart needs. The berries contain anti-oxidants that your body needs. I would not suggest eating the whole can the 1st time you buy this product...you will spend the next day in the "office". I suggest eating an ounce or so as a daily snack. I am a 32 year old SAHM that has become a health nut. :o)
