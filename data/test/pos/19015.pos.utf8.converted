I recently bought this product after hearing great reviews on it and I can say that I definitely agree. I use this on my hair exclusively, I am an African-American and have natural hair. I usually just "seal" my hair with this, which it's good for, but it can be greasy. I don't really know how to combat that, but it doesn't really have too much of a smell either, which is good b/c I don't know how I feel about the smell of coconut. The amount is quite enough for the price, but depending on how much you use it may not last as long as it looks like it will. Mine probably won't last too long, but I will definitely buy again.
