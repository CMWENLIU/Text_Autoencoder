Our American bulldog has had terrible digestion issues for months.  After vet visits, meds, about a million different kibbles (including prescription food), finally we have found something he can eat.  Until now the only thing that hasn't caused vomiting and diarrhea was a bland food diet that I cooked myself.  This food is working wonderfully for us and is very reasonably priced compared to many premium brands.  So happy to finally have found something!!<br /><br />ETA: december 17, 2010  We have now had our three dogs (boxer, two american bulldogs) on this food since this initial review.  They have very soft coats and look terrific, also they have great energy.  I do have to say though, they poop MUCH more than they have on other 'premium' foods.  It really is horrid.  My sensitive dog does well on this so we will continue feeding, but if it wasn't for that we probably would try something else.
