Although my rat terrier-beagle mix came to me eating Purina Puppy Chow, I quickly switched up to Natural Balance Ultra Premium Formula for Dogs after reading various pet food reviews that panned Puppy Chow and praised Natural Balance foods.  And I am here to tell you that the praise is justified.  Although my puppy had been prone to occasional diarrhea prior to the switch, his stools have become solid, his coat has become very soft and thick, and he seems better filled out and more energetic.  He eats the food well, finishes his meals quickly and has done quite well on this food.<br /><br />I am very happy to have found Natural Balance Dog foods and intend to continue to feed my dog this product for the foreseeable future.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CST8PM">Natural Balance Ultra Premium Formula Dog Food, 15-Pound Bag</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003C5TCYU">Natural Balance Ultra Premium Formula for Dogs, 33-Pound Bag</a>
