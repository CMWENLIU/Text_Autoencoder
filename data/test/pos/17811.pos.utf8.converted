Who knew that 8 simple words could mean so much? I for one, did not. However, the fates would smile upon me one evening in a drunken stupor, when I took a gamble on Geier's Liver Sausage. Imagine my surprise when I found I had not only received 1 but 6, 6.5 ounce cans of flavor country.<br />Let me tell you, the pork and pork liver flavors blend together and make you question, where does the pork end and the liver start? Onions solidifying the union of salt and natural spices into a holy trinity of taste.<br />Which brings us to the sodium nitrite, oh sweet, sweet sodium nitrite, thank you for preserving these wonderful little gifts from the gods.<br />Look no further then Geier's Liver Sausage, Hausmacher Brand, for all your tissue and organ meat needs.
