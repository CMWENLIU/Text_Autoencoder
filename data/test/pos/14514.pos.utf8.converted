I tried the product before I gave it to my cousin's baby, and it taste delicious. The baby also agreed, he made no complaints in eating it! He really seemed to enjoy it.<br /><br />If you want to serve it warm, just stand the pouch in hot water, then squeeze and serve. Microwaving the pouch is not recommended. It taste better cold than it does warm.<br /><br />The cap does look like a small chewing toy when removed so parents, keep the caps away as it could be a choking hazard. The caps twists on and twist off.<br /><br />Serving (1 Package)<br />Calories: 80<br />Dietary Fiber 4g<br />Sugars less than 2 G<br /><br />Protein: 4%<br />Vitamin A: 25%<br />Vitamin C: 140%<br />Iron: 4%<br /><br />The servings are given as 1/2 package so I had to double the numbers, because a baby CAN eat this all in one serving.<br /><br />My product expires on Jul 2012 and I received this product Feb 2012 (that is 6 months). I can understand the short shelflife of this product, it is 100% organic with no preservatives, no food dyes, no artificial colors or sweeteners.<br /><br />other than the cap issue (There is a warning on the pouch), I found no flaws in this product. It taste delicious and the baby loves it!
