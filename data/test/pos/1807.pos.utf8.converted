Yellow grits have not been available in our local supermarkets for quite some time, so when I needed some to make my new favorite, Zea's Corn Grits, I searched online.  The first brand that I tried made much of being "stone ground", but the texture when cooked was too coarse for the dish.  These Arrowhead Mills Organic Yellow Corn Grits were my second purchase, and they have the perfect texture.  They cook quickly and are full of good corn flavor.  Highly recommended.
