First, I want to say that Amazon's prices for Splenda are competitive with those in the supermarkets.<br /><br />Splenda is a staple at our house.  We like the taste of sweet things.  I drink it in hot tea all day.  I like sugar cane sugar too, but I need to cut calories.  With Splenda, I don't notice an aftertaste.<br /><br />We cook for cooking fun, eating pleasure, and recipe development; and we use Splenda.  This recipe is my sister Ruth's.  She gave it to me to use in Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook.  When I finished the second edition, we went to our hometown and had a book signing for  Flavored with Love and also for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/158851207X">Solomon's Porch: The Story of Ben and Rose</a>. We cooked a large amount of food because we knew this book signing was going to be a reunion.  When Ruth suggested making these, I said, "You expect me to take these simple little sugar free muffins --- we made them tiny -- to a book signing?"  Since my sister has won a few dozen cooking contests, I was expecting something complicated.  (Her husband was diabetic, and now she is.  She has become very conscious of the way she sweetens her food.)<br /><br />"You'll see," she said.  She used Splenda.  These little muffins stole the show!  People ate them fast and first.<br />--<br />Orange Muffins<br />2 cups self-rising flour<br />1 cup artificial granulated sweetener that is measured the same as sugar<br />1 cup orange juice<br />4 tablespoons margarine<br />2 eggs, beaten<br />2 teaspoons grated orange zest<br />Non-stick cooking spray<br /><br />Combine the flour and sweetener.
