I was purchasing the small 3oz size in our local pet store when I came across a larger 5.5oz on Amazon.  They definitely have my attention and business.  The price on Amazon is less than what I was paying in the pet store for the smaller size and free shipping too!  My cat loves the shredded chicken and it really smells good.  Definitely 4 paws up for the Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken!!
