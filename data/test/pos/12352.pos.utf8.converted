Use this instead of string cheese as it is a high-value treat, but does not get your fingers or pocket goooey (like regular cheese). Like the fact that there are no "extra" (read fake) ingredients. Some of the larger chunks are hard to break up, but generally can break each piece into 2 or 3 smaller pieces. Pieces are about 1" long and 1/2" wide. Also good for situations where you are throwing the treat into the grass (i.e. when training agility weaves) as the bright yellow color makes it easy for the dog to see.
