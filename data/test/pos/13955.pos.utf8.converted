As a nutrition and lifestyle coach this is one of the "musts haves" for me and my clients. It is a wonderful source of protein and much better than any of the whey protein powders on the market - I use it in shakes and baking custards and marshmallows<br />The amino acid profile is anti-inflammatory and compliments the inflammatory effects of all the muscle meats that people are eating today
