Just tried this today...and it was delicious! I have tried Dr. McDougall's Non-Dairy Peach and Raspberry Hot Cereal before, and loved it. Maple Hot Cereal is very flavorful, hearty, and filling!<br /><br />I love Dr. McDougall's products, because they are so natural, with whole grain raw oats (not processed, instant oats), and use soy milk powder to give a creamy texture with out all of the added sugars that normal oatmeal products have.<br /><br />Also, this oatmeal is wonderful, because of the portion size. A usual instant oatmeal packet is skimmpy on size- I usually need two packets for breakfast. This product, however, is a good portion size, and it is convenient because you don't need a bowl to mix it (you use the product container itself, and just add water).<br /><br />Dr. McDougall's Non Dairy Hot Cereal products are the greatest store bought, and the closest to homemade oatmeal you can get!
