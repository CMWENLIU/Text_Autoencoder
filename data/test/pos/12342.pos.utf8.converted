I am so glad i bought a case of these! These veg sausages have now become my tastiest and favorite veg meat alternative.<br /><br />Unlike the other worthington offerings i have tried which dont really taste like the real meat comparison, these delicious veggie sauseges VERY CLOSELY taste like the real thing.<br /><br />They have a great smokey flavor and just the right amount of mild spicey seasoning.<br /><br />I suggest NOT to microwave..these definitly need to be pan fried and you will be pleased with the taste and texture of these delicious links.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!
