There are a couple of reasons that led me to try this product. I am very interested in wine, and I wanted to understand licorice taste and smell better, since this is present in a lot of reds. Most importantly, I have high cholesterol and I love dark chocolate, and a friend recommended this as an alternative since it is a much healthier option.<br /><br />I remembered trying the popular licorice candy you can find in grocery stores (i.e Twizzlers) and finding it repugnant. At that time I thought I did not like licorice, but I couldn't have been more wrong. This licorice provides a completely different experience; with a smooth texture and delicious taste, this is as good as eating the best dark chocolate available. I am planning to keep ordering this product for a long time to come.
