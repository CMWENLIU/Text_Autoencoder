This soup didn't have many reviews, but I got it figuring, how can you screw up vegetable soup?<br /><br />I opened the can and could actually see vegetables on the top.  This isn't like other soups where 3/4s of the can is filled with broth.  The broth itself was a nice deep red color.  The soup was delicious and filling.  Very pleased and would order again.
