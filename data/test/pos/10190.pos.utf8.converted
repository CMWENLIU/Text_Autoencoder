I really enjoy this tea. It's as stimulating as coffee but it taste better. I will drink tea instead of coffee any day. Guayaki seems to be a good brand. I visited the company's website. Guayaki is the strongest Yerba Mate' that I have tried. I strongly recommend this to anyone seeking an alternative to coffee. Descriptions of the tea suggest that it also promotes mental awareness. I found this to be true. It is similar to the feeling i get when I take Gingko Biloba.
