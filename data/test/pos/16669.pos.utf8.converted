My son was diagnosed with Failure to Thrive (FTT), he is 17 months old and currently weighs 18lbs. About 6 months ago we discovered he has a severe allergy to diary, eggs & peanuts - among other things. We had been giving him regular soy milk for awhile but I was looking for something a little more nutritious that would supplement his diet and help him put on some weight when I found this product. Believe it or not this is the only soy-based product of it's kind which I just don't understand - there are so many kiddos out there with dairy allergies!! I even found an article online praising Bright Beginnings for developing this sort of product, they were able to tap into a huge market that even Pediasure hadn't touched. My other options were all dairy-based or EXTREMELY expensive so we decided to try this. Let me just say that within a month's time, I have ordered over 12 cases just to make sure we don't run out. It has been a total lifesaver for us. My son loves it and I feel good knowing that on those days when my toddler is too busy to eat as well as I think he should he's still getting a lot of nutrients from this product. My son put on exactly 1 pound in exactly 1 month thanks to this product.<br /><br />A big THANKS to Amazon.com for carrying this product!!! Not only is it cheaper here than anywhere else they ship it so quickly which I really appreciate!!!!
