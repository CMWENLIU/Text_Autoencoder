My 12 year old cat has been suffering a skin allergy that began last January. After hundreds of dollars, half a dozen prescriptions, skin scrapings, blood work, several injections we found this food. Her next step was either a biopsy ($400) or a trip to the veterinary allergist ($1000) First I decided to do an 8 week food trial to rule out food allergy. After pricing the food the Vet wanted to put her on at $43 for a 6 pound bag, I decided to do some research. I looked at food ratings, ingredients, customer reviews. I came across this food & decided to give it a try. After 2 weeks her hair is growing back. The "lesions" she had are healing and no more scratching them open. Her coat looks great & she even looks like she is slimmimg down. It stands to reason that cats should be fed meat, not corn and fillers. What a relief.
