I love Duplo.  I have travelled to Germany twice because my relatives live there.  Everytime I am there I bring a lot of this home with me.  They also bring some to me when they come.  These are THE best wafer / chocolates you will ever eat.  A lot of German chocolate is made with Hasselnuss.. I mean Hazlenuts..  Anyway, if you like these, you are definetly going to love Milka my fave Sahne-Creme).  They are to die for and I screamed and called my mom when I found these on amazon.  I would also reccommend Ritter Sport (my fav is butter biscuit),  Ritter is becoming more mainstream and I have found it at a few local grocery stores (it is not as good as Milka though).<br /><br />I close my eyes and take a bite and I can feel me sitting in my cousins house overlooking the green pastures of the tiny village of Weissenbach in Southern Germany...  Ich leibe Deutchland und ich leibe Deutch schokolade ewig!  Ist Zehr Gut.<br />translation:  I Love Germany and I Love German Chocolate Always.  It is very good.
