When I was young, a while ago, sardines didn't come three or so to the flat can as they do now; they were small fish, young sprat. The very best were so tiny that they were packed crossways and two layers deep, lightly smoked, in oil. These still are, and at the best price I've seen in years. The taste is utterly different from the cheap supermarket brands. If sardines could be elegant, these would be.
