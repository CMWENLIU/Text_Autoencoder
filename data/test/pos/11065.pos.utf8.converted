I've been all-around impressed with Teeccino, and the multi pack is the way to go. I expected something that was a bad imitation of coffee, kinda like the Tofurky of beverages or something. Instead, this is just some tasty darn stuff on it's own merits. Nice balanced flavors, with a natural mild sweetness, like the best coffee has. Not acidic, not bitter, but strong and interesting. Wakes up my brain and tongue, just as I'd hoped. The flavor is stable, and doesn't taste stale after a while like coffee does. I can work on a large tumbler all day and it's still fresh.<br /><br />Easy to make. I use it in a Bodum travel press. The grounds actually make a tasty second cup, if you want, but only one. Fits nicely into your regular coffee ritual without any fuss. Strongly recommended. It's a little pricey, but far preferable to Any other option I've tried, and worth the price to me.
