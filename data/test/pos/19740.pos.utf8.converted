When I couldn't find the red quinoa at Trader Joe's, I asked the clerk.  I looked at her in horror when she told me it was "a seasonal item and should be back in 6 to 9 months".  What!?  There was no way I could wait.  We eat this stuff with everything.  It has fully replaced rice in our household, so I use it in soups, with stir fry, etc.  But it's also good as a salad topping or (if you prepare it with broth) just plain.  Extremely tasty and good for you and the price for 4 boxes here is the same as for 1.5 boxes at Kroger.
