I've been using Xylitol, specifically Emerald Forest's product, for a few years now.  It looks and tastes like sugar and can be used for baking too.  There have been a few occasions when it didn't quite substitute right, but those are few and far between.  Coffee, tea, hot chocolate, macaroons, chocolate chip cookies, brownies...all turn out great.  I'm on a no sugar diet (along with no grains) to combat a possible candida problem.  Xylitol has been my savior.  I still get my little sweet kick now and then without any of the damaging health effects of sugar.  And, xylitol is also anti-fungal, so it even helps with things like candida.  High recommended!  And this price is a total steal too!  One 32 ounce can costs nearly $30 at my local health food store.  This price can't be beat!
