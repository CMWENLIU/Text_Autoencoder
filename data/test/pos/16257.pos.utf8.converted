Absolutely my favorite seasoning of all time. My entire family orders and uses this stuff. It is great for all kinds of food. I haven't found anything I don't like it on. An absolute must try. Everyone always asks me what I season my food with. I tell them there's just one thing and nothing else, "Slap Ya Mama".
