If you are planning on making some thai recipes at home this is the best Thai fish sauce money can buy. Add some sugar, some water, mint cilantro and chilies and you'll have a staple of Thai cooking, serve that dressing with Spring rolls, Thai noodles and even brussels sprouts and you'll have a hit! Check out my blog for a nice recipe using that stuff.
