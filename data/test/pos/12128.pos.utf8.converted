A few days ago I stumbled across this outstanding cereal while browsing our local grocery chain's web site for healthy lo-cal foods. Its has far fewer calories than the raisin bran I normally eat when I do cereal, and is even lower calorie and higher in fiber than the Shredded Wheat my wife eats. It also has 45% of your daily iron, and nice percentages (in the 25% to 35% range) of other necessary vitamins.<br /><br />It also has a very good taste, you could eat a few pieces of it at a time for a snack. A 3/4 cup serving has 7 grams of sugar. Since it is still lower calorie than what I've been eating, that doesn't concern me.<br /><br />With 1/3rd cup of milk and a half of a banana, breakfast is less than 200 calories and very nutritious. I use a bit less milk than many on cereal. I don't like it to ever get soggy, yet I don't like it completely dry. I have developed the knack of pouring just enough so that the milk doesn't show in the cereal. If I can see the milk after I pour (cereal already in the bowl LOL), I know I've overdone it for my taste.<br /><br />If you are watching calories, beware of the other flavor varieties of this cereal line. They are almost twice the calories per serving (200 or so compared to the 110 for this).<br /><br />I do find that 3/4 cup of this cereal with a half banana is just as filling for me as a cup of Raisin Bran (with a half banana), so I'm getting more nutrition, more fiber, and about 80 fewer calories for a bowl of cereal. I have always had trouble getting enough fiber in my diet, so the extra provided here is very helpful.<br /><br />The Amazon price is considerably less than our local supermarket, which has this at about $4 a box.
