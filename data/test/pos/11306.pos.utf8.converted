I've done quite a bit of research on dog food.  Who knew I was feeding my dogs such sub-standard stuff all these years.  But my current pup has a very sensitive tummy and so I was forced to research.  When this food was delivered and I unpacked the box, he sat next to the bag and howled!  It was a hoot.  Needless to say he loves it - and his poop is great with it.
