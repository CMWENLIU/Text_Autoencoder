I can smell the strong, pungent odor of the saffron as soon as I pull the envelope of it out of the bottle. I just put in a generous pinch into my rice cooker, and voila I have a delicious smelling, looking and tasting saffron rice every time. I've used the product about 4 times, and there is still plenty of saffron left in the jar.
