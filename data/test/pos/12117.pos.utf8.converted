These are EXCELLENT little treats for a dog with food allergies.<br />You hate to not be able to "reward" them, with something other than<br />their regular food.  So, these are just the ticket.  These are especially<br />nice for a smaller dog (I have a Dachshund, who has developed allergies<br />as he's gotten older).  They haven't caused any gastro-intestinal problems<br />for my dog at all/or made his skin break out; and he is on a Vet ordered<br />Salmon diet.
