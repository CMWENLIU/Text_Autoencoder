This is REAL Ginger Ale - Not Ginger flavored or high-fructose corn syrup sweetened.<br />If we hadn't started peeling & chopping our own Ginger Root for tea, it might have been too strong for us.<br />But, we did make our own tea and reveled in its taste - Ergo, this beverage was for us.<br />If you're expecting Canada Dry - Forget it.<br />JC
