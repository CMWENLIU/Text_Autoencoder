Sure, it's not 100% pure vanilla extract.  That's indicated quite clearly in the ingredients.  Molina vanilla is made with a mixture of pure vanilla extract and synthetic vanillin.  Personally I love its strong distinctive flavor, regardless of what percentage pure vanilla extract it is.  For those who feel it's too strong, use half the amount listed in the recipe.  I know a couple of people who do this when using Molina Vanilla.  Again, I like the flavor, so I use the full amount called for in the recipe.  This stuff has a great flavor that really kicks things up a notch.
