Cabbage, peppers, and onions. Those are the proper ingredients and that's all this stuff has.<br /><br />I'm a Chow Chow freak. I've tried them all and except for a few brands made in the state of Tennessee, this is the best I've ever had. Just enough heat, the right crunch, and the perfect amount of sugar gives this chow a mildly sweet finish. Great on beans, blackeyed peas, hot dogs, burgers, fried green tomatoes.... use your imagination.<br /><br />Try this on pork chops, northern beans, and smoked sausage. Yeah, that all goes in the same pot.....with the entire jar of Chow Chow. Amazing!
