I'm actually a diabetic; and cereal, because of it's high glucose content, is usually something I stay away from.  If I eat cereal for breakfast, even the good cereals like corn flakes or cheerios, I see a sudden spike in blood sugar and usually get tired at around 10 or 11am.  These Nature's Path Cereals, this one and the granola, are the only cereals from which I experience absolutely no negative effects.  Because of the natural ingredients, pumpkin seeds, flax, etc. this cereal does not immediately turn to sugar for the body to process.  Instead, it leaves you feeling full and energized for a long time.  They taste incredible too; seriously, I prefer this over regular raisin bran or whatever you'd compare it to.  Strongly recommend!
