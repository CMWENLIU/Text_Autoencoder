These granules are so easy to bake with versus syrupy sugar alternatives like maple syrup and honey. It's nice to not have to reconfigure every recipe that I don't want to use sugar in. Delicious taste! It is on the expensive side...I would really love it to be cheaper so that I can use it more often....maybe if popularity picks up, the price will go down?
