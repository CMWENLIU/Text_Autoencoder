Hey this is a nutritious, healthy, hearty and tasty soup. I was going in with low expections and was so surprised. 250 calories about for the entire can...okay that's about the going rate anyway and it's so full of Vitamin A (about 90%), protein (5-6 g) and FIBER (7-8g).  AND it's organic to boot? How can you go wrong?  I think eating healthy soups like this for lunch will really help me on my "diet" since the healthy ingredients and fiber will keep me from craving more food (which is often one's body in search of more nutrition).  I hope Amazon offers the chicken soup soon. And free shipping - thank you Amazon.com for making my life easier and giving me more value!  I'd be lost without you.
