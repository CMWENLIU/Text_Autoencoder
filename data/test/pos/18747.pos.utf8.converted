I love this chili mix and it's gotten hard to find in grocery stores these days. I was thrilled to see it stocked on Amazon!<br />Inside each bag are 4 packets, one of chili seasoning, one of salt, one of red pepper (to make it more spicy), and one of masa flour (for thickening the chili). Enough to season 2 lb of meat.<br />If you don't add any of the red pepper, the result is mild but still delicious!<br />In addition to 2 lb of ground beef, I usually add bell peppers, onions, black beans, and kidney beans.<br />The resulting chili is easy to keep in the fridge (I just put it in tupperware) - makes especially great leftovers.
