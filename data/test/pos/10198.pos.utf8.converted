I recently decided to add raw pumpkin seeds (known as "pepitas") to my diet on a daily basis, and wanted the convenience of seeds that were not in the shell. After doing some research on the internet, I bought this directly from Superior Nut based on glowing recommendations from other purchasers. I am very happy that I did.<br /><br />These seeds are fresh, are nice and chewy, and taste delicious. I have not found any seeds that are musty, rancid, or burnt (which apparently can be a problem with other companies). The seeds come in a sturdy resealable bag that helps to preserve their freshness.<br /><br />These make a great snack, are very filling, and are loaded with lots of minerals that contribute to your health. Superior Nut was a pleasure to deal with, and shipped my order promptly.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a good company to order a tasty and healthy product from at an economical price.
