To get great espresso, you need the grind to be perfect.  Unless you're willing to shell out $350+ for a professional level grinder (like a Rancilio Rocky), you've got to buy pre-ground espresso (a less-than-professional burr grinder will cause your espresso to taste burnt and watery).  Most espresso connoisseurs will agree that Illy (the brand in the silver cans) produces the best pre-ground espresso; the only problem is the price: an 8.8 oz can will run you around $15, which puts the price per pound a little under $30.  I had tried the standard Lavazza before, and was unimpressed.  However, on a whim, I picked up a can of 'in Blu' a few days ago.....<br /><br />Let me cut to the chase: I would say that Lavazza in Blu is actually BETTER than Illy -- the taste and finish are perfect, and even in an inexpensive machine like a Krups, you can still get an amazing amount of crema.  With minimal effort, 'in Blu' will allow you to make, at home, espresso drinks that rival the quality of the nicest coffee shops (not to mention the subpar brews of S-bucks!).  The fact that over 2 lbs. of 'in Blu' goes for $22 is just the icing on the cake!<br /><br />A quick note about the actual flavor of the espresso; it's a tad sweeter than the usual dark roast, and works extremely well in a macchiato (just a small dollop of frothed milk on top of a solo espresso).  Even those who don't usually drink espresso will appreciate an 'in Blu' macchiato with a ginger snap on the side.  Seriously, try it!
