Barry Farms is known for their quality and rare, hard-to-find ingredients. Guar Gum is no exception, but anything can be found on Amazon, right? Barry Farms to the rescue!<br /><br />The thickening effect of Guar Gum is similar to gelatin, but the end result is more of a syrup than a jello. Guar Gum has a thickening power nearly 8 times greater than that of corn starch.<br /><br />Many ice creams and popsicles, even Italian ices, call for two main ingredients: Guar Gum (which, being the dietary fiber that it is, has been known to help lower cholesterol) and sometimes Xanthan Gum (also available from Barry Farms: [...]). Both of these gums behave quite differently, and Xanthan Gum can be harder to mix into your liquid solution, but both are effective means to preventing crystallization of liquids, which is how you get softer ice cream and popsicles instead of rock hard ice!<br /><br />Guar Gum can also be used in baked goods to increase dough yield and improves texture and shelf life, in pastry fillings to keep the pastry crust crisp and flaky, in dairy to thicken milk, yogurt, kefir, and liquid cheese products and to maintain homogeneity and texture of ice creams and sherbets, in meat as lubricant and binder, to improve the stability and appearance of salad dressings, barbecue sauces, relishes, ketchups and others dressings/sauces, and even in dry soups, and instant oatmeal mixes.
