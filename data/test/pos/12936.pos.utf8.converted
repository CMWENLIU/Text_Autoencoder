I am a passionate home cook and have been canning my own tomatoes since I was a child.  American canned tomatoes all contain a "firming agent" that prevents the tomatoes from turning to mush in the can.  This agent also prevents them from breaking down nicely in a sauce, too!  Thus, I always can my own.  However, I will no longer be using my own tomatoes in pasta sauces after trying these Italian tomatoes.  These tomatoes are rich, meaty and are packed in a thick sauce.  They look and taste fabulous, and make an amazing pasta sauce!  My husband and I kept "mmm-ing" as we ate the first sauce I made with these.  I love the fact that they have no additives of any kind - no firming agents, no herbs/spices, not even any salt.  You have complete control over how you season your dishes.  I'm soooo glad I bought a whole case of these, and hope I will always be able to access them.  The case price brings them down to well below supermarket prices for Italian tomatoes.  I couldn't care less that they are not DOP San Marzanos, just like I couldn't care less that my champagne doesn't come from France!  These tomatoes are the same as San Marzanos, without the special government label of tomatoes that come from a small geographic area in Italy.  American or home canned tomatoes are great for soups and stews, but no more American tomatoes for my pasta sauces!  I encourage everyone to give them a try.
