I use a lot of seeds for making breads, salad dressings, and in other cooking.  These are excellent sesame seeds.  The only drawback is that it takes a while to use up two packages and unless you are careful to keep the seeds cool and out of the sun they lose a little quality after a few months.  Toast them to bring out the flavor.  Grind them up when making salad dressings and add them to your other ingredients to add new flavor to your dressings.  I toss a handful into salads, onto cooked vegetable or add them to marinades for poultry and meats.  Sesame is very versatile and healthy eating!
