I have an eight year old corgi who is my security system and my baby.  He has had allergies all of his life, but recently they had gotten worse, with him having open sores on his underbelly, and bloodshot eyes, despite bi-weekly baths and benadryl.  In an attempt to help his allergies I put him on these treats and the corresponding kibble.  Six weeks later, his eyes are clear, he has stopped scratching, and his skin is much less red.<br /><br />However, this dog food did something else, something that is amazing.  Corgis are very prone to arthritis and hip problems.  My corgi had also developed what looked like fairly advanced arthritis in all four legs, with a limp that seemed to move from hip to hip, depending on the weather. Aside from an occasional limp on one paw damaged by rolling his entire body weight over one shoulder from three feet in the air in a bad frisbee catch, his gait is entirely normal.  I never thought I would see him move like this again.  Amazing stuff.
