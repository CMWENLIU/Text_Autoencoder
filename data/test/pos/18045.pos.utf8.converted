These are great! They aren't quite ice cream, but that doesn't bother me. My local health food stores carry it for a lot less. I like them best frozen solid, as they seem gummier a bit melted.<br /><br />My favorite is coffee, similar in flavor to Blue Bells.<br /><br />The strawberry is great, too and is most like real ice cream. It has some strawberry in it and a soft texture without being gummy.<br /><br />Chocolate tastes like a plain, barely sweet fudgesicle.<br /><br />The choc peanut butter is like a salted version of the chocolate.<br /><br /> The vanilla maple is a sweet icy treat, but does not resemble vanilla ice cream, although I really like it.<br /><br />The mint choc cookie (no cookies in it, just flavored) does taste like "thin mints" although it is not very sweet. All three chocolate ones are only eaten a few bites at a time by me.<br /><br />The cookies and cream is a bit of a flop. It looks strange and tastes like a chocolate-like version of the vanilla. I probably won't get that one again.<br /><br />Some markets still have the older versions which are different recipes. The chocolate is gummier and less sweet than the new, and the strawberry banana (now just strawberry) is okay, but so much better without banana (even though I like banana).<br /><br />I haven't been one to eat more than a half pint at a time, but you certainly could with whichever flavors you really like.<br /><br />I will be stocking up on Coffee, Strawberry, and Vanilla Maple, and buying the others if they are out of them or I get bored. While several stores near me have it, they don't have every flavor.
