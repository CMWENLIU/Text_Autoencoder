This cat food is the best that there is on the market. If you do not have the time to cook for your pets and you feed your cats dry kibble this is the product for you. Raw Instinct & Innova Evo are the only grain free dry kibble products on the market. This is premium stuff. One of my 5 cats was always scratching and had rashes, then I found out that the allergy may have been from grains. Ever since I started feeding him grain-free cat food, his allergies went away. Nature's variety also makes grain free canned food but it contains garlic which like onions may cause heinz-body anemia in cats so I do not give the canned food to my cats. Innova eveo is also a good choice for dry & canned food - both are garlic free.
