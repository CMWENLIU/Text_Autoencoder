I was hesitant to order this tea because there were only a few reviews at the time.  One reviewer said the tea was "tasteless" and another cited poor packaging affecting the freshness.<br /><br />I'm glad I took the chance because I disagree on both counts.  The taste is excellent which is, of course, the most important factor.  I love strong, aromatic, flavorful tea and this does not disappoint.  I had to add just a teeny bit more (a more rounded teaspoon for one cup) than with the tea I normally drink, Twinings Irish Breakfast, but that is insignificant since this Davidson's tea is half the price.  I love that it is organic since I drink a lot of tea.<br /><br />I also thought the packaging was adequate.  It is similar to the packaging used for the organic Ruta Maya coffee that I buy and I have never had a problem with freshness.  Of course it is best to make sure you press out all of the air before resealing the top...I usually tap it on the counter to settle the contents then bend the top over on itself while leaning over on it, then seal it. As it reduces in size putting a rubber band around it helps just in case you didn't get the seal completely closed. I keep a small quantity of the tea in an old Twinings tin so that I don't have to open the original package so often.<br /><br />I am very happy to have found this tea.  I still love the Twinings but it is just too expensive with three people in my family always drinking tea.
