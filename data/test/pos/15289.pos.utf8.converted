I'd settled on this brand as my favorite quick polenta and was sad when I couldn't find it in my regular stores.  I gamely tried the other quick brands to find a replacement, but they just didn't compare.  The texture and taste of this brand is much superior and by far the most authentic.  The flavor is rich and clean, not 'doctored' tasting, so if you want to add your own enhancements nothing gets in the way.  The texture is not mushy as some of the others are.  One brand reminded me of baby cereal. It pleased me to find this favorite brand here on Amazon and I stocked up.  This is great stuff.<br /><br />While it is called 'quick' polenta, it's really pretty much instant and is ready almost as soon as you reach the consistency you like.  I boil some salted water and pour it in slowly while whisking (you have to do this lest it clump since it absorbs moisture so fast).  When I reach a slightly thickened loose consistency, I remove it from the burner and set it to rest after adding whatever suits me such as chopped herbs.  It will thicken further, so you don't want to get it too thick to begin with.  That's all there is to it.  A scoop of this polenta under a duck breast is pretty close to heaven.  If you want to save some to saut&eacute; later, spread it on a cookie sheet before it thickens too much.  It cuts nicely into rounds or squares for a later meal.
