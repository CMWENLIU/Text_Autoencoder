I'm very picky when it comes to fruitcake.  I hate average fruitcakes that taste synthetic and are full of preservatives and who knows what else.<br /><br />But THIS fruitcake is amazingly good!  I ordered it out of curiosity and to try something new.  Wow!  So much flavor and richness!  It's moist without being soggy, and the cherries, pineapples, and nuts taste perfect with the brandy flavor and spices in the cake.  This is a very dark, rich, flavorful fruitcake.  It tastes homemade.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering this again!  Probably soon, too, because I know this one won't last very long, it'll be eaten before Thanksgiving for sure!<br /><br />The seller was quick to ship and it was packaged great.
