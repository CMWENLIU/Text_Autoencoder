My mom recommended to me ONE coconut water, and it's great.  Great tasting, full of electrolytes, and relatively healthy.<br /><br />When my Whole Foods ran out of stock, I thought I'd try the alternatives, including Zico and Vita something.  Surprisingly, both weren't that great although I think in one case it may have to do with them trying to mix other juices in (i.e. not pure coconut water).  Another brand I tried was worse.  That's pretty sad because other than good OJ or apple juice, nothing beats coconut water and more people ought to know about it.  No matter what brand you try, I wouldn't recommend non-pure coconut water like mango or other juices mixed in because it takes away from it.<br /><br />I've had coconut water straight from coconuts, and this is as good as I've had.  So it was a pleasant surprise when years back they started selling this stuff.  In many cultures, Coconuts are a daily staple and the source of a wide range of critical nutrients.  It's something people can eat and drink literally every day.<br /><br />The drink is good like Gatorade after a long excercize.  I hate Vitamin water and all the other sports drinks, and somewhat tolerate Gatorade.  I'm surprised they don't just imitate coconut water.<br /><br />Anyways, highly recommended.
