Came right away! Works great. It even warned me when a roast caught fire on the grill. (made a different tone and I went to check) It also gives about a 5 degree warning before the target temp. is reached. The speaking voice is pleasant and loud enought to heard well. Has a belt clip to wear the reciever on your person. I've used it indoors and out, without fail.<br />Highly recomended!! Thinking of buy'n a second one for the vacation home.
