I am having  to have my owner type this for me, but I really love this food!! I am a small designer breed who is very picky about food. I always eat my dinner, and my coat is soft and fluffy. I am happy this food does not contain corn or animal by-products. This food is always highly rated , and worth the small extra costs. Believe me, your dog will love you for buying it!!!
