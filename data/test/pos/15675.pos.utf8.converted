Great tea to boost your immune system, it also works as stress reliever, the tulsi or holy basil is native to India. This herb improves resistance to stress and has a normalizing influence on blood pressure and blood sugar imbalances. Used on a regular basis as tea or tincture, Tulsi is likely to prove prophyllactic against the negative effects of environmental toxins, including cancer. The plant is also richly endowed with bioavailable antioxidants, vitamins A and C, and calcium. Great taste as well, I love it!
