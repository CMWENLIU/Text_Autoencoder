This item seems to have disappeared from stores in my area, but happily Amazon has it.  I use this as an addition to homemade tomato sauces of different types and find it adds just the right depth of flavor and texture.  I generally use tomatoes from my garden, fresh or frozen, as a base and paste from a tube to help thicken it.  The herbs and spices are up to me and while I enjoy adding various things depending on the purpose for the sauce, using a bit of this product in addition seems to ensure consistently good results.  I'd like it even better without the MSG, but since the portion size isn't huge, I can live with it.  I end up with sauces that guests and family rave about and can definitely tell the difference when I don't have any.  Maybe someday I'll figure out how to duplicate the flavor, but until then I'm keeping this product in my pantry.
