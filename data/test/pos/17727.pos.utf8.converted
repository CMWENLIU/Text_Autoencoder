These traps are simply amazing - they take a few days to kick in, but they fill up quickly after that. I've had at least a hundred flies caught in a week, and it makes you think "where did they all come from?" (we live in a suburban area)<br /><br />YES, it does stink - the dead flies start to decompose, obviously, after a few days. While you *can* empty and re-use, I just throw it out with the garbage and use a new trap. For this reason, best put them someplace where you don't pass often (or eat close to!). This will also attract flies in the local area, so you'll see a lot of activity near the trap.<br /><br />It takes a few weeks of use to clear our the fly population, so buy more than one. I guess the lifespan of a common fly is about 2 weeks.<br /><br />Definitely worth getting - I try to buy a few at a time and use proactively.
