I bought this out of curiosity, after hearing the buzz about it on the internet. I took my chances and bought 10 packages of these.<br />They are fantastic! It came in a box, with 10 individual wrapped packages.<br />These freeze dried ice creams are broken into pieces (Stop blaming packaging!) for a reason, so they are more easier to bite into, and because they crumble after being freeze dried at -40 degrees!<br />I love these, and I am definitely planning to buy more, just in different flavors (this flavor is great, I just don't like vanilla. Strawberry is very enjoyable). Very light and compact, and you can bring it with you in a bag or a purse when you're craving ice cream but it's raining, or whatever.<br />Highly recommended! Cheers, Amazon.
