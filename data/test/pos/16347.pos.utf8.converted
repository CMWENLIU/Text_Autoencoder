We bought ours just before Christmas and plugged it in on December 27.  The chives and basils sprouted after just 3 days and we've seen visible growth in the few hours from when we come home from work to when we go to bed.  Seven days into the project and we're seeing signs of life in the "Sprouts in 8-14 days" pods.<br /><br />The documentation is excellent.  It has simple clear diagrams and easy to follow language.  And the instructions appear in multiple places, so you don't have to worry about losing the manual.<br /><br />We bought the white model retail for the same price before tax and it came with a $20 mail-in rebate, but you had to buy two to get the deal.
