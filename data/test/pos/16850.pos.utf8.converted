This is indispensable for making anything where you want a good clean strong chili/garlic/cumin flavor: Southwestern, Indian, Thai. I usually start by sauteeing a can of diced tomatoes in olive oil, then add a tbsp (or more, to taste) of chili base and let the mixture saute gently until it is thick and dark.<br />I have added this tomato/chili mixture to soup, stew, rice, chicken, pork chops, beans, really anthing, with great results! Highly recommended. Liisa
