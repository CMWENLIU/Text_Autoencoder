Have you ever been walking and heard a song on the radio and remembered something you thought long forgotten? Have you ever smelled something cooking that reminded you of growing up? Have you ever seen something that is so symbolic that you are transported back in mind? Our five senses are the strongest triggers of memory that we as humans possess, and this Retro Candy basket from the 1980's takes full advantage of that to make a perfect gift for the person who has every gadget, trinket, and item they ever needed.<br /><br />The 80s were the era of Atomic Fireballs, BitOHoney, Mamba, Nerds, Lik-m-aid Fun Dip, Bottlecaps, Wonka Pixy Stix, Bubble Gum Cigs, Candy Cigs, Apple Heads, Lemon Heads (small & large), Charms Blow Pops, Saf-T-Pops Lollipops, Sweetarts, Now & Laters Assorted Classic, Fun Gum Wax, Pop Rocks, Zotz Sour Fizz, Runts, Slo Pokes, Zours, Jolly Ranchers, Slap Stick, Grape Heads, Jaw Busters (small & large) and Tootsie Midgees. The only thing really missing from this basket is Big League Chew. According to the seller, some items may be substituted as they run out, but really, candy is candy, and there is enough in here for you and your friends, basically everything the kid in you still desires. And while the candy types may be 26 years old, the actual candy is fresh, sweet, and pure goodness just like you remember.<br /><br />Be warned however, there is enough sugar to make a rhino hyper and your dentist wealthy, so consume in moderation. You aren't 10 anymore. If you buy this for someone else, you will be highly tempted to devour the entire basket or slyly sneak out a few select choices.  There are several other sets in this product line, each with their own unique line-up, my favorite being the 70's box. Enjoy!
