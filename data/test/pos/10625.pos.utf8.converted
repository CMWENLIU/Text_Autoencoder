after $100.00 in smoke bombs and spring loaded spike traps, we gave up on the mole invasion. we called and exterminator who used these same traps. they didn't miss. he caught six in two days. we found these traps on-line and ordered two. about a month later we saw another mole tunnel. next day we had him. be very careful setting these traps, they are very powerful. by the way, the exterminator gets $50.00 a mole.
