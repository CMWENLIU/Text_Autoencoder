This honey really has healing properties.  I bought the honey for a friend who had open heart surgery months ago and had a dreadful raw looking scar.  The difference in just two weeks of using the honey covered with gauze as a wet dressing is just remarkable.  It's healing and her skin is returning to its normal color.
