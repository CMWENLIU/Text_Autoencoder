These little nuggets are very tasty and good to reach for instead of a candy bar.  They're not hard which I thought they might be since the morsels are small.  Instead they're soft and suitable for cereal topping, cookies, yogurt, etc. -- or just right out of the bag.  I like them better than raisins.
