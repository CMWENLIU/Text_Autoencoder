This has an excellent ginger tang, is chewable without either too much fiber or gumdrop stickiness.  The Amazon description mentions sulfur dioxide; I'm usually sensitive to that, but if it's actually in there I didn't notice it.  The 5-pounds came in one nonresealable bag; I simply transferred the slices to two zip bags for convenience in use and storage.
