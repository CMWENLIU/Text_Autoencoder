In an effort to eat more whole, healthy foods my husband and I have been trying new whole grains.  This one is such a winner!! It has an incredibly satisfying chew and cooks quite quickly (20 mins).  It is perfect for risotto or as an alternative to rice.  Great flavor and texture (and price!), I will order this again.
