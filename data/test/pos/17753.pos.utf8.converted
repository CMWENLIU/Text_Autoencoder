I hate instant oatmeal. I thought I hated ALL oatmeal until I tried Steel Cut. This has a great texture and is much healthier for you than that instant paste!<br /><br />When I make this I add a bit less water than most recipes call for. I make a big pot in my RICE COOKER which means I don't have to stir or watch a burner...so really no extra WORK than the instant.<br /><br />AND I make mine "instant" too! See, when I make a big pot (about 8 servings), I scoop out individual serving sizes into little Gladware containers. I add a little vanilla extract, half a packet of Splenda, a few apple slices, a few banana slices and....some dark chocolate chips. Then I freeze it! (Also nice because you don't have to have a fresh apple or banana on hand every time you want the oatmeal)<br /><br />When I go to work in the morning I grab one out of the freezer, zap in the microwave for about 3 minutes and voila! "Instant" oatmeal with great flavor, texture and toppings!!
