I ordered these 3 syrups after having a drink with Lavender Monin syrup that I enjoyed immensely.  The Peppermint is crisp the Pumpkin is like liquid pumpkin pie, mmm, and the the gingerbread is a lot like caramel.  There's no funny business going on in the ingredients, no high fructose corn syrup [&#8230;] or other fake sweeteners.  For anyone who likes flavored coffee, drinks (with or without alcohol) and sweet treats, these are a great gift idea to give to someone else or yourself.  Maybe they could pair it with a book of recipes : ).
