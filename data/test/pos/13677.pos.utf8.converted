My husband and I LOVE these San Marzano tomatoes.  NO, they are not from Italy...the cans I have actually looked at were grown in Canada from San Marzano seeds.  It is NOT "just" a regiuon in Italy, it is also a classification of tomato, like "Roma," or "Big Boy."<br /><br />They taste fantastic and fresh and un-fooled-around-with.  Just like from our garden, when the squirrels actually let us have some of our own tomatoes (rarely).  We search these out and will pay extra for them.  The taste dances on your tongue.  Use them as a sauce, no other ingreditnets necessary.<br /><br />These are the only canned tomatoes we eat in our house, and I grew up with Hunts (sugary) and Centano (salty) in my Italian-American home.
