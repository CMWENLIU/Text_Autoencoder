I purchased the package of two from Amazon, and found that the two containers were shrink-wrapped together in a way that made it unlikely that they would pick-up any odors or tastes from the warehouse or while in transit.<br /><br />I had purchased a different brand from a local health food store, and found that the taste of the two products is the same.  Very good taste, with no sort of aftertaste or significant difference from table sugar.<br /><br />The Emerald Forest Xylitol has large crystals compared to the other brand I'd purchased, which was pretty-much a powder.  It dissolves well in liquids, so it's better as larger crystals.  Xylitol dust is bad for your lungs when inhaled.<br /><br />Texture of what you bake with xylitol may differ from sugar, though you probably wouldn't notice any difference in drinks.  It cannot be used in baking products that use yeast to raise the dough.<br /><br />Xylitol is toxic to dogs, and it's probably best not to give it to any animal; though I did read there were studies as to whether it could be used to improve the health of cats and chickens by adding it to their water.  To learn more about Xylitol scan the web for "Xylitol MSDS" or "Xylitol Safety"
