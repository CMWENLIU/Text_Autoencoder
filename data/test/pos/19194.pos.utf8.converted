I wasted so much money when we discovered our son was allergic to wheat. I kept on buying the gluten free flour I managed to find in the store. Big waste of money. Then I posted on a board and a mother told me about Better Batter. The bad news is that this stuff is impossible to find in the store, the good news is that its worth a little extra hassle. I can't even tell the difference between regular flour and plan to give up on regular flour and use this for all my cooking and baking.
