Elderberry jam or jelly is never available in stores around here anymore so I decided to look on Amazon. I ordered this Suro jam and also Mrs. Miller's Homemade elderberry jelly.  In a taste test in front of an open window the Suro jam was superior for it's pure clean elderberry essence. I was surprised that, in comparing the two, an off flavor was apparent in the Mrs. Miller's jelly, which I would describe as musty or like there was honey mixed in.  I had not picked up on this when eating the jelly on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Of course I am comparing an expensive jam with a less expensive jelly.  On the down side the Suro jam was a little on the thin side and the numerous seeds are a potential problem for someone with diverticulosis.
