My 2 picky sugar loving boys love this chocolate stevia.  I have not tasted it for myself.  You do have to put a little liquid in the cup, mix it really well and then add the rest of your liquid.  This is a great substitue for chocolate milk and hot chocolate without all the sugar and artifical junk in it. We mix it with rice or hemp milk since they don't drink milk.  It really doesn't take as much as the package says- we use about 1/4 tsp. for 8 oz. and they are happy with that so a little container goes a long way.
