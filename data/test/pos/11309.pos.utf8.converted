A popular Japanese carbonated drink most often associated with the season of summer, though suitable for drinking all year round. Ramune carries a sense of nostalgia, and Shirakiku as well as other brands note this on their bottles with regards to the taste ("mukashi natsukashii aji").<br /><br />Reminiscent of citrus-hinted candy, the flavor of the drink itself is more along the light and neutral side of the sweetness spectrum, making it an ideal companion with almost any meal or snack as well as by itself.<br /><br />As with any Ramune bottle, the method opening and drinking is part of the experience. A marble traps the pressure inside the bottle, and popping it inside is required for opening the bottle. Inside, the marble stays in the top area while the indents on one side act as stoppers so that the marble does not block the flow of the drink. Drinking  Ramune properly involves keeping that marble away from the neck, which some people (for good reason) treat as a game of sorts.<br /><br />Refreshing however way you have it, and Shirakiku is a decent brand I purchase often (other brands of Ramune, such as the MiZuKi imports, also provide selections with a hint of other flavors such as lychee).
