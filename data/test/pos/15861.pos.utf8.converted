After reading the negative reviews I was a little hesistant to order this basket. There were many more positive reviews though and this basket had the best selection between sweets and "food food" for the price then any of the others I looked at. After talking with the friend I bought it for, she said there wasn't one item per box like one of the reviews I had read. She said the only thing that just had one was the bavarian pretzel but she said it's large, the size of the box it comes in. She really enjoyed it, all in all I would say this is a very nice basket.
