I've recently started eating the Ezekiel cereals and find them very satisfying. When eaten alone, it doesn't have much flavor. It's pretty obvious why.... There's no processing here. Without fruit, it's still satisfying with Vanilla Soy Milk. However, if eaten as pictured with Blue berries, the cereal really tastes good. You get a satisfying cereal with a good amount of fiber. I've been hearing a lot about sprouted grains and I'm not sure what it really means in the end, but this cereal is pure. Which is something I appreciate.
