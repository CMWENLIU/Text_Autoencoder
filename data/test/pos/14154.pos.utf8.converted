While Pesto Genovese is my favorite pesto for capelli d'angeli, my family and I love this pesto on crostini.  In fact, it's become a staple in our house and a regular at mealtimes.<p>Sun dried tomatoes tend to have more &quot;tang&quot; than other tomatoes and this pesto will certainly give your crostini added spiciness.  Don't get me wrong, you don't have to use this pesto on crostini alone.  That's just our favorite way of using it.  It would be great on pasta, too.<p>If you love tomatoes, especially sun dried tomatoes, I don't think you can go wrong with this pesto.  I recommend it highly.
