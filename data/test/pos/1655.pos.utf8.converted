I did not believe that there could be a zero calorie, soy free , gluten free noodle that actually tastes good. But I believe now thanks to Miracle Noodle. For those of you that have already made the switch from regular pasta to wheat pasta; your next switch will be to Miracle Noodles. I was amazed to find that unlike some pastas/noodles this product absorbs flavor and cooks quickly. I have prepared these in stir fries with such things as olive oil, pasta sauces, and chicken broth. All of my meals have come out great and the best part is that they leave you feeling full. The second best part is that you do not feel guilty later for having eaten a noodle. I have tried all of the Miracle Noodle products and am still deciding which one is my favorite. Obviously I am a big fan and think others will quickly become one too.
