With a rampant craze that spread faster and wider than the freaking cancer, energy drinks have become a common staple of the American caffeine junkie, instantly, from one day to the next. Strolling through obtuse grocery aisles my eyes are hardly at rest. Everyone has an energy drink brand: Monster, Rockstar, Elmo, Barbie, even that guy that guy Richard Grieco who used to come out on that show 21 Jump Street. Well not really, but there are plenty. And with so much variety, how could my daily caffeine intake get any better? Only when The Simpsons entered the market with DUFF.<br /><br />  A delicious orangey taste that mockingly counters the color palette of beer, the low stamina days become high stamina days and the Simpson's brand logo puts a blissfully dorky smile on my face.  The bubbly tonic is rightfully simple in taste, without the excessive extravagance of other energy drinks that make your teeth wonder when they might get brittle and break like the stumpy columns of ancient Greece (i.e. Arizona green tea energy drink).  Don't let a cartoon brand Energy Drink parody of beer fool you either. This liquid delivers with a steady caffeine peak, without a draining crash. It is a drink that delivers in the substance of product and exceedingly well in the d&eacute;cor of its package. Ay Caramba!
