There is something wonderfully addictive about farro and Roland's product is high quality and delicious.  I've loved farro since childhood (a much-loved, traditional grain in the region of Italy where my family is).  A simple bowl of farro cooked in a broth of garlic and pepperoncino with a drizzle of olive oil and dash of parmigiano on a cold winter's night, oh there is nothing more soothing and satisfying. Buon appetito!
