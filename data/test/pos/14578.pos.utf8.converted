This is really the only non-sulfured, organic, no-sugar-added pineapple I've been able to find. And, lucky for me, I love it. My husband and I eat it straight from the bag as a snack, and we also mix it into our trail mix. It has good flavor, and it's tender and easy to eat.<br /><br />However, this is nothing at all like the dried pineapple you can find in most grocery stores. The stuff in the grocery has sulfur to keep the color light and bright, and it has a bunch of sugar to keep the fruit plump and juicy (and oddly sticky). This stuff doesn't have any of that. It will be darker and tougher (and less sticky). This is very natural, as in full-on, granola-eating hippie kind of natural. And if you're OK with that...it's delicious.<br /><br />We've eaten our way through about 30 bags of this now. Some bags have better pieces than others. Some have good individual bites. Some have clumped up pineapple bits. But they all taste good, and we've never gotten anything that was the least bit questionable. We've tried many of the other Made in Nature dried fruits, as well, and we've been equally pleased with all of them.
