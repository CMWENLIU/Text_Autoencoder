I feel unworthy to even be reviewing this item, as it is so far beyond my comprehension, but I will do my best.<br /><br />Chester's Hot Fries are the most sacredly intensely brilliantly delicious thing that has ever been on this earth.<br /><br />I really don't understand why people invest in bonds and stocks, when Hot Fries are so obviously a better investment. They are, firstly,  incredibly cheap; A fair-sized bag fetches $.99, yet their yields are far more abundant than $.99 and they have instant maturity! They are like the Steinway and Sons of the chips world; They are undebatably the greatest product in their field. As such, no price, I mean no price would be high enough to encompass the brilliant ecstasy that these heavenly beings have to offer.<br /><br />I am at a lost to explain drug addiction, when the highest high you can get is clearly to be gotten from these incredible snacks. Not only that but these are cheaper too.<br /><br />I would give a million dollars for these chips. I would give my car, my house, my home, and my life, to maintain the existence of this monument of divinity.
