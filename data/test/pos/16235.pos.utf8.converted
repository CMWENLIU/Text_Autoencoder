I purchased two sets of the blooming jasmine and green flower teas as Christmas gifts.  The recipients were thrilled to have received such interesting presents.  Both of them raved over the uniqueness and fantastic tastes of the teas.  The only negative with these gifts is that it will be a little more difficult to purchase something these hard to buy for relatives will find as delightful this next Christmas!
