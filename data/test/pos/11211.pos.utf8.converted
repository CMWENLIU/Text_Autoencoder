I've purchased Grade B Maple Syrup before and it was good - but not anything like this brand! Heavy duty maple-y flavor - very thick consistency - a little goes a long way :-) I'm going to be very happy that I signed up for the auto-delivery every 3 months - will be using it on/in everything I can think of!
