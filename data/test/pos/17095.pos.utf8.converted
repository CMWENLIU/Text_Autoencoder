These are the BEST wasabi peas I have ever tried!  From gourmet grocers to other Asian brands, these are BY FAR the tastiest!  They are crunchy, fresh and hot!  And the "hot" is what makes them so addictive! The "hot" is from the wasabi (made from horseradish) so it's a different kind of hot, than say, tobasco or chilis.  If you're "carbing" this is not the snack for you; however, if you're on a low-fat diet (like me) or not dieting, this is the way to go! You'll love 'em!
