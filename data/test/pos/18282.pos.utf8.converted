I've been drinking this Bigelow green tea/chai blend about 6 months & it is my first choice every time I go to brew a cup of tea.  We also have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ51MG">Celestial Seasonings K-cups India Spice Chai, 8.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HWWKGW">Bigelow Tea English Breakfast K-Cup For Keurig Brewers, 24-Count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> but I go through the Bigelow green/chai blend faster than the other two combined.<br /><br />As for personal taste, I don't like plain green tea, but do like chai tea (w/ milk).  However, I like this blend even better than just a plain chai blend.  I drink this tea with 2% or skim milk & 1 packet of sugar.<br /><br />This tea blend hits the spot and is perfect for my afternoon tea cravings.  As a bonus, one brew fills the office with a nice spicy scent.<br /><br />Disclosure: This product just came available through Amazon today, so we made our purchases through other sites.
