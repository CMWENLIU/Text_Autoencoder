This kit has everything you need to make Okonomiyaki, except for the Mayonaise, bacon(optional), and sauce. Well, also obviously, you need to provide the wet ingredients and fresh ingredients, eggs, water, cabbage, etc.. One kit makes two servings, but if you order this, you get 3 kits. So you can make 6 servings with this particular order.<br /><br />I recommend getting the Kewpie Mayonaise and the Okonomi sauce. The sauce is availible from this merchant. You can get Kewpie at your local asian food market, or here on Amazon.<br /><br />The kit comes with the nori flakes and bonito flakes, you will use to garnish your Okonomiyaki after it is done.<br /><br />There are instructions inside, not using our measuring system, but you have the internet, I'm sure you can figure it out for yourself.
