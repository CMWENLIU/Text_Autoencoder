Maybe it's easier to mix because I only do a glass at a time, but it really isn't difficult. I just stir it briskly with a spoon, smoosh a couple lumps, and it's good to go on my cereal. So don't be put off by that because this makes the name-brand stuff seem tasteless. It's much creamier, smells like real milk, and a bargain at that price.  I'll be buying it again.
