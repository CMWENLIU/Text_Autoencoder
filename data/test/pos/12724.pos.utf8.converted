It's really difficult to find this wonderful syrup!<br /><br />We needed Maraschino Cherry juice for a Christmas beverage recipe but it was impossible to find it bottled in either Liquor or Grocery stores.  I finally stumbled upon this Reese Maraschino Cherry Syrup when we were visiting Minnesota (at Target --- near the ice-cream syrups). I was very excited to find this available from an Amazon Marketplace Seller.<br /><br />One of the great things about this glass-bottled syrup is that it contains NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP!<br /><br />Ingredients: sugar, water, citric acid, natural flavor, sodium benzoate (preservative), artificial color (red #40).  Distributed by : World Finer Foods, Inc, Bloomfield, NJ 07003<br /><br />Fyi: the Christmas beverage is a 2007 Southern Living recipe: "Jingle Juice"<br />Wow! It really puts you in the Christmas spirit; but be careful, it can catch up with you quickly!
