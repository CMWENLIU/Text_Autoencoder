Mauna Loa Dry Roasted Macadamias with Sea Salt<br />You can't find these in most places so discovering them at Amazon was a stroke of luck. Costco used to carry them and now do not which forced me to look elsewhere.  These are the most flavorful and salted with sea salt for a special treat.  The secret is they are authentic Hawaiian.No other macadamias taste like these!!!
