I had purchased Eden's umeboshi because I'd long heard of its positive health benefits. I suffer from chronic heartburn, so I thought maybe these would help. Odd that something that initially tastes like pouring salt into your mouth could somehow benefit digestion, but it does actually help a bit. Don't get me wrong, I'm not advocating that you discard your heartburn/antacid pills...but my stomach does seem to settle after eating one of these plums. The packaging is excellent, as always, and both packs arrived with not a spill in sight. I believe Eden did change its policy on the number of plums per package though, as I had quite a few in each pack...I'd say more than 20 per carton for sure. On top was a little wad of shiso leaves, which gave it a lot of visual appeal. The plums were moist but not lying in a lot of juice, which I liked b/c I'd had plums packed in the pickling juices, and they were extremely mushy and fell apart. These had a nice and firm skin, though you could tell the insides were a paste-like texture from the feel of them. Initially, you really can't taste anything other than the salt. Very, very salty...which is proper for this type of food. However, after a few days, I noticed the actual taste of the umeboshi and shiso. Those first few I pitted by hand and choked down as quickly as possible, but now I find myself leisurely sucking on the plum and savoring the flavors before extruding the pits. I don't eat more than one a day because of the salt content, and I don't really like it on rice, but it tastes fantastic on its own and is truly great on corn on the cob. Squeeze a little out and rub on the corn, and it gives it a sweet/sour taste that's a low cal substitute for the slathering of butter I previously used. As soon as this last pack is done, I definitely plan on buying more.
