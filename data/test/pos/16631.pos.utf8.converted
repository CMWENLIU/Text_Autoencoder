I bought these alongside another seaweed snack from Amazon (Sea's Gift Korean Seaweed Snack, Roasted & Sea Salted) and definitely prefer this variety.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that this Annie Chun's Seaweed Snack is quite salty but it is perfect for my tastes.  If you want a noticeable salt flavor, choose this snack.  Sea's Gift tastes bland in comparison.  I feel like the sheets in this snack are also a bit crispier than the Sea's Gift variety.<br /><br />I also prefer the larger packs the Annie Chun's variety come in compared to the Sea's Gift as I inevitably end up eating 2 of the Sea's Gift to feel satisfied with the size of my snack.<br /><br />Pros vs. Sea's Gift:<br />* More salt!<br />* Crispier/Crunchier<br />* More per pack<br /><br />Cons vs. Sea's Gift:<br />* ...none
