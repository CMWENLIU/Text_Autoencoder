I originally bought one package in a local store to try and immediately fell in love with them; they are so yummy!  Amazon has them at a great price too.  For anyone who enjoys sushi, or a salty snack without all the bad stuff that's in chips, these are awesome.  The seaweed taste is nicely enhanced by the sea salt.  And each package has only 60 calories.  They won't fill you up by any means, but when you have a craving for something salty, this fits the bill.  My only complaint is I wish they came in larger packages.
