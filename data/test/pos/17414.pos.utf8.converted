When my daughter was starting to eat snack foods, I got a pack of these for her to try - she loved them and so did I. Since then, this is a staple in our snack list & since it has such wonderful nutritional numbers, it makes for guilt free snacking :)<br /><br />I have introduced these to several of my friends & they all have loved it ( my brother-in-law finished almost an entire bag in one sitting!)<br /><br />It does get tasteless if it isn't fresh (soggy) ie. if the bag wasn't airtight, so you should check the bag before you buy these.<br /><br />In all, I highly recommend that you give it a try.
