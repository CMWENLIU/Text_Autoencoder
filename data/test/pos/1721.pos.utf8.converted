This is my new favorite flavor in The Simply Bar! The peanut butter is very subtle but makes for a nice balance between the PB and Cocoa flavors.  I find it hard to control myself and only eat one of these, and my husband is going through them like they're candy!<br /><br />If you haven't tried The Simply Bar (in any flavor) yet, you MUST try it. You'll be hooked!  These bars are low in calories and fat but high in protein. The other bonus is that they are milk and gluten-free, if you happen to have food sensitivities like I do. My other protein bars are so high in calories that I can only eat 1/2 of the bar at a time, but with these, I get the whole bar without the guilt! Plus, The Simply Bar gives me twice as much protein than my other protein bars. The other thing that I like is the fact that the ingredients list isn't a mile long with stuff that I don't even recognize. These are made with very few ingredients, all healthy.<br /><br />Enjoy!
