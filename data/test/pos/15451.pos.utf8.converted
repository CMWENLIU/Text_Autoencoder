I bake quite a bit. I make pizzas, breads, etc usually at least once a week.<br /><br />I have found this brand of yeast to work well. The granules are tiny.<br /><br />Yes, you can get bulk yeast a bit cheaper in some discount stores, and in groceries, but this is for sure worth it at the price.<br /><br />Just not having to run around the kitchen looking for little packets of yeast, or having to cut them open, try to pour into your measuring spoon, etc. I divide the yeast up to about 2 to 4 zip locks and stick them in the fridge. I keep one handy to use, all I have to do is open it up, stick in the measuring spoon, and close it back up. Easy. And you never have to worry about running out.<br /><br />You can save TONS of money making your own breads and pizzas, and it is fun, too. And almost always tastes better.
