Hemp is head and shoulders above all other protein sources, and I have tried them all!  This is a great protein concentrate... I drink a shake with it every morning... mixes easily... taste is fairly bland, leaning toward nutty.  More expensive than others, but a better source of protein and higher concentration. I did hours of research before choosing this product, and I definitely recommend it!
