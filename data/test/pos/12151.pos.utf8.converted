Absolutely! It is by far the nicest tasting granola I have ever had. It is not the same texture as most granola. It isn't extremely hard and crunchy. It is a bit softer in texture, but this doesn't mean that it sops up milk like a sponge if you choose to eat it more like a cereal. It remains the same lovely texture, not too hard, and definitely not mushy.<br /><br />As for its flavour, it's a bit nutty tasting. The cranberries in it are a splendid bit of tart-sweetness, and the sunflower seeds are gorgeous as well. I generally mix a bit of Bear Naked Peak Protein All Natural Granola in with my Crispix. It's a scrummy touch to the Crispix, and makes the 12 ounce bag of Bear Naked Peak Protein All Natural Granola last a lot longer. (I tend to have this for breakfast and at least one snack a day.)<br /><br />I give Bear Naked Peak Protein All Natural Granola five stars for its taste, texture, and nutrition.
