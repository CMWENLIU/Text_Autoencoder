I read a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307460169">cookbook</a> recently where the author, in addition to giving recipes, interviewed famous and influential chefs of all sorts.  One of the questions that the chefs were asked was "What do you eat when no one is watching?"  In other words, what is your guilty pleasure that might not jive with your being a renowned chef.  The answers were honest and amusing.  Although I am only a foodie and not a chef, if I were asked that question my answer would be "Hormel Corned Beef Hash."<br /><br />Fist, let me be honest about what this is: this is not something that you would want to eat very often if you were worried about fat or sodium content; the potatoes are dehydrated; and the corned beef tastes a little like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025UCGKK">potted meat</a>.  Still, it is a real comfort food for me and I love it.<br /><br />I almost always add some freshly diced onions or shallots.  I also add either diced bell pepper or minced Serrano.  I put in it a hot skillet over medium heat and let it cook until crispy.  I flip it and while the other side is cooking I cook an egg or two in a separate skillet and place them, sunny side up, on top of the hash.  I like to finish it off with a generous dose of hot sauce.<br /><br />I buy this large size when I have guests (I have to admit that not all of my friends or family share my love for this product.)  I also purchase the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004S04X4W">15-Ounce</a> and also the 7.5 oz can when it's just for me (and when I'm not having it for my main meal.)  This is something that I always have on hand (I just hide it from my judgmental foodie friends.)  :-)
