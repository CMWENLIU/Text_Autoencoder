I've never used TVP before this, so I wasn't sure quite what to expect when I purchased this product. So far I've used one whole bag and I couldn't be happier with it. My whole family enjoys eating the food I've made with TVP instead of ground beef, and so far I haven't noticed any stomach issues in anyone, even the baby. (And though I was a little unnerved by another reviewer's comment on the smell, I didn't really notice anything more than a subtle grain scent when I put my nose in the bag.)<br /><br />The first thing I did with my TVP was to take the liquid left from making a pot roast in my crockpot, skim away most of the fat, and use the liquid to rehydrate the TVP. It made a really delicious meatloaf-tasting crumble that we ate in sandwiches with ketchup. A few days later, I made a homemade spaghetti sauce with TVP simmered right in, and that turned out great too. I did notice that the TVP made the recipe just a little sweeter than it would've been, but I compensated with extra spices. I would leave the sugar out of the sauce recipe next time I make it with TVP. And last night, I rehydrated the last cup of TVP in the bag with water I'd mixed a packet of taco seasoning into. It made a very serviceable taco meat substitute for beefy taco macaroni and cheese.<br /><br />Just from my one bag, one quarter of my order, I got three meals for my family, which works out to less than seventy-five cents of TVP per meal. I don't know that I'll ever try to actually make a hamburger with this, but I just love it for any recipe calling for ground beef. Instead of defrosting and cooking a pound of beef, rehydrating a cup of TVP is fast and simple. I will definitely buy this again.
