i love drinking honey water with some lemon slices every morning for detox and energy. I have tried a lot of different honey and i love the taste of this brand. I dont get the mediciney taste that people in here say do...i feel like it helps with my allergies that i use to have and sometimes i would put in on my face as masks and its moisturizing effect is so good!! The only thing i dont like abut is the plastic bottle. other than that. this is great for your taste buds and your health!
