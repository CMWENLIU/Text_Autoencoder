I saw an article on MSNBC regarding a taste test on a large number of brewed and instant coffee's- ranging from standard brands to exotic restaurant blends.  This coffee came out on top, even beating brewed coffee's.  Thought I would give a try and found them on Amazon here- this 4 jar package.  I am on my 3rd order!  Not only do I love this coffee, I ended up giving several as gifts, and everyone so far loves the stuff.  Highly recommend!
