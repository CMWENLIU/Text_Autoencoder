Excellent product. Makes equally good thin or pan pizza crust. Also good for breadsticks. Betty's Tips on the back of the package will tell you how to make a basic pizza for best results. I put a little garlic basil olive oil on the crust before the sauce. I use generic spaghetti sauce already seasoned with italian herbs and spice.(Cheaper and less salty than so called "pizza sauce") Buy shredded mozzarella or 5 italian cheese blend.(Save even more money and buy the cheese on sale during a buy one get one free promo.) And viola! Pizza in less than a hour and less than five bucks. Compare that to 15-20 dollars for a specialty 5 cheese pizza from those other guys and you have money for your piggy bank. I love this product. I have made 3 pizzas so far...no soggy crust. So that must be a pilot error and not Betty Crocker's fault.(lol)
