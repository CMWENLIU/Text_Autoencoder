I am so glad Kraft makes organic mac & cheese!<br />Tastes just like their regular mac & cheese.<br /><br />A welcoming aspect for those going or gone organic!<br />Especially since most healthy foods are lacking in taste.<br /><br />A delicious side dish or even as the main dish.<br />An excellent source of protein!<br /><br />Being organic it is healthier for you,<br />Without processing & chemicals.<br /><br />Toss in some chicken or tuna for variety.<br />Excellent for kids of all ages!
