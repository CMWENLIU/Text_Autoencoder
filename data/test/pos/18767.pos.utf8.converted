This is a great product.  It's not as finicky as arrowroot powder which if heated too long will not thicken. I made the recipe on the back with some additional changes and it was fabulous!! My kids loved it and it's a great substitute for the very unhealthy cans of cherry pie filling on the store shelfs.<br />Here's what's on the back:<br />QUICK APPLE CHERRY PUDDING (I call my new reciipe "Cherry Pie Filling"- used for cobbler)<br />4 C EDEN organic apple cherry juice (I used Santacruz unpast. OG apple juice)<br />(I also added 1 1/2 Tbl of Dynamic Health Black Cherry Juice Concentrate)<br />4 Tbl EDEN Kuzu dissolved in 5 Tbl cold water<br />Place all in a saucepan, bring to a boil, and stir constatnly until thick.<br />Kuzu is also good for sothing the stomach and strengthening the intestines. this would be a great thing to give your child if he's suffering from a tummy ache.
