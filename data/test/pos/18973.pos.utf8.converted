I love this product It is a great moisturizer for my hair as well as my skin. The smell is subtle but pleasing. I leave it in my hair overnight and it easily washes out in the morning. It also keeps my skin soft. It works very well for dry cracked heels. I just bought 2 more jars. I have not cooked with it!
