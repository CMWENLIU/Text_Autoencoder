This is a great protein powder and I only use half the recommended portion. I drink it in the morning with  unsweetened almond milk and 1/2 banana in the blender and it keeps me going until mid day, then I drink a glass of water and I'm full all day. Its got a nice chocolate flavor, although I add 1/4 tsp of cocoa powder if I want it stronger. I love this product and the price on Amazon.
