Since I'm constantly trying to get enough protein (it's recommended one has at least one gram of protein per pound of body weight), finding a good breakfast cereal has been an issue for quite some time.  If I'm limiting my caloric intake, making certain that such a large proportion of that intake is from protein is very difficult.<br /><br />So many cereals deemed "healthy" aren't as healthy as they would have you believe.  My husband, for instance, bought some Smart Start cereals, but if you look at that label, it's clear that the cereals just aren't that good for you.  That one has over 200 calories per serving, almost 20g of sugar per serving, and only 5g of fiber.  Of course it tastes good. So does Frosted Flakes!<br /><br />Kellogg's Special K Protein Plus, on the other hand, is actually GOOD for you.  Don't be fooled by the plain Special K cereals-- they are missing the protein they need to make those cereals balanced meals.  This cereal, though, has it all. INCLUDING TASTE!<br /><br />Only 100 calories per serving, 5g fiber (proportionately better than the aforementioned cereal), ONLY 2g sugar, and-- here's the kicker-- 10g of protein!  And, that's what I'm always looking for in the foods I choose-- at least a gram of protein per 10 calories.<br /><br />And, what is really surprising is that this cereal is delicious.  I like cereal with flavor, and this has it. The texture is crispy, but nicely soggy in my skim milk, and there's a hint of nuttiness to it.  Additionally, it's sweetened slightly.  Sometimes, though, I sprinkle a packet of Equal on it if I am really craving something sweet.  Either way, it's very very good!<br /><br />Kellogg's Special K Protein Plus is perfect for breakfast and it's perfect for an evening snack.  It's great any time of the day.  Finding a low cal, low sugar, high protein cereal that is moderately low in carbs was impossible before this came on the market.  I can't praise this highly enough!
