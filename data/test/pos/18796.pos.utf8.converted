this cheese, made primarily from sunflower seeds and macadamia nuts, is absolutely delish! sprinkle it on your salad with a little lemon juice and a drizzle of your favorite oil and you're all set! you can also eat it straight out of the bag like I did when I first tasted it. when you do, forget about the calories! my only complaint again is the price--everything raw (and generally organic) is sooooooooooo expensive. anyway, if you're looking for a splurge, you won't be disappointed with this one. Bon apetit!
