I've been buying this juice concentrate for months now (at the supermarket) and I love it. The price here is a little more than what I would pay at the grocery store, so I've decided to keep buying it this way. I just had to say something about the poorly-researched negative comments here.<br /><br />Pasteurization is not "nuking". It has nothing to do with radiation; it's just a heating process. The juice is heated before being sealed in the can to kill any microbes that may be present. Many food items that can be stored at room temperature before opening have been pasteurized.<br /><br />Since you add your own water to this concentrate, the quality of your water determines the quality of the juice. If you have heavy water or a detectable amount of chlorination (like in city water), it's probably not a great idea to make juice mix with it. It isn't going to taste right.<br /><br />Additionally, since you mix it yourself, you determine the concentration (sweetness) of the juice. I typically dilute the juice to 64oz of water instead of the recommended 48oz. For one of the other two flavors, there's a one-star review that complains about the sweetness level of this concentrate. I cannot begin to describe how wrong this is. Maybe the reviewer drank the concentrate directly out of the can.
