Yorkshire Gold Tea is flavorful and rich - never, ever bitter, no matter how long you steep the tea.  It's great with milk and sweetener if you drink it English style.  Each tea bag is large and makes 16 ounces of tea with no reduction in flavor.  I was very grateful that Amazon carries this product - especially in a pack of 5 - because sometimes it's hard to find in the grocery stores.
