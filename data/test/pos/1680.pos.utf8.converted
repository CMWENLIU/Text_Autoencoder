I was ordering Native Forest Coconut Milk from Amazon quite frequently. It was the most delectable coconut milk I could find anywhere. The five star reviews were spot on. Loved it!<br /><br />Then all the sudden I started receiving a completely different product in a can with the same label. It seemed like very, VERY watered down coconut milk with coconut oil added to it. The result was a liquid with oil solids (translucent like coconut oil) throughout. It didn't matter how much I shook the can (or heated the unopened can in hot water before shaking) it was a disgusting, unusable, oily slop! If I refrigerated an open can the oil would rise to the top and form a solid top layer. I've never seen any other brand of coconut milk do this.<br /><br />The cans do say "Product of SRI LANKA" in spite of the Amazon listing stating it is from Thailand. I suspect this it the reason for the poor quality. I would bet that the cans that have labels stating it was from Thailand are the real Native Forest Coconut Milk and the Sri Lanka cans are some sort of evil Doppelg&auml;nger!<br /><br />UPDATE 3/15/2012<br />Due to new reviews I decided to give the product a try once again. Looks like Amazon or Native Forest has addressed the issue of the inferior product from Sri Lanka. I have recieved several 12 packs and all have been from Thailand, all have been super creamy and delicious. Thank goodness. I love this product.<br /><br />Also wanted to thank Amazon who always refunded my money when I complained about the Sri Lankan slop.
