They're mentioned in German Medieval sources before 1200 CE and archaeological evidence suggests that wheat noodles have been a staple of Schwabian cuisine for at least 4000 years. I'm fairly convinced this is true, since most of the packaged Spaeztle I've bought in the USA taste roughly that old. The etymology of the name is obscure, but most Schwabian housewives declare that it's derived from Schwalbe, the German name for the bird swallow. Or perhaps it's the Schwabians who are derived from Schwalben because their dialect sounds like twittering. Not a single housewife of my acquaintance has been able to suggest what the connection might be, leaving me free to speculate about the possibility that Marco Polo carried a bag of Spaetzle with him on his travels to the Khanate, where his attempts to translate the German into Chinese via Italian gave the Khan's chefs the idea of making bird's nest soup, the birds in question being swallows. However, there's also the strong possibility that all Schwabians are genetically Chinese, since their profile of frequency of blood types A and B exactly matches that of certain districts of Shanghai, which would certainly demonstrate that Marco Polo never actually traveled to China but instead heard tales of the place from various German Dudelsack players who were imprisoned with him in Genoa for disturbing the peace.<br /><br />In any case, Spaetzle are basically gnarly little egg noodles, usually served with meat dishes having rich gravies, when other cuisines might offer rice or pureed vegetables. Of course they're far better home made, but this brand is more than tolerable. There's a description of how Spaetzle are made on wikipedia, written in astounding detail, and you'll find recipes for appropriate saucy dishes on-line or in any German cookbook.<br /><br />K&ouml;stlich!
