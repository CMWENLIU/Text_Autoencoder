These dates are wonderful!  They are moist on the inside and deliciously sweet/complex/creamy/caramelly in flavor. I've bought dates in the past that have a "papery" outer layer that is unpleasant; these do not have that issue.  These are NOT the dates you find in the baking section of your grocery store - nothing wrong with those for baking, but these are much better & good for snacking or eating as they are.<br /><br />I like these for dessert.  I have a 1/2 Cup of plain Greek yogurt (Fage 2% is my favorite) & 1 or 2 of these dates.  My sweet tooth is completely satisfied by the dates and the yogurt is like eating pudding; delicious and healthy.  Also great as an appetizer: just make a slit in the date, take the pit out & put in goat cheese, blue cheese, mascarpone or any creamy cheese.  Warm them under the broiler for about 3 minutes or skip the broiler & eat at room temp.  Or go all out & wrap bacon or prosciutto around the stuffed date & broil for about 4-5 minutes, turning them after about 3 minutes.  The combination of salty and sweet is delicious.<br /><br />The package has the "Packed Date" and the "Best By Date" on the back.  I received my dates on 5/22/10....they were packed on 3/15/10 and will be best by 9/15/10.<br /><br />I have not found it necessary to store the dates in the refrigerator and I prefer to eat them at room temperature.  I just store them in an airtight container in the cupboard after opening the package; of course they aren't lasting long in my house!<br /><br />The plastic container is recyclable:  1 PETE<br /><br />UPDATE 10/2010:  I've now ordered these dates 3 times.  This last time, I noticed the dates are not as nice as the first 2 times...not bad, just not fabulous.  They are a bit more papery skinned & there are dry "lines"/patches on some.  Also, the packer has stopped putting "Packed On" dates on the packaging.  Now there is just a "Best By" date.  I prefer the old way because then I know how old they are when I get them.  The inside of the date is still very good, creamy, delicious.  Perhaps these dates are older?  Or maybe weather conditions have been poor for the grower?  These are an agriculture product grown organically so weather can be an issue.  I'll order another batch when I finish these & let you know how they are.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/2011:  I ordered again & this batch was similar to the previous (10/2010) batch - several (maybe 25%) dates in each package with papery skins & dry line/patches.  However, I still enjoy these eating dates.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/2011:  I decided to order the non organic version of these dates to see how they compare & maybe save a couple bucks.  I concluded that the organic version is superior but the non organic is good too.  FYI/ I reviewed them on their page:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NWIQQI">United With Earth Medjool Dates, 16-Ounce Containers (Pack of 4)</a>
