I have no negative comments about this product. It far exceeded my expectations and there is no better price either at any other site. I became interested in the Cacao nibs after reading the rave reviews and the health benefits( full of minerals and antioxidants) of the raw, organic bean at various raw food lifestyle sites. Although I am not 100% raw, I am trying to exchange as many foods as I can. These nibs are crunchy--but not rock hard crunchy. Do not look to compare this to processed, cooked chocolate that is full of sugar. These nibs are not "candy" but a healthy food. Dipped in a little agave syrup( a honeylike , low glycemic index, organic sweetener that is delicious) or honey, one would have a candy like snack. Since they are not a processed food full of sugar, they are more bitter than chocolate  but they are not by any means too terribly bitter to enjoy. I thought they were wonderful with a small amount of agave syrup. I will use them in cereal and smoothies next. More people will for sure enjoy these than not.
