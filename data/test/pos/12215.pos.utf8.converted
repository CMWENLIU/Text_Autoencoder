Whisk together one cup of warm water (90-100 degrees F), 1 teaspoon of yeast, 1 1/2 cups of this flour and a dollop of olive oil.  Turn your oven on for a few minutes, pour the batter into an oiled skillet and let it rise in the warmed oven for an hour.  Bake just the crust at 375 for 10 minutes.  Then spread the cheese or other toppings on the crust and return to the oven until the cheese is bubbly and browning.  Serve the pizza and pass the tomato sauce!  (Don't bake the pizza with tomato sauce - the crust can't keep liquid from penetrating - that's gluten's job.
