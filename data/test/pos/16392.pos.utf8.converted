First time buyer from this supplier.  Product was delivered on time and in great shape.  I love to cook vegetables with sesame oil and garlic but could only find small, expensive bottles at the grocer.  I now have plenty of oil and extra money in my wallet.  The can has a built-in spout for easy pouring with a handy snap on-off cap.  I also fill a squeeze bottle to set on the table for use as a spice.
