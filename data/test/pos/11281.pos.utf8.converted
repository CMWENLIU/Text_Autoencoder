I was using Bob's Red Mill ground flax seed before now and personally do not see any difference since I started using Hodgson Mill, though I just saw a couple of reviews saying Bob's was coarser and tasted better. I have not detected any difference.<br /><br />I like that it comes as a sealed bag in a in a box as it is easier to store (I keep it in my freezer after opening to maintain freshness and avoid it going rancid etc. though the fridge is probably just as good).<br /><br />I add flax seed to my cereal - usually oatmeal, but more recently have been adding a couple of tablespoons to the junky cereals my kids use. I have also added it to applesauce and have added it to bread and pizza dough too.  When I was making waffles once I added some blueberries and some flax seed meal and they were great.
