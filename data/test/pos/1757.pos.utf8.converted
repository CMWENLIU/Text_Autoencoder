Being that I am a vegetarian I was having a hard time feeding my dogs Blue Buffalo Chicken kibble. I just could not do it anymore from a moral and ethical standpoint so I started to research 'Vegetarian Dogs' like crazy. Came to find out most dogs who convert to a vegetarian diet thrive on it and I can honestly say this is true. My dogs are ages 2ish,7 and 11ish, all adopted, all Chihuahuas and all came with their own issues. The one thing we all agree on is that Natural Balance Vegetarian Formula is the best. My oldest dog has seriously just thrived off this food, she is so energetic and happy. My other 2 love it and their coats look so shiny and their nasty dog breath has gone away.<br />I know my decision was one that many people will criticize and say is 'selfish' and 'wrong' but the bottom line is I did my research, spoke with the people at Natural Balance, told my vet and in the process found out that the worlds oldest living dog was/is 26 and is a vegetarian. So needless to say, I don't think dogs not eating meat is as big of a deal as we would like to think it is. This dog food has changed my life, my dogs lives and the lives of many other vegans I have met who were against getting a dog because they could not find an ethical dog food.<br />Natural Balance I cannot Thank You enough!!!
