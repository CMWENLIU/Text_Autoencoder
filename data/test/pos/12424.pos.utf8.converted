I wondered how this would taste before ordering.  I enjoy spicy foods, and peanut butter why not?  I really didn't want to get stuck with 6 jars of a peanut butter I did not like!  I gambled and went for it just based on the possibility of how good it could taste.  I actually made a good gamble for once.  This peanut butter is awesome!  It tastes good on crackers, in PB&J sandwiches, and PB & Cheese sandwiches. (I would have never tried the cheese part if a friend didn't make one when I let him use my PB and he had a pleasant look of delight on his face after his first bite) I'm sure the possibilities of what to eat this on, or cook it in are endless.<br />The heat to it is just right.  The oil tends to separate if it sits for a few days without being stirred.  However, this is not a problem, it stirs up very easy and your ready to go.  If you like it hotter you can stir it less and leave more of the oil on top.
