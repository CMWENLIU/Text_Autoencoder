After a recent trip to Thailand, I got hooked on coconut water. We'd buy several coconuts a day from the street vendors and drink the water straight from the coconut. After coming home I tried about all the brands out there. None of them even compared to Taste Nirvana. This was by far the best, and closest tasting one to actual coconut water from Thai coconuts. A sweeter and nuttier flavor than the other brands. I have a hard time drinking any other brand now, after tasting this. I'm hooked!
