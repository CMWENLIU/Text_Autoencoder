I bought this bacon tray because it had a vented lid. And what a difference that makes.<br />I used no paper towels. All the grease drained onto the tray because the bacon is held on a grid raised above the bottom.  It did a great job, the best microwave bacon I ever had. I found that 3 minutes 15 sec was right for a full tray<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049WV8S8">Joie Piggy Bacon Tray</a>. No spatters in the oven, the clean up was a breeze. The little pink pig handle is really cute.  And then...you will want to get the cute little pink pig hot grip to match, because the tray does get hot.
