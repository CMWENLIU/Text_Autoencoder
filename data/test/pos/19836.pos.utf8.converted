After years of dealing with increasing price of soda, finding place to store it and returning  empty bottles decided to give this a try. We bought ours at Costco which came with 1-130L Co2 Carbonator, 2 1-Liter Stainless Steel Bottles and trial flavors pack for $99. First let me say I'm very pleased, the flavors are not bad at all and i can use my own filtered water from either the fridge or Pure faucet attachment and no longer need to pay or bring back bottles for the deposit. They also have much less sodium than store bought soda with the exception of Diet Rite.<br /><br /> I have tried many diet flavors and the ones i like the best are Orange, Caffeine free cola, dr pete, Fountain Mist, Cream Soda and Root Beer. As for the cost it has changed everything, no longer have to pay deposit, return empties or search for sale price on soda which means lot less trips to the store saving me from impulse buying and gasoline usage. I can now make fresh bottles of soda whenever I need it (unlike store bought soda which can lose carbonation)  and any flavor I feel like at the time. Already used up  1- 130L Co2  carbonator bottle so ordered 1 full bottle + 1 exchange for empty bottle from SodaStream web site this way I'll always have one full bottle when one is done. You should always search the web for coupons for any online store before ordering and SodaStream is no exception, saved $15 which is the price of the license on a new bottle.  So it cost me the same as if ordering to exchange 130L Co2 Carbonators, pretty sweet. If you order 10 bottles of syrup at a time you get one free  and with on line coupons and cashing in points your earn from them with every purchase can save you more than just the shipping cost, the cost of a trip to the store. For me the SodaStream is well worth the cost.
