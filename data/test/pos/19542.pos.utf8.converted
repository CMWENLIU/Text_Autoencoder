When in Boulder this summer I took a tour of the Celestial Seasonings factory.  Kind of boring.  Except for the enclosed room where they keep the various mint herbs.  It will clear your sinuses!  But I digress.  You do get to sample any tea they have and that is worth the trip.<br /><br />In any case, I love this tea.  I have always enjoyed the iced tea they serve at Thai restaurants.  Not the full version with the sweetened cream.  Just straight.  To me, this is very close.  I kind of wish it was caffeinated, but its nice to have something to drink at night.<br /><br />Coconut flavor?  If I had drank it not knowing what it was, I'm not sure I'd be able to identify such a flavor.  But something about this tea does have a very unique flavor, which I like.  And it is also absent vanilla, a flavor I dislike in teas.<br /><br />I drink it iced.  I have gone thru 6 boxes in a couple of months and re-ordered early via Amazon's subscription service and am pleased.
