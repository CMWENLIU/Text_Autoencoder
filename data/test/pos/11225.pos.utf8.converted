This is the best-tasting spaghetti sauce I have ever found.  I enjoy it enough to just eat with a spoon - no kidding - but it's perfect for serving over pasta, which tones down the intensity to better fit most people's taste. Lots of olives and capers - not for the unadventurous.<br />No broken-seal issues with the box I just received, maybe they are better packaged than before ?<br />The only problem is, now that I have fallen in love with this flavorful sauce, how will I be able to put up with the ordinary kind ever again !
