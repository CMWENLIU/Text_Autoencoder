The subject says it all. I guess less than 1% of all cheese lovers will like it but, luckily, I am one of those.<br /><br />Basically, it's Limburger, but then there are probably hundreds of versions of Limburger. Wouldn't that be fun to be able to compare all of them?<br /><br />I ordered this directly from wisconsincheesemart and shipping was much less. I have the 2.75 lbs version.
