My 10 year old son saw the cooking channel and they used a ghost chilie which is to be the hottest pepper in the world. I tried finding it in several grocery chains in San Antonio to no avail. I then found this kit available for sale on Amazon and ordered it right away.  It arrived within days and made for a great gift. He has followed the easy instructions and it has begun to grow. We are so delighted to see it's progress and I'm am happy it was availabe to purchase as it also helps to spark the interist of a child. Better this than anything video game related. Hery happy about this product.
