Many vocal critics of illy coffee have never actually tasted it. As Dr. House says, everybody lies and illy is apparently a very popular thing to lie about. I've caught several vocal critics lying about illy (by serving it to them, getting the typical "This is fabulous!" reaction, then telling them what they're drinking. You know, the Folger's Coffee Crystals technique).<br /><br />Why is this?<br /><br />Well, on the surface illy does appear to be frivolous and therefore an easy target.<br /><br />- It's very expensive, especially for coffee that comes in a can<br />- It's got a very fussy, very European marketing envelope around it<br />- It tends to be sold in fussy, trendy stores<br />- Because it's roasted and packaged in Italy, it is always several months old when you buy it<br />- Did I mention that it's very expensive?<br /><br />As a result, it's easy to dismiss illy as an elitist, "image" product that can't possibly be worth what it costs. And it's easy to convince others of the same thing, whether you've actually tried illy or not.<br /><br />The truth is illy is really superb coffee, just about the best I've ever tried. Since I've started drinking it at home, I've found I'm actually drinking much less coffee overall, because I only know a couple of places that serve illy locally and I just don't feel like bothering with anything else, at least most of the time. The ironic net effect of this is that illy may actually be saving me some money!<br /><br />I don't know if illy will be worth what it costs to you. There are some very good coffee beans sold by Costco for roughly 1/5 the price, much better than anything you can get at Starbucks or Peets. (In fact, if Starbucks or Peets is your idea of really good coffee, stop reading this now. Not because I think you're some tasteless boob, but because those brands are in the very modern, very successful mode of bitter, over-roasted, burned-tasting American coffee and I don't personally care for that. So if you like those brands, you're probably not going to like illy or any coffee that I like. Personally, I like the bottomless cup of Peerless my favorite diner serves much better than Starbucks.)<br /><br />What I do know is that if you like coffee enough to own a decent grinder and other caffeine paraphernalia, you really ought to try illy. In particular, if you like light-medium roasts but find most are just too wimpy, you may just love this stuff.<br /><br />If not, you'll at least have a cute, fussy  little can you can sub-divide some of your Costco walnuts into. And that is something.
