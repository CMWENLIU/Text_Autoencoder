This is a great Couscous.<br />Its precooked so it hardly takes any time to prepare.<br />Just take it in a Bowl...Pour Hot water..and a few drops of oil...and cover and leave it for 5 mins...fluff with a fork...and LO!!!<br /><br />Excellent soft grained yummy couscous.<br /><br />We are primarily Rice eaters at my place other than breads...and my extremely fussy toddler acutually ate it like its rice...just a softer fluffier version than the Long grain that we have been used to.<br /><br />Excellent...great source of fibre...i wasnt sure if I could use it in place of rice...But I just add a pinch of salt it it when cooking..and it works great...Intend to use it for Pulav...Upma...I definitely think its a great healthier and easier alternative.
