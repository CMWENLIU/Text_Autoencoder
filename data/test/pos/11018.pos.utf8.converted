Well..this is the third time I've tried to review this, so lets cross some fingers...and actually 'copy' this before I hit send this time..heh.<br /><br />I've been using this product for probably a good 8 years now. Slowly improving on my marinade for my steaks as I get older. My steaks have gone from "hey I'm young lets throw all kinds of stuff and also beer on it" to "people roll their eyes back in ecstasy when they eat my steaks"...with some help from this seasoning (as well as some other ingredients).<br /><br />I've used this on burgers, and even in my spaghetti sometimes. All in all, it's just a great blend of spices to quickly throw in some marinade or just throw on the meat while it's being cooked.<br /><br />I never thought I would actually review this, but right now I'm in Iraq, and we grill up some steaks once a week. The BX/PX sells frozen steaks and charcoal and we found an old barrel grill out back our work compound. We use sauces from the chow hall for seasoning. But I was fiending for more of a little kick, so I thought..hmmm..maybe Amazon has some McCormicks. Well what do you know...they do. You gotta love Amazon sometimes..lol. So I ordered it and it got here to Iraq in a week. Used it once already (as well as about 6 other people) for steaks AND burgers.<br /><br />Yummmmmmmmmy.
