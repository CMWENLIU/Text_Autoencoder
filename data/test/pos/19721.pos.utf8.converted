Wow,<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect with an organic marshmallow,<br />but this product is great. It had flavor, a different<br />but great texture and last a long time in your mouth.<br />I did a taste test, organic verses regular with a few people<br />and after tasting the organic they thought the reqular<br />marshmallow taste absolutely horrible.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this product and will continue to<br />purchase it, as long as the  ingredients are/stay wholesome,<br />and the price doesn't get any steepier. (I think I made that<br />word up).<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />P.S. For your information they melt really well for<br />  rice cripy treats
