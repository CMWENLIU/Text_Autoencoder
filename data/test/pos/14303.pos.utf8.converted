This bread makes the best toast. It lasts for months, fresh, on the cupboard shelf, and keeps nicely in the fridge once opened. It has a tangy sourdough taste rather than the slight bitterness often found with whole grains and a dense, slightly chewy whole grain texture. I would not make a sandwich with it--it is too crumbly, but it is great for open-faced toast, spread with jam, peanut butter or pate. I order it by the case.
