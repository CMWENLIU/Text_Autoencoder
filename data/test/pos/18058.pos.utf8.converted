Wow!  The delivery was right on time as I was anxiously waiting for it. It's the BEST tasting Nut Butter I have ever found!  My husband is type 2 Diabetic and I have 3 boys who love peanut butter so I am always looking for healthy, grainy food to incorporate in my family's everyday lives. Their nutrition and health are very important to me!  Nuttzo is a big hit with my family and it makes me happy to be serving them a nutritious, healthy nut butter that has no added sugars or hydrogenated oils!  This is such a fantastic find!  Thanks to Dr. Oz and the makers of Nuttzo!
