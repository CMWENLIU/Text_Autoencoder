Ayahuasca Vine alone will not give any pleasant or interesting trip. But combined with mushrooms or DMT it will give an intense trip. This special combination is capable of inducing a powerful psychedelic experience because the MAO inhibitor present in the Ayahuasca preserves the DMT. DMT is a psychoactive chemical which produces intense visuals and strong psychedelic effects but is usually rendered ineffective when taken orally because it is easily broken down by the body's MAO enzyme.
