I am an "expert" in dulce de leche as I was dipping my fingers in a dulce de leche jar before I could handle a spoon, born and raised in Buenos Aires I grew up with Gandara as the best, we used to get it on our way to Mar del Plata.<br />That been said to establish my "credentials" and been opinions on taste so personal, I believe this is a good value for my money, I use it as a spread on toasts with my breakfast and as a "sweet treat" by the spoon when my wife does not look at me in the evening after dinner.<br />The taste is not outstanding nor the texture, BUT, at a couple of dollars a can, I do not think twice about using it, the more polished, tasty brands at anywhere 7 to 12 dollars the same amount is to me abusive, I like to eat it without thinking how much each spoon, but each one its own.<br />If you want to add dulce the leche to your daily "sweet" choices, this is as good as it gets, if you are looking for "gourmet"  more sophisticated sweet, you will likely be disappointed.<br />PS: after opening the can I transfer the content into a glass jar with a tight lid and of course keep in the refrigerator.<br />TIP:keeping refrigerated makes it a little hard to spread on soft surfaces like cakes,crepes<br />  etc, "a touch" of microwave is the solution,SECONDS NOT MINUTES.
