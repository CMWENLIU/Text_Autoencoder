These are the best veggie dogs around. There are 10 linketts in a can and everytime I open a can I fight myself to not eat all of them in a single day.<br />However if you are not a vegetarian/vegan yet, don't start buying a whole pack even though they are much cheaper at amazon.com.<br />Buy a single can (they have it at Walmart, or you can ask at a Seventh Day Adventist Church, they'll know where to find a store around) and don't give up if you find it doens't taste like the traditional dog, because these don't have meat in it.<br />But if you are veggie lover, you'll notice Linketts Loma Linda are # 1.
