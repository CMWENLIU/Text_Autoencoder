I enjoy pancakes, but when I began to adopt new ways of eating - I began to search for a "healthy" pancake mix. This pancake mix sealed the deal once I tried this product. In doing so, my daily intake of fiber begins bright and early in the morning. One thing I would recommend, or at least I like each morning when I cook fiber one pancakes, is that you put one pack of Truvia when you mix up the recommended 1/2 cup. If this is done, your pancakes will not only have the already great taste, but it makes that great taste delicious.
