Arrived in just a few days.  I have a Soda Stream and do not care the Soda-Stream Syrups.  I found this Sarsaparilla Syrup while looking for alternatives.<br />Recipe for Sarsaparilla in the Soda Stream: Fill water up to the fill line of the Soda Stream bottle and carbonate the water as you would for any soda.  Using a measuring cup, remove 4 ounces of the carbonated water and discard. Measure 5 ounces of the Fee Brothers Sarsaparilla syrup, and slowly pour into the Soda Stream bottle. I always tilt the bottle so the water does not fizz up when the syrup hits.  Screw on the Soda Stream bottle cap and gently mix up.  I think the Sarsaparilla tastes best when refrigerated and served over ice!
