I was so glad to have discovered this tea when my mom was visiting last year.  She buys tea from the Gevalia coffee company which is very good but is very expensive, especially with the shipping, so just for the heck of it we bought a couple of small boxes to try out to see if we could come up with a cheaper alternative for her.  One of them was the Twinings Irish Breakfast and I was amazed at the flavor.  We in my family were all brought up on Lipton but I abandoned hot tea years ago for coffee.  BUT now this tea is giving my morning cup of coffee competition!  Since then I have also tried the English Breakfast but don't think the flavor is as rich.
