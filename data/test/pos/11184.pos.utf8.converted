We have 4 small dogs and our challenge has always been to find a natural, healthy dog food, made especially for small dogs, that our dogs actually enjoy eating!  They are very particular! Simply said, they love this dog food.  With other brands, we could usually just leave food in the bowl and the dogs seemed to eat only when they absolutely had to for survival.  Now we have to put portions in their bowls because they will eat as much Blue Buffalo as they can... every kernel!  I think they would eat until they explode if we didn't "police" the food bowl!  We've tried every dog food on the grocery store shelves and this is the best.  I know if our dogs had thumbs and type this review, they'd give Blue Buffalo five stars.
