I saw this product while in Costco and figured I'd pick it up to add to my "arsenal" of seasonings. Well, this is one of the seasonings I use the most now and keep at least 2 in stock so I don't run out as often. You can be as liberal with it as you want, due to it not containing any salt. If you are looking for a seasoning that adds flavor without all the sodium, this is DEFINITELY something you should put on your list.
