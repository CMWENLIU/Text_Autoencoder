LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!<br />Do not buy here if you have peanut allergy, they process peanuts in the facility.  You can buy small batches made in a different kitchen that would be peanut free.  Minimum order is 24 bars.<br />I love chocolate, but found I can't tolerate sugar any more.  I found these and am in love.  I use stevia in my coffee everyday, it sweetens my liquid vitamins as well.<br />Just remember this is super dark and not overly sweet since that is how stevia works.<br />I have tried to make my own using the same simple ingredients, and have not had the same wonderful results they do.  I am a fan and will be buying more for sure.
