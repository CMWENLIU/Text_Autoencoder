I first learned of the Keurig system almost ten years ago.  At that time, I worked for one of the largest marketers of the systems in our area.  I had the chance to sample almost every brand and their different brews.  Timothy's traditionally always made some of the best brews for the system.<br /><br />I have left the company, but kept my brewer.  I can still purchase anything I want at cost (if I drive the 30 miles to pick it up).  I choose to use Amazon's subscription for ease of use.  It is only a couple of bucks more than cost, and includes free shipping.  No more trips for coffee, and sure I miss the old mates, but this so worth it.<br /><br />The coffee is smooth and strong.  I prefer a very strong cup of Joe.  I typically make Americanos from my espresso machine (a 3 oz double shot diluted w/ 5 oz water).  That is close to what this tastes like.  I don't know about its acidity, but I can say that it is in line with my palate.  No bitterness (like one famous brand).  No creama, but really, what do you expect.  This is not espresso, it is a strong brew made from Arabica.  Really, just a quick quality cup of coffee.<br /><br />I also order the decaf.  It is just as good
