If you are selecting among the variety of Walden Farms salad dressings, this one deserves special attention. It's probably very difficult to get good flavor when you don't use sugar, fat or significant carbohydrates. But this one works---flavorful, with a zip of heat, decent thickness. If you didn't know you were eating a zero-calorie dressing, you'd take this for a very acceptable 'calorific' product.
