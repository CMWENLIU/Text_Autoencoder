This is THE marzipan for your holiday baking.  Soft, smooth, sweet, easy to roll out-- you'll be fighting off the kids to eat the leftover scraps  from your cake or candy projects.  I have used other brands and they are coarse compared to the silky sweetness of this heavenly product from Sicily.<br /><br />On the practical side, it comes in a sealed foil pouch.  It stays in perfect condition for a couple of months in a cool cupboard.
