My family has been whole-grain converts for a few years, and one thing that was always challenging to find was a whole grain graham cracker. I'm sort of addicted to them (they are simple and sweet and fairly good for noshing on during the day) but finding any that didn't have a ton of partially-hydrogenated oils  was close to impossible, and the ones I found in health food stores were pretty disgusting- VERY grainy and "chunky".<br /><br />These are really, really good. At first bite, I thought "I don't know about this..." because they don't pack the sweetness quite as much as the typical graham, but after my second bite, I was hooked. Perfectly sweet, perfect texture (yes, made with whole grains but without the weird "tooth" of other whole grain crackers), perfect size, not crumbly.<br /><br />My husband liked them, my five year old loved them, and I'm a convert.<br /><br />Very pleased and we'll be ordering more.
