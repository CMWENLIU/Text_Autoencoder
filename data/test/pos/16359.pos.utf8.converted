I have been buying Emerald Deluxe Mixed Nuts for quite a while now and have never encountered a bad or a stale nut. I buy the 10 oz size because it's just right to pour into a bowl when company comes. If they aren't all eaten, just pour back into the container and they'll stay fresh for quite a while. I love Emerald's mixture of walnuts, almonds, cashews, pecans--AND NO PEANUTS! Peanuts are legumes, not true nuts, and don't belong in a cocktail nut mixture. To me, they overwhelm the taste of "real" nuts. Sure, these cost a little more, but aren't you worth it? I know I am!
