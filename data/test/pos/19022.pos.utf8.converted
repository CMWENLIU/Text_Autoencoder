I have only been ingesting this oil and using as a moisturizer for my face, body and hair for a little over a month.  My face and body are hydrated and soft as a baby's butt.  Plus my hair is growing like a weed, soft and shiny.  My biggest thrill came last week when I walked past my entry hall mirror and noticed that the slight sagging on my jawline was firmer and I looked years younger.  When I started this Coconut Oil regimen my blood pressure was 188/92 with medication. Last week it registered 125/75 without medication.  Needless to say I am tickled at the results since deciding to take control of my health naturally and stop relying upon doctors and drugs.  My next natural health cure is switching to naturally alkaline water. I'm told that it also produces miraculous results. Does anyone know of a good brand that is at least a PH balance of 9?
