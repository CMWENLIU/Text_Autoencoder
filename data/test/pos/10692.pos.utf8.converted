I got my cats on this food after I found one of them urinating blood and refusing to use the litterbox.  The vet told me he didn't have crystals, and after two visits they still couldn't figure out what was wrong with him.  They wanted me to put him on the Hill's Science Diet for urinary health, but I read the ingredients, which include by-products and rice, and decided to do my own research to find a better quality cat food.  I can't sing the praises of this food loud enough.  My cat is no longer straining to urinate, or going outside the box.  I have yet to find a variety either of my kitties don't like.  Just be cautious, if you are looking for a grain free food (which all felines should eat), Weruva does have a couple varieties that contain rice.
