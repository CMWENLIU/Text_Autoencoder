Having just had a sugar free snow cone at the fair I decided to get some sugar free syrup for home. You cannot tell the difference between regular and this. There is no after aftertaste. It is made with Splenda and has Zero calories.<br /><br />I called the company and they told me that unopened it has an 18 month shelf life and opened it has a 12 month shelf life at room temp. You do not have to keep in the fridge although I am just so the ice doesn't melt as fast when I put it on.<br /><br />I also got the grape flavor. Both very good.
