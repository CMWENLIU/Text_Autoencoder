I've been giving this brand of dog food to my small dogs (10-12 pounds each), since the tainted dog food incident a few years ago (it takes them probably 6-8 months to go through 30 pounds).<br /><br />When I got a new puppy (doberman), I thought this would be a little expensive, since he eats a LOT.  I looked through PetCo at just about all the different dog foods around this same price (I didn't really look at the ones that were more, since I'm pretty happy with the food). I found that this was the ONLY dog food in this price range that had the first TWO ingredients being meat (or meat by product). In fact, many of the dog foods (the kinds that you find in the grocery store) actually had the FIRST ingredient being filler. In case you don't know, the largest quantity ingredient is listed 1st and so on down to the smallest.<br /><br />He did have diahrea for the first couple of days, but that is because I did not transition him to this food.  Sadly, he had moved from one house to another house to our house within 36 hours, and I did not get information from the original owner about what he had been eating. I mention this mostly to refute the other lower rating - most dogs need to transition in foods or they will get diahrea. So typically, one should mix the old dog food with the new one, in decreasing increments over about two weeks, until the dog is eating 100% of the new food.
