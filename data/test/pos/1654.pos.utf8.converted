ok so you guys, after reading all the reviews, I took a risk and ordered these. The smell when opening was pretty bad, but that is just the preservatives. Wash the noodles under cold water for 4-5 mintues. This takes away the taste and smell. I cooked these for the first time in hot water for about 1-2 minutes and put it sauce. The first bite was OK but after a few more bites, it was disgusting, not because of the taste because you cannot taste the noodles, it was because of the texture. It really was like rubber bands like all the other reviewers said.<br /><br />So i kept experimenting, and realized that after rinsing 4-5 minutes, you have to boil it in hot water for 5-7 minutes, then rinse them in cold water again for a minute. Mix it in your sauce and it is alot softer and that rubber band texture is completely gone. It was like vermicelli noodles. Im going to try the fettuccine noodles next but my last experience was so much better.
