This is the wine that is served at Olive Garden for $25. a bottle.<br />It can be purchased at state liquor store (if you are in PA) and other outlets<br />for 8.99. It has a really great taste, sweet, distictive taste that is different<br />from most. Its most adictive as once you taste it you will want more!<br />It also has a bubbly consistancy.  Very good with a meal, desert or any celebration.<br />My only wish is that it came in a bigger bottle than the 750 ml.<br />If anyone finds it in a larger quantity please let me know!<br />I give it a 10+ AAA rating!  Enjoy!
