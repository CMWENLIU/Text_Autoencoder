<span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:59 Mins<br /><br /></span>My dog, Ichi, is 10 years old and is a fussy eater -- and she usually doesn't even like dog biscuits. But she does like the Hartz Crunch 'n Clean Dog Biscuits (for small dogs).<br /><br />She is missing a couple of teeth (had to have them extracted) but she was able to eat (and obviously enjoy) these biscuits. So hopefully they will also protect her remaining teeth.<br /><br />Watch her in action in this video review! :-)
