If you're like me and prefer to mix your own soda drinks, the MUCH reduced sugar and much better flavor of a custom mixed soda will have you never look back at coke or pepsi.<br /><br />The monin blackberry syrup was top notch, with full flavor of blackberry. Lots of other syrups will contain two or more other fruits to pad out the bottle that ruin the taste.<br /><br />A jigger of this and some fresh, fiercely bubbling seltzer is a<br />wonderful treat. This is also great on pancakes! Try a bottle you won't regret it.
