I discovered Ambrosia custard while in Ireland and absolutely love the subtle taste and smooth texture.  Ambrosia is a great light dessert when looking for something with minimal sugar, and the taste better than Birds, imo.  I would like to be able to purchase it in the aseptic boxes sold in the UK but am happy it's available at Amazon.
