I have a large yard with several moles.  I called a mole/pest removal company.  I hired them and paid 200.00 to have about a dozen traps set (yes, they used these exact traps which is why I ordered some for myself).<br /><br />Anyway, they had 30 days to trap moles in my yard.  They also charged 69.00 for each mole they caught.  They got 5 moles in that time.<br /><br />That may not seem like many, but if you read about moles, you'll find out they are not like mice or rats.  They breed slowly and live alone.  They reproduce once per year and maybe have 2-4 offspring of which maybe half will live in natural conditions.  When you see an area or network of mole tunnels (your grass pushed up), that's just one mole... If you study the tunnels, you'll usually see it comes in from the edge of your yard where there may be more moisture (forest or wild area).<br /><br />You just need to look at the branching of the tunnels and find a few areas where you can guess the mole may be re-using that section to go back and forth.<br /><br />Once you locate a good spot, gently push the grass down to collapse the tunnel, and set the trap.  Be sure to set the trap so the spikes that go in the ground (not the spikes that kill the mole) are not right in the middle of the mole tunnel.  The idea (obviously) is to set the trap in an area the mole will try to use again.  When the mole tries to fix the tunnel, bam!<br /><br />I just trapped my first mole today.  I saw the spring of the trap was down, took the trap up, and the mole was dead underneath.<br /><br />This trap does work to kill the mole.  YOu just need to put it in the right place and set it correctly.<br /><br />The guy who worked for the pest control company told me most of this and it really makes a difference.<br /><br />I'm here to buy a few more traps.  I would suggest getting two traps for each distinct area you think there may be a mole.  I plan to just keep rotating 4-6 traps until all the moles are gone.
