I bought whole wheat berries for health reasons....whole grains do not spike blood sugar like the processed flour does!....and OMG!  I will never buy white flour again.  Now, you have to have a heavy duty blender or a grinder to grind them up, but the flavor is more intense and so much fresher than regular flour....you will never go back...once you taste it for your self.  I love Angelinas too. GREAT prices and fast shipper.  Be sure to store your wheat in a cold place-like the freezer--not your garage!.... away from possible mice helping themselves to it....they like it better too!
