This Special K is very tasty. It is crisp until the bottom of the bowl. The high protein makes it a meal that stays with you for hours. I am adding it to a healthy eating plan for weight loss and health. Five grams of fiber is a big plus also.<br /><br />I like this much better than the plain Special K due to the fact it sticks with you longer.
