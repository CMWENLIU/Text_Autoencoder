Anything from Bob's Red Mill is great.  TVP is a great product to know how to use.  A great way to stretch your hamburger for tacos, meatloaf, etc.  Instead of adding plain water to soften, use a broth,  Extra flavor means great taste.  A healthy way to add soy to your diet.  This is a dried product and goes a long way, well worth the cost for the health benefits.
