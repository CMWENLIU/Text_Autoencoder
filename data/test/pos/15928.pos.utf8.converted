I love liquid stevia, especially the English Toffee!  2nd best is a tie between milk and dark chocolate and the vanilla creme is great too.  Nice addition to coffee,  Best thing is there are no side effects like those of equal, sweet'n low or splenda.  Highly recommend to people w/sensitive stomaches like myself
