I've never drunken this straight but I've used it in cereal and making pancakes etc.  It's great.  I love that it is cheaper than conventional milk AND is hormone free.  The hormones in milk freak me out.  This stuff is great.  No more wasted milk - I just mix up two cups at a time.<br /><br />I have no problem mixing it - I just put it in a bowl with water and whisk it.
