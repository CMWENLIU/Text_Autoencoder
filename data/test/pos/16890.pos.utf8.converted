White Gold Raw Unfiltered Honey is wonderful.<br /><br />I've always loved honey...believed that the honey I purchased was just that...HONEY.  Ignorance is bliss...eh?  I've been really dismayed to discover that some of the honey (the processed/filtered/clear kind) out there is adulterated with HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP (HFCS).  I HATE this stuff.  How would I or you know?  We can't...it's an impossibility...and that's exactly how HFCS manufacturers want to keep it.  If HFCS listed as an ingredient on any product I pick up at the grocery store I place it back on the shelf and walk away.  I'm sure that's EXACTLY why corn producers and HFCS manufacturers do not want regulations that require it being listed in the ingredients on products that contain HFCS...if we only knew.  Sadly, some bee farmers use HFCS to supplement their bees diets...could this be part of the cause for bee colony collapse?  I wonder.<br /><br />I'm stepping off my soapbox now and want you to know that this White Gold Raw/Unfiltered Honey is absolutely the best honey I've ever tasted.  It's mild, buttery, and aromatic all at the same time.  It just melts in your mouth and has a clean, yummy aftertaste.
