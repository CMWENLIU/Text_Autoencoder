Needed a larger quantity than usual of paprika and onion powder to make a jumbo sack of our fav BBQ rub for meats. Usually I get the big jar at Costco but they were out so I turned to my favorite online site Amazon and found it there and for much less. The paprika was pungent and being organic was just an extra plus. The rub turned out fantastic and I have never had so many compliments. This is my new go to resource for all my spice purchases.
