YummyEarth makes the best tasting allergen free candy!  These gummy bears are soft, tasty and chewy.<br /><br />I bought these YummyEarth Organic Gummy Bears to include in my child's party favor bags.<br />Several of my child's classmates are allergic to corn, wheat, dairy, eggs and nuts.  As a parent of a child who outgrew his allergies and carried an Epi-Pen, I understood the challenges of finding a treat that you feel safe giving.<br /><br />It was a huge challenge to find candy that was both kid and mom approved - candy that tasted good, is allergen free, and wholesome.  These gummy bears are the best!  They come in small packets of 24 bags.  These are just the right sized packets.  There is enough gummy bears to let the kids eat now or save for later.<br /><br />I hope YummyEarth makes these small packets available year round.  I have only seen the larger 5oz bags, and the smaller 0.9 oz packet sold individually at my local grocery store.
