Just got back from France and didn't see this product when I was in Arles, near the Camargue.  Later, in Nice, it was served at a restaurant (Vin Sur Vin -- recommended) with my grilled bass.  It added such wonderful flavor to the fish, and to the accompanying vegetables.  I had no time to go looking for some there, so I'm thrilled to be able to order it on Amazon. There is a really special taste and texture to it.  The container on my table even had the signature of the man who had gathered the crystals.  It would make a wonderful gift to dinner hosts.
