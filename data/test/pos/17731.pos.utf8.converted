Bought this to cut down on the amount of flies on our back porch.  Within a day it was a quarter full and practically to the top in a week.  Worked so well we'll be getting several more.  Substanially cut the amount of flies around the porch and house.<br />Extremely easy to use.. Just take off lid.. pour in dried attractant, add water to line on cup, snap on lid, fit on the second lid and hang.  Instructions say it takes a few hours for attractant to activate so you don't have to worry about smelling up the house.  Comes with everything you need.<br />We hung ours about 25 ft. from porch and as stated was full in a week.<br />You actually probably could reuse this trap if your not too squemish about dumping dead and dying flies and cleaning the cup all you'd need then is more attractant.  We just took down the trap and tied a plactic grocery bag around it and tossed the whole thing. At 5.99 not that bad of a loss but we'll probably move up to a larger size seeing it worked so well so quickly.
