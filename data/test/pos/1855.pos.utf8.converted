Of the Rishi black teas, this is probably my favorite so far. Rishi describes it as "malty and robust with accents of cocoa and dates" and that's about what it tastes like. I usually drink Twinings Earl Grey, but this has quickly become my staple when I'm not in the mood for Earl. That said, it's not your typical tea flavor, so some may appreciate its heavy flavor and some may not. In other words, it's not a light and fruity tea if that's what you're looking for, it has a very bold flavor.
