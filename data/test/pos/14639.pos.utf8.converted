My husband was diagnosed with high cholesterol and as most of us know whole grain, oatmeal and in particular steel cut oats are really a super food for helping to lower cholesterol. When I started purchasing steel cut oats at the grocery I was shocked to see how expensive they are until I remembered someone mentioning that they ordered their dry pantry goods from Amazon. Well, I wish I remembered who that person was because I want to thank them for helping me find this great deal! Four packages are just a little over what I would have paid for one, and with subscribe and save I not only maximize our savings, get free shipping but the convenience of regular deliveries. The product itself is great- I make them in our slow cooker so its super easy- put it on before bed, have breakfast ready when we wake up! There are lots of ways to make them and I have to admit I thought they would be kind of gross but I love them! Bob's Red Mill is a great brand that I trust.
