I first tried this tea at Einstein Bros. Bagels, and it is the only tea the we drink now. It has the greatest flavor, and is the finest tea that I have ever tasted. I have offered it to many friends that do not like tea and they have tried it and loved it. We all like it without cream or sugar, the flavors are so rich and vibrant that it easily stands on its own.<br />Harney & Sons even somehow got my boyfriend off of soda, he bought a bunch of different flavors and has them with his meals instead now. They compliment meals very well, and are a wonderful way to start your day and unwind in the evenings.
