I was worried after reading other reviews about receiving dented cans.  I decided to take my chances for $1.77/can vs paying $2.50-$3 per can at my local grocery stores.  I just received my shipment and inspected all the cans. Everything is perfect!  No dents and far away expiration dates.  This is the exact stuff that's available in the stores now.  We go thru this like crazy and so glad I'm able to get it at a great discount.
