This is 100% organic, unrefined coconut oil.  Yes, it tastes like coconut, but it is supose to.  A food should taste like what it is!<br /><br />The nutritional value of this food is outstanding.  It contains a lot of lauric acid which is also found in mothers milk and is both antifungal and antimicrobial.  It is stable at room temperature and does not become rancid quickly like other popular cooking oils.  It requires very high heat to release free radicals (I do prefer red palm oil for high heat cooking options because it does not release free radicals at all).<br /><br />My Suggested Uses:  smoothies, slow cooked baked goods, sauteed foods, mixed with maple syrup over popcorn, homemade cosmetics, and as an occasional conditioner for dry ends of long hair.
