We started buying this food which was recommended by our vet.  When we brought our dog home from the shelter at 4 months old we knew he would be a good size -he's a Weimaraner mix. He transitioned well to this food.  He became a shiny, beautiful, happy boy. Eight months later when we adopted another 4 month old puppy (Black Lab this time)  as a playmate there was no doubt which dog food he would be getting. The Lab seemed to have had a harder time before being adopted. He was underweight, with his ribs and hip bones showing. He also had quite a case of dandruff. After a couple of weeks eating this food he was putting on weight and became more sleek and healthy.<br /><br />Months later, both dogs are in peak physical condition. Bright eyes, shiny coats, energetic and full of life. This truly is the best dog food I've ever used in all my years as a pet parent.<br /><br />/even the poop is better<br /><br />Buying on Amazon is great, too. The big box pet stores don't keep enough in stock to be sure you can always get a bag when you need it. Amazon never runs out and brings it to your house. Brilliant!
