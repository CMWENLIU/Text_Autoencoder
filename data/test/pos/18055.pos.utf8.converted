A friend bought the Red wine Vinturi model recently. He and his wife visit the Napa Valley area frequently and have gotten to know the vineyards and owners. Back at home, they have a basement wine cellar. I mention this because his wife and he enjoy wine for what it is, and doesn't fool with junk. He brought the Vinturi out and explained how and why this gadget worked, which I and others found did quite well. I was impressed and confident enough to turn around and buy a Red wine Vinturi for my brother's 40th birthday gift, which was used with numerous bottles of wine. Another brother in attendance nicknamed the device "Bobcat" after comedian Bobcat Goldthwait for the intensely caffeinated noise this thing makes as the wine mixes with air. Blind taste testing resulted in most everyone picking the glass of wine poured though the Vinturi with having the best flavor, which seems lighter, sweeter and with a better aftertaste. They hosted another party shortly after the birthday party and emailed me that the Vinturi was a centerpiece "hit". I have bought one myself; maybe I should start entertaining others now...the wine will be at its best.
