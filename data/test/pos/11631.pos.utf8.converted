This dressing is comparable to fine dining restaurants!  I, family & friends absolutely LOVE it!  I haven't been able to find it lately & was delighted to find it on Amazon. I usually make it with olive oil & Heinz Apple Cider vinegar.  It tastes a bit lighter if you use vegetable oil. Various vinegars also change the flavor, but the dressing is consistently deliciously good no matter what vinegar or oil you use.  I'm worried about it disappearing so I'm ordering two (24) packs!
