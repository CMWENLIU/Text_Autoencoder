I have read a ton of reviews on the Atkins All Purpose Bake mix...although as of today all I have made with it are pancakes I gotta say, it's good!  I know most people are saying otherwise, maybe I'm just weird or perhaps they have changed it over the years.  It does have a strong 'soy' taste to it 'raw,' however I found that once the pancakes were done it was pleasant and "better than regular pancakes" as my husband stated.  My almost 3yr old also enjoyed them as well without batting an eye.  I think it is worth giving it a try and then evaluate for yourself, you never know till you try it how you'll feel about it!  I hope to try other bake mixes as well, I'm sure they all have there strengths and weaknesses.
