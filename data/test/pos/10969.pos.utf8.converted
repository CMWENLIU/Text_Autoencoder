I am pretty much a sceptic of so-called energy drinks.  Most of them give you a quick buzz, then let you down just as hard.  But, that being said, I am a cyclist, so I decided to give this a try since Lance has his hand in the company.<br /><br />I love it.  I love it.  What I especially love is the fact that it is a gradual release.  You don't get that horribly jumpy I-gotta-run-around-the-block feeling.  I drink it about 30 minutes before my ride, which is usually 20 to 30 miles, and about a third of the way into the ride it kicks in.  I don't get a rush, just a feeling that I can keep going and push a little harder.  The energy really does seem to last for a few hours without a horrible crash at the end.<br /><br />Taste is not bad, not great, but certainly drinkable.  I got the orange powder.  I put it in a shaker bottle with eight ounces of COLD water, let it sit for a bit, then drink.  It reminds me of the orange Tang I used to drink as a kid.<br /><br />This is a product I will buy again.
