The price point of this product makes it immediately attractive. It's only detractor, the labeling, fails to mention the various qualities that a health concious consumer needs to know when comparing the more expensive alternatives. After some research, a manager at the Trader Joe's-Bollinger helped unravel this dilemma by providing the following information. Trader Joe's Coconut Oil is: non-hydrogenated, cold pressed--no heat is used at any time during the processing, raw filtered, unpasturized, and is strained. Hope this helps!
