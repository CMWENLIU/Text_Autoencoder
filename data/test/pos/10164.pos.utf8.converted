I love ramen noodles but stopped eating them because of the terrible ingredients and high sodium content.  I was so happy to find a healthy version.  I even use half of the season pack and they are still delicious.  My son loves them too.  Actually he asks for them every night!  And even with him, I only add half or even a quarter of the season pack.  I also add little chopped pieces of broccoli to the same water the noodles are boiled in for some extra vegetables and it's a great, quick, healthy meal for my 4 year old (and me!).
