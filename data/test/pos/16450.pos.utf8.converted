I grew up eating meat and switched to vegetarian about 10 years ago.  My cravings for a nice smoked sausage still remains.  I found these Primal Spirit Meatless Sticks on Amazon and took my chances.  Usually a vegetarian product trying to imitate meat falls far short when it comes to texture.  These have the texture of a Slim Jim and have a nice spice to them.  Since ordering them, I have also ordered several other of the Primal Spirit products.  These are, by far, my favorites.  They scratch that itch for us one-time meat eaters.
