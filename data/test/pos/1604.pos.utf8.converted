When I thinkof the richest chocolates I usually thinkof fine Belgian chocolates. Lately I needed some small thank you gifts. The chocolate ballotins arrived in TWO days without express delivery. Thanks to fresh product and fine packaging the chocolates could not have arrived as they did: in perfect shape. My friends were very thrilled and even grudgingly gave me a nibble. This selection contained mostly liquid centers with shells ranging from thick to thin, milk to bitter chocolates.
