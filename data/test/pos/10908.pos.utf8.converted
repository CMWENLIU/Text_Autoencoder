I'd never tried sea vegetables before so I wasn't sure what to expect from this kelp, but several of my relatives have thyroid problems and after researching the matter I decided that adding iodine to my diet via kelp was a good idea.  When I received the product and opened a packet and saw that the kelp was covered with a white dusty substance I was horrified and assumed it was moldy but after reading the instructions--always a good idea!--I was informed that it's normal and is just salt and sugar substances produced by the kelp as it is dried.  This company claims that they voluntarily test for various kinds of contamination, so I was impressed by that. As for eating the kelp, I washed and inspected a piece of it, then snipped it into some chicken broth and gently simmered it for about 20 minutes.  It's a little chewy--imagine a really tough cabbage leaf--and seems salty, but I found it palatable and didn't get sick or anything.  In fact, I felt quite good the next day.  Don't know if that was down to the kelp, but I will keep on eating it.  Try it.
