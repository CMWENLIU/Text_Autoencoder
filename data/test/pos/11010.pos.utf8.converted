Hello All,<br /><br />I have tried several brands of Coconut Water, including vitacoca, Zico, and O.N.E.. Of all of them this is the only one I enjoy. It is incredibly refreshing and clean tasting. The cans are large and durable. This is completely unsweetened and pulp free. The taste isn't very strong either, but it is incredibly refreshing. I have been able to give this product to everyone I know and have them enjoy it, give it a whirl.<br /><br />Be warned, the 10oz cans DO NOT taste the same as these tall boys.<br /><br />This stuff is the best.
