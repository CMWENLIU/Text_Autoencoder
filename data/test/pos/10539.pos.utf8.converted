Sure, it might be a little expensive, but trust me when I say it's completely worth it. A full-blown cow might not cost $43.50, but if you think a thousand pounds of bland, worthless cow meat compares anywhere near this 3 lb (1.4kg) succulent morsel, you've got another thing coming. The instant I took my first bite into this rabbit, I literally came in my pants. It's just that incredible. There was no warning, no time to react, just pure unadulterated joy enveloping my entire body. I don't care if I have to spend my first-born's college fund to get it, I NEED the unique nutty flavor of this fresh whole rabbit!<br />I've noticed some distain regarding the unethical treatment of these rabbits, but the rest of us know that rabbits don't feel pain. I would bet money that these rabbits are proud to serve their human masters. We give them a good life on the farm, eating the finest quality carrots, mating with the most beautiful females in the modern rabbit world. Giving their lives to please a superior race is really all these little critters want in life.<br />Bottom Line: 5 stars isn't nearly enough for this product. I went as far as to draw 5 more little gold stars on my screen just to clear my conscience.
