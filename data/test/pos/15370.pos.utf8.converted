I like this blend.<br /><br />Brewed:<br />The chamomile and hibiscus dominate the smell and flavor, and there is light cinnamon smell (and flavor) to it as well.<br />The sencha (green tea) takes a backseat to the other flavors here, which is exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />For my tastes, I don't add any sweetener because it seems semi-sweet by itself.<br /><br />At around $9-10 a pound, I think this was a great value.<br /><br />The packaging I received:<br />It comes in a large resealable bag - ziplock style. You tear off the top of the sealed bag to open it initially.<br /><br />The outside is brown paper as shown on Amazon's product images.<br />The inside is lined with a silver, reflective material that is itself lined with a clear plastic coating. The tea-blend is in contact with the plastic lining.<br />I assume the silver-colored lining is an attempt to reflect infrared/heat. Who knows...<br /><br />I ordered other Davidson's tea in the past, and the older packaging didn't have the silver-colored material.<br /><br />The description on the product page "Contains ... exotic berry flavors" is misleading. I don't detect any "berry" flavor in this nor do the ingredients suggest any berry-ness (other than mysterious "Natural Flavors" ingredient).<br />For teas in general: to get an idea of how it'll taste, you should always check the list of ingredients rather than the marketing description.
