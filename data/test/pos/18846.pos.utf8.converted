Still smarting from the Community Coffee deal that I indulged in, I got right back on the horse in my quest for finding great coffee on Amazon.<br /><br />I have had a few weeks and gone through a full bag of this coffee, subjecting my family and friends to pots of coffee brewed with Eight O'Clock 50% Decaf Whole Bean Coffee.  Quotes from my victims:<br /><br />My mother-in-law, "I don't like decaf, are you sure this is decaf?  This is too good to be decaf."<br /><br />My father-in-law:  Asked for a second cup.  Honey, you never have a second cup of MY coffee!<br /><br />My cousin, "Oh my God...this is better than Dunkin' Donuts!"<br />My cousin the next day, "Would you mind making some more of that delicious coffee?"<br /><br />My wife, who only used to drink Dunkin' Donuts coffee,: "Are you making coffee this morning?"<br /><br />What do I think?  It's the best cup of home-brewed coffee that I have ever had.  I am a big Dunkin' coffee fan, so I won't say it's better than DD....but it's very close if it isn't better!<br /><br />Keys to success:  "Use fresh, filtered water.  Use half and half or cream.  Grind the beans fresh.  Use a ratio of 1 1/2 tablespoons for each 6oz cup of coffee."<br /><br />If you haven't had this yet, do yourself a favor and give it a shot.  I guarantee that you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Enjoy!
