I love the new Zico in a bottle!  To me, it tastes the most like real coconut water straight from the coconut.  Even when it was in tetra, Zico was my favorite (VitaCoco tastes like pure garbage and ONE isn't so great either) but I love that it is finally in a bottle so that I can take it with me to the gym and anywhere else I'm going.<br /><br />Can't wait to try the other flavors!!
