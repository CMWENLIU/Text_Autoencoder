There was a time when I went out of my way to avoid coconut oil - I'm not quite sure if I was confusing it with palm oil, or if medical science was actually lumping it together with all the other saturated fats as a dietary NO-NO.  Of course that's all changed now, and coconut oil is recognized as one of the 'good' oils - but it was still only recently that I had a chance to try it for myself.  Wow!  It's great stuff.<br /><br />Coconut oil has a unique quality in that it has a melting point of 76 degrees, F - and out here where I live (Oregon), that means I seldom see it as a liquid oil (even in summer) - but that's fine with me, for one of the things I like using it for is in biscuits and pie crust, and for those, it has to be solid - and as a solid fat, coconut oil is quite hard (really hard!), even when close to 75 degrees - and for that reason, it is much better for use in baking, where a hard fat works much better than a soft one.<br /><br />But another characteristic of coconut oil that I love is its flavor and aroma - when you open the jar and stick your nose down in it, you are enveloped in the beauty of the coconut's best element, its aroma - its almost frightening how beautiful that smell is.  Maybe it's just me, but that aroma literally sends me to the tropics each time I open the jar.<br /><br />And then there's the flavor.  Most fats have little or no flavor - in fact, as cooks we've been taught to use a fat with no flavor in our cooking.  However, we all know that many fats are flavor!  And if we remove the fat, we lose much of the flavor.  Well friends, coconut oil is a fat with super flavor!  Anything you make with it will have the subtle flavor of the topics - I use it when I make rice, when I do S E Asian dishes and curries, and to make great scrambled eggs.  When you begin using it, coconut oil will open new doors of creativity in your cooking - and you will love it too.
