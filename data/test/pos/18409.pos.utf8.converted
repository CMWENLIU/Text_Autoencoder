Excellent value!  I was disinclined to review something as hoity-toity as caviar because I think that should be left to the gourmets. (I am just a gourmand, meaning my tastes are less refined, I am less informed, and I eat larger amounts.) I only wish it came in bigger jars! I came back to order some more!
