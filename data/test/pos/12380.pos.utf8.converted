I just ordered this McCormick saffron and I can't wait to try it.  It's a really good price on saffron.  I like McCormick seasonings so I'm sure it will be good, fresh saffron.  I like that it comes in a glass jar to maintain freshness.  I use a lot of saffron so I need a good price on it.<br /><br />I hope Amazon keeps it at this price.<br /><br />4/29  Update:  Saffron arrived yesterday.  Sturdy glass jar containing saffron inside of a waxed paper packet which was inside of an envelope.  Demonstrates care for delicate, expensive product.  Expiration date on jar is for 2014, so very fresh.  Looks and smells fresh.<br /><br />5/05/2010  Update:  I have been using this saffron every day and I am really happy with it.  It is potent and fresh and gives that beautiful yellow color to my grains.  I use it in all my grains: rice, quinoa, barley, kasha.  I use it in my curried cauliflower and potatoes too.  Great deal on the world's most expensive spice!<br /><br />Subscribe & Save is a fantastic deal on this product.
