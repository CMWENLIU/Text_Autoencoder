Used this to spray a castle cake (Nordic ware castle bundt pan).  It looked really great and everyone was impressed.  And it was wicked easy.  I blocked off the castle "door" so it wouldn't get sprayed and would retain its chocolate color--it seemed a bit more realistic that way.  Oh, and I did not notice any distinguishable flavor and no one complained (which my family would feel free to do).
