I love peanut butter M&M's.  I love that they contain a ton of protein (relative to any other candy), the existential crunch of their thin candy shell, and their laxative effect when you eat enough of them.  With more substance and punch than the peanut M&Ms and lacking the acrid tang of the originals, they're the perfect food for road trips, the slopes of Kilimanjaro, or nervous trips to the doctor.  I always take some along on first dates, just in case.  They are an all-around classy candy, sometimes not safe for work, and that's the way I like it.
