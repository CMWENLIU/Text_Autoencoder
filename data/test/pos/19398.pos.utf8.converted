There has been a lot of upheaval in my life, lately, so you know that I have needed a tea called "Calm."  This particular tea, by Tazo, has great ingredients (chamomile blossoms, hibiscus flowers, spearmint leaves, rose petals, blackberry leaves, peppermint leaves, safflower, lemon balm, lemon grass and natural flavorings).  I can definitely see why this is supposed to calm you down.  Chamomile has calming properties that soothe me into feeling more at peace (just not so much that it feels like I have been induced).  I could definitely taste the rose petals and most of the other ingredients I mentioned above.  I am so glad that some products (like tea), especially from Tazo, have remained untampered with and are still made with ingredients we can easily pronounce and are derived from nature.  I highly reccomend this tea when you are feeling stressed, need a little "tea escape"  or for any reason at all, really.
