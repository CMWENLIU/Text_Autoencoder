I love this mix, and because it is plain it is fun to play with.  So far I've added chocolate chips to it; that was good, and chopped up dried apricots with about 1/4 cup of almond meal plus about one more TBS milk (delicious), and chopped dates and walnuts (wonderful- served them with honey), and a mix of dried berries (blueberries and strawberries)- marvelous.  All these iterations took at the most about 5 minutes to prepare :-)  I find I don't have to bake them quite as long as the package says- but I make small scones- and perhaps my oven is erratic.  At any rate, keep an eye on your first batch to get a good idea for baking time.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to trying savory additions next.  I'm sure they will be good too.<br /><br />This mix is fantastic alone, also- but it's so much fun to add things I find it hard to stop.  The mix is excellent quality, and I was very pleased to find the sell by date is a long way off (Nov 17 2011, for my two orders).<br /><br />I've ordered all the Garvey's mixes, since my family has so enjoyed this one and the coffee cake.  This is a truly exceptional company.  How lovely to have found them.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />Have now made the fresh blueberry scones (as you see on the side of the package- it was great!  I topped it with some glaze and the blueberry sugar that Amazon sells.<br /><br />I also made a rosemary ham, shredded cheese and green onion scone (2 slices thing ham, minced, 1 cup shredded Mexican blend cheese, and one finely diced green onion)- these were really really good.<br /><br />And finely, I created a Parmesan, orange peel and white pepper scone that was the best of the lot.  I grated the peel off two organic blood oranges, added about 1/3 cup shaved parmesan, and 1/2 tsp white pepper.  The taste was absolutely out of this world.
