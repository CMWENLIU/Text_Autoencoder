I had tried the FRS products (concentrate liquid, chewy snacks and powder supplement that you mix with water) on a free trial from the mfr.  Although I did not sign up for the automatic ship program, I knew this supplement was working because I had more energy to get through the demands of the day than I have had in months.  I continue to take the FRS daily and would recommend it highly to anyone who has depleted energy or just wants to destroy as many of the free radicals in their system as possible.
