Was drinking way too much coffee by the pot and this organic instant coffee allows me to cut back on coffee but have a real nice organic cup of coffee whenever I want to...I am also an organic bean grinder person so this is just the greatest substitute....am going to try the decaf one soon...thanks Mount Hagen!!!!
