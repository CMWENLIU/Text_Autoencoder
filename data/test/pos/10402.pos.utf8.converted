Though a different reviewer complained about taste, I'd be careful of heeding such complaints, given that traditionally nori in Japan is also enjoyed without additives of sugar and salt, "the tasty" additives the reviewer may be referring to. Thus you understand why Americans are not renowned for being healthy. I do very much enjoy this product. It is what it is meant to be: plain roasted nori.
