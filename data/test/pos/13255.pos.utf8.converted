I was coming back to Queens from a show in the city and I suddenly felt a hankerin' for something that would lead to cancer. I pulled into my friendly dimly lit market, strolled up and down the aisles looking for Bloody Mary mix, when suddenly the words "All Butter Loaf" jumped out at me like the Virgin Mary on toast. "All Butter Loaf?!" I exclaimed out loud. To not take that home would be criminal. So, after doubling back down the aisle and grabbing the salt-and-vinegar chips, which had also grabbed my attention, I boldly strolled up to the cashier, pulled out my charge card -- cha-ching! -- and they were mine. I opened up the bag of chips before barely getting my other foot out of the store, but I knew that the All Butter Loaf must be respected, and you gotta slide a plate under a puppy like that. So when I got home, and I took my first slice of All Butter Loaf and jammed the whole thing into my mouth, I knew that this was the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Two a.m., All Butter Loaf and my hung-over arse on an ugly Ikea sofa. My life was never the same.
