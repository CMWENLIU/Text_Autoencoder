I love this stuff!!!!!!! It works quickly, efficiently and tastes good too. It works for headaches, stress, mental disorders like Schizophrenia, ect...a must have for any medicaine cabinet!!!! I take this first thing in the morning upon waking because I have ADHD and Schizophrenia so this stuff helps to calm my thoughts. I take this with my morning medications and then I'm good to go for the day. Also, when I feel really stressed out I take this and it works like a charm. I believe everyone should always have a bottle of this on hand.
