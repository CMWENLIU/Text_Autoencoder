Our family had dinner at a nice Italian restaurant in Houston Texas that had GF pasta on the menu.  My son has been on a gluten free diet for 9 years and I have never seen him eat pasta like he did there.  I was certain it was not GF until the owner brought out the box to show me.  The texture, color, and taste are perfect. I have had other Italian pastas shipped to me for years, but nothing compares to this pasta.  I still can't believe it is wheat free.  You can serve this pasta to people not on the GF diet and they would never know it was GF.  I am still amazed and thrilled!<br /><br />Thank you!<br />Jodi McMahon<br />Houston, TX
