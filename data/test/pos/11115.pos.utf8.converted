I'm almost afraid to say how much I like this product for fear the price will go up or demand will go up and it will get tougher to find. Recently, at the home of a Latter-day Saint friend I was offered a cup of Pero served with a flavored creamer and it was A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Back in my coffee-drinking days I would easily go through 10 cups a day. I still love the smell of coffee and Pero has brought back the flavor without the jitters. I can have a cup before bed and not have a bit of trouble falling asleep. Thank you Amazon, for carrying this great little product at a great little price!
