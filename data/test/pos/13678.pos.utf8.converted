No, hese are NOT tomatoes imported from Italy...so, now that you know that, enjoy them for what they are, a quality product grown in California. I have tried many tomatoes for sauce and these are just simply the best. They are on the pricey side, but worth it, they have such a rich flavor and absolutely NO hint of acidity like so many other canned tomatoes. Give them a try! I am honestly surprised by so many negative reviews, I suspect they are mostly people upset thinking they were purchasing an imported product, and that they are not really unhappy with the quality of the product itself.
