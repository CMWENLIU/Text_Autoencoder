Spatini used to be available to the average American in little packets sold in boxes of three at the supermarket.  Unfortunately, the company making Spatini was bought by the evil conglomerate Unilever, which dropped consumer Spatini in favor of their 2 Lawry's (inferior) spaghetti sauce mixes.  For some secret reason, though, Spatini has remained available in these 'restaurant' sized packages and that's a good thing!  Buy it like there's no tomorrow because Unilever is not to be trusted. 3 tbsp are approximately equivalent to 1 packet of the old product.  In response to the other reviewer, add a little sugar or agave to desalinate the taste of the current product and to decrease the acidity of the tomatoes.
