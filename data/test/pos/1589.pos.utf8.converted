I grew up in the days before microwave ovens, and I recall eating popcorn that was popped in a wire basket over a fireplace, as well as popped in a "hot air" popper and in all kinds of configurations on the stove-top, including the entertaining "Jiffy-Pop" that started off in an aluminum-foil covered pie pan and ended up fluffing up that aluminum-foil higher than a 1960's bee-hive hairdo.<br /><br />Microwave popcorn has become so adept at using that now-universal kitchen device, I think I'd have a microwave if only for popcorn.<br /><br />That being said - you can SEE that there are scads of competing brands.  Still back before microwaves there were commercials starring Orville Redenbacher, and geeky as that guy seemed, he seemed to know something about popcorn.<br /><br />NOW we have microwaves and, frankly, Orville's off-spring haven't kept up.  "Pop-Secret" just plain pops better - their Popped kernels come out big and fluffy and just about every kernel pops.  I empty the bag and the familiar residue of a teaspoon of unpopped kernels just plain isn't there.<br /><br />THAT would be reason enough to rejoice, but Pop-Secret exceeds my expectations.  Back in the days when we popped our own popcorn by time-consuming laborious processes, the key to enjoying the popcorn was what you did AFTER the popping - just before putting the stuff in your mouth.  Back in those days mom taught us to melt a bit of butter and sprinkle that with just a touch of salt onto our snowy stacks of popped corn.  DEEEEEE-licious.<br /><br />In the years since some palates have been trained to become used to that greasy, sticky, oily stuff that's served in our nation's movie theatres. Okay if that's all you can get.... BUT - why would you want that at HOME?<br /><br />Pop-Secret Homestyle must have picked Momma's brain, because it comes out just like Momma's best - big, fluffy popcorn coated with just a touch of salt and Land-o-Lakes butter.<br /><br />I love popcorn.  The Mrs. makes fun of me for how much I love it, but I think the Mrs. and God understand.  Pop-Secret Homestyle is not only the BEST doggone popcorn you can get, but stick a bag in your microwave, push the "popcorn" button, and a few minutes later you have a little bag of heaven.  Open and enjoy.<br /><br />One piece of advice from an expert: Before putting the bag in the microwave, flatten out the bag - as much as possible flatten out the little kernels - separating them from one another.  This makes for more uniform popping and you get that "no unpopped kernel" experience.
