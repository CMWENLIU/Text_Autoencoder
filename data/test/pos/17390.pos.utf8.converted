These were an experiment that worked well.  My 2 large dogs spent more time with these than with any other product to date. Sometimes as much as 10 min. which is a record for them.  My small dog spends about a day on it.  They have that "crunch" that dogs seem to like and they grab them and go when they are offered.  I like that they are a USA product.  They are odor-free.  Not all companies' are odor-free.  They are a good size at 6 in. and the thicknesses vary which is good since the small dog is better off with the thinner ones.  I will be buying these again.  The company was great to deal with.  Product came swiftly by USPS Priority.
