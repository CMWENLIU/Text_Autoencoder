My opinion is exactly opposite of B. Atlas'. I'm on Day 5 of a Master Cleanse, drinking lemonade made with Grade B maple syrup and cayenne pepper. I'd tried Coombs before, and thought it was fine, but decided to try Highland next. Ordered Coombs again last week because it was cheaper this time. In a side by side taste test just now, I much preferred Highland for its lighter, less sweet, straightforward Grade B flavor. In comparison, Coombs was a prettier amber color than Highland, but too sweet and with a heavy burnt caramel taste. To my surprise, the caramel doesn't show through in the lemonade, but the maple taste doesn't really either. Though Highland should definitely take packing lessons from Coombs, I'll order it again. Now to get through these two jugs of Coombs first...
