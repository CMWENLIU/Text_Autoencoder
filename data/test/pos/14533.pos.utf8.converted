I have been purchasing these treats at the recommendation of the vet to help with my cat's tarter build ups.  When they are chewed they release enzymes into kitty's mouth to help fight against the tarter.<br /><br />What really surprised me is the price difference, I was paying about $12 at the vet for a 30 pack.  When I did the math on buying the 90 pack + S&H, it's about the same amount I would pay for two 30 packs -- so I got 30 more, another month's supply!<br /><br />Also, Entirely Pets shipped this very promptly.  I ordered on Labor Day Weekend and it arrived on the following Thursday.  Good Service!
