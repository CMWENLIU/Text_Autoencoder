Twinings Earl Grey is my favorite tea, and I drink it almost daily.  I've tried Bigelow, Harrods, etc. and I like Twinings best, either loose or in bags, so I know exactly what this tea is supposed to taste like.  I was a bit concerned that the K-cups would disappoint, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I tried the 3 smallest brew sizes before I found a trick that works for me.  I double-brew one K-cup on the smallest setting.  By this I mean that I run the water through 1 K-cup twice, both times on the smallest size which makes a large cup that for me is about the right strength and flavor.  When you factor in the convenience and speed of using the Keurig, this makes getting a good cup of tea a breeze.
