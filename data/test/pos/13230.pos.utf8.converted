Hey,<br />This baking mix is absolutely wonderful. I add extra baking powder for all my recipes with this mix. My chocolate chip cookies come out mouth watering delish. The pancakes are wonderful, just replace the water with milk, soy or almond milk and add 1/2 to one Tbs. of non-aluminum contained baking powder. You won't find another mix like it that's so yummy, versitile and gluten/wheat free.  Enjoy!
