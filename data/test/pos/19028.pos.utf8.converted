I ordered the extract to make rose ice cream, because you can rarely find it.  The ice cream turned out really great with this flavoring.  I used 1 1/4 teaspoons to flavor about 3 cups of ice cream.  It was a very light and perfect flavor.  You can definetly use more for a stronger taste.  The seller was also very quick with the shipping.
