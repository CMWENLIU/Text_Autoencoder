Love love love love the pb cookies this mix makes.  In our family, we always make them as peanut butter blossoms, rolled in sugar before baking, and then with a hershey kiss placed in the center of the cookie right after they come out of the oven.  (Tip: as the kiss starts melting after a minute or two, gently push the kiss down.... this makes the entire kiss come into contact with the hot cookie.  This way, the kiss will soften into a puddle of chocolate, and will stick better to the cookie, instead of popping off as you move the cookies around.)<br /><br />I'm eating these pb blossoms as we speak!<br /><br />To say how good they are, I made these for a homeowner's association meeting a few years ago, and the president of the association disliked me quite a bit (I tore up part of my front lawn to plant a flower garden without getting his permission in writing first.... flower planting rebel that I am!).  However, he devoured these cookies, raving about how good they were and that I should start a bakery!  Of course, I told him I made them from scratch.  ^_^<br /><br />Another tip, the package gives a time range for how long you should bake these, and in my personal experience living in a place that had incredibly dry air in the cold winter, I baked these cookies on the low end of that time range.  If I didn't, they stood a greater chance of drying out when I placed them out for company.  The cookies I'm eating right now, my sister baked them for the longer time listed in the time range, but we now live in a damp, rainy winter kind of place, and they didn't dry out.  Of course, this might be simply due to differences in ovens, but I thought I'd throw my humidity speculation out there for you, just in case.<br /><br />BTW, amazon has the *best* price on these!  I normally pay about $3.50 a package at my local grocery store.
