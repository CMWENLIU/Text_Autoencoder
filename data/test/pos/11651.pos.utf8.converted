I love bedtime teas and use different types. I would call this one of my super teas for sleep help. No, it won't knock you unconscious -- never the objective -- but it makes me very sleepy and provides a peaceful, restful sleep. I often use this on nights when I want to get to sleep earlier than my usual routine bedtime, for an earlier than usual wake-up time. I have no scientific knowledge to base this on, but I think the herbs/ plants in this help to shut off my brain a bit faster than just trying to fall asleep on my own, thus allowing me to change my sleep cycle to an earlier bedtime and wake-up.<br /><br />A few suggestions: Don't drink it before driving, as it may decrease your alertness. Don't sweeten it, if possible, because sugar before bed can also disrupt sleep for some people. It has a pleasant, grassy taste. I prefer to make it and let it cool down awhile so that I can drink it fairly quickly, about 1-2 hours before I need to fall asleep. Don't drink it right at bedtime, or you will probably need to get up and groggily go to the bathroom, thus disrupting your sleep cycle.
