I love these whole wheat wraps!!  It's such an easy way to have whole grain, fiber, and low calories in one shot!!!  Did I mention delicious??<br />Yes they are.  I had a hard time looking through all the variations found in supermarkets, and can't find them too often.  So, I hit Amazon, and lo and behold, there they were.  Now, I never run out.  They don't fall apart either, which I love.  Eat, and enjoy!!!!
