If you're looking to send something to a soldier overseas, send Crystal Lite. It's often included in care packages that we receive and there's still never enough. I'm actually buying more right now. The "On the go" packets are the perfect size for water bottles.<br /><br />I'm in Afghanistan right now and it's already hitting 115 degrees. It's a great alternative to soda and doesn't have the calories of Gatorade.
