After a bout of upset tum from a bad bag of food (lasted ~1 month!), my vet recommended vegetarian organic.  This fits the bill and, fortunately, my dog loves it!  Eventually, I want to get her back on a meaty diet...partly because this is expensive but also because it is just more natural for dogs to eat meat.  This is good because there's no yeast, no soy, no meat, and gets just basic ingredients that shouldn't upset a tummy.  We also add plain yogurt and OptaGest to her food in the evenings.  She's enjoying herself again.
