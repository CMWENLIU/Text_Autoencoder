I have an extremely fussy little Shih Tzu who won't eat dog food.  I discovered she will eat Newman's Own Turkey and Chicken formula of which I found 2 cans at a pet store.  After searching on line for a better supplier I discovered Amazon not only carries the food but would send me a case a month on an on-going basis.  The price is the best I found and I even get free shipping.  Every month I get an email allowng me to opt out of that month's supply if I wish.  I am happy and my dog is very happy.  I strongly recommend checking out Amazon's pet food.
