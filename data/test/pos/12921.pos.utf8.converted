We drink a lot of tea in this house, and after trying many other basic black teas have settled on this as the best one all around.  For the first pot in the morning to the iced tea later in the day, this is the one we all (four tea-drinkers) prefer.<br /><br />It is robust without being bitter, does not develop a stewed flavor after sitting in the pot for an hour or so, and is very even in quality from batch to batch.
