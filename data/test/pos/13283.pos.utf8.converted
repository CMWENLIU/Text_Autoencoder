This tea by Rishi is the most exquisite tasting Jasmine Pearl Green Tea I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. I know the price may be a little more than what you are used to paying for green tea, but, believe me, it is definitely worth it.<br /><br />The jasmine flavor is rich and sweet, all by itself. The amount of work that goes into creating each of these lovely pearls is astounding (hence the price!). Once you have tried this tea, all other jasmine green teas will pale in comparison. The flavor is so concentrated, you only need to use a scant teaspoon of pearls for each cup of tea that you brew, so these two cannisters will last for some time. I hope you try this tea, as I know you will not be disappointed.
