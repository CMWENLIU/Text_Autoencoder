My cat was biting at himself and leaving open wounds all over his body. After many trips to the vet, prescription Hill's Z/D low-allergen food stopped his itchiness, irritation and self-mutilation. However, at $60 a pop (10lb), I wanted to try alternatives. A couple types of food from the local pet store made him return to his previous behavior so I ordered this online based on the positive reviews. I have been feeding him this for 2 years and he has shown no problems since. His sister is forced to eat it as well but she seems to like it just fine. In my experience this food is a good alternative to Hill's Z/D prescription food at one-third the price.<br /><br />Update: May my little buddy rest in peace. He had urinary blockage which took his life at age 4. No way to know if the Natural Balance food played any part. His sister age 13 who has been eating it is still very healthy and happy. I believe he was prone to health issues in general and I still stand by this brand, but I crowdsource this info in case others discover the same result.
