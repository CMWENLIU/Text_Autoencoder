This bread mix is the best ever but you have to play with it a bit. Depending on which bread machine you use, extra water may need to be added. Also play with bake time till you get it right. Both of these take a bit of time but worth the effort. Also to make the bread a little more moist add about 2 tablespoons of honey to the mix, it realy helps.
