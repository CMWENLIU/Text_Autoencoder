My husband and I were sick of the oversalted unnatural taste of microwave popcorns, so we have tried just about everything out there.  Seriously, we've spent hundreds of dollars on popcorn, suffering through the 2nd and 3rd pouch in each carton, just to kill it so we could move onto the next pick.<br /><br />When we found Black Jewell Natural microwave we thought we had found "the one" but kept looking, just to be certain. We have now been eating this popcorn for many years and have yet to find something even close.<br /><br />We have converted many a friend to Black Jewell and feel quite firmly standed in our devotion.
