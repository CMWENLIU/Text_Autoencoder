I'm drinking a cup right now! I started drinking it while visiting a friend in Ireland, mainly because he didn't have coffee. Soon I was craving it! I brought home a box when I flew back, and I was searching for more on the web when I found this.<br /><br />It's got a nice mellow flavor and I suspect it's got a pretty high caffiene content compared with the sweet tea we normally drink cold in Georgia. I feel like I've had my coffee after a cup of this.<br /><br />I drink it with a little milk and sugar, and it's just great.<br /><br />UPDATE: A few years later I had persisted in my belief that this is the best tea, worth special ordering. Then we got some Tetley's British Blend from the local store and did a blind taste test. Turns out I can't tell the difference. I still like Lyons just fine, but I don't think I'll special order it. Also, I learned not to be a snob. :)
