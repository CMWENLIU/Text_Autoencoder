This is so delicious! Amazon didnt have the Chocolate Hazelnut available with their subscribe and save program, that I typically order, so I decided to give the Almond a try and am so glad I did. This is made from Almonds so of course has a different taste than the Hazelnut Chocolate Butter (also made by Justins) but it is still just as good. When u read the ingredients (which you should) you will notice that the #1 ingredient is actually Almonds. This is an excellent source of protein and good fat and a great 'treat'. This should not be compared to Nutella, of course your taste buds would chose something with more sugar, but sometimes you need to have some self control and make a choice that's better for your health and your families health. I admit I have had Nutella and it was tasty, but after looking at the ingredients I will never buy it again. How can anyone make the choice to purchase and consume something with the top 2 ingredients being Sugar and Oil? I cant believe that people give it to their kids and think it's healthy.
