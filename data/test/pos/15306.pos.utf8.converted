Skillet is the name a popular Seattle area food truck owned and operated by Culinary Institute of America trained chef, Joshua Henderson. After working at a variety of top restaurants (including a stint as Head Chef at Beverly Hill's Avalon), Josh moved back to Seattle, bought a 1962 Airstream trailer and now serves gourmet food out of it to Seattle's night-time crowd.<br /><br />Skillet's signature item is simply called "The Burger" and what really sets it apart from other deluxe, $12 hamburgers is a generous slathering of Henderson's own creation, Bacon Jam. When I first encountered this product I was so blown away by it's heavenly, bacon-rich flavor that I rushed to my computer to find out how it is made. This is from Skillet's website: "... we take a big bunch of really, really good bacon, and render it down...add a bunch of spices..onions, etc. and let it simmer for about 6 hours...give it a quick puree, blast chill it...and you have bacon jam..."<br /><br />This stuff is great! It has a thick, spreadable consistency with hints of powdered chilies, brown sugar and vinegar. It gives a somewhat subtle but unmistakable bacon taste to whatever you spread it on. Hamburgers are a natural, but I have used it on paninis, grilled cheese sandwiches and a baked potato. This will be a regular item in my house. I should be able to use Bacon Jam for things other than sandwiches and I look forward to experimenting with this wonderful spread.
