I bought this while on one of my many hospital visits to Riley in Indy to visit my grandson. I have to admit, I was reluctant to buy it, but was craving a "good" piece of chocolate. It was well worth the price I paid(I think it was 6 or 7 dollars). The texture is different from normal chocolate. It's slightly coarse, which was a nice change of pace. The taste was very bold chocolate, and it's nicely sweetened with pure cane sugar. In fact, those are the only 2 ingredients: cocoa beans and cane sugar. As you can see, I am now scouting for some more! DELISH!
