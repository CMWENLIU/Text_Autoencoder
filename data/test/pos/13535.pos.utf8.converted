I tired Real Theater Popcorn last night for the first time and managed to eat the entire thing by myself!!  It was that good.  If this isn't exactly like movie theater popcorn, it's as close as it gets!  I'm purchasing the 20 pack today and am going to hand out a few packs to my friends whom share the same love of popcorn that I do.<br /><br />It's GOOD!!
