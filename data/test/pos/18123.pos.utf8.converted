I was a very long-time loyal buyer of Wild Planet of Minimal Mercury Wild Troll-Caught Albacore Tuna until Wild Planet decided to eliminate the minimal mercury tuna and simultaneously cut the size of their can from 6oz to 5oz.<br /><br />The surprising and very good news is that they also cut the price from $27 to $16. So the price actually went down from $4.50 per can to $2.67 per can. That brought the price per oz down from $0.77/oz to $0.55/oz. ---- a very substantial (almost 40%) savings! The quality is still very good, and it's actually a much better buy now.<br /><br />On the minus side, I do not like the fact that Wild Planet decided to ditch the Minimal Mercury Albacore and instead is pushing it's Minimal Mercury Skip-jack tuna instead.<br /><br />Additionally, I am not thrilled that this product is now coming from Vietnam---according to the product description. I prefer my troll caught albacore tuna to come from clean waters of Alaska or Oregon.<br /><br />But in light of today's economy, getting such excellent tuna for almost 40% less --- only $0.55/oz when a closely equivalent version previously cost $0.77/oz is a remarkable and welcome change.<br /><br />UPDATE!  This product is going for $29.95 + shipping on the Wild Planet website.  So the Amazon price of $16 is a super bargain and probably won't last.  I am going to stock up while I still can!!!
