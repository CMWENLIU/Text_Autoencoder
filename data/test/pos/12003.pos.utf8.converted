We have now owned a Keurig (actually three of them: home/business/RV) for almost two years.  We don't always drink flavored coffee, but when we do this is one of our very favorites.  As a rule, Timothy's brand is our favorite K-Cups in any variety.  Amazon offers one of the most competitive prices, and paired with the accumulated savings our Amazon Visa offers, we don't buy our coffee anywhere else!
