I have not purchased Miso from Eden yet, but Eden makes high quality products and I have never been disappointed. This is just to clear up the comment made about this making a 'flavorless' miso soup, because I believe it is user error, and not this product that was the culprit.<br /><br />If you want Miso soup like you get in the restaurants, you have to make your own Dashi (a Japanese soup broth). Then you use this Dashi as the base of your miso soup instead of water and you will get a very flavorful soup. Making dashi is easy. All you have to do is bring Kombu (dried kelp) and bonito flakes to a boil, simmer lightly, then strain the flakes and kombu from the resulting broth.<br /><br />Use this broth in place of water for your soup by following directions on the package and you will be good to go!
