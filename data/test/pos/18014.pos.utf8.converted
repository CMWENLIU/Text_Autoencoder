Just the aroma of opening the bag was enough to send us off on a memory jag. What a great product! Fresh, aromatic, tasty & long lasting in quality. The price was great to go along with the quality. Thanks for offering it up, we will see you again as the tea storage gets low. I highly recommend their Earl Grey.
