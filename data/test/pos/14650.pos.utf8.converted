I bought two boxes of these and have been waiting, waiting, and waiting until the first box finally arrived about thirty minutes ago.  I'd been thinking that I should cancel the delayed second box because I figured they'd be crushed and crumby after traveling for over a week on UPS trucks, as this box had been.  I opened this box, thinking I'd see bags floating around inside, but I was wrong.  I found a perfect Stacy's red box, sealed tight.  When I finally found the expiration date on the product to be 12/07 and today's almost 10/07, I assumed these would be already going stale.  I again thought I'd be better off by calling to cancel the second box.  I opened the box and found inside a dozen perfect bags of chips.  Before calling Amazon, I decided to have some cheese, Byzantine Country Olives and Stacy's Multigrain Pita Chips.  I sliced some cheese onto a plate.  I put some olives next to the cheese.  I cut open a bag of chips, ready to find little bits of chips.  I was wrong.  I placed some nicely shaped chips next to the olives and cheese.  These are absolutely fresh and delicious and I'll be so disappointed if the second box is unable to be delivered.  As much as these chips were just enjoyed, I can't wait to try them with something soft and mushy like hummus, baba ganoush, egg salad or guacamole.  They will be perfect dipped into cottage cheese.  I could pit and chop some of the pounds of olives I have and serve tapenade with these chips.  In other words, these are versatile and healthier than most snack chips on the market.  I hope they return to Amazon stock because these need to be a staple in my household!
