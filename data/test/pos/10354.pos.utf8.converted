I tried this product after being unable to find anything other than lemon juice concentrates with preservatives in my local stores.  If you're reading this review, you may have a similar desire to avoid those little yellow lemon juice balls that are so common.  I wanted to start incorporating more alkaline foods into my diet to balance it out.  I was so happy with the Santa Cruz lemon juice that I placed a larger order a few days ago so that I wouldn't run out.  Here are my thoughts on it:<br /><br />Pros:<br />  - Organic (no "cides" - pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, etc.)<br />  - One ingredient and that's it (no preservatives like sodium benzoate or sodium sulfite)<br />  - Alkaline/acidic for a nice balance to many Basic diets<br />  - NOT from concentrate<br />  - Great taste; not too weak or strong - just right<br />  - Glass bottle (no BPA)<br />  - Packaged very securely during shipping<br />  - Shipping was fast (and free as of this writing from Vitacost, despite having less than $25)<br /><br />Cons:<br />  - Pasteurized (this does not bother me, but some may find it as a negative)<br />  - Pouring from a glass mouth is more prone to spilling/dripping than other containers (this is extremely minor, but it's difficult to find much wrong with this product)<br /><br />I hope this helps your purchase decision - cheers!
