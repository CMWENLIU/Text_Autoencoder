My shipment of vanilla beans arrived vacuum packed for freshness.  The beans are long, thick and large. The flavor and scent is intensely vanilla. I was worried that because these beans are sold for so much less than those in specialty/gourmet stores, that they would be of poor quality.  Not true! These are the best vanilla beans I've ever purchased.<br /><br />I have used these beans to make my own vanilla oil (split a bean or two lengthwise, then leave to soak in a couple of cups of a mild cooking oil such as canola. The resulting vanilla oil can then be used as the oil called for in desert recipes (think cupcakes!), or even body products such as lip balm.  Split vanilla beans may also be used to make your own vanilla sugar or syrup.  Just leave the split bean in a closed container with up to four or five cups of white or brown sugar for a week to make "vanilla sugar."  Add a split vanilla bean to two or three cups of simple syrup, and you now have your own vanilla syrup (note: I also add a drop or two of vanilla extract to enhance the syrup's flavor.  I've also made my own vanilla extract by placing two split beans in a closed glass jar of plain vodka (leave for at least two weeks before using, shaking container every so often). I cannot imagine the amount of money I've saved by making these items myself, plus it's fun and, in my opinion, better tasting!<br /><br />Prior to finding this vendor on Amazon, I purchased and used vanilla beans from "specialty" and gourmet stores over the years.  I find those other beans - Nielsen-Massey, for example - to be extremely expensive, dried out and relatively flavorless compared to the  beans offered by this vendor! You cannot beat the pricing and flavor offered by the folks at JR Mushroom.  Oh, and the shipping was extremely fast, and I believe I received a thank you note from the vendor with my purchase.  Highly Recommended!
