I ordered these flowers from you and you notified Falcon Farms to supply this order and my Mom, who is very ill with breast cancer, was very, very pleased with her flowers and the vase that came with them!  They were delivered within the time frame and before Mother's Day, as promised!  I already wrote my review to Falcon Farms but I felt the need to let Amazon know they notified the right supplier and I will order flowers from them again!  Way to Go Amazon.com!!  Dianne D'Andrea
