In our household, we like to taste the bean, not the roast.  When Starbucks came out with the "blonde" roasts, I got pretty excited because I prefer lighter roasts (as do 40% of coffee drinkers, according to the barista at the store)... light roasts are a little earthier, not as burnt tasting.  So I scored a bag each of the Willow and Veranda.<br /><br />The other one, the Veranda, didn't do a lot for us.  While it's supposed to have "delicate nuances of soft cocoa and lightly toasted nuts" we missed that. It had no snap, and was kind of mixed and mushy tasting, bland and flat, not a definitive flavor.<br /><br />On the other hand, we really liked this one.  The Willow has a brighter citrus-y note and was more flavorful.  The taste was (for lack of better words) clear, defined.  It had a good full flavor, and a clean finish.<br /><br />Your tastes may vary, but if you like a snappy light roast, or a "breakfast blend" type coffee, the Willow blend will probably be your pick.  We're definitely not coffee afficianados, but we know what we like and Willow is how we roll.
