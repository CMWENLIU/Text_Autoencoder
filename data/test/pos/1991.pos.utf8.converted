My dog loves this. Had to switch from dry to wet food because she has something called mega-esophagus (where the esophagus is compromised) Started off with cans of IAMS and wondered why should I pay extra for "premium" dog food such as Dogswell. So I decided to do the research and find out whether the extra 80 cents (80% more than a can of IAMS) was worth spending per can. I mean dog food is dog food right?<br /><br />So what's the difference? Well I found out that dog food that contains "meat by products" or any "by-products" consisted of not only livestock deemed "inedible" under human standards (bones, intestines, hoofs, hair, etc) but it also contained dead zoo animals, road kills, and *gasp* euthanized DOGS and CATS with their (flea)COLLARS on! Goto [...] and educate yourself about dog food. This may give your dog an extra 5 years of life.
