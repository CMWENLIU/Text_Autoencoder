I loved the taste of these, which is what earned it the high marks (dark chocolate was by far the best, although I've tried some other flavors and enjoyed them somewhat, with the exception of white chocolate).  They're a great snack, rather filling and high in protein, although they're a bit smaller than what I'd like. Nevertheless, I wish they didn't advertise its health benefits so much and so deceptively--maltitol also increases blood glucose and is somewhat absorbed, so it is not really a free carbohydrate.  "Sugar-free" is just confusing.  They should consider sweetening it with sucralose and stop making a big deal about its "natural" qualities--who here thinks that packaged snack bars with a dozen ingredients are "natural" anyway?  At the end of the day, I can occasionally tolerate their high price and their ridiculous claims because it just tastes good.
