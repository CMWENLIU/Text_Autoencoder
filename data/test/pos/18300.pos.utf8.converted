I like a good PB&J sandwich as much as the next guy, but I hate all the effort that goes into making them.  I have to open a jar of Peanut butter, undo that little tie on the bag holding the bread, and then spread the peanut butter on the bread- MANUALLY!  I always get the kind of peanut butter which already has jelly mixed in, but it's still just WAY too much effort.  Now with Gaem Grub I can just open ONE container and I'm ready to eat!  The best part is that the container itself is non-toxic, so I don't even HAVE to open it!  I can just gnaw right through it and suck out the grub without even having to take one of my hands off the XBox controller!
