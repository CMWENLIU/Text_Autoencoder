I found this product at Whole Foods during a day trip to the city. I used it in my coffee today and loved it. It tastes kind of like brown sugar, and doesn't have the too-sweet or bitter aftertastes that many sugar alternatives have. One spoon of it was perfect, and I didn't feel sluggish or jittery afterwards. I highly recommend this. I have the sap too, but I prefer the non-messy crystals.
