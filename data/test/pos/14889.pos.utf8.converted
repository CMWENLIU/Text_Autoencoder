Wild Planet's Sardines in spring water is an excellent product  and I highly recommend it as an alternative  to Tuna. The filets are large and meaty and they mix well in various recipes. These sardines are delicious:  when added to salads, mixed with mayo/or olive oil, capers and and a bit of lemon, or in a pasta a la pescatora with black olives, capers, whole peeled tomatoes, zucchini, garlic, onion, leeks and freshly grated parmesan. They are low in calories and pack a lot of protein so one feels full and the best part is they taste great, even just out of the can.
