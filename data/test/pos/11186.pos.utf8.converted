I have used Blue Buffalo food for years. It really is the best out there. Great for dogs with allergies to all the junk in other dog foods. I started using this when I adopted an old senior brittany some years ago. Her cloudy eyes cleared up and her coat became nice and shiny again rather than dull. I won't use anything else and with Amazon Prime...I don't even have to lift into a cart at the pet store and then haul into my house. Fed Ex leaves it right on my kitchen porch.
