I ordered the medium gumball machine and gumballs for my 6 year old grandaughter for Christmas.  It arrived damaged.  I emailed the shipper (Candy Machines) about the damage (glass top was broken).  They shipped a new one the day they received my email. The replacement arrived in 4 days.  Their prompt response to my problem was great and the sign of a good company to do business with.  My grandaughter is thrilled and so am I!  My thanks to [...] and their Amazon representative.  CF
