I've used Schultz Plant Food successfully for decades. It's easy to use and keeps my indoor and outdoor plants healthy and long-lived. Since it's concentrated, it's also economical to use. The only time I use anything else is when I can't find this product in the stores. Finding it at Amazon solves that problem, happily.
