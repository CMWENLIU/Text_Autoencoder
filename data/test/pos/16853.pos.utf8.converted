I didn't know what to expect from this purchase as the "On the Go" packages are significantly larger than other flavors of Crystal Light.  The product description on Amazon did not explain what type of sweetener, if any, is in the drink.  It is sweetened with the new sugar substitute, Stevia, which perhaps is why the packages are so large. I will definitely purchase this item again.
