I love Colman's mustard!!  I got a great product for a great price.  However, I received six cans of mustard in August 2009, and all had an expiration date of January 2010!  I also didn't realize grocery items were nonrefundable.  Bottom line: keep expiration dates in mind (not provided to potential buyers), and buy only what you can use in a reasonable amount of time.
