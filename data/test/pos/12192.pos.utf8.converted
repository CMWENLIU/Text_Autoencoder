I gave this item as a gift. My dad absolutely loved it. He's not much for candy, but it was fun to be nostalgic on his 50th birthday and taste the different candies with him. The box included a lot of items not listed, and had a great variety. I'd highly recommend this as a fun gift for someone you'd enjoy reminiscing with.
