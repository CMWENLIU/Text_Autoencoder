I've recently been learning a lot about food and healthy eating habits. Learning about 'super foods' (those that contain all essential amino acids) has changed the way I eat, and more importantly, the way I feel. Flax Seed is simply amazing for your body: it contains a complete protein, fiber, has no 'bad' fat, and is easily added to things you already eat to make them even better for you. I use it on top yogurt, mixed into bread, and as part of smoothies after a workout. This 40z canister is a great bargain compared to health stores like Whole-Paycheck.<br /><br />Very worth the money.
