Kay's cereal has 9 grams or protein per half-cup serving, mainly from soy. I appreciate the low sugar content: only three grams per serving. I wish that the rice flour were BROWN rice, though.<br /><br />Here's the ingredients: Honey Almond Ingredients: Soy Protein Isolate, Yellow Corn Flour, Rice Flour, Natural Honey, Tapioca Starch, Inulin, Pea Fiber, Evaporated Cane Juice, Partially Defated Almond Meal, Canola Oil, Cinnamon Powder, Vanilla Extract, Natural Flavoring, Baking Powder, Double-Acting Leavening Agents, Salt.<br /><br />Here's the nutritional information:<br /><br />Serving Size  1 oz (Approx. 1/2 Cup)<br />Calories  100<br />Carbs  15g<br />Fat  1.5g<br />Fiber  3g<br />Sugar  3g<br />Protein  9g<br />Weight Watchers Points  1<br /><br />This is a really good price, especially with the 20% off special.<br /><br />I think that you will like this Kay's cereal, especially if you are a cereal lover like I am. And even if you're name isn't Kay, like mine is!<br />Recommend.
