I didn't know what to expect but bought some and put in w/my almond milk (no sweetener) w/fruit and protein powder, added some extra stevia because I like it sweeter and it's great!! Stevia sweetener is the best and only sweetener I will use, other than agave nectar. From the research I've done, it's the only one that is not harmful in any way and wish the FDA would get off their rears and allow companies to add stevia to food. It's alot healthier than sugar in "any" form and alot better than all of those truly chemical artificial sweeteners.
