I discovered this tea in a little cafe in Costa Del Sol, Spain. It was a particularly cloudy night and I was not properly dressed for the occasion (as the weather was deceptively hot during the day). As I began to feel worse and worse and watch the snot drip down my nose, my group went into a cafe and I asked for chamomile tea...but they didn't have it. Instead, they gave me the closest thing to it - tila tea.<br /><br />In just one sip of this tea (with only sugar added and nothing else), I felt all of the mucus clear out of me. Apparently linden flowers are particularly good at doing this and a few other remedies.<br /><br />For such a cheap price (shipping of course is a little high because it has to be exported from Spain, so buy two boxes to make yourself feel better [and to save money]), I highly recommend this product. Never had an issue with the vendor either.
