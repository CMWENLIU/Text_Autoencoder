Even before I adopted my first cat, I'd been reading reviews about the best canned food out there for cats. Most sites seemed to recommend this brand. The price made me wince a little, but having compared the ingredients to those of brands that are cheaper, I think this product is a good investment. After all, we want what's best for our kitties, right? Those cheaper products might be more affordable, but the possible health problems from those ingredients aren't worth the money saved.<br /><br />Anyway, my cats LOVE this food. They lick their bowls clean, and they lick the serving spoon too. If even a little bit falls out of their bowls, they will lick it off. I have given them every flavour, and they aren't picky at all (apart from the Indoor Formula flavour-- they WILL eat it all but don't beg me for more). I am also comforted by the fact that you can look up each can of food on their website, and they will provide a report, analysing the food.
