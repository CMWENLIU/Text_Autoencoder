This is a very good product.  Although, not so much pumpkin flavor, but the spice notes are very nice.  It was not overly sweet and very "spicey" as compared to other syrups I have tried.  I love the fact that this syrup is made in the U.S.A.  I will definitely make future purchases from this vendor.
