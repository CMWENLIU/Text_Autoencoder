This is the same product as the Cappuccino Coolers.  Just the name has changed and the packaging.  They are available in most Walmart stores that have a grocery store.  They are also sold in Rainbow stores in MN, in Publix stores in Florida and some Hyvee stores in the midwest.  I have never seen such a high price as these sellers are asking. Notice that Amazon is not the seller.  The price has not changed much since Maxwell House added their name.  They are still only $1.89 - $2.09 in all of the stores I mentioned.  Shame on these sellers for suggesting $49.95 for 2 boxes. They aren't that hard to find!! One seller asks $6.09 for shipping and the other wants $16.99 for the exact same product to ship.  You can probably go on line to Walmart or Publix or maybe Rainbow and see if they will ship you a case.  I guarantee it won't cost a fraction of the $49.95.  Good luck.
