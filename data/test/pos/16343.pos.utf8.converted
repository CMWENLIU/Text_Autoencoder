I have never been able to grow anything.  I have killed more plants than I care to mention.  So, when I saw the care instructions for the Aerogarden I thought, "Even I can do this!"  And I can.  With next to no effort I have a healthy herb garden and even went out and bought an additional garden for lettuce.  I live in a high rise apartment building making the aerogarden especially nice for someone with limited space and no land.
