My wife and I both love coffee, and tea to a lesser extent. I've realized over the years that my preference for coffee is largely due to two factors: the strength of the flavor, and the 'thickness' of the drink. This is one of the few teas that rivals coffee in both departments. That's not to say it tastes anything like coffee--it is strong and aromatic, but sweet and almost nutty, not acidic or tending towards bitter. The hazelnut and vanilla flavors mingle quite nicely in this dark, expressive tea. Yogi makes some really fine teas, including this one.<br /><br />If you like substantial flavor in your teas, give this one a try. My wife and I both really enjoy it.
