I keep one bottle in the kitchen and another in the bathroom.<br />For cooking I almost exclusively use this oil, rarely I use Canola or Olive oil. The reason is this oil is very healthy full of antioxidants and it resists heat better so it makes it especially good for frying without releasing harmful byproducts when heated. Also as a dressing for salads is delicious because it has a tasty flavor.<br />For the body I use this directly on my body and face as moisturizer or mixed with raw shea, mango or other butters or just with body lotion to make a more liquid and more moisturizing lotion. It's really good because it doesn't leave your skin all over oily, it's absorbed fast and the antioxidants help your skin as much as your inside.<br />This particular oil for La Tourangelle is high quality oil at a decent price and the bottles are easy pour.
