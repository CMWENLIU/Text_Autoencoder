After researching for months on possible migraine headache relief, I discovered ginger was being used as a possible treatment. Having exhausted the "traditional" medical route without success, I jumped in with ginger and had great results. My neurologist has backed me up on this, and it is turning out to be an excellent treatment for me.<br /><br />I started with bulk crystalized ginger, then found these little chews at my local grocery store. Not only do they help alleviate my pain, but I have fallen completely in LOVE with them. I keep them with me at all times, as they are just great for my migraines, queasy stomach, or just to have something to chew on that isn't aspartame-ladden chewing gum (a major migraine trigger for many people).<br /><br />Ginger may not be for everyone, and it is a completely different heat than what you get with hot sauce or peppers. After a few months of eating them almost daily, I can get by without water, but for the first few weeks, I defintely needed a little heat-relief from a drink of water, as ginger can be very intense.<br /><br />All-in-all, these are delicious and have really helped change my quality of life. Defintely worth researching and asking your doctor about if you suffer from migraines!<br /><br />Have a great day.
