I usually but Harissa as a paste but my refrigerator tends to get overly full so I thought I would give powdered harissa a try. Very satisfactory taste, no bitterness, and adds a rich intensity to my dishes. I used it in a garbanzo bean soup and as a rub for lamb in a tagine. Very, very good. Then found out that it too, must be kept in a sealed jar in the frig. Oh well, even with needing to be refigerated I think I will stick with the powder. Great, well balanced flavor.
