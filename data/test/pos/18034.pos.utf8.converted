Well worth the money. I bought 60 lbs of this for food storage.I grew some, to remediate the soil, ate some cooked as a grain and in soup and will sprout some in the winter. Well packed and arrived promptly and fully sealed in containers.<br /><br />Buckwheat remediates the soil, counteracts effects of radiation to some extent in soil and humans.  I scoured the net and this was the best offer for bulk buckwheat which is not that easy to come by.
