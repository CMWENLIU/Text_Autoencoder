I saw Rice Bran Oil talked about on Dr Oz.  He said that it doesn't turn into fat in your body and that sounded like something I definitely wanted to try. I'm glad I did.  There is virtually no taste to the oil.  It takes on the flavor of whatever you are cooking it with.  I've used it to saute garlic for pasta dishes and I couldn't taste a difference between the rice bran oil and the olive oil I usually use.  Another great trick I've found is for popcorn. I put maybe one or two tablespoons of butter in a bowl and mix it with a little of the rice bran oil.  Poured over a large bowl of popcorn it tastes like its pure butter. This is a great item to add to add to a healthy lifestyle.
