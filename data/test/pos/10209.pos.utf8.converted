This fruit is great for a quickie cobbler. Just pour a can in a 9"by9" pan. Add cobbler topping (mix together, cup sugar, cup flour, 2tps baking powder, and 1 egg.) Sprinkle over fruit. Pour melted butter over top, sprinkle a little cinnamon over top and bake at 350 for 30 minutes. Try it, I've gotten lots of compliments on this and it's simple and fast. If you really want to have more fruit, try adding a can of rasberries to the mix!
