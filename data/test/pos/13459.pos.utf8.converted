Two Leaves and a Bud Organic Earl Grey tea is simply delicious.  Each box comes with one hundred mesh bags of whole tea, not the dust and debris you'll find in cheaper brands.  The tea itself is flavorful and delicious, with none of the aftertaste of commercial brands.  As a single person, I hesitated to purchase so many tea bags at once.  However, it is definitely worth the investment, as the tea comes in sealed individual plastic bags and tastes superior to tea from Starbucks or Lipton.  The tea has a delicate but full flavor, and NO sugar is necessary to make the tea delicious.  In addition to making hot tea, you can also use the bags to make incredible iced tea.  Simply make the tea at double strength and poor over ice.  Again, no sugar is needed - making this tea a good beverage for those of us watching their sugar intake.
