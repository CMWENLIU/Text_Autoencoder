I love this tea pack. I bought these in Scotland and I wish I had bought more! I cannot find these in regular supermarkets in the UK, so I will have to order more from the company's website. I was surprised that I would be able to buy them from Amazon in the states (yay for Amazon!). Living in the UK has turned me into a tea addict, and these teas are very good if you add about a teaspoon of sugar and some milk to them. I'm not a fan of the regular English breakfast tea, but I love every one of these. I particularly like the whiskey one. They do NOT taste the same. All of them brew strong black teas with a distinctive overtone to them. The flavors are delicate, but they are brought out if you add sugar and milk to your tea. I tried them without adding anything and it doesn't taste good. Sugar and milk is the way to go if you want to enjoy these teas!
