I've tried most of the baked potato chips made by Popchips, so I figured I'd give these a try. They're delicious! These tortilla chips are just as good if not better than their non-healthy counterparts. The ranch tortilla chips are my favorite so far, but the chili limon and nacho cheese are very good as well. I highly recommend trying these tortilla chips!
