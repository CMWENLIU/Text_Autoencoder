A friend introduced this product to me and I dear say, it's excellent!  I am so happy I can use Agave instead of sugar substitutes if I desire to deviate from my norm.  Agave, pronouned a-gar-vee, taste good, it's nice and sweet, it dosen't raise my blood sugar levels and it hasn't caused me any weight gain.  It's a natural.
