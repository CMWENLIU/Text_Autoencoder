We love the taste of this salt. It is very course, I mainly use this to throw into soups and things that it will dissolve into, or dissolve with a bit of melted butter to put on vegetables and pastas and such, or onto items where you would traditionally use a course, kosher type salt. I put it in at the end of cooking so I won't "cook off" all the minerals it contains. It has a nice, kind of sweet taste, once you try it you will never want to go back to the heavily processed salt Americans generally use. I have not tried it in a grinder yet, but when I tried to process it in my spice mill it was difficult to grind down due to the fact that there is some moisture in it. So we generally just buy the finer grind for table use, although my kids do use small amounts of this at the table sometimes and enjoy it. We find it is also A LOT more pleasant to use for nasal irrigations than regular salt, a lot less harsh on your sinus passages. Delicious and healthy for you!
