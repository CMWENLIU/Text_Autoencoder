Picked this up on a whim at a big chain store because the coffee looked good compared to the other "crummy" instants. As far as instant goes, I think it is the best affordable non-flavored brand on the market. It doesn't have the funny, woody, or bitter after tastes that a lot of the other less expensive brands (Folgers, Taster's Choice) have. Very good when mixed with a good hot chocolate and a little milk or non-dairy creamer. Bonus is a good caffeine kick when compared to the flavored instants.
