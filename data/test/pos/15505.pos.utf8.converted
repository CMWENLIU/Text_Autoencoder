I ordered this on January 8th. After nearly 2 weeks without receiving the product, I went online to see what the hold up was. It said delivery will be around Feb 9th. I have no idea why it took so long but I finally received it on Feb 5th. I live in Phoenix so I was worried it'd be 110 degrees out before it arrived then what would be the point of hot chocolate, right?<br />Anyway, there's no way I could give this product a bad review. It's good stuff man! I ordered 8 cans of it when there was a special going on. World Market sells this for 7 bucks a can. I got it for half that! I know I'll still have some when it's 90 degrees or better outside but that's okay. Blender + Cold Milk + Ghirardelli Hot Chocolate Powder = DAMN GOOD CHOCOLATE MILK!
