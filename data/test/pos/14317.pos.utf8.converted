This is an excellent matcha. I have tried several different mathcas of varying quality and from different suppliers, and this is one of the best. Everything about this matcha surprised me.  From the package inside the tin keeping it fresh (expected it loose inside the tin), to the super bright neon green color and complicated, somewhat sweet taste.  There is really no drink I enjoy more than a good matcha and this satisfies completely.<br /><br />Aside from all the apparent tastes there are two sensations that lurk right below the surface but permeate the entire experience - freshness and pleasantness.  They aren't tastes but a kind of experience that can't be seperated from the taste of the tea.  Is this what is called the 5th taste, umami?  I don't know but nothing else is as pleasant as drinking a fresh cup of this matcha.<br /><br />I know there are other better matchas out there but is anything more expensive than $10/oz really worth it?  I mean, will you actually be able to tell the difference between this and a ceremonial grade matcha selling for $30/oz? For me this is already too expensive to drink every day, but not so expensive that I can't enjoy a great cup occasionally. But if you already have a $3-5/day coffee/latte/frappe/stale teabag habit, then replacing it with this will be well worth it.
