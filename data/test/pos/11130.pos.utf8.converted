I have tried all the rice-based milk replacers, since I do not eat dairy and I like to cook, make ice cream and shakes.<br /><br />I also don't think added sugar is healthy, or canola oil (see my review of the Rice Dream product).<br /><br />But even putting those considerations aside, this has the thickest, richest flavor. I like the vanilla flavor best.<br /><br />And it's organic!<br /><br />I much prefer rice beverages to oat, almond, hazelnut, and soy beverages, for flavor. There are some reasons not to drink too much soy as well (look it up).<br /><br />You'll have to get your protein elsewhere, but otherwise this drink is delicious and healthy and easy to digest- the best of the lot.
