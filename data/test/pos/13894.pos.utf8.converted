As a parent of a child who was recently diagnosed with Celiac disease, you might imagine the stress associated with informing your child he can no longer have one of his favorite meals - mac and cheese.  That was until we discovered these canisters!!!  These are our savior and the ability to buy them separate and in bulk is exactly what we needed.  They arrived on time and in the expected condition. They are easy to use (they have a resealable top) so we get great mileage out of them.  We will be buying them for years to come!!
