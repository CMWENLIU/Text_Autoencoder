I have used this Fancy Feast Turkey Kitten food for three kittens whom I have rescued over the past several years. I first purchased a few cans at Petsmart when I adopted a little "rescue" black and white, adorable kitty about three years ago. His name was Trouble and he came to me as a skinny, undernourished little guy. He was six months old, but looked only two and a half or three months. I could not find ANY variety in Kitten food right then, so Trouble thrived on Turkey Feast and dry food. He fattened up and seemed to get healthier and healthier, but turned out to be ImmunoSuppressed and I could not keep up with his vet bills so a kind Vet's assistant took him from me.<br />Well, there I was catless again. So I adopted another little guy who was rescued fom a drainage ditch. That is my Trnity. He was a scrawny little piece of fuzz when I took him home. Got him some Fancy Feast Turkey and some kibble and he too fattened up and his short litte hair grew long and graceful. He is a small cat, only 8 lbs, but he grew up on this food and I think it did well by him. He is a slim little rascal with no added fat, but plenty of spunk. He progressed on to other Fancy Feast meals, but still, once in a while, enjoys a can of kitten food.<br />His sister, Gabriella was a surpise to Trinity...and to me. I dropped by the Humane Society while out and about one day and found an adorable, underfed brown tipped, ticced kitten. She had been tick dipped but still carred the carcasses of dead fleas and ticks when I took her from the facility. Her owner said she was four mo, but she only weighed 2.9 lbs. Off, I went for more Turkey Kitten food (I do wish they would make it in more flavours). Plus I sneaked in some Pro Plan Kitten food on her too, but it was very expensive and she got mostly Turkey. She is now the 15 pound Alpha cat of the house and grew well on this Kitten food.<br />Somebody dumped a pregnant female kitty in our neighborhood and a friend took her in. Oh my. She had a litter of six and I will be the proud Mommie and "Cat Lady" when to of those babes come to my house in 3 days. Sure enough, I knew they were on their way, so This Time, I let my fingers do the shopping at Amazon and Turkey Feast is here. (Also some ProPlan), but Turkey Feast will dominate because of cost and past wonderful experience.!<br />Kittens love this stuff. And they go from undernourished to well fed in two or three weeks. My new guys will be the first I have had that are well fed from the get go, but the will be Turkey Feast Kitten babies since it has done so well for me in the lives of so many kitties.<br />I certainly recommend it. The kittens thrive and the price is low! It is a great deal.<br /><br />PS. New kittens have arrived. One ALL Black and one a brown Tiger. They go for the Turkey food and gobble most of it right down in one sitting (One three oz can for the two of them.) And, on this wet food, the poop does not smell bad. That is a big plus! They are also getting some Pro Plan Food, but the remains are smellier than the Turkey.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000634G8I">Pro Plan Total Care Chicken and Liver Canned Kitten Food</a><br />October 16, 2011.<br />Found Fancy Feast Kitten Food in Whitefish variety. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B36HZW">Fancy Feast Gourmet Kitten Formula Tender Ocean Whitefish Feast Canned Cat Food (24/3-oz cans)</a> Will be giving it a try also.
