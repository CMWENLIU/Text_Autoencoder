This is my first time buying Tellicherry peppercorns and I am impressed!<br /><br />I loaded up my new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CFB4N">Unicorn Magnum Plus</a> with these peppercorns, ground some on various foods, and WOW! It's like I'm discovering the joys of fresh-cracked pepper for the first time all over again. I can't wait to season some nice thick steaks with this.<br /><br />The flavor is very bold compared to the McCormick peppercorns I had been using. And from what I gather, this is a great price for Tellicherry peppercorns.<br /><br />My only concern is that it will take me and my wife a _long_ time to go through two pounds of this stuff. I actually purchased the two 1-Pound Bags instead of the one big glass jar. At the time I purchased, that was actually a little bit cheaper by ounce. Also, it comes in two packages, and the unopened one seems to be sealed well. Still, I plan on vacuum packing the packages between refills to help keep the flavor fresh.<br /><br />I can tell you this: I'll never again buy cheap pepper.
