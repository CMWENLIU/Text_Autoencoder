My bamboo arrived in perfect shape. It's low-maintenance and thrives in an office with no natural light, and seems a lot healthier than the alternatives I've seen in stores around town. The holder has a bit more space for the roots than the picture shows, and the vase is a really pretty chocolate brown. I may pick up a few more in different styles as gifts for friends who have complimented on how nice this one is.
