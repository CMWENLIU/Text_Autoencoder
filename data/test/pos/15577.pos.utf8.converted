Flax seeds are good for you but adding them to my diet (like anything) is really a matter of convenience.  These flax packs are so convenient and portion controlled in a really sturdy little packet.  I keep a packet in my purse and it really gets tossed around.  So far (watch I just jinxed myself) no premature openings in my bag.  The flax seeds are always fresh.  I add them when I am away from home to cold cereal and oatmeal for added nutrition.
