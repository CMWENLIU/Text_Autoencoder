Just because it states licorice - please understand that this is Double Salt licorice - exactly as it states! Double salt means very very salty - an acquired taste.  You need to start with regular dutch licorice like the cats then if you enjoy that work your way up.  Not fair to give a low rating if you don't know what your doing!
