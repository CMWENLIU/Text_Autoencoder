I was initially reluctant to purchase this, but I finally got tired of paying $6.00 for a 1-pound Rice Select container at the local grocery store.  I found that this Roland Italian rice made better risotto than it's expensive California cousin.  It was creamier, faster, and tasted better.<br /><br />Let's face it, it's a little arrogant to package and sell ELEVEN POUNDS of arborio rice.  I mean, who really eats that much arborio rice?  Well, after trying it, I do.  Order a bag, turn on the Food Network, cut up an onion, and be a culinary rock star.
