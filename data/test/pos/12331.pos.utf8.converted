I am a label reader - I count fat grams, carbs, proteins and grams of fiber vs. grams of sugar.  Most foods that advertise themselves as a "healthy" snack are not really all that good for you.  Often they are too high in calories or they use products that you just shouldn't eat.  This snack food, FoodShouldTasteGood Multigrain chips really is a good tasting, good for you snack.<br /><br />The ingredients are listed on this page and you can see that there are no hydrogenated oils, no high fructose corn syrup and no MSG.  They contain grains that are visible in the chip and a one ounce serving gives you 3 grams of fiber.  (The packaging doesn't specify if it is soluble or insoluble.)<br /><br />The chips are delicious.  They are thicker than what you would expect in a normal corn tortilla chip; more like a cracker in thickness but with the crunch of a chip.  The flavor is similar to a popular name brand corn chip (Fritos) only without the added fat.  I can see where some people say they have a stale taste - there is a grain that has a mild nutty flavor in the chip that you don't expect to taste in a corn chip.  I recommend the multigrain chip if you are hungry for a salty snack that won't blow your diet and that leaves all the unhealthy junk out.  I tried the Buffalo flavor this weekend and they have a very mild kick; much milder than I expected.  I still like them, but not as much as the plain.
