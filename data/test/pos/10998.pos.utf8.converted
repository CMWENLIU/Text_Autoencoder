The Bonsai Jade came in beautiful condition (exactly like the image)!  Shipping was not only faster than expected (3 days) it was also packaged very well.  There was no damage & it was very well watered. It also came w/a great little care instructions pamphlet.  Finally, the price was almost half as much as I've seen in retail stores.  Very satisfied!!
