Just make sure you find the imported version of Robertson's Classic Mincemeat (in the 411g jar as pictured above) and not the version made for the US market and distributed by GFI of Westport, CT (as sold in US supermarket chains).  The US version is: much sweeter (contains additional syrups), more of a soupy consistency, and has a lighter brown color.  The imported version is dark brown and has no corn syrup, ascorbic acid or salt.  The imported version had a "Best Used By" date, but the US version did not.  We bought both and after tasting, used only the UK/imported one.  See attached photos.
