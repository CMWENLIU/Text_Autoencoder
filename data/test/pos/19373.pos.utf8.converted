I buy the Native Forest peaches, pears, and pineapple slices. I think they're all delicious. The pineapple slices might be my favorite, I throw the can in the refrigerator the night before I eat them, makes them taste even better.<br /><br />BPA issue -- Random Native Forest reviews here on amazon had concerns about BPA in the cans so I emailed Edward and Son's (company that makes Native Forest brand) about the cans to find out the truth. The pineapples, pears, and peaches were on the list of BPA free cans that they emailed me back. The asparagus and baby corn that I bought were not, so i stopped buying them.<br /><br />As I did with my review of the peaches, I'll post the list of BPA free cans that I was given in the email in the comments. For those of you who don't care about the BPA issue, you should just know these are delicious.
