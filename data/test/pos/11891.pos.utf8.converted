Why didn't I think of this?  At first, I assumed these beautifully designed tins filled with individually wrapped spices would simply make charming and unusual little gifts.  They certain do that.  What a clever guest you will seem when you come to the door bearing little spice boxes rather than the usual bottle of wine or tired bunch of flowers.  A plus for you is that by giving "tsp spices" you won't be spending nearly as much money as you would on flowers or wine.  You don't have to mention that to you're friends (I certainly hope you don't have the kind of friends who are gauche enough to inquire about price), but it won't matter to them because they'll be too busy marveling at the whole concept.  That's assuming, of course, your friends are smart enough to appreciate fully this new way of storing dried herbs and spices.  As I say, I initially thought of this simply as a good gift idea,  not a radical new concept for my own kitchen. Then I tied the pre-measured spices for myself and the next thing I knew I was eying my collection of glass bottles half full of fading powders and disintegrating leaves.  Most of them I never use because they've lost all their flavor, yet I don't throw out the bottles because it somehow seems so wasteful.  Then I realized, it was time to redefine my definition of waste. The better way to conserve precious resources is to have my kitchen stocked with flavorful spices and herbs that are packaged in quantities that I actually use.  Who came up with the idea of ounce-size bottles for dried spices anyway? Did you ever read a recipe that called for an ounce of dried oregano? When word gets out, I predict that "tsp spices" will bring about a revolution in the modern kitchen, much as the Cuisinart did in my mother's generation and the refrigerator did in my grandmother's. If you think I exaggerate, invite me to dinner and I'll bring along a nice little gift that may change your mind.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V7S5NQ">Tsp Spices Sweet Basics Organic, 12 One-teaspoon Packets, 25 Ounce Boxed Tins</a>
