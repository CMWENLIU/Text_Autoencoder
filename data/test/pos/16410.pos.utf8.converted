I agree with the lady who stated "This is the spaghetti that I remember from my childhood."  I have lived in many states and other countries.<br /><br /> " My "Box" Spaghetti"  has been hard to find in many places.  It is always something I ask people to send me and I always look  to stock up on when I come home.  It is a little spicy but Oh So Good; a great comfort food.  I am also afraid that they will stop making it, so try it.  We need more loyal fans.
