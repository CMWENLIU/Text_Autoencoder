before you buy coffee filters do your research. what chemicals do they use when making the paper? what glues do they use to hold the paper together? if you care rates superior in all categories in my book. if you don't care go ahead and drink something that is just been soaking in hundred degree water with acidic coffee. I think that's crazy if you're a health-conscious long-term coffee drinker. also drink organic coffee with fair trade certification
