Tiny French lentils are much nicer in my opinion than the larger brown lentils that everyone is familiar with. They have little of that "rough" feeling in your mouth that we associate with lentils. I also like the tiny red lentils that are used extensively in Indian cooking.<br /><br />If you can't find French or red lentils in your grocery store, try a health food or gourmet food store or order them online.
