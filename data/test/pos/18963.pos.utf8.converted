I've gone to wearing my hair "natural"--no chemical relaxers to straighten it. On advice from other African-American women who have also gone the natural route, I tried mixing coconut oil, unrefined shea butter, and aloe gel to use on my hair. The results are nothing short of miraculous! My hair is soft, shiny, and manageable. I use the braid-out/twist-out styling methods, and the resulting curls and spirals are absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />Also, I've read up on the health benefits of coconut oil, so I will definitely be experimenting with it in my cooking.
