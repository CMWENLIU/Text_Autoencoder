I had the opportunity to try coffees all over the world and have found a few that met my taste. An excellent prepared Kona coffee in an upscale hotel in Hawaii with coconut pancakes was my favorite. Dallmayr Prodomo is the best everyday coffee with a consistent smooth and full coffee taste. The water is a major factor though--filtered water often helps. Having lived in Asia, America and Europe and traveled to many coffee loving countries, (try France, Italy, Turkey, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Hongkong--before it was returned to China), and many others, I know a wide variety of coffee roast/beans/brands. Still, with filtered water, this is the most consistently smooth tasting coffee readily available. Be careful though, once the vacuum seal is broken the coffee loses its flavor fast. I usually buy in larger quantities and often receive a package that is a "reject." But I have seen people picking up "soft" packages of coffee (a sign that the vacuum packaging is compromised) in the commissary and in other stores--I always wondered about that. To enhance the flavor of coffee that has been out of the vacuum pack for a few days, just add a pinch of salt to your coffee when you brew a pot, sometimes a hint of Dutch processed cocoa. Use quality filters for drip style coffeemakers (I prefer for everyday the cold brew method), and realize that you have to be able to adjust your coffeemaker to allow for the much finer grind of German coffee. So, a good coffeemaker is half the battle.
