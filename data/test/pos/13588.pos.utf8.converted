If you are looking for something that will add flavor to your cooking, the Demi Galace is what you are looking for.<br />Some time ago, I purchased 4oz of Demi Glace from a well known merchant, for $30, my family and I found the flavor excellent. This product is also in the $30 range but you get 16oz making this the most economical way to purchase Demi Glace.<br />You could make your own, but it takes 2 days and constant attention.<br />There are other verities of Demi Glace for poultry, vegetable and fish so what ever you are cooking, you can add remarkable flavor with almost no effort.<br />If you can't use the full 16 oz at once (unless you are a restaurant you wont) you can freeze it and it will keep for months.
