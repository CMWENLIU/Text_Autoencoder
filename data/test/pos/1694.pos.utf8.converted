My husband loves, and would only eat the pepperoni version of slim jims.  They became hard to find around town, so being the good wife that I am (ha ha).  I started a subscription so I can still get them for him.  However, I finally tried one.  HUGE mistake.  Now I want one a day.  Then my mom asked to try one.  Another HUGE mistake.  Now for every one that we have...my husband MAY get one.  These are so good, it's scary.  Someone may determine that they are trying to take over the world!.
