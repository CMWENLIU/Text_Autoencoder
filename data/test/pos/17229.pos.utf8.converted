This is an excellent genmaicha and it is USDA organic certified. It comes in a plain brown bag with reclosable top, like fancy coffee only plain brown paper. The tea is a combination of a very nice, vibrant Japanese green tea, whole leaf, and perfectly roasted short grain brown rice. In Japan, I gather it is often a morning drink. I like it anytime, especially in cold weather months. The flavor is smooth, flavorful, well balanced and nutty. It is just a superb buy and I recommend it completely.
