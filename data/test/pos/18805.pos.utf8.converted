You will not disappointed with the quality of this coffee. In the instant coffee scale, this coffee deserves a 9.5 out of 10. Not only does this coffee tastes great with potent caffeine rush similar to a Starbucks brewed coffeee, but it also is also reasonably priced. Its only downside in taste is a very slight acidic aftertaste.<br /><br />I use this coffee at work and at home. Instead of going to Starbucks everyday, I now spend approximately 25-50 cents (depending on how much coffee I drink) a day on a similar caliber instant coffee. I think Bustelo should introduce a smaller packet size so the coffee will be more portable for travels.<br /><br />I have also tried Starbucks VIA. Although VIA is also a nice instant coffee, it costs almost $2 (2 packets) per a large cup. At that price, it is actually cheaper to go to Starbucks and buy its fresh brew.<br /><br />If you are looking for the best instant coffee that comes close to a quality of a high quality brewed coffee at an affordable price, then look no further. This coffee will fit your needs very nicely.
