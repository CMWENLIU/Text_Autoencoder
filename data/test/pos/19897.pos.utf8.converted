I just started a weight loss program at livestrong dot com, and chew on just one teensy weensy piece to control my food cravings. Actually, I don't even chew, just let it sit on my tongue.<br /><br />It works!<br /><br />At the rate I use it, one bag should last me for ten years. Might just be the power of suggestion, but who cares, as long as it works for me.
