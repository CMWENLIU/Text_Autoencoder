Here's how to get the best results:<br /><br />1. Open the package and dump into a sieve and run under very cold water for at least 60 seconds to rinse away seafood aroma.<br /><br />2.Using scissors, snip the nooodles at least twice to create a shorter nooodle that is easier to manage.<br /><br />3."Dry fry" the noodles in a non-stick skillet until all the excess water has evaporated, the nooodles are now ready to absorb the flavor of your desired sauce, pesto, ragu, garlic olive oil, etc. like a sponge...<br /><br />4. Add your sauce and other ingredients and cook for at least 4-5 minutes to let flavors develop...you can't overcook these noodles because they are very different from traditional wheat pasta...<br /><br />5.  If you follow these instructions, you will get the best results, if you don't, you will have a watery, tasteless experience...refrigerate leftovers, do not freeze leftovers...
