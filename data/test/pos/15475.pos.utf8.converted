Fermented Agave nectar is a really refreshing drink with a twist of lime. I usually use a wine yeast when I make some. In Mexico they ferment an Agave drink called Pulque.  The best kind of nectar to use in dark unfiltered, it has the most nutrients.  I find it helps to add a little honey to get the yeast going.  I use about 1/2 gallon of nectar to make a 3 gallon batch.  It takes a long time to ferment like honey.  You can also distill Pulque to make Teqkillya! A good addmixure plant to Agave nectar is Yarrow.  Yarrow contains thujones, the active intoxicant found in Absinthe (derived from Wormwood) but without all the toxic sideffects.  It can be 5% alcohol but with Yarrow added it'll feel more like 8% alcohol.  Cactus prickly pears are also good to mix in Agave nectar fermentations but it's an expensive addition. There's nothing like it on a hot day.  Yeah, I know most of you won't like my review.  Oh well, I'll deal with it.
