I bought these tomatoes after I read an article about canned tomatoes that said they were bad for you; the acidity leaches stuff out of the tin.  These are great tomatoes; not quite as choppy, more pureey than I am used to, but that's OK.  At 26+ oz, I find I need to freeze about 1/2 of the container for most recipes.
