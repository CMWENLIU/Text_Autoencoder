It has been nearly impossible for me to find these in a store. My kids can't have red or blue dye in their foods as they have been shown to cause ADHD symptoms, headaches, and stomach aches...and those dyes are in almost every kind of fruit snack available. These taste fantastic, my kids love them, and best of all - they are made with natural colors. Thanks so much!
