I have replaced all sugars with this and I love it. It's most like maple sirup but less harsh. I would like to have a large tub type container instead of these little bottles since they do tend to leak during shipping and I use quite a bit of it. I don't bake a lot but in Soymilk, cereal and pancakes this is excellent! And it makes the best chocolate soymilk!
