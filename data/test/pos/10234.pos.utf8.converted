"Dave's Insanity Sauce" is top shelf when it comes to hot sauces.  This is for people who really like their mouth to catch on fire and for their chili to melt the pot.<br /><br />This collection has four sauces; the original "Insanity Sauce", which was once the hottest sauce available on the market, made directly from capsaicin extract, clocks in at a healthy 180,000 Scoville units, the "Temporary Insanity Sauce" which is as hot as the original, but doesn't linger on the tongue, the "Total Insanity Sauce" is a garlicky version of the "Insanity Sauce", and finally the "Ultimate Insanity Sauce", which gives you a mind-numbing 250,000 Scoville units.<br /><br />Compare these to the average 2,500-5,000 Scoville units for your standard bottle of Tabasco sauce, and you can start to get the picture.  These are some true hot, hot sauces.  The "Ultimate Insanity Sauce" should get ladled out by the toothpick-full rather than poured directly into a dish.<br /><br />This is a great set for the price, and you aren't going to run out any time soon.  One bottle of any of these sauces will keep your mouth on fire for several years due to the small amounts used for each dish.  It is an awesome set, and one that I highly recommend.
