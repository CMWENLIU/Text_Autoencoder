I generally try to stay away from caffeine but like to sip on something warm periodically thru the day, I find it soothing.  My usual is the Tazo Camomile with a few drops of rose water.  When I saw this product on Amazon in my search, I immediately signed up to try it and just got it.  I LOOOOVE it.  It has a wonderful flavor that has a natural sweetness to it, enhanced by the rose flavor.  Try it try it try it!
