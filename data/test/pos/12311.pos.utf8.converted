I'm a chamomile tea fan--I drink it every night--and these tea K-cups are super delicious and convenient. I re-use the same K-cup for several tea cups' worth, though the resulting tea gets significantly weaker with each re-use. Tastes like real chamomile, though I have to admit, it's not QUITE as strong as a real tea bag. Nevertheless, I wouldn't trade this K-cup for another. Cheers!
