We've bought this oil at least a dozen times at an Asian grocery, for $2.19 a bottle. It is absolutely ridiculous to pay approaching seven bucks for it here on Amazon. However, if you can find it cheaper (if you're lucky enough to have an Asian grocery in your town, look there), this is some delicious stuff! It smells and tastes incredible, and is our favorite oil for stir-frys.  Don't expect to get skinny cooking with it... but if you want some great scent & flavor, this delivers.
