The initial food of the cost maybe seem steep, but the ingridients are superior in quality, I like the fact that its made by a small company and I hope they wont be involved in any recalls. The food is very rich, so you're feeding less then cheap grocery brands full of fillers, meat feeds muscle not corn, my dog has several allergies and for a long time I couldnt settle on a food that didnt upset his stomach or gave him gives, bad breath, etc. He gobbles this up every evening and thinks its a treat.<br />Well worth the money spent.
