Although I've had to do without for a couple months (summer 2010) now while my subscribe-and-save order is held due to unavailability (sigh), I have to say that this is my favorite dried fruit. If I'm not careful, I can eat a pound per week (another sigh). Not TOO sweet, but very flavorful....perfect munchy food. I've tried the dried pineapple (tasteless), the dried cherries (like bitter raisins), and the dried pears (not as sweet as my own dried pears). I LOVE that there is no added sugar! I can hardly wait for this great snack to be available again and my suggestion is to snip up a couple pieces into your morning oatmeal, cook and sprinkle with ginger, cinnamon and chopped almonds. I stir in organic yogurt or kefir as well. Yummy!<br /><br />August 28, 2010 - Just received order and please note that the pieces are small, mostly square as shown in the photo. I liked them when they were larger slices just as well. First bag tested pieces seem to be softer. Same marvelous mango taste but now it's even harder to stop eating them!<br />September 2010 - next order was of large slices again
