I sent those lobsters as a christmas gift to a dear friend who lives in chicago,Ill.I am from Boston MA.The lobsters arrived alive and healthy in the foam container. I would recommend this dealer to anyone considering sending delicate shellfish that must remain alive until cooked. I would have hoped some seaweed would have been provided as a packing and cooking supplement but in itself is a minute detail that can be overlooked.
