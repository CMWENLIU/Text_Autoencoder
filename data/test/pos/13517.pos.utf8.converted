We have two cats - one who is picky about her treats and one who eats just about everything.<br />As soon as I opened this bag, they both came tearing over to see what it was.  I have never seen such purring, pawing at the bag, and frantic treat seeking before in my life!  If I didn't know better, I would swear it was a bag if straight catnip, but I don't think that even that would get this big a reaction from the cats.<br /><br />How much do they love them?  We only give them reguarly when checking our diabetic cat's blood glucose.  She has always tolerated this activity - barely - but now begins purring like crazy as soon as she sees us get out her test kit box, because she knows she'll get one of these treats.  They are apparently so yummy that they make a needle jab in the ear sound like fun!  Other cat has actually bashed the kit to the floor to open it, just to get to the treats.<br /><br />I'm guessing there is not much that a cat wouldn't do for one of these seemingly addictive, crunchy, fishy smelling little delights.<br />We're thrilled that they are so in love with something from a health-oriented company; there is no junky "filler" in these, and they are grain free.<br /><br />"Wild Cravings" treats are perhaps the most appropriately named pet product that we've ever purchased - cats seem to crave them, and will do some pretty wild things to get them!
