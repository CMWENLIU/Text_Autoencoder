Just got these on Friday and they are awesome! Crisp, clean and refreshing! It was like drinking straight from a freshly cracked coconut. I've tried all the major brands and this is by far the best one out there.<br /><br />I had one after going to the gym and it was perfect. This thing has over 700mg of potassium and it's only 35 calories. That's the most potassium and lowest calories I've seen from any coconut water on the shelf. There is no added sugar. It's just naturally sweet. I can give in to my sweet tooth without any guilt!
