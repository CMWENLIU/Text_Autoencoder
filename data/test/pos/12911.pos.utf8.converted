I enjoy eating ramen, and noodles in general, and since the powers-that-be took away our lunch break, during the workday I end up surviving on microwave-only, or just-add-water items while sitting at my desk. I try to cycle through various brands and flavors and types.<br /><br />I've had other Myojo noodles before (the boil-in-a-pot-at-home variety) and they've always tasted great.<br /><br />The way this yakisoba is prepared is by first pulling open a designated corner to access the interior. You have to remove four small packets (seasoning/ingredients), lying on top of the dry noodles inside. You tear open and pour in the dried veggie packet. You pour in the boiling water...I used the hot water from a water cooler...and cover the top. It says to wait 3 minutes...I wait about 5 minutes since the water I'm using isn't as hot, but I guess it also depends on what you prefer for the consistency of your noodles. You then remove a sticker tab from the top, drain the noodles through the slits the sticker tab had covered, remove the top, and add and mix around the contents of the remaining three packets into the noodles and it's ready to eat. I hope I didn't make it sound like a complicated science experiment, but when you do it, it's actually pretty simple.<br /><br />Their fill-and-drain packaging works well, I've had other noodle bowls where the drain holes/slits were too big and the noodles fall out into the sink, or the water doesn't drain out properly.<br /><br />Flavor-wise, it's surprisingly good (from looking at the ingredients, it looks like it uses tuna product for flavor, not beef)...when I go out to eat, I order beef yakisoba, because the beef base provides the best flavor (or so I believe). My friend orders chicken yakisoba because she remembers some really tasty beef yakisoba her grandma used to make her, but she no longer eats beef. And the chicken yakisoba she orders always tastes bad (and she agrees).<br /><br />If you're a meat-lover, this yakisoba could be even better if it had some sort of meat-like bits to add extra texture.
