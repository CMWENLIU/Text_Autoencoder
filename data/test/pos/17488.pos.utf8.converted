I just tried a can of this C2O coconut water for the first time today and LOVE the flavor!  I bought it at the local chain natural market, despite being hesitant because other brands of coconut water have tasted weird and not much like the water from a fresh coconut at all.  Well, I liked it so much that I wanted to see if I could find it online.  I found it here, but it's too pricey.  At the market, I paid $1.79 + 10 cents CRV, so $1.89 for one can.  So I was sure I'd find it for a better deal here...not the case.  The sale price is $29 for a case of 12.  That's $2.42 per can.  Disappointing...Amazon is almost always the best deal or at least super close.  If Amazon can do better than $1.89 per can, I will definitely order because this C2O coconut water is awesome!!!
