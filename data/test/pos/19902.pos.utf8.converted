So happy I found this product, as is my whole family. These noodles cook quickly (one minute) and are versatile enough to serve in many different ways. I have added them to soup, served with tamari, tofu, and vegetables, and next intend to put in spring rools (rice wrappers). They hold together well but can get very sticky if you overcook them. For best results add a bit of oil (or rinse well) after cooking so they are less apt to stick together. Good nutritional value overall, and very tasty.
