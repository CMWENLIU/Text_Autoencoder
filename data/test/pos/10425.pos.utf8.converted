This Lapsang Souchong from Culinary Teas has a rich, complex flavor that surpasses quite a few other brands at a price that is comparable to or better than most.  A pound of loose tea can take a while to get through, though, so this may not be the best choice for someone looking to try smoked tea for the first time.  If you are already a fan of Lapsang Souchong and are looking for a satisfying cup, this is a great find.
