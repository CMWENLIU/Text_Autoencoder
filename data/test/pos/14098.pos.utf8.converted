My first suggestion is to make sure of what exact pest is digging up your yard. My husband and I had first thought these mounds or hills were made by moles, or maybe armadillos, and after research for local yard problems, found they were made by the Southeastern Pocket Gopher. We have the other 2 pests here too, but their habits are different, and we'll have to get something else for the moles.<br />We had tried everything to repel or remove this critter, and finally ordered one of these traps after reading good reviews here. To my great surprise, we got the pesky Pocket Gopher the very next morning after setting the trap. We did use the carrot trick at the back of the trap, as shown on the instructions.<br />So much damage was done to our yard and shrubs, and it appears it was just this one pocket gopher all along. But if another one moves in, we will be prepared with this Victor Black Box trap. Very satisfied customer!
