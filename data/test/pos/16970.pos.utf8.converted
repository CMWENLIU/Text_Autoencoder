Pros:<br /><br />-claims to have all the essential amino acids<br />-organic<br />-no sweeteners (artificial or other)<br />-easy to digest and hemp protein is supposedly more usable by the body than whey or soy<br />- loads of fiber<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Tastes like you are literally drinking mashed up seeds even when i use a blender and combine it with milk.  So if you are like me you wont be drinking this for the 'taste' of it.  Its not an awful taste, but i guess if youre used to the smoothness of soy protein then this one will take getting used to.<br /><br />- Only has 15g of protein per serving,,, and a serving size is 4 TABLESPOONS FULL!<br /><br />I do feel  more energized when i take this, and you dont get that bloated gassy feeling like with soy.  Im a vegan so soy has been my only protein supplement till now,,, and with all the mixed emotions on soy i decided to give it up for awhile,,, like some claim that soy messes with your thyroids etc etc,, do some research on soy vs. hemp.
