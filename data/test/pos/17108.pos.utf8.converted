I thought I was taking a chance on this item. Golly---I'm so glad I did. It does have a slightly nutty flavor. I tried it with tapioca toasted bread and added some raw honey. It was great.  I will stay on suscribe with this.  Thanks for the great product I have never heard of before. I am learning a lot at Amazon.com. They seem to have everything. This is a quality product that I don't think you should pass up.
