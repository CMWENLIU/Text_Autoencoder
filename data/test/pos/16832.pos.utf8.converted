I love to bake and cook and feel homemade, from scratch, is almost always the way to go. Cookies, cakes etc, nothing can beat the loving touch of measuring the ingredients, right? Wrong! On a whim I picked up some Ghirardelli chocolate brownie mix at the store and haven't looked back since. Like all brownie mixes it's a box of powdered stuff to which is added oil, water, and egg.<br /><br />After that it's totally different from any box mix, or made at home brownie. The brownies have a delicious flavor, no fake or nasty taste. They are thick and dense and chocolate. Of course, being Ghirardelli I would expect the chocolate to be good, but these are great. I felt a little miffed to be honest and began making brownies left and right from some pretty famous chefs and gourmet cookbooks and finally, about the fifth time my family said, "these are good, when are you going to make the Ghiardelli again?" I gave up. I even take these to events and always get compliments.
