As an experienced baker for decades, I have used gel, paste, liquid, and powder artificial colorings.  For the best control, I prefer the gels and powders.  Whether doing royal, butter cream, color flow, fondant, or marzipan, the gel gives me an immediate, true color.  I have been a Wilton customer for 30 years and will not use another brand.<br /><br />Tips:  When opening each little jar, DO NOT fully remove the foil cover over the product.  Insert a wooden tooth pick to open a small hole.  Unless you are making a large quantity of icing, you won't need to widen it and remove more than what is on your toothpick each time you pull out some color on it.<br /><br />Store the jars with the lids secured and in an upright position.<br /><br />I found another use for these colors recently.  I used wood putty to repair a decorative shelf made of fiberglass.  Using two shades of Wilton colors, I was able to re-produce the colors I needed.  Anything that needs color and is sealed with a protective coating and does not get much wear will probably be just fine.
