Great stuff. Not only healthy, but keeps you going for a long time...must be a different type of natural caffeine or something. Just be careful about drinking it too close to bed time or you'll be up very late at night. Anytime I drink it too late, I wind up doing alot of stuff around the house...with bleary eyed pets (i.e., cats) staring at me and wondering when I'm going to sleep.
