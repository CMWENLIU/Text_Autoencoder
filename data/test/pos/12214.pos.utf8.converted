This is a wonderful, rich cake mix.  My family and I are in love with this stuff.  It makes 14 cupcakes, big ones.  We freeze half for the kids to take to school for treats, the rest are consumed almost immediately!  My advice is to let the mix set for 15 minutes before baking, the liquid absorbs more and your cake will be even more moist!  I will be using Pamela's for a long time!
