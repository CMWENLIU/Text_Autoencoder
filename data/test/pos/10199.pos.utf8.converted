So this gum is wonderful because it doesn't have aspartame (which = headaches for migraine sufferers). But as far as comparing to other gums, don't chew it unless you have to, like I do. :-)  The taste lasts for about 10 seconds (literally) and the gum tends to stick to your teeth.<br /><br />But to me the health benefits of a gum w/o aspartame (or sugar, as in the case of the sugar-free glee gum) is far beyond the minor disadvantages of the quality of the gum. I particularly chew it for aiding digestion after meals and to quench my need to snack.<br /><br />Also, I recommend chewing two pieces at once. The pieces are the size of Chiclets, so two at a time is really best.
