Ever since I started feeding my four cats this food:<br />1. They've all stopped shedding 80%, still a bit during the winter and summer but not PILES of fur like before.<br />2. My 2nd oldest cat used to rip his hair out and hes stopped this, and his dry skin has cleared up completely.<br />3. All of my kitties are SO SOFT now it's ridiculous.<br /><br />They also look so much healthier and seem a LOT happier. I totally recommend this food because the change in their visible health was SUPER DRASTIC in the best way possible.
