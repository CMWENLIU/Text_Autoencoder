I'm posting the same review as the one I wrote for the regular version of this product. I can't say enough about this chew!  My dog was sick for 6 months last year, and hospitalized twice.  Her food was changed 4 times, before they figured out she was allergic to just about every kind of meat!  What is a dog to do???  There wasn't anything out there that she could chew on (that she liked).  She wouldn't touch non-food toy chews, so she took to finding paper(or books) and chewing/shredding it whenever she could get away with it.  I was going out of my head!  Sam's Yams was a God-send!  She loves them and can't wait to get one.  She gets so excited when she knows I'm getting one for her, and then can't find a place to chew it...it's funny, she circles the house looking for a good hide-out, afraid someone will take it from her.  The best part is...they aren't making her sick!  I highly recommend these, as well as the regular Veggie Chew version of the chew. My dog is a Cavapoo, the size of a Cocker, and it takes her about 5-10 minutes to polish one off.  That is the only downer...wish it lasted longer.  But hey, beggers can't be choosers!!
