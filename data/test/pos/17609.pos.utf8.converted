Traditional Medicinals' "Breathe Easy" is an amazing tea. A couple of times I've had asthma attacks, it's clearing powers have worked! It's a delicious,spicy mix of Egyptian licorice, peppermint, ginger, and eucalyptus. It's the drinkable Vaposteam&its benefits are incredible. Traditional Medicinals is based in beautiful Sebastopol, California, and its healing herbs come from their garden!
