"The World's Best" is usually just an empty marketing slogan, but it this case it's the truth. I've seasoned chicken in countless ways in about 25 years of cooking. Chicken has long been my favorite food and this is my favorite way of seasoning it. My favorite ways to use it are 1) rinse and pat dry a roaster and coat lightly but thoroughly with Szeged rub then cook as you usually would, and 2) Use a coffee grinder (one that's used only for grinding spices!) or a mortar and pestle to powder a tablespoon of Szeged rub. Then mix the powder with 2-3 tablespoons of flour and coat a pound or so of white meat chicken strips with the seasoned flour. Dip them in egg wash and then coat with crumbs (panko are my favorite crumbs). Pan fry them on medium heat in enough oil to brown the breading on both sides.<br /><br />My mouth is watering just sitting at the keyboard.
