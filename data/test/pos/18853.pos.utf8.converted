I tell myself that I buy these to have around for sore or scratchy throats, and although they are great for that, I really get them because they are so good!  Each "bar" contains 9 hard candies, each filled with liquid honey.  They contain only three ingredients; sugar, corn syrup and honey.  I love to use them at Christmas too; I send out lots of packages in the mail and like to include a bar or two in each.
