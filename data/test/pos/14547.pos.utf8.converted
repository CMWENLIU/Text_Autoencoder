I've tried stevia from other manufacturers, but always come back to SweetLeaf.  There is just no comparison.  It's easy to use in all recipes that call for sugar or other sweeteners.  It's also better for you than sugar and Splenda.  No after taste. I use the liquid Stevia in beverages.  It only takes a drop or two, depending on your taste. So if your looking for a calorie free sweetener you simply must try SweetLeaf Stevia first.  Don't waste your money on anything else.  It's the BEST.
