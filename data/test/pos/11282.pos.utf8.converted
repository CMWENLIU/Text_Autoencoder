This is a good  way to get my Omega 3 since I dont like fishy fish.  It is also a way to get good fiber.  In order to get the omega benefit of flax it has to be the ground flax and I used to  grind it myself but this is much more convenient. this particular brand of flax seed is my favorite among the ones I have found in the store. I  like it better than Bob's red mill atho get  that if I have to.<br /><br />I buy this with the automatic ordering every 6 months and it saves me money and no shipping if done this way along with the 10% off.  I put several  heaping teaspoons in my cranberry juice in the morning.  some people put it in baked goods or on cereal.  I have also added to rice mixtures, casseroles, hot chocolate etc - whatever strikes my fancy.
