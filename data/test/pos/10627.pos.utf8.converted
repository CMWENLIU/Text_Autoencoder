I admit it - I'm very, very ambivalent about harming any creature, even one that tears up our lawn the way moles do. But after one of our kids fell and nearly broke a leg in one of the numerous mole holes in our yard we (reluctantly) decided to cut down on the mole invasion. We did not want or need another emergency trip to the doctor's office. We also have elderly parents who visit often and the thought of THEIR falling was frightening to us.<br /><br />  Bottom line on these traps - THEY WORK. If you want a trap that quickly kills moles, these do. They also seem to keep  suffering to a minimum. I'm not even sure the moles DO suffer because I was walking to the mailbox and felt  one of these traps go off. The mole was dead by the time I pulled it out, less than a minute later.<br /><br />  Our lawn is no longer full of dangerous mole holes. I admit...if we'd only had an occasional mole hole, I would have stayed away from traps. We are animal lovers. We have pets.<br /><br />  But the situation was becoming dangerous. I didn't want anyone  to get hurt walking across our yard.
