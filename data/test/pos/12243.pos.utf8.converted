The folks giving bad reviews on this product don't seem to understand that creamed coconut is not the same as condensed coconut milk. It contains coconut-meat solids and is pulpier/thicker, and will not taste like coconut milk by thinning it out with water.<br />What you get: inside the green box you see in the picture is a plastic-wrapped block of creamed coconut. Unless your house is very warm, it will be rock-hard. I fill a bowl with hot tap water and immerse the entire package, then knead it with my fingers after a few minutes. Repeat a couple of times, then snip the package open and pour/squeeze it out like toothpaste for use in cooking. If you don't use the entire package all at once it will resolidify; that's not because there's anything "wrong" with it, that's just what real coconut cream does.  That's why I love these little packages, as opposed to the 16-oz jars of other brands that they sell at Whole Foods Market.
