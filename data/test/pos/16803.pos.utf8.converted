I like this roast because it has a full smooth flavor without a burnt aftertaste.  I have tried alot of K-Cups and I have learned that for me I really prefer roasts like this and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZB2">Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> which are medium to mild roasts.  Timothy's coffee have been some of my favorites.
