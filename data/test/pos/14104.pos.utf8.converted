We discovered Fleur de Sel on a honeymoon trip in Montreal at a butcher's counter in the Marche Atwater.  It was beautifully packaged in a sealed, round cardboard container and we fell in love with its unique texture and flavor. When it came time to re-order, this vendor offered a full pound of this yummy stuff in a plain old plastic bag for about the same price that others charge for mere grams.
