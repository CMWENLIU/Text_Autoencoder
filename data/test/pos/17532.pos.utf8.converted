I've been drinking this water since last year, and am still in LOVE with them.<br />Not only they taste better than (perrier, personally) any other water, it appears to be shedding my body fat. Of course, you need to watch your diet and excersize to loose weight, but I can clearly say that this water was helping me loosing weight. Now, it's not the main reason why I drink this. Just like this water, any alkiline(with higher pH) water will be absorbed to you body almost twice as fast as your regular drinking water. When I play basketball, I sweat like a hog. But as soon as I take a sip(full sip) of this water(or any alkiline water), you can feel that your body is sucking that H2O from your stomach as soon as it gets consumed, then you start sweating much more right after.<br /><br />As a health profession, with much knowledge of histology and physiology, it seems like I can picture how my cells are absorbing that H2O(supposedly, polarized due to the high pH) at a very faster rate than regular water. You go to bathroom much more frequently, and I see my urine gets as clear as it can be. I do assume that it will also benefit your kidneys by actively clearing those biproducts(i.e. CO2, etc.) of your body.<br /><br />I know that high price of this water is the main drawback. I go to Costco, and sometime they sell a case of 12 glass bottles at a cheaper price. Recently, Amazon had it avaliable at a very good price, but still anybody will be offended by it's high price over other cheaper bottle waters.<br /><br />Like I said, you get what you can afford, and go with your budget. Still this water is very expensive for me, but I simply cut on my expense on ther beverages like Cola or beer/wine. If you put more value on this type of water than other beverages, it's still affordable, I think.
