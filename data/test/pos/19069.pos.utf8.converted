What an outstanding product!  Fresh, clean, packed in one of those easy-to-reseal bags.  The apricots are very, very tasty and flavorful.  The fruit is a little darker than the sulfurated variety but much, much softer and easier to eat.  This is a FIRST CLASS product, unadulterated with any chemicals or preservatives.  A good source of all-natural vitamins and minerals, especially iron.  WMD
