I was looking for tootsie pops to replenish my supply. I am diabetic so when I found these miniature pops, I thought it would be a good thing. I mean, there were 200 of them! Turned out that my friend wanted some to, so I ordered a bag for him. He wants to stop smoking and that it would be a good idea to have something to put in his mouth. After a few pops, I realized that I would never get through all of them. What would I do? Around holiday time, I came up with an idea what to do with then. I decided to make holiday bouquets with them. I bunched up 4 lollipops (different flavors) and taped them together and tied a ribbon around them and curled the ends. It looked like a bouquet of flowers except with lollipops! I made 52 of them and gave them as gifts to the nursing home staff where I am living. Everyone was so touched by the unique gifts? They were easy to make and so affordable! It all worked out in the end!
