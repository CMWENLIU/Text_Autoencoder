I'd suggest to buy TWO containers, one for hair use and one for cooking use. I originally bought this to use on my daughter's hair -- she fussed a bit about leaving it in her hair for two hours, but the results were amazing, far better than any conditioner we've tried on her hair.<br /><br />I don't care for the taste of this oil on toast but it's terrific for frying -- eggs, hash browns, greasing the griddle for pancakes -- superior results, better than butter, better color, better taste. It's pretty much a 1:1 replacement for butter. Very pleased with this product.
