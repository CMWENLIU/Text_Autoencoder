I bought this one day while looking in the sugar and alternatives to sugar section. I was impressed that it was natural, unprocessed, low on the glycemic index, and that the make-up of it was much lower in sucrose and fructose than other alternatives. So, I thought I'll give it a whirl. So far, I've used it to make two batches of cookies. Those cookies were delicious! I haven't really tried it in anything else. It is true that it is pricey, but it might discourage me from excessively making deserts ;o)
