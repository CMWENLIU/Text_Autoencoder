If you like your coffee a little stronger than mid-strength, this one is for you!  You would never know this is decaf coffee.  I'm a very fussy coffee drinker - too weak = bla;  too strong = bitter and undrinkable.<br /><br />Tully's coffee as a rule is a little stronger then the GM brand, overall. Typically 'House' blends don't mean a whole lot to me, but this one is exceptional.  Not bitter, not watery, wonderful aroma. The only other decaf brand I would ever recommend is Emeril's. All the other brands are too weak for me.<br /><br />My husband can only drink decaf and we tried every, single brand when we were switching from ground coffee to the K-cup.  This is the only one he liked - and he doesn't like strong coffee and I don't like weak coffee - WE BOTH LOVE THIS ONE!  (finally we agree on something)<br /><br />Enjoy!
