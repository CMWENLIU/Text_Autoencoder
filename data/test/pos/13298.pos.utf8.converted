Polenta is generally not a week-day meal, if made the old fashioned way.  However, quick-cooking polenta opens up that possibility.  This particular version cooks in only 1 minute.  I was pleased with the results, as was my husband.  It is a fair amount of polenta to buy at once (12 boxes), but should last until we manage to eat all of it.
