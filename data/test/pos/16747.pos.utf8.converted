My Lab has always been an extremely aggressive chewer, to the point where we don't dare get him any plush chew toys any more because they'll be shredded on the first day. We got this for him when he was about 4 months old and he showed no interest in it. He much preferred the Nylabone Dura Chew Wishbone Wolf instead. This was simply too big for him and he preferred other chew toys that fit his smaller jaws better.<br /><br />He's now 7 months old and he's grown to the point where he LOVES this Nylabone. It's super hard so it'll last a very long time for even the most aggressive chewer. As with any hard plastic chew you need to supervise: throw it out before it gets too small.
