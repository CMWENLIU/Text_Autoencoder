My body doesn't handle caffeine well and I don't like its effects, even with black tea. Thank goodness for Pero. It's rich and robust without nasty caffeine because some of us tea totalers get tired of the wimpiness of herbal teas. I like to add milk and sugar for a richer coffee-like experience. And for those who thrive on instant gratification, it dissolves immediately without having to wait 3-5 minutes to seep. Pero costs almost twice as much in retail stores, so I was ecstatic to see it on Amazon at such a deal. Only problem is having six containers means that I'll probably won't have to buy Pero again until 2010.
