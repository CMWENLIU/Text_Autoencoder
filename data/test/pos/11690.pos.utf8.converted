Has helped my husband's aching back & my knees with only 1 tablet a day.  Also have some friends taking it.  One friend has arthritis in her hands with swollen knuckles.  Had to have her rings resized.  After a month of 1 tablet a day, her knuckles are noticeably reduced; she can also make a fist.  Must have her rings resized AGAIN.  She is thrilled.  Tablets are much cheaper through Amazon.  Around $25 in the health food stores.
