This chili is great tasting and very filling. One can will easily feed 2 people. It is a medium spicy tasting chili but you can always up the heat if you want with a shot of hot sauce and more spices.<br />It is the best tasting vegetarian canned chili i have tried and i highly recommend.<br />Serve it with some nice crusty bread and you got yourself a whole meal.
