I ordered two of these for my husband and self. We went through and tasted each one (over a few days) and tried to make comparisons and then read the labels. This is a great way to get aquainted with Pralus (and varietials) if you cannot afford to start out with the big block. Yes, they are tiny, but there is a lot of flavor and nuance in that little piece  - We're not talking stale milk flavored hershy or nasty tangy godiva here loaded with half or more its weight in sugar and milk powder! If chowing on a bag on hershys is your idea of an ideal chocolate experience, this is not for you - but should be! This small block is enough to really get a taste for it if you pay attention while you eat them, and pick your favorites if you want to order whole bars. Of course there is the matter of preference and maybe Pralus isnt right for you, but its my favorite and this nice little package can get you aquainted with the flavors of the world - the warm cocoay Africans, the sweet cool South Americans, the spicy Indonesians. It is a lot like coffee and if you love the different varieties (Im not talking Hazelnut or Carmel latte here) then you will appreciate the chocolates which do seem to have similar qualities as coffees. Even if you dont much care for dark chocolate (most big brand's dark is even worse than their milk because you can taste how bad the chocolate is) this is a good place to start as it lacks many of the off-putting tastes such as bitterness. Pralus does have a milk chocolate though (melisa) if you would rather start there.<br /><br />Pralus is FANTASTIC!!!!!<br /><br />Im not some wine snob who just gets into this so I can talk about it in The Right Places but someone who really loves chocolate and this IS Real Chocolate.<br /><br />Enjoy
