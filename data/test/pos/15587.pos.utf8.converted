Oh. My!  This hazelnut butter is DIVINE!!! Being the frugal, savvy shopper that I am, I balked in the store when I first saw how much this cost. "There is no way I am paying almost $10 for a bottle of NUT butter," I thought (but there was no dissuading my boyfriend). And, the second it hit my tongue, I was a convert. This stuff is SO worth the price tag.<br /><br />  I feel that before I continue I should mention that unlike so many others, I am not, nor have I ever been a fan of Nutella.  In fact, I only tasted it once (several months before sampling this treat), and while I found it tasty enough (with that much sugar, fat, and chocolate, how could it not be?), I wasn't thoroughly impressed. But, THIS.  THIS is absolute heaven.  As noted in my title, it tastes like Ferrero Rocher, and it is ADDICTIVE!!<br /><br />  **A NOTE about CONSISTENCY/TEXTURE**  As other reviewers noted, this is not an entirely smooth butter, but I'm not really bothered by that. (It's not CHUNKY, but, there are bits of what I can only imagine to be hazelnut in the spread that are the size of small grains of sand.)<br />Let me note, though, that we first sampled this out of the squeeze pack, and after sitting in a pocket for a couple of hours, the butter oozed out in a gloriously creamy fashion, almost like a thick caramel sauce.  In fact, I don't recall detecting any of the "grit" or "grain" that is present at room temp. when we had it that way. . .So, try warming this up in a double boiler or other gentle heating method if you're really craving that smooth consistency.) Since this is so thick, sometimes it CAN be difficult to spread on softer breads; my boyfriend likes to eat this on challah (for some reason, the combo reminds me of a boston creme doughnut!!) but he likes to take a huge glob of it and smear it instead of gingerly spreading (I know, I know -- what guy "gingerly spreads"? :) so please take note of that.<br /><br />  I LOVE that the first ingredient in this is HAZELNUTS.  It IS vegan (though it doesn't say it on the container) so it doesn't contain any dairy.<br /><br />  No comparison can be made between this and Nutella (though it is obviously unavoidable as they are both a hazelnut chocolate spread) so please don't buy this hoping for something similar in taste (though I can't imagine even the staunchest of Nutella lovers being disappointed by this; my boyfriend is -- and HAS been for YEARS -- a Nutella diehard, and he, too, absolutely ADORES this). If you're looking for a delicious, decadent treat that will tantalize your taste buds :) and haunt your dreams, then, by all means, dig in!
