Summary:<br /><br />Peanut butter, plain: A bit "rubbery". I cooked them a little longer in microwave and added chips. ;^)<br /><br />Peanut butter, choc. chip: Crispy, crunchy, crumbly, rich and VERY addictive! (Yes, they always arrive broken up somewhat, but you won't care.)(Like other chip one, only 5 oz. box)<br /><br />Swirl shortbread: Too heavy and buttery for me. Nice texture.<br /><br />Choc. Chip shortbread: If you like shortbread, this will taste decadent! Rich choc. chips. Crispy and yes, also addictive! (Note: only 5 oz instead of 7 oz. box)<br /><br />Butter shortbread: Couldn't really eat these. Too heavy and buttery. Least favorite.<br /><br />Haven't tried others yet.<br /><br />I have a wheat allergy and never tasted shortbread again until I found these wonderful delights at the store in the health-food section! The shortbread choc chip I tried first has not only the unique taste of shortbread, but has chocolate chunks also! They are crunchy and light.<br /><br />In comparison, they weigh less than some other Pamela products. They are not as "buttery" as the Butter Shortbread or Swirl (a good thing in my opinion). I love the pecans also!<br /><br />Recommend to any wheat-allergy sufferer, or gluten intolerant person. :^)
