I've liked most of the Back To Nature (BTN) products I tried and this is no exception. These are about 40% whole cashews and 60% halves. They taste fresh and are lightly sea salted. There are no added oils. I wouldn't call them jumbo though, as they are the same regular size of any other brand on the market I've tried. Since usually it is the Kirkland brand from Costco I buy, I will say BTN's taste much better, but they are also considerably more expensive. I will savor these 3 bags due to their high caloric content.Yum.
