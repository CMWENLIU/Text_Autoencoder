I have just ordered my second case.  The salmon is delicious and my favorite go-to lunch staple, usually as a sandwich or tomato filling with a little mayo, celery, dill, pepper and sometimes Tabasco.  The flavor is milder than canned tuna.  The bones are easily incorporated, and a great source of calcium.  It's difficult to find good-tasting food that is low in sodium, and this salmon is both.  I'll be a steady customer.  Many thanks!
