Campbells Creamy Tomato Parmesan soup at hand is very tasty and convenient! I notice when I have a stuffy head, or especially a sore throat, that it is really soothing. I swear it made my throat better, and I really FELT better after I sipped it down. The only thing I do not like is how SWEET this soup is, which I wasn't expecting. But, still, its good. However, the classic tomato flavor is NOT so sweet and it has HALF the calories of this one! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MIFS5M">Campbell's Soup at Hand, Classic Tomato, 10.75-Ounce Microwavable Cups (Pack of 8)</a>.<br />Creamy Tomato Parmesan:<br />Calories  -  220 (per unit)<br />Protein  - 5 grams<br />Fat  -  7 grams<br />Carbs - 35 grams<br />Sugars -  20 grams<br />and only 27% of calories from fat!
