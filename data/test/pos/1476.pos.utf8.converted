This is my initial cup of hibiscus tea and it is very warm and pleasing.  The tea comes out a beautiful red color and has an uplifting floral scent.  I like the sour bite the tea yields.  I look forward to many more cups of this wholesome organic brew.  This is pure health in a cup and I feel good drinking it.<br /><br />If you like tart herbal tea, this is the tea for you.
