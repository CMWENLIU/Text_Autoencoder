I mostly drink traditional black teas. I've tried a few green teas, and for the most part, have been disappointed with their flavor. I like this green tea. It has a nice hint of lemony flavor (from lemongrass) which is not too overpowering. It's also supposed to contain a peach flavor but I didn't really notice it at all.  I'm not sure about the "rejuvenation" claims. That's pretty bold to claim, but heck, if it rejuvenates you then great.
