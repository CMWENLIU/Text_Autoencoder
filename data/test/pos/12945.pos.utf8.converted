Great to use as a dry rub on tri-tip steak. Wonderful to sprinkle on steak, chicken, pork chops, potatoes, eggs and just about anything you can think of. When we were on vacation in Jamestown, New York I found it and brought it home. I was so dissapointed when we ran out, so I tried googleing it and was so excited when I found it on Amazon. Definatly give this one a try. A+
