They look gross when you get them but dont let that influence your opinion. I am a dietitian and I cook healthy lunches for my coworkers once per week. We made stirfry with the noodles, SO GOOD! I love them. Wouldnt use them like pasta with pasta sauce though. Keep to asian themed dishes. They are very filling and tasty!
