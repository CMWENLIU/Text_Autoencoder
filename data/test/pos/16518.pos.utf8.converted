My cat suffered from such severe food allergies that the process of finding a food that he could safely eat nearly killed him. Natural Balance Venison Green Pea formula is the only food he can safely eat. Within two weeks of switching to Natural Balance my cat regained 2 of the pounds he'd lost while he was sick and his facial sores started to clear up. The best part is that he loves the taste. He'd probably eat six cans a day if we let him. I just wish Natural Balance would offer a dry version of the Green Pea and Venison formula.
