I've tried everything with my 7 month old corgi/chi mix.  Normally he would eat half of a new brand's bone and then wouldn't touch another one again.  He just finished this bag a few days ago... he LOVES it.  And I love it too because the ingredients are way better than most of the dental chews out there.  No animal by products; no corn, wheat, or soy which can create horrible skin allergies... just really awesome and healthy ingredients.  I already bought two more bags and will definitely be a long term customer.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />It's been a while since my dog has first tried these.  He is a SUPER picky dog, but the minute he sees me pull out this bag, he goes crazy and starts to whine for them.  I can't believe he hasn't gotten bored of it yet.  I am very glad Amazon has lowered the price on these.
