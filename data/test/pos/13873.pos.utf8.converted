Brussels does a very good job of packaging and shipping their trees.  It came in perfect condition.  This is my very first bonsai tree and I almost lost it due to a lack of watering.  You must keep this tree watered or it will drop all of it leaves.  These trees are very hardy and are capable of recovering from mistakes like these as long as the mistake is not too prolonged.  The fukien tea is an awesome indoor tree, but you must take care of it!
