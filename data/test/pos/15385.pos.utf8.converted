There are a lot of technical reviews out there, but in very simple words, there are two things that you get from the hemp powder. First is the protein, it is very potent and actually keeps you active, there are lots of studies on the net that you can look up, but for myself, I have been using it for 1 year now, and I can run for 4 miles and pump weight for another 1 hour and still go out party in the night, I never had so much energy with any other product. The second part is the fiber, it will make your mornings lot easier, without another fiber supplement. For taste, it is very personal but, hemp is easy to mix in a wide variety of liquids so you have choices, the best idea is to try it for a month or so and see how it works on your body, make sure you exercise to maximize the result.
