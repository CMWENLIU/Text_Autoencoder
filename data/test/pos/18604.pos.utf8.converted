This stuff makes an excellent, relaxing evening drink - a great alternative to alcohol after the kids go down. The dose can be ramped up if a laxative response in the morning is desired.  It helps my wife become drowsy as bedtime approaches, but I only get the same reaction if I hold some in my mouth for sub-lingual delivery (which I recommend).
