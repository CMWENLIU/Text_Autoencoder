This is a great herbal tea for those that used to drink regular black Lipton type tea, but don't want the caffeine.  Decaffeinated teas still retain a small amount, as well as some decaffeinating methods use chemicals.  This is a wonderful tasting alternative.  In addition to a regular hot cup of tea, I place 4 teabags in a 2 quart container, fill with water and place in the refrigerator.  In a few hours you have a great tasting iced tea.
