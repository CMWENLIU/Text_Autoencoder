As an African-American woman who has suffered from breakage and damaged hair, I have to give this props.  I've only been using the product for about two week now and I'm seeing big difference in my hair.  I use it as a part of deep conditioning regimen and let me say when I complete the overall process of conditioning, shampooing, and combing or brushing through my hair I have very little breakage.  If I don't use it as a part of my DC regimen than, I'll use some to a cheap conditioner as a prepoo to soften my hair for about 35 mins.  True the smell isn't the best but for the work it has done on my hair it gets my respect.  I will warn you the first ingredient used in this oil is mineral oil, so for my natural ladies who are scared of that, you may want to try the powder form.
