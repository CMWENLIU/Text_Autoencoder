I think it's awesome but then again I like most things made of raw coconut.<br />One of my favorite treat is homemade Sorbet. You will need a powerful Vitamix like blender and tamper.<br />1/2 -1 frozen ripe banana<br />2-3  cups of frozen berries<br />1-2  tbsp of Maple syrup<br />1/2-1 box of cream coconut<br /><br />for extra sweetness add liquid stevia like Kal liquid stevia<br /><br />Eat as soon as possible otherwise it will turn into a fruit smoothie.<br /><br />alternatively: you can use honey, I prefer Maple syrup ( no other sugar is as tasty as Maple)<br />  1/2 of a frozen avocado instead of banana. You could also easily make chocolate banana sorbets.<br /><br />I love to experiment with food, there is no greater joy in life.<br />Yummy!!!
