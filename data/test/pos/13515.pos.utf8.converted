I've been using Agave in my tea, coffee, cooking and on pancakes for over a year. I'm a type 2 diabetic, and need something with a low glycemic index.  This product is the best - and it tastes wonderful.  My kids don't miss honey on their pancakes any more, and this keeps everyone from having sugar highs and crashes.<br /><br />Highly recommend!
