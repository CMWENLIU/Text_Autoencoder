Thank you, General Mills, for reformulating your Rice Chex. Same great taste! Same great crunch!  Now safe for gluten-intolerant folks and celiacs! (Specially Marked Boxes Only)<br />Now, if only they'd do the same for Corn Chex...<br />Oh yeah -- it is so convenient to have a case delivered right to my front door through Amazon's subscription service. I tried to find the new Rice Chex at my local grocery store, and they were out.
