I've come back to tea after drinking coffee almost exclusively since before adulthood.  A huge part of the migration was, initially, due to that malady of modern life, acid reflux.  Caffeine makes me gullet go gaga.  In fact, I'm even reduced to drinking a blend of decaf and regular tea in order to keep the oesophagus happy.<br />A really cool thing about tea is that, unlike coffee, in its varieties there is a complexity of subtle (and not so subtle) flavors that one can easily apprehend.<br />Sure, there are people who will argue there is a whole range of flavor notes that can be found amongst the various coffee beans and while this is, strictly speaking, true, it is also pretty much true that one cup of good coffee smells and tastes pretty much the same as any other cup of good coffee.  Coffee is not the sort of thing one sips to enjoy as one would a glass of wine.  Drinking tea, on the other hand, can very much become a sipping game possibly because a tea leaf is more like an herb or flower than a coffee bean is.<br /><br />This is not to say that one can't find plenty of industrial strength tea with minimal flavor notes (e.g. many of the English/Scottish Breakfast tea blends, but see also Taylors robust yet flavorful S.A. Kwazulu that manages to deliver a mule's kick) and I love that kind of stuff and wish I could drink it because the decaffeinated stuff I've been reduced to is insipid in comparison.<br /><br />If you are just getting into drinking it, you're soon going to be touring the world of tea for different taste sensations, and likely flit from leaf to leaf before you find what makes for you the perfect brew.<br />This is DEFINITELY one of those teas you want to try on that journey for this Special Rare Assam Leaf Tea, Doomur Dulling, Loose Leaf tea is actually pretty special.<br />When you open the sealed bag it comes packed in you will likely first be surprised by the large size of the tips that comprise this tea.  They are so large the contents have the look of a pouch of tobacco (indeed, the stuff is nearly as fragrant as a pouch of newly opened pipe tobacco).  The next thing you'll do is smell them, no doubt, and note the fragrant, not quite heady aroma it exudes.<br />This fragrance and consequent flavor is what makes this tea singular.  After you have brewed it, stir in some sugar and milk, then taste it.  You'll immediately identify this as the so-called 'milk tea' drinks that the Japanese are so fond of and drink as a soft drink in much the same way that Americans in the South drink iced tea.<br />Its flavor is distinctive floral notes and may take you by surprise.  Doubtless, these floral notes and the delicacy of the liquor are what make this tea so desirable And may put off those who prefer the more common industrial strength blends.<br /><br />I find that I quite like this tea, and could possibly make it a daily drinker because it doesn't seem to cause that acid reflux reaction the broth-like teas I enjoy so much do.  Having said that, the pronounced fruit or floral flavor of the brew tells me that it may be something I drink for a can or two before reverting to the hearty (however feeble the decaffeinated version of the hearty is) brews I generally enjoy.<br />Actually, the English Breakfast Tea produced by 'Ahmad Tea' is one I highly recommend as a most delicious, full-floral-note flavored tea that brews up a hearty liquor.  It's the closest thing yet I've found that balances well industrial strength and high fashion flavor.<br />As for this tea, it is all high fashion flavor and, while I can't say that I love it, tastes real good.
