Best cinnamon I have found and used in over 45 years of Baking.<br />I am a repeat customer for this Frontier Cinnamon Powder (Korintje / A Grade (3% oil).<br />On my first order, I found reviews stating the 3% Oil  was a much stronger flavor and aroma than normal cinnamon (Such as McCormick's), and others just CAN"T COMPARE. AND that the Korintje cinnamon was equivalent to cinnamon so popular from CINNABUNS.<br />I have won several ribbons for my baking, and have had some of my receipes published. I now have reqular orders and some special orders from customers that consider my Carrot Cake among the best. I give some of that credit to the use of this cinnamon in my carrot CAKE receipe, and my husband "RAVES" for my STICKY BUNS with pecans. I first considered and tried using less of the cinnamon, than originally called for in my receipes. (And that works well, and makes for less cost for the receipe). But I have found (including suggestion from my husband) that using the same amount as originally called for in the recipes, just ADDS to the flavor and robust aroma of the baked goods.
