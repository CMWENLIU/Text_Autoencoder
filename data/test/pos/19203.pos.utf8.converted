Considering we have a new Keurig machine at our house we wanted to try a variety of coffee/tea products.  Instead of buying 4 boxes of flavors we opted to purchase this "variety" product.  After reading quite a few reviews on Amazon I was skeptical on purchasing a "variety" pack thinking I wouldn't truly get a "big variety."  However, this sampler says you are "guaranteed 35 different K-cups" and they are right-we recieved all different cups, hot chocolate, caramel apple cider, flavored coffee, non-flavored coffee, iced tea, chai tea and decaf.  Some were even "limited edition" flavors.  I will buy from this company again-wonderful supply!
