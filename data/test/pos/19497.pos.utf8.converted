So, I started a gluten-free diet about two months ago. I have baked gluten-free bread, but other than that, haven't really tried to replace other wheat products. This was my first try of a gluten-free pasta. I've had quinoa before and really liked it so it seemed like a good bet.<br /><br />Even so, I wasn't expecting a miracle. Even as it cooked and I was tasting for doneness, I was noticing grainy textures that weren't that great. But I kept tasting, and right around the suggested cook time, it smoothed out. I drained immediately and dressed with a really light sauce. There is no noticeable "off" flavor to the pasta and it has a great "al dente" texture. I am confident I could serve this to someone who didn't know it was regular pasta and they'd never think anything of it.
