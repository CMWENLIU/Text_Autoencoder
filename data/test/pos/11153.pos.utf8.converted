We sent Woods and Water as well as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ESMHOI">Cameron's Gold Cup Whole Bean Coffee, 32-Ounce Bag</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ESS8D2">Cameron's Intense French Whole Bean Coffee, 32-Ounce Bag</a> to my husband's parents as a gift.  They typically only drink Starbucks coffee but we went out on a limb based on all the good reviews for Cameron's coffee.  They like all three coffees, but they said in particular they like Woods and Water the most.  Once we move back to the US, we're going to try Cameron's out too!
