During the summer months, I enjoy iced tea and prefer to make sun tea because it's so darn simple & energy-efficient. But finding tea that does well in the sun is difficult. The regular teas (black, green, white) become bitter when left standing too long, not surprisingly a requirement for sun tea. The herbals (fruits, chamomiles, mints) never seem to steep well in the sun and are generally bland & lack-luster. But this tea ... ah, heaven. Deep, robust, sweet, well-rounded. Personally, I think it is better as a sun tea than steeped the traditional way with hot water.<br /><br />This tea steeps well in morning or afternoon sun. I always use glass (never plastic) and 6 bags for about 1.5 quarts. Makes a fantastic tea in 3-4 hours, and letting it sit for a couple more hours produces a tea that definitely needs to be watered down. Needs no sugar, no lemon. Perfect as is. Awesome, just awesome. I wouldn't go a summer without it.<br /><br />I pick it up at Trader Joe's, and occassionally I find it at Target and Wal-mart. Nevertheless, considering that shipping is included in a subscription, Amazon's S&S price is fair and on-par with B&M retail outlets.
