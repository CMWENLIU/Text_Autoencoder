Carrington Farms organic milled flax seeds are delicious with a slight nutty flavor kind of like wheat germ. But flax seeds are so much better for you and the texture is great! To get the full benefits of flax seeds, they must be ground or cut in some way or will pass straight through the body with all the nutrients still inside the seeds. They are a pain to grind yourself and measure exact amounts without a scale. These packets are fantastic because they are pre-measured, the flax seeds are already ground, they do not become dangerously rancid, and one a day on cereal or in a bowl of soup is a powerhouse of nutrients and positive health benefits. Centuries ago, Charlemagne made it law that people in his kingdom consume flaxseed because he believed in its health benefits so much! One of these packets has 2 grams of protein, 3 grams of soluble/insoluble fiber, zinc, B vitamins, 90mg of potassium (and only 4.8 mg of sodium!), sulfur, magnesium and on and on and on....<br /><br />The importance of balancing Omega 3 to Omega 6 appears to help so much with almost any type of inflammation from arthritis to intestinal inflammation. The proper balance also can help with depression. As well, some studies have indicated that consuming an adequate amount of milled flax seeds everyday can lower cholesterol as effectively as statin drugs without the side effects. Milled flax seeds seem to help diabetics because of the fiber and micro-nutrients, and also help people with a number of skin conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, and those who just want over-all better skin condition. It may even help those wih dry eye syndrome. It's good for weight loss too with all the micro-nutrients and beneficial oils which help burn fat.<br /><br />I believe Carrington Farms is packaging a little miracle in each packet! Stay with it once you begin with the milled flaxseed. Depending on how out of balance your Omega 3 to Omega 6 may be, balancing may take some time. I noticed almost IMMEDIATE improvement in my well being, arthritis pain, and blood sugar control. Not enough good could ever be written for such a wonderful product! This is a TEN STAR product as FIVE STARS are not enough!
