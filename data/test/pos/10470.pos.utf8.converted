This is my favorite comfort food when I am hungry and thinking about breaking my diet.  Very filling and I don't miss having the croutons or cheese. This soup is so flavorful that served plain I feel like I am indulging.  Also makes a really good substitute for chicken broth for when I cook my pot roast. Sodium (25% of daily allowance) is not a concern for me, although it could be for others.
