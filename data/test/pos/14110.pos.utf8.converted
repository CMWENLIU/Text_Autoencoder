I have used Dreamfields Healthy Carb Living pastas for over a year now.  I like the taste of whole wheat pastas, but some people don't or they don't want to eat it all the time.  If you are a low-carber (or not) who misses the regular semolina pasta with all the full-carb taste, then this pasta is definitely for you.  It tastes Sooooo good!  I have tried all of the shapes, and they are all great.  No more waiting for special occasions or treats to get the high-carb taste you love.  With 1 gram fat, 5 grams fiber (4g soluble/1g insoluble), 7 grams protein, and only 5 grams digestible carbs, you can't go wrong buying this great product.<br /><br />Dreamfields is great for those who have diabetes or metabolic or insulin resistance, or people who want to eat low-glycemic, low-carb, Atkins, Body for Life, etc.  Macaroni and Cheese, Lasagna, Meatballs and Spaghetti, Linguine with Clam Sauce, Penne Primavera--endless possibilities for low-carb meals, now.  I can't wait for other shapes to be introduced (hint, hint)--fettucine, cavatappi, orzo, angel hair, and on and on.
