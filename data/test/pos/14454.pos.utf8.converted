After an usually unpleasant cycle, I started drinking this tea daily.  I have one cup in the morning after breakfast and one or two in the afternoon or evening.  My last cycle was noticeably better!  This did not help at all with the pms mood swings or water retention (which is does not claim to do) but I did notice that my actual period was much more pleasant than it has been in a long time.  I also noticed that the "flow" itself was different, more consistent, fewer clots, etc.  I can best describe the whole experience by saying that it seemed very healthy and what I would expect my "ideal" cycle to be like (except for the pms!).  Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />This tea is delicious and I would drink it even if I saw no benefit.  Its slightly sweet with a hint of mint and an undertone of raspberry leaf flavor.  Very complex and delicious.  I love this tea!  Very nice product!
