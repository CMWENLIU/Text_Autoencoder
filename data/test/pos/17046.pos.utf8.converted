I bought these seeds not as a spice for food,but for hair.I've read, that fenugreek seeds are the best treatment for flaky scalp and dandruff.Just add little water to couple spoonfuls and leave it for overnight.Then blend it to paste consistency,apply to the hair,leave it for 20-30 min.Wash with mild shampoo and rinse.It so easy and handy.<br />Thank you,Amazon
