After ordering a Bubble Tea in CT restaurant, I was anxious to try this at home.  They were just as good. The only drawback is making them is a bit time-consuming, since they must be heated/boiled, then allowed time to cool before adding to the tea. They also come in large bags and I feel like a lot of them go to waste unless you use them often or try placing them in smaller bags and storing (unsure if they would retain freshness). They tasts great and have that addictive chewy texture. Will try storing them differently, perhaps in freezer to extend life of extra.
