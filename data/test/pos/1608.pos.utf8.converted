Turmeric tea? It is a lot more gingery than turmeric in flavor. I like it so much that I wouldn't change a thing. I was feeling adventurous and I picked this up. I'm so glad that I did! Usually when I buy a new tea, I might enjoy it, but I don't forsake my old favorites. With this tea, I drank almost nothing else until it was all gone! And now I crave more.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this tea is that it doesn't need anything else. To my tastebuds, it is already sweet in flavor, so I don't add any honey to my this tea, which is great for my waistline. Turmeric also shows cancer fighting properties, so I get the added benefit of feeling better about my health when I drink it.<br /><br />Not only do I love drinking this tea, I've been cooking with this tea, too. It makes for a much more interesting oatmeal breakfast.
