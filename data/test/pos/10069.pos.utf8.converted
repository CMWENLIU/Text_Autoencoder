This is my favorite flavor out of all the coffee, teas and espressos for the Kaldi. I've tried them all more than a few times each to give them a relatively fair review, but this one tops my list. I do have to admit that I prefer espresso drinks over coffee and teas, so take that into consideration.<br /><br />The Italian espresso is smooth, bold and full of flavor, but doesn't leave a bitter after-taste. The other two espresso flavors leave a taste in your mouth where it feels like something's missing.<br /><br />My favorite espresso drink is an iced latte, and this makes the perfect latte. Two shots of the espresso with about 6 ounces of milk makes my perfect drink!<br /><br />Out of the three caffeinated espressos, the Italian tops the list for flavor, then the Premium and lastly the Continental.
