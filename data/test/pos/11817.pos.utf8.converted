Have you ever flown into the SF/Bay Area, and seen those colorful pools of liquid in the bay? Ever wondered what these are? Well, these are salt evaporation ponds owned by Cargill. This is where they harvest salt for their Diamond Crystal brand of kosher salt.<br /><br />Pity, this salt is usually dismissed as suitable only for pickling or making ice cream. I can buy this salt in smaller, 500 gram cardboard shakers like ordinary salt. I cannot honestly say that it tastes better than that other brand with a girl with umbrella, but Diamond Crystal is the one I always use for everything. Due to the rather large and bulky size of the crystals, you have to measure out twice the volume of this salt compared to ordinary, granulated, table salt.<br /><br />I saw a local PBS TV show about these salt ponds, and it sure seemed like a top drawer gourmet product commensurate with the other, gourmet food products that the Bay Area regularly produces. If you want this gourmet, SF salt,you will have to buy this Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt, as Cargill does not sell it to anyone. I am glad the ridiculous craze for 'gourmet' salt has faded, and that twenty dollar containers of 4 oz. of salt are sitting on grocers' shelves gathering dust. This brand is the only one you need.
