If your grandma ever made molasses cookies, they might have tasted like these extraordinary ginger snaps! They're light and snappy, without being a jaw-breaker. The amount of ginger and sugar is just right and the molasses is unsulphured, thus, there's no yucky aftertaste. The Country Choice vanilla wafers are equally delicious! At over six bucks a pound, these cookies are a bit pricey, but worth every penny. Try these with a nice cup of tea or an ice-cold glass of milk. Now, try not to eat the whole box full...I dare you!
