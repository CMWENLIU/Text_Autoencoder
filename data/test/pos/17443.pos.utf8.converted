We became hooked on this iced tea several years ago and have since not been able to find it in our local grocery stores.  All we can find are the diet mixes that use artificial sweeteners - - this one is sugar sweetened.<br />On a whim, I decided to try Amazon - - - here it is.  It was only sold by the case however, the product is shelf stable and we go through it quite quickly as our family drinks this all year round.<br />Tip - - Brewed as directed tends to be a tad too sweet for our taste so we doctor the mix a little by brewing a pot of strong tea using tea bags, then use this mix to flavor and sweeten the tea.  Play around with the doctored measurements to suit your own taste, but we brew 5 teabags, mix with 5 tbsp of mix to fill a standard 2 quart pitcher.
