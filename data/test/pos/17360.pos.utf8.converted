I bought this hoping it could be used in place of the more expensive Bronte pistachio paste in David Lebovitz's Pistachio Gelato recipe.  Apparently pistachio paste is not as standardized as peanut butter.  I used the same amount as was called for in the recipe, but it was far too strong and had an unpleasant aftertaste.  I would never attempt to substitute this for Bronte paste, despite the higher price of the Bronte paste.  I gave this 5 stars because it isn't a fair comparison.  It smelled great when opened, and had I used it on bread or in another recipe, I'm sure it would have tasted wonderful.  I had to give this review though to warn others who  might want to save some money on their Pistachio Gelato.
