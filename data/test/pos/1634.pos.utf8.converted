There's little question that these cookies have the crumbly pastry-like taste associated with European biscuits in general, they're flaky good like a buttery crust, although not quite as rich and moist as Vienna's finest. The insides is moister; howver, replete with creamy soft chocolate flvor, almost pudding-like in consistency. However, your Honor, since there's a nutritional debate among these reviews, I'd like to enter into evidence the incontrovertible the facts right off this 5.3 ounce package OF "HITs" that I hold in my hand.<br /><br /> Exhibit A.<br /><br />The following shows the amount and percent of the recommended daily allowance (rda) of one serving - that's two HIT cookies, or 27 grams--based on a 2,000 calorie/day diet.In one serving (two cookies (27 grams):<br /><br />Calories per serving: 140, total fat =7 grams (11%), Saturated fat=6 grams (29%), Cholesterol, 0 grams; sodium, 75 mg (3%); and 17 grams (6%) of carbohydrates, including 1 gram (3%) of  dietary fiber and 9 grams of sugar--and two grams of protein. You also get 2%  of the RDA of Calcium, and 4% of iron.<br /><br />Exhibit B:<br /><br />Compare this to "one serving" or two (28 grams) cookies of wheat-free/dairy free, mostly organic Newman O's (a somewhat healthier version of the classic OREO): Total fat (4.5 grams), Saturated fat (1.5 g). Trans fat (0 g), calories (130), sugar (10.0 grams), Total Carbohydrates, (31.5g), dietary fiber (1 g), protein (2 g), sodium (85 mg), no cholesterol, iron (8%).<br /><br />Nutritional conclusion (As always, consult  your physician!):<br /><br />Newman's beats the pants off HIT  in total fat, saturated fat (HIT has 4 times as much), twice as much of the RDA of iron but has over twice as many carbohydrates, and minimally more sugar and sodium.<br /><br />Style points:<br /><br />I can see Audrey Hepburn eating a HIT bar (without the bright wrapper) or something like it, served on a silver platter, with Italian coffee or perhaps some tea.  I cannot see her, unless she's slumming it in "Roman Holiday" eating an Oreo, even one owned by an actor as great as Paul Newman. HIT cookies--loved by kids, suitable for the adult.<br /><br /> Offered here at a great price; moveover, Amazon.com ships this free on eligible orders of $25 or more.
