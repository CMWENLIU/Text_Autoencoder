I have pretty much been living on Amy's food for about 8 years now, when I can't eat fresh or am too lazy to cook from scratch. The Berliner family (Amy's Mom and Dad) has done the world a major service in proving that frozen and canned food can be truly healthy. (Please stay private! Going public and thinking mainly of profits will ruin the food, no doubt.)<br /><br />Their pesto pizza is so good it's ridiculous. I've eaten about a thousand of those, maybe two. All their products are hand-made from organic ingredients, and the prices are more than fair considering the quality.<br /><br />I love Thai food, especially Tom Kha and green curry (hint hint, Miss Amy!). This soup holds up well to some of the better TKs I've had in good Thai restaurants. It is spicy but not overwhelming, creamy but not too thick, and in general simply dang yummy!! Easily the best canned Thai soup I've ever had (except for Satay soups, made by Austin's wonderful Foo Swasdee, but sadly her canned food biz stopped a while back (her restaurants are still here, though, and still great. Foo is a wonderful lady!)).<br /><br />Good Thai chow is almost everything I want from food: nutritious and healthy and extremely tasty, with many flavors complementing but not overwhelming each other. This soup is all that.<br /><br />And as always with organic food, by buying this not only are you getting the healthiest food, you're helping support people who care about the health of our planet, and not supporting people who don't.<br />Many thanks to the Berliner family for making the best pre-packaged food on the planet.<br /><br />I could live on this stuff.<br /><br />Wait...I do...
