I really love this product.  It came pretty fast and well packaged.  It's 100% pure Cocoa Butter so it has a wonderful faint chocolate smell, its hard, and a little waxy to the touch.  However, it works wonders for the skin if you know how to use it. I know some people had a hard time trying to figure out how to use it so I have provided some instructions if you want to try it.<br /><br />~First remove the chucks from the container and melt it down in a pot over a low flame.  Once the chucks of Cocoa Butter are completely melted turn the flame off to avoid the oil becoming too hot and popping.  Infuse with your favorite oil, just make sure it's all natural like i.e. "grape seed oil", "emu oil", or an "olive oil".  Pure in about 3/4 to 1/2 a cup of the oil with the melted Cocoa Butter.  Mix it in then put the mixture into a plastic container with a lid and put it in freezer over night.  In the morning you will have a softer more usable product the melts when you rub it in your hands.  Use it for your heals, knees, elbows, or all over for soft conditioned skin.  It absorbs fast and leaves your skin completely moisturized it's great for blending or fading dark spot and healing of stretch marks.  Enjoy!
