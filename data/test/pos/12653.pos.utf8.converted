GET ORGANIC UN-HULLED SEEDS THAT HAVE NUTRITIONAL VALUE SINCE HULLED SEEDS ARE EMPTY CALORIES, WORTHLESS...<br /><br />I have been consuming seeds for years. Unfortunately in the beginning not too many people knew (infact they still don't) that seeds like flax seed and sesame seed have no nutritional value unless;<br />1. Seeds are fresh, not old and rancid,<br />2. Grinded in a coffee grinder,<br />3. Consumed within few days,<br />4. Kept in the freezer,<br />5. Kept in a dark place not exposed to light,<br />6. Oils and supplements are worthless since it goes rancid.<br /><br />So for few years although I consumed those seeds, I got no nutritional value out of flax seed oil which was very expensive to purchase till I learned the above pointers. I can not grind sesame seed in the grinder since it is so oily and ruins the grinder. Flax seed is the best balancer. Regardless of that, I have to consume both seeds due to the high mineral content which is a necessity for my healthy diet. For years I have been doing blood test and my omega-3 has been much higher than the highest level required for my age, year after year. Although I consume fish, it is the flax seed that pushes my omega-3 higher.<br /><br />1. Sesame seed for calcium, protein, phytosterols and host of other minerals and vitamins<br />2. Flax seed for omega-3 fatty acids with no cholesterol, to increase good cholesterol HDL<br />3. Cocoa for antioxidants instead of eating chocolate with sugar and unnecessary additional additives<br />4. Protein isolate for a complete amino acid chain without the fat, cholesterol and extra calories<br />I mix it all with organic soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis to feel full and have all the necessary vitamins and minerals without much spike in my glucose, fat or calories.
