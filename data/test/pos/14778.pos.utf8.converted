The Frontier Celery Seed Whole, 16 Ounce Bags (Pack of 3), that I purchased directly from Amazon, is without impurities.  The seeds smell divine and taste even better.<br /><br />Since these are whole seeds, they should stay delicious for quite some time.  I am thrilled to have 3 lbs. of these seeds, as I can use the extra to make spice mixes for gifts.  Thanks again to Amazon and Frontier.
