Though not as famous as Top Ramen, Maruchan Ramen Noodles are still good eats when you're on a budget.  As is usually the case with Ramen soups, the beef flavor is the best, followed by pork, then "oriental" flavor, then chicken.  You can find many different ways to "dummy" it up, but it's best served in a bowl, soaking in those delicious juices.  You can also make a fine spaghetti using these noodles, ketchup, and sliced hot dogs.  Not gourmet to be sure, but still a decent meal.
