I am writing this as I sip my first Newman's K-cup, and it's fantastic.  OK, not the same as a fresh cup from my local Caribou Coffee, but it's bold and dark, full of flavor, and not burnt tasting at all.  I have found most of the K-cups I tried to produce dishwater, just not enough coffee in them to make a full-flavor cup.  I have been drinking Timothy's Midnight Magic Extra Bold, also very nice--just ran out, and picked up the Newman's at Costco (no time for shipping).  It's a very worthy competitor, very very nice.
