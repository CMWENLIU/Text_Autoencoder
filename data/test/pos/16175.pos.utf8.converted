I grew up drinking coconut water in my hometown. I still have those vivid memories -young coconut, the jellied meat inside of it, and of course, the water itself. Wow! So delicious, and so good for your health. I am not living back home anymore, but I still crave it very often. So, I went to a health store near my home, and I purchased all kinds of different brands available at this particular store. Some were: ew!!!  others were: ok.<br />Then, about a week ago --I came across the Nirvana brand -and I am so glad I did. I subscribed and got a heck of a deal from Amazon.<br />Thank You Amazon!<br />I love the taste! I got mine with the pulp -and oh my God! Delicious!<br />Give it a try -you won't be dissapointed!<br />Enjoy! :-)
