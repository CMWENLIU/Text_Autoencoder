When you are 80 years old, you know when something taste incredibly good. Rich, smooth, and just the right amount of ingredients to make you say, "Man, that is good!"  I usually add a little more of the Wild Tribe when making this treat with a cup lined with a swirl of chocolate syrup and topped with some whipping cream. For a little extra flavor, I occasionally add a shot of espresso.
