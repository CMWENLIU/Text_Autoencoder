Last weekend I had to chance to BBQ one of these bad boys up for my 3 Wolf Moon T-Shirt / City of Heroes Supergroup. I chose to take the Beer can Chicken approach, but replaced the Chicken with Rabbit and the Beer with Red Bull. All I can say is that it was scrum diddlyicous. After dinning on this fine vermin, we settled in for a night of online gaming. I kid you not, this meat of the gods improved our game play by at least 30%.
