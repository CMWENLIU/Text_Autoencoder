It's a bit less nutrients than steel-cut oats, but on the positive side, it's exceptionally fast to cook, literally a couple of minutes; I stir it into boiling water, then add about one-square-inch-worth of torn-up orange peel, then -- bubble-bubble toil and trouble -- stir it from a few secs to maybe a minute (on high heat), then cover and turn it off, and go about my business, take a shower or something. When I'm back it's ready.<br /><br />The texture is kinda like thick glue (depending on the amount of water: unlike steel-cut oats, this seems capable of sucking in any amount of water); the taste is sufficiently different from steel-cut oats so you can alternate them on consecutive days w/o feeling you're eating the same thing. I like to add a teaspoon of butter, two-three tablespoons of sunflower seeds, one cut-up banana (combined with the orange peel tastes great), and sprinkle on a bit of either sugar or parmesan. Comes out pretty nice! I wouldn't eat it every day, but every other day is fine. And the price (ten bucks a package) is quite good too. Nothing to complain about! Five stars. And thanks to other reviewers, 'cause I bought this thing to try after reading these reviews here. They're not lying! It's good stuff.
