I first bought this salt when I visited France about 4 years ago when I saw it in a grocery store. Then I saw Ina Garten using it. Well the French and Ina are right.<br /><br />This is a lovely finishing salt. Definitely do not use it when you are cooking. It is too crystalline and not meant to be used that way.<br /><br />It is something to add just before serving.<br /><br />I love just a pinch on veggies or eggs or whatever you want. Adds a nice salt crunch and is not too briny.<br /><br />Remember just using a pinch at a time makes this last a long time so it is a good bargain as well.
