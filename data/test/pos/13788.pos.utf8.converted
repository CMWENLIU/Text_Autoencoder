I'm American and have never been to the UK.  I don't even remember how or why I first tried Marmite.  Years ago anyway.  I love it.  Loooooooooove it.  If you like salty flavors and like chips over sweets, then you'll probably like this.  Very salty and slightly meaty flavored.  And it is vegan.  My dad says it tastes like an old barn smells.  He may be right.  I guess I like the taste of an old barn.
