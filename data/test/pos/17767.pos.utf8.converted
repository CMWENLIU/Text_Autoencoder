McCann's steel cut is the best, no question about it, but when the price increased to more than 22 cents an ounce, I decided to try Trader Joe's Country Choice steel cut oats ($2.99 for a 30 oz. can - 10 cents an ounce).  These oats aren't quite as good as McCann's, but they're pretty darn close in these times of austerity.  If you have a Trader Joe's nearby, give them a try.
