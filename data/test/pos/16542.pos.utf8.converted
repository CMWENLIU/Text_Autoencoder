Wheat Chex<br /><br />I never imagined that our cereal would some day be delivered via UPS, but since Amazon's free-shipping price is 1/3 lower than our local Safeway, that's where we get it.<br /><br />- It tastes great, even with the non-fat milk we've been using forever.<br /><br />- Dry cereals made from wheat are much more filling than those made from corn, rice, or oats.  I have to eat twice as much to be full, if the cereal is made from those grains.<br /><br />- It stays reasonably crunchy the entire meal, and I have a big bowl every morning.<br /><br />- It stays fresh in an opened box; although at the rate it's consumed around here, that's usually not very long.<br /><br />- It stays fresh in an unopened box for many months.<br /><br />- Good daily dose of fiber, although that's not the reason I eat it.<br /><br />- The box and inner plastic bag open easily. My wife eats a Kellogg's brand cereal and opens the inner bag with scissors, as it can't be pulled apart.<br /><br />- If you are a regular Wheat Chex customer, save 15% through Amazon's "Subscribe & Save" offer; prominently displayed on the product page.<br /><br />I've been eating this stuff for 50 years.  When I travel to a foreign country, one of the things I miss is this cereal.  Guess you could say I'm a loyal customer...
