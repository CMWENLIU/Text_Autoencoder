I purchased this item first at my local Giant just to try, it was a bit pricey at $3.50/each.  I tried it and I was immediately hooked.  I do really like tuna and the tuna found in this product is very good, the pieces are firm and not all mashed up and turned into paste.  After finding out that Sam's Club doesn't carry this I looked it up on Amazon.com and found it for $2.50/each so I bought several packs.  I am a university student and my eating habits are especially bad. I often skip breakfast and don't eat a lunch until after 4 pm.  Since a microwave is not readily accessible to me the fact that this tastes GREAT without heating is a huge plus.  I am an extremely picky eater and I found this to be very tasty and convenient.  The fact that this item is vacuum sealed and does not contain any preservatives is also a plus.  The included spork is quite sturdy and it is individually wrapped and there is also a sachet of "Orange & Acacia Honey" that is included which I don't think is mentioned in the product description.  With this I can pack one of these to eat around lunch time and I no longer have to starve for half the day.
