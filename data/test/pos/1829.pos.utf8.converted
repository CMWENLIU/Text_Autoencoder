I suppose it is splitting hairs as to how you define cane syrup, but as this product contains only pure cane sugar and water (and perhaps a bit of preservative), it qualifies to be called pure cane syrup.  This really is just simple sugar syrup, made with water and pure cane sugar.  You could make it yourself at home, or buy it already made and ready to use.
