For us diabetics, this sugar-free Hershey's chocolate syrup is just the ticket!  It tastes FABULOUS -- so good that no one would guess it was sugar-free unless you told.  Pour it over your favorite sugar-free ice cream (mine is mint chocolate chip), and you can enjoy a treat fit for a king or queen (diabetic or not) without having to watch your blood sugar go crazy.  Thank you, Hershey's, for making such a WONDERFUL product !!!
