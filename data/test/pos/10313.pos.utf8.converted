When I told my wife I had been searching for Pickled Green Tomatoes she asked if I had lost my mind and said "YUCK". I explained that I had some years ago and loved them. I bought the Jake&Amos 3 pack, chilled them and talked her into trying one. Since then I've only had a couple. Now I'm having to order more. If you like Pickles, you will love these. Five stars, now please rush my new order because every one else has eaten all my Pickled Green Tomatoes.
