Great product.  Comes with noodles, spice packet, and vegetable packet.  These noodles are spicy as other reviewers have mentioned.  You can decrease the hotness by only adding a little of the spice packet.  I didn't care for the vegetable packet, but that is a personal choice.  These cook up nicely in the microwave in about 3 minutes, comparable to other store bought ramen noodles. ENJOY! :)
