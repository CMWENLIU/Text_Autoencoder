Excellent product and a good value, too. Once you have the real deal from Italy, you will NEVER go back to the green shaker tube. Don't be dismayed if you find that the yellowed crust is too hard to grate. Save it and use it in sauces or soups.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;UPDATE>>>>>> July 12, 2011. Just received another order, and the quality and packaging is great. This time, I cut the crust into 1/4" cubes, and put in my food processor. It grated easily, and can now be used on spaghetti and other recipes.
