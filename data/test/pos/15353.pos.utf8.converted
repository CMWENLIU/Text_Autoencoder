I have been buying aloe vera drink from one popular brand for quite a long time. So I was a bit unwilling to try something new, but I really liked this stuff. Refreshing, delicious, with pleasant grapy taste and only 60 calories! Also it appeared to be a great natural alternative for soda. My children are delighted with its yummy pulp! I'll definitely be ordering more.
