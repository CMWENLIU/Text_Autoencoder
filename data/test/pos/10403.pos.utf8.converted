Celestial Seasonings Cinnamon Apple Spice Herbal Tea<br /><br />Is this for real? I read the box: no calories, no sodium, no sugar, no carbohydrates, caffeine free. This does not taste like any herbal tea I have had before.<br /><br />The cinnamon packs zing, the apple is sweet, and the chamomile provides the tongue appeal.  This is a full bodied tea, almost like drinking espresso.<br /><br />Without the caffeine.<br /><br />Delicious.  I had no idea that an herbal tea could be so satisfying.<br /><br />Like savoring the hard candy shell of a candy apple without the mess or the calories.<br /><br />Ingredients;<br /><br />Cinnamon - Yes, overwhelmingly.<br /><br />Hibiscus - That explains the sweetness.  When I lived in the Virgin Islands we would pluck hibiscus blooms and suck the nectar from the flowers' bases.<br /><br />Chamomile - The alkaline feel of the tea on my tongue comes from the chamomile.<br /><br />Roasted Chicory - Chicory, yes, that provides the full bodied, peppery sensation.<br /><br />Orange Peel - More zing!<br /><br />Roasted Carob - I can see how they layered this tea to give it so much weight.<br /><br />Natural Cinnamon and Apple Flavors and Natural Flavors - Okay, I'll admit that sounds like they added a drop of this flavored syrup and and drop of that.<br /><br />I don't care.<br /><br />This is great herbal tea.
