I used to buy this stuff in tiny expensive packages at the grocery store, so I was very happy to find I could get it in larger and vastly more economical quantities at Amazon. It makes a great peanut sauce; mix it up with some coconut milk and boom! Quick and easy. I have also used it on baked chicken, fish, and vegetables, particularly a mixture of cauliflower, carrots, and broccoli. You just take your cut up veggies, toss them in a little oil or butter, coat them with the spice mix, and bake them until you think they're done. It really adds life to vegetables.
