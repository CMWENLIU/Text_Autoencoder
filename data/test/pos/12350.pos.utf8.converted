And way too yummy for my waistline! How come I can't award these things fifteen stars, anyway?<br /><br />Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips are without a doubt, the most delicious cinnamon treats I've ever eaten.  They remind me of the best bite of an apple pie crust, without the apples and the goopy moistness of eating an apple pie out of a bag.  With Stacy's Pita Chips, you open the bag and get this tiny puff of cinnamon aroma and you are compelled to dive in, face first and mouth open.  Sharing is not recommended, but the sharing police aren't going to do anything to you if you give a couple to someone you love dearly.  However, that night you will lie in bed unable to sleep, obsessing about each chip that you gave away, and your stomach will growl accusingly.  Be warned.<br /><br />Happily, now that you have found these chips on Amazon, you will not go broke because of your addiction.  They have a superb price, far better than anything I have found in Boston area supermarkets.  For example, I save over a buck every time I eat a bag of chips from Amazon.  I'm eating several bags a day, and at dollar apiece, I am going to be rich, rich, rich!  (sorry, richness not guaranteed in your area)<br /><br />On a less spectacular note:  a baked treat is not a fat-free treat, and calories are the punishment for yumminess.  The bag claims that a portion is a measly eleven(!) chips!  Eleven!  I've had more than eleven chips while writing this paragraph. That miniscule amount of flavory goodness is packed not only with wonderfulness, but also with 140 calories!  The tiny snack size bag has 1.5 ounces, and is supposed to feed 1.5 people. That also means it has about 17 chips in it, and I'd be licking the inside of the bag, embarrassing myself for all time, and adding 210 calories to my personal fat-retention system.<br /><br />You may wish to purchase and split a case of Stacy's Pita Chips with a friend, so that you can both wear swimwear without embarrassment in the coming season.  Make sure that your friend is there when the friendly delivery person arrives with your chips, or your friendship might be endangered. (Or you might have to buy a second case to split with the friend, but that leaves your waistline in worse shape than it was before)  Better yet, make friends with the delivery person, and split the case with him.<br /><br />Enjoy your tasty treats, and if you have difficulty making friends, the kind you would want to share your Stacy's Pita Chips with, I am a kind and friendly person, and can be trusted to split a case fairly and evenly.
