When Kraft quit making Postum we had to find an alternative - it was already an alternative to coffee, so this would be plan C.  We explored every avenue we could find in our small town at all the local stores and on the internet.  We found Pero on line and decided to stick our necks out to try a case of it.  We have not been disappointed.  We like it better than coffee.  It is smooth with no bitterness.  It mixes well with hot chocolate and tastes good straight and black if that's what you want.  We will be buying more of it and some friends will be doing the same after they tasted it.
