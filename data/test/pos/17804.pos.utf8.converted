I've been drinking Kronung since 1999 when I was stationed in Germany.  It has a wonderful taste that is distinct and tastes premium.  My friends would beg for coffee whenever they came over.  Usually I buy it at the DECA Commissaries but they were out this time and I cannot drink another brand at home.  Now I live in the coffee capital, Seattle, and they don't have anything that can compare to Kronung.  If you are curious, give it a try and you will be hooked.
