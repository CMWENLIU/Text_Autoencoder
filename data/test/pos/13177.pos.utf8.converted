I spent an hour one day tasting a variety of expensive olive oils at the St. Lawrence Market in Toronto and came home with something very pricy that tasted like car grease.  The following day in exasperation I just hauled something off the shelf at our local supermarket and it turned out to be fantastic.  Masserie di Sant'Eramo (the "flavourful" kind, not the "delicate" version) always gets compliments and it's very difficult to find; no other supermarket in Toronto or where we live now on the west coast has it, at least to my knowledge.  I was delighted to find that it's available through Amazon since I had given up hope of finding it anywhere other than at Loblaws in Toronto.  Strongly recommended!
