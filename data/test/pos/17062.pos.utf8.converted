Having a parent with adult onset diabetes led me to try some alternatives for sweetner and avoid the chemicals found in standard restaurant 'sugar' options. This is great. It is very sweet, can be used in place of sugar, honey & we added a smidgeon of maple syrup flavor to it and it acts and tastes like maple syrup as well for FAR less cost and better 'sugar' or glucose impact on the body. We use in recipes, with some modifications, tea, on fruit - etc<br />We've passed this on to others as well. Buy in multiples - it saves you even more!!
