With the Dolce Gusto coffee system, you get a lot of choices. I find myself having more different types of coffee throughout the day, and this carousel helps me make those choices. Everything is neat and compact and easy to see. It's also great if you have guests because they can see all their coffee choices right in front of them. I doubt without the carousel that anyone would say to me, BTW, could you make me a quick latte macchiato? But with the capsules right in front of their faces, it's easy to see they can have whatever coffee their heart desires. From a cappuccino to a hot chocolate or tea, it's like a barista in my kitchen. Love it. It makes the coffee capsules very attractive and easy to store and choose. Looks nice on the counter.
