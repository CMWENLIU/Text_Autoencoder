I drink a lot of iced tea (unsweetened, you crazy Southerners), but not a lot of hot tea. This stuff is going to be used in my iced though. Had a cup last night and man oh man, this was tasty. It has an excellent fruit flavor going on, but you can still taste the tea (that's my one issue with many flavored teas). It was smooth, and crisp, and felt like the flavors just keep hitting your tongue as it goes down. It's going to take me a bit to discern the different tastes in here, but they work so well together, mostly I'm just enjoying them all. Great stuff, I highly recommend if you like flavored teas.
