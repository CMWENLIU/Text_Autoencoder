I tend to have quick breakfasts on the run before work in the mornings, so I often rely on quick, easy foods like bars.  However, I avoid traditional breakfast bars, which tend to be high in sugar and have little-to-no protein.  Rather, I want something that is going to start my day with a better nutritional value AND contain a decent amount of protein to keep me feeling full longer.  The other problem is that it's breakfast--I don't want chocolate!  Maybe true chocoholics eat chocolate at any time of the day, but I prefer something a bit more appropriate to the morning hours.<br /><br />So, after Slim-Fast changed their bars on me (loved their old Oatmeal Raisin Optima bars, but really don't like the new version), I decided to try these meal replacement bars by Special K in Honey Almond.  First of all, when I checked out the box, these bars met my nutritional requirements.  They have 10 grams of protein, which is almost as much as some bars specifically billed as protein/energy bars.  They are a good source of fiber as well, with 5 grams.  Also, the sugar is relatively low at 12 grams (just over 2 teaspoons).  Finally, although the fat content is a bit higher than I would have liked (6 grams), these bars contain only 2.5 grams saturated fat (no trans fat), so most of the fat is probably healthy fats from the almonds.<br /><br />Of course, the final test of these bars is the taste:  they are yummy!  They are chewy, with a pleasant almond-y flavor that is not too sweet (an unfortunately problem that I've found with so many bars I have tried).  These have become one of my new breakfast staples, and I definitely recommend them.
