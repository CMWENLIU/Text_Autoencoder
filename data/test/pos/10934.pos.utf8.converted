I love the blend of spices & cinnamon and the fact it's organic makes it perfect! I never liked tea before I got this stuff! In my larger than a cup stainless steel mug I add one tablespoon organic honey and then 2-3 tablespoons organic agave nectar (low glycemic index and tastes just like sugar!) and just a splash of organic whole milk. There is obviously caffeine in this stuff so I wouldn't have it after 2pm..it's great in the morning!
