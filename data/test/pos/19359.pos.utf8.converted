I have become a bit of a French Roast snob, tasting as many as I can in search of THE one which pleases my palate best.  So far <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003OPCNEO">The Bean Coffee Company Le Bean Coffee (Dark French Roast), Organic Whole Bean, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a> is that very best one.<br /><br />I prefer organically grown coffee and this is 100% organically grown Arabica beans.  The fresh flavor has great depth and is rich and smooth.  The beans are beautiful ~ dark and glistening!  The aroma is heavenly.  The beans are low acid and antioxidant rich.  This is truly a coffee of exceptional quality!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003OPCNEO">The Bean Coffee Company Le Bean Coffee (Dark French Roast), Organic Whole Bean, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a> is also an exceptional value at Amazon.  The price per pound with Amazon's Subscribe and Save program is better than the price per pound of organic French Roast coffees I have purchased elsewhere and the quality of this coffee is much better.<br /><br />I'm very happy to have found this wonderful organic French Roast coffee!
