My 15 year old son can't get enough of this rice and he is picky when it comes to food.  He heats it and eats<br />it and it's GONE! No one else in the house can get to it before it's vanished.  Easy to prepare and apparently it's delicious and of course<br />convenient so I'm ordering another batch and giving the chicken noodle<br />soup a go as well...
