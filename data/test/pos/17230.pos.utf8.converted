This is a great product. It gets great coverage with no clogging, dries quickly, doesn't change the taste, and is easier to use than an airbrush. My only complaint is that if something brushes up against whatever you sprayed with this stuff, the shine will come off and attach itself to whatever brushed up against it. After you spray, be sure not to move the cake too much or brush up against it.
