I'm very partial to canned sardines with tomato sauce.  I heat them in the microwave for about ten seconds and add ground pepper and a bit of ground sea salt and I'm good to go.  Yum!<br /><br />The Season product here surprised me with the bright red, fresh tasting tomato sauce.  There are some really good and bad sardine brands out there, but even among the best it seems that Season is a cut above.  Season is my favorite brand for small sardines.
