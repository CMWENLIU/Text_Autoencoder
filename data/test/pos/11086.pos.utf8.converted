i eat paleo so noodles are not allowed. i tried kelp noodles and barf. they were gross. they were crunchy like pickles. these are AS CLOSE TO NOODLES AS YOU CAN GET! when you open them they arent the best smell bc they are made from yam flour and lime. but i just rinse them and the flavor is very nuetral. in fact they dont taste like anything to me. i put sauce on and some sprinkle cheese....sigh...my mouth is watering! even my hubby who is very against fake anything, he LOOOOVES them. and so does my 19 month old. im telling ya, ignore that ONE negative review and try them. you wont be disappointed aside from the higher price than gluten noodles LOL
