I've never used a better deodorant. If you have used Degree for Men Ultra Clear sticks before, this is the same thing (+ silver ion technology), so you know how good it is.<br /><br />Unlike Right Guard sticks of chalk, this is not chalky or dry and leaves absolutely zero stains on your clothes (I've had huge problems with Right Guard staining my shirts). It's a solid stick, so it goes on evenly, but it's clear, so you can't see it on your armpit, even immediately after putting it on (making it good for applying in public, as well).<br /><br />Degree has the best scents, most of them (including the "Arctic Edge" scent that I chose) having a "shower fresh" smell, like a bar of Irish Spring soap. It also feels cool (temperature-wise) to apply, but in a very pleasant way (not ticklishly cold like some gels are). Even when you haven't just taken a shower, it almost feels and smells like you have after you put this on.<br /><br />Another standard Degree feature is that the entire bottom centimeter of the package rotates to advance the stick (rather than just a small ring in the center), making it easier on the fingers (great for arthritis, I would imagine).<br /><br />There is no better deodorant for men, in my opinion. In fact, I can't see any reason why a woman wouldn't use it, either, other than the label and marketing. If there's any drawback, it's that this is just a deodorant and not an anti-perspirant. I, personally, have not had any problems, but, if you're extra prone to wet armpits, you may need an anti-perspirant, instead. For most people, though, I highly recommend these Degree deodorant sticks, even those that are very picky about their deodorants, as I am.
