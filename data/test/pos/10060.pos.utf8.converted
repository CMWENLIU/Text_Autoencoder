If the price is too good to believe, well it's not.............  these Shitake are superior to supermarket brands at about half the price (which includes shipping).  Cap sizes are in the 1.25 to 1.75" range and are very uniform in shape.  Trust me, a pound of dried mushrooms is a LOT and at this price you can use them in just about anything; hint, save the soaking water, filter thru a paper towel or coffee filter in a strainer and use like wine, stock or water in soups, braises or reduction sautes.  Great flavor and can be substituted for porcini or cepes when you don't want to break the bank, though they're really best suited to asian dishes.  The reason they're so much cheaper is that they're cultivated where porcini/ceps are gathered in the wild; kind of like the difference between wild salmon and farm raised.<br /><br />10/28/11<br /><br />Please be advised that this product may or may not be the same as I purchased at the time of my review.  The vendor is entirely different and I have no confidence the product is from the same source or is in any way similar other than  by weight. I also question amazon's policy of using my review to promote a different vendor and likely different sourced product from that which I shared my experience with.<br /><br />*************<br /><br />After I posted the above revision amazon added back in the original vendor which I had experience with.  I don't know if this was coincidental or a result of my additional comment, but to ensure this doesn't become a continual issue, let me state that my purchase was made from JR Mushrooms & Specialties and that I stand by the review of the product they provided.  Any other vendor is likely to source this product differently and therefore my review should only be considered when purchasing from JR.
