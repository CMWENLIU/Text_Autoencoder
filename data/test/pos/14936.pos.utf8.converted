This honey is wonderful for regular uses, it's thickness and wonderful flavor make things like simple toast and teas better!  But this stuff works wonders when I feel cold/flu symptoms come on!  I take a spoonful everyday for 3-4 days and have avoided getting sick this season.  It also works wonders on cold sores.  I am prone to cold sores when I get sick, and medications such as Abreva have done nothing for me.  A little dab of honey on the tingling area overnight zaps any chance of a cold sore appearing.  This is a wonderful product, I ordered a dozen jars when it was $22 and gave some to my mother who is also always on the lookout for natural remedies.  I can't say enough about this stuff...
