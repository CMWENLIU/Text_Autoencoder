I love this candy! It has a pleasant, mildly sweet (rice flour) taste and the texture is similar to a powdered, soft gummy bear. The melon flavor is mild and sweet (not sour). This candy may be an acquired taste for someone who is accostumed to mainstream, super-sweet American candy. The texture may take some getting used to and the taste of rice flour may not appeal to some. All that said, I've been trying to find this candy for several years but because I didn't know the name of it, I've been making-do with my memories. Now that I've found a merchant, I plan on buying a stockpile.
