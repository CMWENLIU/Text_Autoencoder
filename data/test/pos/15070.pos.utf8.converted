I was a little hesitant to order ths, since Grade B is described as having a "stronger" flavor than Grade A, and often used in cooking.  I am delighted to report the flavor is NOT to strong, and is perfect on pancakes and waffles.  This syrup is of excellent quality at a good price, and I will continue to order it.  I pity those folks out there who think Log Cabin or Mrs. Butterworth's is what you're supposed to use on your pancakes.
