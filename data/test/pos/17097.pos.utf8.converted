There is a fine line in the love of hot sauces.  On one side of this line is the enjoyment of great tasting hot sauces shared with friends and family who also enjoy spicy food, sometimes with a good laugh at some remarkable heat.  On the other side of this line lies a realm where the great pleasures of hot sauce are intertwined with exquisite pain.<br /><br />This sauce is a good litmus test for those who are wondering if they are capable of crossing this line.  There are much, much hotter sauces out there, but you should start with a sauce like this one first.<br /><br />This sauce is not just about heat though.  It truly has a great flavor for those who can taste it over the heat.  This is a good sauce for experienced very-hot sauce afficionados.<br /><br />I highly recommend this sauce IF and only IF you are either accustomed to very hot sauces, or are looking for a good sauce to begin exploring extreme hot sauces.  If you match either of these then you will love this sauce.
