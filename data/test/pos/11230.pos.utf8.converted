I bought this product blindly, whereas I did not have a lot of information about how it actually tasted, but I was rewarded for my risk-taking.  I am a huge fan of strawberry-rhubarb pie, but being a resident of the great desert state (Wyoming), finding strawberry-rhubarb pie anywhere here is a challenge in itself.  I bought me a crust and baked it at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes and then topped a slice with ice cream and to heaven I went.  Barry Farms has gained my trust, respect and devotion, and, yes, I will be ordering from them again.
