We lost our first cat to stomach cancer when she was only 6 years old.  When we adopted our two new cats, I did a lot of research on nutrition.  I found that the grocery store brand dry food we fed our first cat was full of unnecessary carbs and fillers like corn and wheat.  Cats don't need carbs in their diet, because in the wild they would be eating live prey, and the prey's stomach contents would be the only grains the cat would get.  Keeping that in mind, I became an avid label reader.  I now feed my cats 1 can of Innova EVO or similar quality food each day, plus 1/2 cup of Innova EVO dry kibble.  If I had the time and the local resources to feed a raw diet, I would.  But Innova EVO, in combination with other super premium foods and the occasional treat of raw chicken meat, bones and organs, gives my guys super shiny coats and lots of energy.  The litter box is also not as stinky since they absorb many more nutrients.  I now have two healthy one-year-old cats who look forward to meal times and don't have any health problems.  They are well-behaved and don't shed much at all.
