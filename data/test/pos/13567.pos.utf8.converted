I purchased 15 of these for my 7 year-old's birthday party.  The kids dressed in camouflage and we let them loose in the backyard.  They had a ton of fun!  Even the parents joined in.  I think the parents had more fun than the kids did.  We went through 20 pounds of potatoes!!!  We had a few guns break during the fun, but overall they were great.  At the inexpensive price, just buy a few extra.
