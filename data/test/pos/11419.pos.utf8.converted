I've been waiting for this variety to come to Amazon, since purchasing a box locally (and paying a pretty penny...$4 a box!) and really enjoying it.<br /><br />Don't let the "cocoa" in the description mislead you...this doesn't taste like hot chocolate. The cocoa flavor is really subtle, and it gives this tea a really full, rich taste. I am usually a coffee drinker, but I think I could switch for this tea. I take it with some milk and sugar. Highly recommended.
