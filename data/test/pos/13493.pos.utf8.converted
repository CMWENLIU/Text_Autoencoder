Having read the comments about these not browning, I cooked my first batch with the oven rack raised (2nd-to-top rack), and after waiting and watching, eventually found the perfect browned/done effect after about 25-28** minutes at 350 degrees. I use a jumbo-sized muffin aluminum pan, which makes 6 large muffins.  My muffins are beautiful and they taste as good as they look, but not too sweet. I follow the instructions to the letter (including stirring, not mixing, the milk and muffin mix at the end), with one exception: I add 1/4 tsp. more vanilla than instructed (3/4 tsp. vanilla instead of 1/2 tsp. vanilla).  Then I've added 3/4 c. fresh blueberries to a few batches and 2 mashed ripe bananas to other batches.<br /><br />All of my batches have come out of the oven picture-perfectly raised to a gentle peak and golden-brown, not too dry on the bottom.  They are light and fluffy on the inside, buttery and slightly crispy on top.  Mine actually look better than the box (in my opinion, see photo); they rise a little higher than shown on the box.<br /><br />These muffins do tend to stick to the muffin paper unless you let them cool, initially.  When re-heating, I microwave them for 30 seconds and then remove the paper; I don't know why, but with this method the paper comes off very cleanly.  When either fresh out of the oven or chilled, the paper sticks; they need to be slightly warm to avoid the paper sticking too much.  Sometimes after microwaving and removing the paper, I will lightly toast it in the toaster oven to give the top a little crispiness.<br /><br />This mix seems to be very accommodating to alterations, as others have mentioned.  I am thrilled with this product and will buy it again.<br /><br />**I found I need to bake them a few minutes longer, up to 30 minutes, when using frozen berries rather than fresh berries, and 25 min. is sufficient when making these plain.  I have continued using the second-to-top rack because that works beautifully.
