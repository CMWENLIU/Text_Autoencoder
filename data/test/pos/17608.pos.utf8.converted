I purchased this product recently for my teenaged son's recurring asthma--imagine my delight and relief with finally finding something herbal that not only works but works rapidly!  This tea is quick and easy to prepare, relieves chest constriction, opens up the airways, and clears up my son's wheezing. Thank you, Traditional Medicinals, for keeping us out of the doctor's office and steroid free!
