This is my first experience with coconut oil. I heard about it and read up online and was amazed at the health benefits. I found this brand to have the best reviews/price so I went with it. I'm getting ready to purchase my 3rd one in as many months. It has a delicious yet subtle coconut flavor and is now one of only 3 oils I use in my cooking (+olive oil, avocado oil).<br /><br />My uses:<br />-Replace butter/fat/oil for non-stick cooking - except when using olive or avocado oil, this is my go to. In the skillet before eggs/bacon/pancakes/etc.<br />-On toast/pancakes etc. as a butter replacement - that little hint of coconut is delicious and the fattiness is reminiscent of butter.<br />-A tablespoon in my smoothies (for the health benefits)<br />-Oil replacement in baking recipes - it works just as well and is healthier!<br /><br />It's important to note that in cooking, the coconut flavor does not persist. If I add it raw I get that flavor but my eggs/bacon, for example, do not have coconut flavor after being cooked in this oil.<br /><br />HEALTHY: Read up on all the health benefits but here's the main one: yes this is a saturated fat. However, it's made up of medium-chain fatty acids. This type of fat is readily converted to energy and rarely stored as fat. Research shows that coconut oil (in moderation, of course) helps you lose weight and speeds up your metabolism. A few tablespoons a day is GOOD FOR YOU!<br /><br />My only con for this product is the plastic jar/tub. I hate plastic. Glass would be nice, as always!
