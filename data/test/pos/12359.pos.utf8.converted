I purchased this product for grinding, not sprouting. It came well packaged, and the rye was very clean, and had no pebbles or other trash to sort out. I was able to go right from the can into the grinder.<br /><br />This grain made great flour for rye bread.<br /><br />I was hesitant to buy the large can before trying this smaller can. I am delighted, and will now go order the much larger container.
