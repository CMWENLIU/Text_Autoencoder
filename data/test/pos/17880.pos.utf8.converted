I feed the Natural Balance Green Pea & Duck wet and dry food to my cat ever since my friends and vet suggested I do an elimination diet. Granted, my cat will eat anything in a can, I'm glad that Natural Balance has made this limited ingredient food so my cat doesn't have to suffer from his allergies to chicken. It is difficult to find cat food without chicken since it is in everything and the novel protein in Natural Balance's Limited Ingredient Diet is awesome!<br /><br />The dry Natural Balance Limited Ingredient Diet however, does have an ingredient that the canned wet food doesn't have: fish oil. So if you're doing a super stringent elimination diet, just compare labels for both the dry and wet because the ingredients do differ (my cat does fine with both).<br /><br />It has been several weeks now that my cat has been on the wet and dry NB food and his ear/face itching has almost completely disappeared! Just remember, talk to your vet about elimination diets if you think your cat may have allergies.
