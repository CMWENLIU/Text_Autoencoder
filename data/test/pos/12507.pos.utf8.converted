I just checked my package of waffle mix and it has ZERO trans fat! The other reviewer is mistaken. We have tried all the varieties of mixes and find this brand to be the easiest and tastiest mix available. All that you add is water and a little melted butter to prepare the batter. Sometimes we will add a mashed banana and/or pecans to the batter for variety. We might also sprinkle a few chocolate chips over the waffle after it comes out steaming hot from the waffle iron (they melt and add a delicious chocolate surprise to the waffle). We have delicious Belgian waffles every Sunday. The box comes with two individual pouches and each pouch makes approximately 3 Belgian waffles. We use the Waring brand Double Belgian Waffle Iron (makes 2 waffles at one time)and have had great success.
