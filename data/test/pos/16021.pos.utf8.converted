My mom and I are both diabetics and have tried every sweetener out there. Zsweet is by far the best. There are a few that I could use but my mother never found one that she could stand the taste of. This one passes her taste test with fling colors. She uses it to bake cookies, make jello and to sweeten even her first cup of coffee. It did not pass her cake test (it came out more like brownies), but she has read up on different ways to make it more cake like and will try again.
