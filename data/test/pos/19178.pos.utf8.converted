I really prefer McCann's steel cut oats to any rolled oats I've ever had, especially the "al dente" texture, slightly nutty flavor.<br /><br />I often have difficulty finding McCann's at my local grocer, and really appreciate the ease of ordering it from Amazon. With Prime, the shipping is free and the shelf life of this product is well over a year.<br /><br />Steel cut oats have nearly twice the fiber of rolled oats and seem to stick with me a bit longer. Since it does take 30 minutes to cook this up, I make a batch of 8 cups every other week or so, and store it in 1 cup Ziploc or Gladware containers. Under cook the oats about 5 minutes, then in the morning you just pop the container (without the lid!) in the microwave for 2-3 minutes on 50% power. You have a fast and very nutritious breakfast.<br /><br />To vary things a bit, I mix in chopped pecans and maple syrup, or chopped dried fruit (apricots, blueberries, cherries, peaches whatever you have on hand) and honey, or just brown sugar. I always have about 1 Tsp of SmartBalance in with it also. My cardiologist is pleased that I eat oatmeal 3-5 times a week, as is my heart!
