We are long term (10 years) users of Royal Canin Maine Coon food, MC-31. It has worked very well in providing a balanced meal high in all required vitamins plus Omega 3, 6, and 9. The large kibble keeps our cats from requiring periodic dental cleanings. Our present pair of Maine Coons have NEVER required a dental cleaning in 8 years.<br />The only problem we have had with this product is the size of the bag. It is too small. Maine Coons are BIG eaters, a 6 pound bag doesn't last long ( 1 week) with 2 full grown Maine Coons. Royal Canin did pack the food in a 20(?) pound bag some time ago, but discontinued that size because of complaints of lack of "freshness". How could a Mylar bag packed product be "unfresh"? Whose opinion of lack of freshness was it, the Owner?, the retailer? the Cat? or the manufacturer?<br />What do breeders of Maine Coons do? They do NOT buy $25 bags of 6 pounds of kibble. They seek out competitive equivalents to feed their cats, use MC-31 sparingly, but advise their customers of what is the best and what is reasonable to feed these big guys.<br />A vet tech suggested Amazon as the most reasonably priced source of Royal Canin MC-31. Royal Canin should reconsider this marketing decision to sell little bags of food for the biggest breed of cat in the country!
