I really like these crackers. I bought them when looking for a substitute for my son that constantly ate goldfish crackers until we both found out we couldn't eat gluten. He thinks they are okay but I really like them and ended up eating almost all of them myself. They are the closest I've found and I'm pretty sure to date, I've tried them all.
