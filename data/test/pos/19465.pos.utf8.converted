Looking for something else when I stumbled on this sugar.  Thought, "what the heck, give it a try".  I love the packaging that allows for spoon or sift. The sugar itself does not clump and dissolves well. I've tried it on hot cereal and pork & beans.  It is delicious and adds that something special for your palate to enjoy. Buy with confidence and prepare to be delighted.
