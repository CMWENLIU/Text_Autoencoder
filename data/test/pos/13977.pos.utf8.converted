Like some other reviewers, I was skeptical, but ordered based on the reviews here. I was even more skeptical when I opened the box and saw that it was "lite" tofu (I still don't know what that means, exactly). The stuff even looks bad as you slide it out of the box.<br /><br />However, it is a fantastic tofu product. It is smoother than any tofu I've bought from the grocery store, and I have used it in soups, stir fry, wraps, and plain. This will be the only tofu I buy from now on. If you like silky tofu, you will like this product.<br /><br />In addition to being awesomely tasty, it keeps unrefrigerated in my pantry. From experience, I know it keeps at least five days in the fridge once opened.
