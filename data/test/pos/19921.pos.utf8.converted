Ferrara Instant Espresso Coffee, 2-Ounce Glass Jars (Pack of 6)<br /><br />I have been using this brand of Ferrara, Instant Espresso Coffee for about a decade now, often daily in cool weather. You don't need to use a lot of the product to get a full body cup of coffee with crema on top, so the price is right for me!  I have tried other instant espresso coffees and I prefer this one. Originally I was in a gourmet store and this is where I found this coffee. Then after trying to locate this brand at a place with a better price tag I found it at World Market, but then they stopped carrying it, however, perhaps they have it back on their shelves again, I do not know. Soon later I began buying it from Sunset Foods in Highland Park, IL.  They, like World Market, had it in stock only now and then so I began to order it special from them.  After a few orders I decided to check Amazon since Amazon has become so much more of a store for me than books and movies!  Now I have an Amazon SUBSCRIPTION for this product to ship to me automatically.  To get the BEST PRICE I  put this item in my WISHLIST FOR THE PURPOSE OF WATCHING FOR THE PRICE TO LOWER, & WHEN IT DOES I ORDER FOR AN IMMEDIATE SHIPMENT AT THE BEST PRICE *STILL* THROUGH MY SUBSCRIPTION WHICH GIVES ME AN *ADDITIONAL* 15% OFF THE THEN SALE PRICE!!  The product itself: I have found this instant coffee consistent over the decade I have used it.  Normally you will find this in Italian stores or high-end stores.  I like the CONVENIENCE of getting a GREAT cup of SMOOTH coffee just heating water in my microwave and then adding the Ferrara Instant powder.  If the water is hot enough the drink will have a lovely thick crema on top.  Note: This coffee does not taste like actual coffee, but it doesn't taste anything like any other instant coffee on the shelves either, not like any other instant espresso from any company, and certainly nothing like those grocery store brand instant coffees which I find gross..., however, I admit find grocery store brand ground coffee like Folgers and Maxwell House, etc. to taste like garbage in my opinion!  For daily drip (real) coffee at my house we use Lavazza or the online subscription Gevalia brand.  So why do I also use an instant coffee like Ferrara?  Well, as I said, I love the SMOOTH taste, it gives a comforting hot drink that has a lovely flavor, and with hot enough water you will get a thick crema on top once you drop the powder into the hot water.  It is fast, and quite wonderful.  And may I add one more thing?  It takes away hunger for a couple of hours!  I just love it!!
