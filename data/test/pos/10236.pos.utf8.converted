It's so hard to find healthy noodle bowls-- and the Annie Chun's Noodle Express line does a great job of providing good flavor without scary nutrition information. Each tray is a little over 300 calories, compared to 500+ for a traditional ramen-type meal of the same size. I keep these at work in case I don't have time to make my lunch, and don't feel guilty at all when I eat them. Not everybody needs to watch nutritional information, but for those of us that do, it's a really convenient product.<br /><br />The sauce & seasoning packet are about what I would normally expect from a comparable product, but the steamed noodles really make this a great change from the rest.
