You would think not much could be said about pouches of nuts, however...<br /><br />Many of these packs had really top quality nuts and a good mix so these are super fresh which is not always the case in "quick grab" packs.<br /><br />I am constantly on the road and usually try not to grab the $1 value menu "heart attack" meals this is a great way to tide me over...<br /><br />here is the other problem with the big tin of nuts, while you are driving you just keep reaching into the tin, with the measured one serving pouch you can just eat one normal serving.<br /><br />Try em out...
