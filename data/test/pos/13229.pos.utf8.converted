Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix is an important essential in my gluten free diet.  The pancakes are fabulous - light, fluffy and very delicious.  The muffins are excellent - not too sweet and especially great when baked with berries.  I highly recommend this to those on a gluten free diet and anyone else who enjoys delicious food.
