With great anticipation I awaited the arrival of my fresh whole rabbit. And when it arrived, thank you Amazon for fast delivery, I clapped, danced, cut cart wheels, and shouted with joy at the top of my lungs. And as soon I as got into the house, I called my cousin, Roger, and let him know that this rabbit didn't get away! You see, 40 years ago, my brother and two other cousins where in the back yard trying to catch a rabbit. Roger was no help, as he stood on the sidelines and watched. Then he smugly quipped, "What's wrong, can't you catch it before it mul...ti...plies". Finally, I have the last laugh on him, I have my rabbit.
