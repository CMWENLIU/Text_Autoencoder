This stuff's great.  Comparing calories, it's roughly similar to brown rice.  However, the glycemic index is lower, and the amino acid profile is more complete.  Plus, there is a lot more protein in quinoa, compared to brown rice!  Just check it out on calorie-count.com, nutritiondata.com, whfoods.com, and wikipedia.<br /><br />Amazon has the BEST deal on quinoa around--12 boxes of this stuff for $25.  Sure, it's almost twice as expensive as brown rice, but it's worth it!<br /><br />Did I mention that quinoa cooks in less than 15 minutes??  Try that with brown rice (and without pressure cooking, cheaters)!<br /><br />Substitute quinoa for any rice dish.  I make spanish rice with quinoa (the 'rice' becomes a misnomer).  Same thing for black beans and rice.  This stuff's delicious and well textured!<br /><br />Anyway, spread the word about this thing--it really needs to be a bigger staple in the american diet, along with rice and pasta!!
