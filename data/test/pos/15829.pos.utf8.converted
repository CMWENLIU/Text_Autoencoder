I discovered this steel cut oatmeal at Trader Joe's 2-3 years ago.  At ~$3 a canister, it is almost half the price of McCann's (the brand that comes in a round tin can).  If you compare the two grains, Country Choice oats are cut into smaller pieces than McCann's.<br /><br />I find that both taste the same to me.  I initially had trouble figuring out how to cook steel cut oatmeal, so I emailed Country Choice and they responded with several ways of cooking it.  I now bake it in a casserole dish: 1 cup oats + 4 cups hot water, bake at 350-375 covered for 20-25 minutes, stir well, and then uncovered for 10-15 minutes.  Comes out great every time!<br /><br />Note that steel cut oatmeal is chewy and fibrous and lasts 4-6 hours in your tummy!  A great way to start an active day.
