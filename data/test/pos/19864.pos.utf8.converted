We committed to a gluten-free, casein-free diet for our son a couple of months ago, and we have sorely missed pasta! Each foray into rice pasta has been a gummy heap of disappointment, really. I bought this pasta because it looked interesting, but didn't expect to enjoy it...<br /><br />OMG!!! We have pasta back! I just boiled some up with some salt and a splash of EVOO and my son and I were eating it plain... The flavor, texture, appearance was all very appealing. I'm excited to try more of Mrs Leeper's corn pasta - rotini and radiatore are next :)<br /><br />I had a favorite pasta-diced chicken-artichoke hears-kalamata olives-greek dressing salad that I miss so much - and I will go straight out and buy more of Mrs Leeper's pasta so I can try making it with corn pasta.<br /><br />I'll be cooking up more of the corn spaghetti as a non-sticky take-along finger food. I am SOOOO happy!!
