Manuka (tea shrub) is a type of honey found in New Zealand and Australia. 16 is the UMF=Unique Manuka Factor which also can be found in factors of 12 and 20. The higher the UMF, the more medicinal value. Most honey sold in US are treated somehow either by filtering, diluting, blending, pasteurizing... which removes pollens which identify where the honey was produced and without pollens, honey has no medicinal value. This honey is so superior that once consumed, it helps allergies due to pollen content and more and externally can be applied to the skin to treat any condition. Wedderspoon is a quality brand from  New Zealand. You certainly pay a price but you do receive superior grade product when comparing to the worthless honey sold in grocery stores even when it is labelled as fancy grade A which hardly means anything since it may have come from China... Amazing taste of honey unlike any other honey. This is a superfood and a super medicine. double Bravo.<br /><br />Furthermore... After falling off my mountain bike time after time, I had to learn to deal with all the injuries and Neosporin was the first product I used and learned quickly that Neosporin can not be applied to wounds at all since after the body produces scab which is the natural healing process of the body tenting and covering the wound, applying Neosporin softened the scab, removed the scab, delayed the healing process of the wound which caused some scaring on my body. That was the last tube of Neosporin I ever used. Now, the only way that I treat any wound regardless of the size is 1) washing it with water 2)allowing it to dry for couple of minutes 3)applying Hibiclens few times a day for few days depending to the size of the wound 4)applying Manuka honey 5) applying almond and castor oil. Hibiclens is expensive but alcohol by itself although inexpensive, does more damage since it burns the skin and does more scaring. Manuka Honey is expensive but is the best healer of all. These are all expensive natural products but do the trick since help the scab do its job. Almond and castor oil help with removing any black spots, scars and moisturise my skin.
