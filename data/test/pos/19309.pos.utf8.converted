I bought these to use as part of the Simeons (Trudeau) hCG weight loss protocol because they are so much cheaper by the case than by the box in the grocery store. Of course, the case is more than enough for several rounds of the hCG protocol.<br /><br />For those who are searching for grissini for the first time: these are probably the actual breadsticks that Simeons refers to in his book. I have visited Italy and this Alessi brand was in all the grocery stores that we shopped at in Rome and further north. Even the box is nearly identical to the ones in Italy, except the writing is in Italian there, of course.<br /><br />This particular flavor tastes great. The rosemary is noticeable, but very light and pleasant. They are not noticeably salty. The breadsticks are crispy and fun to eat.  My family loves them, too.
