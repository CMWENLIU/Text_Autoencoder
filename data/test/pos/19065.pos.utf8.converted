I have had the oppoertunity to try this chocolate before, but I could not find it any of my local stores. Most stores carry the milk chocolate and the white chocolate versions of this confection but not the dark. It arrived before the estimated arrival date in perfect condition, it's fresh, and the price was outstanding compared to most designer dark chocolate bars. This is great dark chocolate at a great price from an excellent vendor.
