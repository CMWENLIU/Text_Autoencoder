I just ate my first bowl of Irish porridge, as the can refers to it. It was chewy, nutty, dense, filling and delicious, just like all the reviews said it would be. It was easy to cook, the directions on the can advise to boil 4 cups of water and then add 1 cup of oatmeal. Simmer for 30 minutes exactly and it turns out perfect and serves 4, with 150 calories per serving. Each can contains 20 servings. Storing 4 cans was not an issue, considering each 28 ounce can is about as big as a quart of paint. My only gripe is that all the cans I received are badly dented, but if that's the trade off for the bargain price and convenience of purchasing from Amazon, I can deal with it.
