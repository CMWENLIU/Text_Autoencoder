My friend from Sydney Australia is here visiting and she brought 3 different Tim Tam varieties over. The original (light chocolate), the mint (with a mint filling and some crunchy mint bits covered in chocolate), and the carmel filled. All were delightful! NOBODY sells them in the U.S. that I am aware of. I am hoping Amazon.com will sell them. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!! They have a cookie like biscuit similiar to a twix - but not shortbread - they are chocolate and then a light filling - like chocolate - mint - or carmel. My friend says they have a honey one as well! Mmmmmm!! They eat them with tea - I just eat them!! I went through all my packs already and want to order some!!! It's a MUST TRY ITEM! Start out with the original - but if you LOVE Mint - try to get the mint ones. Yum! Buy a variety and impress your guests :) Please amazon - SELL TIM TAMS!!! It's worth paying the international shippping fee! These biscuit cookies are made by Arnott's.
