I love this flour. I love to bake, so being on a gluten-free diet is not easy. But I use this flour for all of my baking. If the recipe has under 2 cups of flour, I usually use this flour as a straight substitution- and no one knows the difference. This has helped me make everything...cheesecakes, tortes, pies, even for breading chicken. So happy baking!
