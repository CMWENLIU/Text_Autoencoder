After trying many different types of gluten free breads and mixes, I love Chebe! It's very easy to prepare, is versatile and tastes unique but great. If you're wanting something light and fluffy, Chebe is probably not it, but if you are missing the days of chewy great bread, Chebe fits the bill. The fact that it's nice and chewy, and not dry and crumbly is a great appeal.
