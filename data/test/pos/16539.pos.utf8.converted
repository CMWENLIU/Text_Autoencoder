I have tried many kinds of bread flours, and on a gut instinct read the one review and thought, I need to try it.  I make an authentic long pre-ferment San Fran sourdough, which has no added yeast. I do believe this flour yields a good strong gluten, enabling the natural sourdough to do its thing.  The crust is just perfect, and what big loaves I get!!! And the most delicious perfect sourdough flavor ever.  I know alot about bread baking and have studied it a lot, and still I know very little.  I do know this flour is different, and am very pleased with the results.  You will need a new garbage can with a good lid as this is a LOT of flour.
