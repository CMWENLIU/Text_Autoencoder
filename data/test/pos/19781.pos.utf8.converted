Without a doubt, the very best brownie mix that I have ever tried.  I love to bake sweets but try to make them as healthy as possible, so when I won this mix in a giveaway contest on Facebook from Naturally Nora's, I was so excited.  My granddaughter (age 5) and I made these together.  They had a nice thin layer of crispy crust and super moist fudgy inside....the pan was gone in less than 5 minutes.  Totally delicious!
