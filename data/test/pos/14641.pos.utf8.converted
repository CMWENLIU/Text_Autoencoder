If you like mozzarella-type cheeses and consider mushrooms their own food group, buy this cheese immediately.  I had it at a wine bar in San Diego with my sister and the owner was kind enough to let me sneak a peek at the label so I could buy some of my own.  It's a large ball of cheese that comes in it's own fancy woven container and is perfect for putting out at a party with crackers -- that is if you don't eat the entire thing yourself beforehand.  The texture is medium firm and it has a melt-in-your-mouth creaminess.  The black truffle bits in the cheese give it the most amazing taste - not extremely overpowering like some truffle oils can be, but just the right amount of truffle taste.  The truffle bits are not discernible texture-wise (important if you like consistency of texture like I do!) This is such a unique tasting cheese and is certain to impress your guests if you serve it, or if you do keep it all to yourself, try it melted on crusty bread with a slice of ham and with a glass of prosecco. Delish!
