As much as I find Amazon.com convenient, this is no deal at all.  I was just at Costco yesterday and bought two boxes of 38 Fiber One Brownies and each box was only $10.99.  For the price they are charging here, Amazon.com should be sending you three boxes.  As for the bars, I am newly diabetic and the Brownie bars make for a nice "dessert" item after an otherwise low carb meal.  They have 13 grams of net carb after subtracting out the 5 grams of dietary fiber.  The item offers a chance for a smaller treat than the Oatmeal and Chocolate Fiber One bar, which I also enjoy to get my chocolate fix in a healthier way.
