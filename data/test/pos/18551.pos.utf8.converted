I bought one bag each of the micro crystals and the Pearl crystals by Ultra Pet.  Having used Fresh Step Crystals since my two cats joined the family over a year ago, I didn't want to shock them with the switch so I tried the Pearls first as they are larger crystals.  I layered the Pearls with a thin carpet of Fresh Step crystals and they seemed to take to it well enough.  The odor control was equivalent (superb) to Fresh Step which is a big thumbs up from me and the two "boys".<br /><br />After finishing that bag, I went to the Micro Crystals.  Before I could even start to put a layer of the Fresh Step on top, one of the cats leaped into the box and basically started dancing around in the litter.  I don't know if it's because of the sand-like quality compared to the hard, rough crystals but he was literally having a ball just spinning around in the box.  I guess it took his brother shoving him out to go do his business for the first one to figure out it's not to play in!<br /><br />All in all, both products I tried were superb quality and highly absorbent with long lasting odor control.  I'll be purchasing the Micro Crystals because it's easier on MY feet considering they do tend to throw this all over the floor before they "go".  It's unfortunate that there's a 3 week shipping delay and there's no subscribe & save option.  If not for those issues, I would make the full switch over to Ultra Pet litters.
