I have tried all the FAMILIA cereals- I think there are 6- muesli and granolas - by trial and error this one - Familia Low-Fat- is for me perfect because  I don't like the granolas that are sweetened with honey-  The Original Style Familias are really mostly just oatmeal and a few raisons - not a great value. This one has lots of fruits and nuts without being too sweet.<br />Drei
