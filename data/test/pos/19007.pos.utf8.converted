I decided to order this product after reading a few books about the benefits of coconut oil.  I received this product about two weeks ago & here are my observations:<br /><br />1)  It totally curbs my appetite and gives me a sense of satisfaction so I don't have to eat every couple of hours.<br /><br />2)  It gives me so much energy!  I usually have to drink two cups of green tea to get me going & maybe a cup of coffee if it's a very busy day but since I started using coconut oil, my energy level is higher and I get a lot more done without burning out.<br /><br />3)  It made me regular, not to be too detailed but you will have a movement after almost every meal.<br /><br />4) No morning breath!<br /><br />5)  Soft, silky skin & hair.<br /><br />6)  No toothache.  I had a cap that came loose so I had my dentist bond it back on but it kept bothering me as if it was infected or something but since I started using coconut oil, whatever was going on is totally healed.<br /><br />We are on our 2nd bottle already!  I love it so much I also use it as moisturizer, just be careful when applying it to your shoulders, especially if you have long hair, it will make your hair greasy.<br /><br />I hope you have the same positive experience.
