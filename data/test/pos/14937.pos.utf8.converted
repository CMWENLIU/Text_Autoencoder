My 86 year-old mother spent 22 days in a hospital and rehab facility for bedsores on both hips. Anyone who knows about bedsores knows there are four stages. 1-4. My Mom had two stage 3's and one stage 4. The hospital did not do much other than keep her hydrated and on antibiotics. Nine days later she was transferred to a rehab facility. Much the same. Just changing of dressings for the bedsores. "They will take a long time to heal, if at all." I was at a loss for words. Her prognosis...only fair. To make a long story short...along came Wedderspoon Manuka MF16+ Honey. One and a half months later, they are completely healed! Praise the God of ALL creation for this marvelous, miraculous stuff! Be sure to order at least MF16+ for full beneficial properties.
