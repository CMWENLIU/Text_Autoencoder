Texture of the cooked product is simply wonderful. Despite the instructions on the back I double the cook time (to about 5 mins.) so it gets more creamy. This is an oat bran, so you shouldn't expect much flavor, but I usually add a tablespoon of maple syrup during cooking, throw some fruit on top afterwards and it is beyond good. Btw, I use milk to cook it in, not water. I only bought this a day ago, but I'm already loving it. Oh, and it's ridiculously cheap too (for what you get).
