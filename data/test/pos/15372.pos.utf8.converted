I love "Food for Life Ezekiel" products. Originally, I was introduced to the bread when on a special diet -- an offshoot program of "Over-eaters Anonymous", the H.O.W. program -- many years ago. The bread contains NO flour, no sugar, is high in protein and fiber, and, for my taste, is delicious. Actually, I learned that OVER-eating was not really my problem. My problem was NOT eating the healthiest, life-giving, minimally processed foods available. Over time, I learned, relapsed, and relearned, etc. I was thrilled when I learned "Food for Life" added cereals to their product line. In looking at labels at my local health food store, I discovered that this brand was the ONLY cold cereal on the shelves that had NO sugar content! Since then, this is the ONLY cold cereal I buy. It can be served warm, as well. Generally, though, I prefer "John McCann's Steel-Cut Irish Oatmeal" (also zero sugar and high fiber) for hot cereal.<br /><br />Needless to say, the cereal is expensive (but cheap if you consider that you're no longer polluting your body with all the sugar, air, preservatives, and other junk in most commercial cereals), so I was thrilled to find that Amazon.com offered it in a 6-box bundle for a far better price than my local market. I usually have a bowl a day with fresh berries (strawberries are very sweet this year in my area) and slivered almonds topped with light soy milk.  I find that when I'm eating really nutritious food, I eat slowly and savor. When I'm eating junk, I tend to "wolf" it down. It doesn't matter why. I just hate that sensation, so I avoid it and my body thanks me every day.
