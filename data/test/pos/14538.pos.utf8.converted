I wash and dry the bottle.  Then I open it and hold it upright over a large bowl.  I gently sqeeze the bottle until as much of the oil is removed as possible.  I then fill the bottle up with water. Replace caps and wash off bottle, then give it a good shake.  The oil can be saved and refrigerated for when you need a little flavored oil for something else.  E.g. toss with raw potatoe chunks and roast until tender.  Yum.<br />This stuff is so good I think I could almost drink it straight from the bottle!
