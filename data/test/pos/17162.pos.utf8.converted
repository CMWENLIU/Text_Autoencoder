I started looking for a new source of dry milk when my local supermarket chain went from offering a convenient 20-quart box for about $17.99 to their new 'largest size' 8-quart box at $9.99.  A total rip-off that I was not about to reward.  Thank goodness I found this wonderful Saco 40-quart version for a very reasonable price!  Apart from having milk for baking, cereal, drinking, etc, the thing I really like is that 1) I'm not lugging large cartons of heavy liquid back home from the supermarket (I don't have a car, so I walk or ride my bike - and Amazon is, of course, delivering to my door, so this time I don't even have to lug a big box of powdered milk from the store!) and 2) I'm not constantly contributing to the garbage, either plastic (the worst) or even paper every time I finish another carton of milk.  I have a nice old-fashioned milk pitcher in my fridge and there sits as little or as much as I decide I need on a given day.  So convenient, so smart and so good!  Highly recommended!
