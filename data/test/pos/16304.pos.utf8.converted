I have been buying this brand of vanilla for several years at Costco and I love it.  It's very affordable and I've always been happy with the quality.  When baking for profit I tend to lean more towards Nielsen Massey Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla, however, this is great to keep on hand in a pinch.  Most people can't tell the difference.
