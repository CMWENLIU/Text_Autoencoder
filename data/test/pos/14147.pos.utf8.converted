<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F41ZFA">Taylors of Harrogate, Special Rare Assam Leaf Tea, Doomur Dulling, Loose Leaf, 3.53-Ounce Tin</a><br />Well, finally and, as it was mentioned by other reviewers, this rare Assam from India is a very good one. I usually drink very strong tea with sugar, no milk. But this truly rare Assam is a pleasure to drink also w/o sugar added. As I tried many different Assams in the past, I had a negative prejudice to the Assam teas (many of the Assams in the past were Chinese though, I guess). Because of the high price, I decided to take a risk - and was rewarded. I do hope that the next batch will be as good as the current one. My spouse is having a cup of tea every morning (the Revolution English Breakfast), I am confident she will like this rare Assam. The only problem here is its price. I may have hard time to keep on buying the Assam from India on a regular basis. Well, X-mas is coming soon. I might survive with the Special Rare Ceylon. There is only one choice here - the Diyagama West.
