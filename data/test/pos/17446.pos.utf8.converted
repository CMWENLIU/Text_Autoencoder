Ever since Twining's changed (destroyed) their Earl Grey tea recipe by using less Bergamot and adding more Lemon hoping people wouldn't notice, I've been desperately looking for a way to get back what has been missing in my tea!<br /><br />I've tried every different brand of tea I can find in attempts to find the best Earl Grey I can, but they never use quite enough of this valuable extract.<br /><br />Now, ever since I bought this bottle of 100% pure edible Bergamot extract my problems are solved!  I only add a few drops to an entire pot of tea and it makes it taste wonderful again!  For a single cup of tea I just wipe the lid on the tea bag and it's perfect!  This will go a long way, because of how potent it is, and 4 ounces is a lot more than I thought it was!<br /><br />I will be buying from this seller again, if their other extracts are half as good as their Bergamot is, that's just fine with me!
