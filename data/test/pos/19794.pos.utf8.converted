I moved recently and discovered that my local grocery store doesn't carry this chai. Very glad to find it available through Amazon. I was used to Oregon chai, and at first didn't like this as well, but after drinking this for a while and then returning to Oregon chai, I find that the Oregon is a lot sweeter. This chai has a nice blend of spices, not over peppery like Tazo. It's great cold as well, and I never have to worry about having milk on hand.
