I have my kitchen stocked with all kinds of ramen/ramyuns and this is a nice change of pace when I want noodles without the broth. I usually mix the sauce components in the bowl I'm going to be eating out of and add a few tablespoons of the liquid I used to boil the noodles in to it. Just have to add the drained noodles and mix. I only use about three tablespoons of water to get the sauce the consistency I like, but you can add more/less depending on how you like it. This noodle is traditionally eaten with a side of slices of pickled radish (the yellow stuff you might find at your asian grocer). If you don't have pickled radish, you might enjoy it with a side of sliced cucumbers or other fresh vegetable because the sauce might be kind of heavy. I find this sold at my store for $5.99 per pack of five so the price on Amazon is not bad.
