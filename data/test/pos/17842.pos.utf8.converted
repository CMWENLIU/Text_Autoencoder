This is the best tasting Sugar FREE drink for a K-Cup I have tried.  I used the medium setting for my brewer adn got a very good cup; there is no aftertaste at all.  This is a fresh apple caramel with a hint of cinnamon.  I have had real apple cider that tasted about the same.  This is a treat that even a  diabetic could go for and enjoy.  I am not sure why there are so many 1 star reviews, but i really do disagree.<br /><br />10 cal (0 fat)  --  0g fat sat  --  1 carb  --  0g sugar  --  &lt;1g fiber
