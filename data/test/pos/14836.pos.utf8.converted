I have been drinking this wonderful stuff for a few years now. Until recently have been able to purchase it at our local AFB Commissary, but they have stopped carrying it. Decided to check Amazon.com and there it was! Sugar-free, decaffeinated and delicious! And what's more, it's on Prime so it comes with free shipping. I like the Mocha flavor the best although the French Vanilla is acceptable. The Mocha is like a great cup of hot chocolate, with a hint of coffee and so creamy smooth. I can have this any time of the day! Only 60 calories per cup! That's 'way under the 100-calorie snack that's popular now. I highly recommend it. And thanks to Amazon.com, I can get it for just about the same price as the Commissary!
