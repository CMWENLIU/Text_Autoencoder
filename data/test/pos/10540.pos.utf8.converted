Let me take you back to a cold Christmas morning, stockings hung over the fireplace, the tree trimmed with all manner of fanciful decorations, and small children fast asleep, ready to awaken to the dawn of the best day of the year. My eyes flew open as the sun peeked above the bottom of my window pane. It was the day that everyone had been awaiting all year!<br />Practically bludgeoning my siblings out of the way, I made a dash for the stockings. I always had gone for the stocking first. A few gift cards, some candy, maybe even a Pez dispenser. Nothing too exciting. What I smelled next, however, made my heart skip and my breath catch. I knew exactly what was under the tree for me.<br />As mother and father watched on warmly, my siblings and I tore through the wrappings of our gifts. Soon they'd all be jealous of me. No one was going to get something quite so special as what I was about to receive. The room was soon filled with the invigorating scent of red meat and blood. I became dizzy just fantasizing about spending long hours with my new gift. I finally pulled the last shred of dripping, rotting wrapping paper from the carcass, my eyes lit with the purest of joys.<br />I'd gotten just what I'd asked for.<br />The beautifully gory dead rabbit, its skin peeled off in some enticingly cannibalistic way, oozing blood and pus and its bones skewed at odd angles, hung limply in my arms as I squeezed it tightly like a stuffed animal. "Thank you!" I squealed in pleasure before running off to my room with the decaying corpse to snuggle. What more could anyone possible want? A dead rabbit is the greatest, most useful thing that anyone could ever buy.<br />It truly was a night of wonderment, and one that my family and I will always remember.
