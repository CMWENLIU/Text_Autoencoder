I have been taking this product for the past 12 months.  Not only is it simple to take and easy on the taste buds, but as you will read also much more effective than I ever thought it would be.  In addition, I have been taking direct source of milk thistle and tudca powder, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008TJXMBS">FREE Milk Thistle Powder 25 Grams + TUDCA Powder (Tauroursodeoxycholic) 5 Grams</a>. I am forty-two years old and exercise regularly and eat moderately healthy.<br /><br />I recently took a physical for a new position I acquired with a huge company and my total cholesterol was 149.  I was completely taken off guard by hearing this number because the last time I had my cholesterol checked was three years ealrier and my total cholesterol at that time was over 200.  I was 39 then, and in much better shape physically than I currently am.  It is true what they say that the metabolism takes a sharp decline at 40, not joke there!<br /><br />I assumed my cholesterol must have been at least somewhat lower but I had no idea that such a drastic change would occur.  I believe these Benecol Smart Chews along with the recommended dose of milk thistle and Tudca have played a big part in this incredible drop from a once 200+ cholesterol rating. I haven't grew any younger and my lifestyle is pretty much the same as it was three years ago (if not a little more relaxed) so needless to say, these are products I can highly recommend without prejudice.
