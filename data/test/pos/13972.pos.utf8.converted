I fell in love with Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee (where else?) in Jamaica! I love the rich, deep aroma and the smooth non-acid taste. This is one of the only coffees that doesn't irritate my stomach. Yes, it's expensive but well worth the treat. I tend to give this as a gift to friends and family and it's become so popular that I even get requests for it by name! I buy it in both ground and whole bean.
