I've tried many brands of green tea, and the Yogi Green Tea with Kombucha is the best tasting tea out of all of them. It has passion fruit, so it doesn't taste like alfalfa or hay. I add a tiny bit of honey for my sweet-tooth, but it tastes great either way. I drink 2 cups a day and never get over jittery; The caffeine content is just right. Definitely worth the try if you are looking for an every-day caffeine drink.
