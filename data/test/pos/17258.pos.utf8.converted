OK, I'm tired of keeping this secret to myself.  The HERO blackberry preserves is, hands down, the best darn jam I've ever had including my grandmother's pear preserves.  It's sufficiently tart, yet essence of sweet, chunky enough to not be jelly, but not so gritty that you spend the rest of the day picking blackberry seeds out of your teeth.  This is a beautiful color, the true black of blackberry as God intended.  I don't care if you don't buy it because there's more for me!  Visit me and you'll be served HERO's jam.  For years I had to sneak around and sleuth all sorts of markets and groceries to find it, many of which carried the brand but not the Blackberry.  You know, I'm sure that blackberries are at the top of the naturally healthy germ-fighting products ever blessed on this earth.  And if you're smart enough to buy it online and make your life easier, let alone spare the air from driving around searching for it, you will be so grateful that you found it here and heard from one testimonial just how compelling this rich taste is.  Hey, don't listen to me; more for me!
