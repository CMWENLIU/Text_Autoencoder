Very well packed, arrived quickly.  6 lbs are a lot so I store them in my freezer.  Use coffee grinder to grind few cups into powder and again put them back to freezer.  Add couple tablespoons of ground flaxseed to bread, pancakes, rice, meatballs... Helps increase nutrition value of my food.  Pretty happy with it.
