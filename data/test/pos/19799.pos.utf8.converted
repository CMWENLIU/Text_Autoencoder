Great transaction---great product!<br /><br />I've been feeding my Alaskan Malamute V-Dogfood for several years now. I am so glad it's finally available here at Amazon! My dog is almost 9 but people typically think she's much younger. We live in the mountains and are out running every day. She loves her V-Dogfood along with her nightly bowl of carrots and broccoli! Hope she lives to be as old as the other vegan dogs in Ripley's Believe It or Not and the Guiness Book of World Records!
