I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviews (why didn't I hurry and rate this as soon as I got mine a few weeks ago??)! I ordered the Chocolate Raspberry, the Lemon Drop, and this one, the English Toffee. I was used to buying the same brand in the packets of powder, but the health food store was charging like $8 a bottle. The prices here on Amazon is VERY reasonable. I love the Lemon Drop one in my herbal teas, and this English Toffee seems to work better in the coffee. For a nice rich "mouth feel" (like cream but without the bad calories) try cold-pressed Coconut oil, also available here on Amazon. It's amazing what it does for coffee!! I'm trying to cut back on the soymilk because of excess estrogen level issues, and the cocoanut oil in my coffee combined with these WONDERFL Stevia flavors - I don't miss the soy milk at all, let alone regular milk!
