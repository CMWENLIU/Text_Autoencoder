This is the ONLY dog food my Shepherd mix will eat.  For the 2 reviews above, your dogs are unique and prob. have an intolerance.  Evo is a wonderful food, Eukanuba has MANY things that are horrible for your dog to eat.  Evo has NO corn or by-products which are very bad for dogs. It is a high protein food so its not great for 7+ year old dogs but wonderful for normal adult dogs.  Perfect for dogs with grain allergies.  Whenever looking for food stay away from dog foods with ANY corn or by-products.  Eukanuba and Iams are CONSTANTLY recalling their food.  I work at a local pet shop and in the past year they have had recalls 5+ times, no other food has been recalled.
