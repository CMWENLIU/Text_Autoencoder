This is the 3rd year in a row that I've tried to get this... they charge you right away, but delivery is 2-5 months... absolutely wonderful product, but don't count on it if you need it in a hurry.<br /><br />This year they said "in stock" when I ordered in November.. now it's "out of stock" and my order status is "filling".. and forget getting their customer service to answer their phone or reply to you.
