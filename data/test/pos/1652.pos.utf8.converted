I am following the South Beach diet and saw these on Dr Oz. Who wouldn't want to have "pasta" while not actually having pasta? But, all the negative reviews freaked me out, so I was nervous to try them :)  However, I did follow many reviewers' advice and they were delicious.  No calories, no carbs...I'm in!!<br /><br />Here's what I did. Opened the bag, dumped them in a mesh colander and rinsed, rinsed, rinsed them. Blotted dry on a paper towel. Heated up some olive oil and a little garlic and threw the noodles in. Added what I had on hand: some cooked chicken, cooked diced zuchinni, a little spaghetti sauce and ricotta cheese. Let simmer for maybe 5-8 min. Sprinkled with some parmesan cheese. Really DELICIOUS! My husband even ate some and didn't say a word. I thought they were really good. Mixed in with a bunch of other ingredients and sauce these tasted like angel hair pasta to me. Worth it! Note the 7 oz package is very small. Really one large meal or 2 smaller meals. Probably only about 1-1/2 cups of noodles.<br /><br />If you are following a low-carb diet these are a treat. More realistic pasta taste than a spaghetti squash, for example. Definitely worth a try.
