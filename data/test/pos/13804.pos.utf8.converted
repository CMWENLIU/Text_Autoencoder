When I left England in 1997 I think I missed these the most, sure there were parents and aunts and uncles, but that's why they invented the web cam.  Looking at Cherry Bakewells on a webcam never gave me the same satisfaction of actually eating one.  I could get other people to eat them and then describe precisely the sensation, but it was never enough.  I tried to find a US substitute over here, Cherry Poptarts?  Hah!  I laugh at your pitiful attempts at creating a cherry cake.<br /><br />Jump forward about 10 years and these babies show up on Amazon, what a great day indeed.  I ordered a pack immediately and awaited their arrival, they arrived promptly and as I ate the first one (whole) that same great taste I remembered came flooding back.  The soft fondant icing, the almondy crumble filling, the plum jam at the bottom, the firm but somehow soft pastry case and of course the cherry on top.  Bliss :)<br /><br />I don't recommend anyone buy these as I want them all for myself.  All of them you hear? ALL OF THEM!!!!!
