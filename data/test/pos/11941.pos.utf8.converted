Real quick: it's a dark paste, thick, kind of like chocolate mousse in colour (but much thicker). The taste is mostly salty, with a noticeable after-taste of bitter, with a very slight hint of dry smoked-fish (if that tells you anything).<br /><br />Why it's not easily available I can't begin to guess, since this is a kind of condiment that, if you get a drop of it in your mouth, you'll continue to "nibble" till the jar's empty: it's really addictive. Goes very well with pretty much everything, from a slice of bread with butter, to veggies, to, believe it or not, almond butter. As long as it's not too sweet, it goes well with Vegemite, I think: like take butter, Irish butter (unsalted, creamy but neutral in taste) will do great; French (like President) probably not -- too flavourful itself, sweet.<br /><br />One thing though: it's mindlessly promoted by all kinds of cretins (including the manufacturer) as a spread: god forbid you spread it all over that piece of bread, you're gonna throw up, it's too bitter that way. Add a SMALL amount to something else, like spread some creamy butter first and then add a quarter teaspoon of Vegemite: that'll work great. I don't even spread it, just scoop it with a teaspoon and eat: take a bite out of your sandwich, then a quarter tsp of Vegemite, this sort of thing. Don't use a ladle when dealing with it; a small amount does it.<br /><br />A few things in closing:<br /><br />- I've no clue why it's so freaken pricey. It's a byproduct of beer making! It's a kind of thing that if not used for Vegemite would be dumped into the ocean to pollute it even further, how much should this nonsense cost?! A buck a pound perhaps.<br />- It's available at something widespread but not well-known called Wegemann's (I think?) for six bucks a pop. Not a steal by any means, but about a half of this thing here. Don't overpay, it's too expensive as it is.<br />- As usual, vague BS aside, there's no information on this page, so here goes, directly from the jar:<br /><br />Serving 5 g, servings per package: 30<br /><br />- Energy : 40 kJ [energy? wth]<br />- Protein:  1.3 g<br />- Fat: &lt; 1g<br />- Carbs: &lt; 1g<br />- Sodium: 173 mg<br />- Niacin (B3): 2500 ug<br />- Thiamine (B1): 550 ug<br />- Riboflavine (B2): 430 ug<br />- Folate (B9): 100 ug<br /><br />(Riboflavine is the thing that makes your pea glow in the dark; very beautiful! Worth trying just for that!)<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />- Yeast extract (from yest grown on barley)<br />- Salt<br />- Mineral salt (508) [what is this?]<br />- Malt extract (from barley)<br />- Colour (150 c) [so much for "no colour added"... perhaps it's not "artificial", OK, but why add any colours? It's food, who cares what colour it is.)<br />- Flavours [aha, "no flavours added", yeah]<br />- Niacin<br />- Thiamine<br />- Riboflavin<br />- Folate.<br /><br />Allergen Information : contains barley.<br /><br />Suitable for vegetarians.<br />------<br />Bottomline: nothing but praise (except for price too high), very highly recommended. Should be easily available along with staples like catchup, soy sauce, and salsa. Same for Marmite, btw., (which is somewhat similar to this thing here, except I can't find it anywhere: anyone know a source?). Btw, reports that Vegemite is "banned in the US due to the folate content being too high" is an urban legend: first, it _is_ sold, though not widely; and second, there's no such thing as too-high folate content: folate isn't known to be toxic in any realistic quantities, and anyway, there's 100 ug of it here, whereas the RDA is 400 (some nutritionists recommend twice that amount to keep your homocystein in check). You can eat as much folate as you want, till you turn green and sprout yourself, nothing bad will happen to you.
