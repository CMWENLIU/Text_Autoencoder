I fell in love with the Pumpkin Pie Latte at Starbucks. When I found out that they used their own Pumpkin Pie syrup I was started on a mission. When I locate the syrup (Da Vinci) I wanted a sugar free version but it was not available. When I finally did locate the sugar free syrup my dream came true. Now I can have my very own Pumpkin Pie Latte anytime I want!
