Fever-Tree Naturally Light Tonic is a great mixer that won't overpower the taste of your favorite alcohol.  I never really liked the taste of diet tonic water.  I also didn't like the fact that diet tonic water is sweetened with artificial sweeteners.  Regular tonic water has a taste that masks the alcohol and it contains too much sugar. This Fever-Tree tonic has less than half the sugar of regular tonics.  My perfect gin & tonic has 1.5 oz of my favorite gin and 1/2 bottle of Fever-Tree Naturally Light Tonic Water over ice, which ends up being only 4.8 grams of sugar.  If you think this tonic is too expensive, remember what it costs for a good bottle of wine.  If you want a great cocktail, this tonic is worth the price.
