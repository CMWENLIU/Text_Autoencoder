Ok, ok, so maybe I wouldn't add it to ice cream or jello but when it comes to meats, fish, vegetables, this is a wonderful blend every home chef should have on hand. I can honestly say that about many of The Spice Hunters products.<br /><br />  If you like fish or are a frequent user of boneless skinless chicken breasts, as so many of us are these days in an effort to eat healthier, you need to get this blend. It is a mix of onion, dill, lemon peel, ginger, garlic & chives and your meats will thank you for sprinkling a lot of it on them. I use this on baked fish and even the time I accidentally overcooked the fish, it was still awesome due mainly to this spice blend.<br /><br />  Try this sprinkled over boiled new potatoes with a few pats of butter tossed in with it. It tastes like Springtime. Try it mixed with a little mayo and sour cream for a tasty homemade dressing for salad. Or sprinkled on Asparagus... mixed with butter and used as a topping for baked potatoes or throw a dollop onto any meats or veggies. Am I rambling? Rhapsodizing a bit? Yep... but honestly, it's worth the ramble. :-)
