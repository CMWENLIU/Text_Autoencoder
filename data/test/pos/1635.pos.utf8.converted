I buy a case of these or the cocoa variety whenever Amazon features them on the Friday Sale -- generally about six dollars less than the listed $22.00.  The 5 ounce packages are paper reinforced cylinders, easy to pack and easy to open, great for a take-along treat.  (The packs don't re-close, however, so you pretty much have to devour all contents once opened.)  For Christmas I made up small gift baskets using these, a coffee mug or two, and some instant cappucino.
