I bought my first RJ's Licorice when I was flying out of New Zealand and needed to spend the rest of my money in the duty free before we took off back to the USA...needless to say, I wish I bought more. I agree with the first reviewer, this is the best licorice, its expensive, but its a long way from New Zealand...trust me I had to fly home from there!
