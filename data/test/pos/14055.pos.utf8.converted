In the 96 ounce can, there are 40 weenies, at the current sale price, that makes the cost per weenie only 0.414 cents each. Not a bad price for a weenie that is good raw from the can or done up however you like, and is vegan.  The big can is okay. I pour it into a tupper and put it in the fridge. They don't last long at my house anyway.<br /><br />Dietary information (off the can):<br />Serving size: 1 link<br />Servings per container: 40<br />Calories per serving: 70<br />Calories from fat: 35<br />Total Fat: 4g - 6%<br />...Saturated Fat: 0.5g - 3%<br />  Trans Fat: 0g<br />...Polyunsaturated Fay: 2.5g<br />  Monounsaturated Fat: 1g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg 0%<br />Sodium: 160mg - 7%<br />Potassium: 20 mg - 0%<br />Total Carbohydrate: 1g - 0%<br />  Dietary Fiber: 1g<br />  Sugars: 0g<br />Protein: 7g<br /><br />Vitamin A - 0%, Vitamin C - 0%, Calcium - 0%, Iron - 2%, Thiamin - 8%, Roboflavin - 12%, Niacin - 4%, Vitamin B6 - 8%, Vitamin B12 - 15%, Panthothenic Acid - 6%.
