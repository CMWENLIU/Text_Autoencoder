This freeze dried peaches are great!  I found freeze dried peaches in my local health food store, but they were so expensive, I was looking for something more economicial.  These fit the bill perfectly.  The peices range in size from a small to a large crouton, great bite sized peices that you can pop into your mouth.  Shipping was fast too, the order was  shipped out on the same day and I had them at my door in less than a week (a lot quicker than when Amazon said they would be delivered).
