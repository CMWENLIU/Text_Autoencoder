Great product!<br /><br />It is claimed that this cinnamon (Cinnamomum Burmannii) is not real cinnamon....Perhaps. But, after research, I found it has more healthful effects than "real" cinnamon, and that the harmful coumarin is found in far less amounts in Burmannii versus other "alternate" cinnamons that are the primary forms found in grocery stores.  Burmannii has been shown to have high amounts of cinnamaldehyde (effective anti-inflammatory) and other beneficial compounds.<br /><br />I haven't figured out how to grind it easily yet, as it is very hard. I struggle a bit with my hand coffee grinder. I'm sure I'll figure it out.  The Burmannii is strong but still smells and tastes great... especially in my coffee.
