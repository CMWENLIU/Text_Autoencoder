I bought these about a month ago because we have a few cats that we occasionally have to give pills.  It worked for 2 of the cats but the other seemed to sense that something was "fishy" about these things and wouldn't touch them.  But for the other two cats they worked great.<br /><br />They are like a semi-moist cat food, but more moist and pliable.  There's a little indentation in the middle and you just push the pill inside and squeeze it together.  The cats seem to pretty much swallow it whole, or if they do chew it, don't notice the pill inside.  If it were a very  bitter pill I probably wouldn't use these since they'd probably be able to taste it.  Anything that gets medication down even 2 of the cats without a struggle is a success as far as I'm concerned.
