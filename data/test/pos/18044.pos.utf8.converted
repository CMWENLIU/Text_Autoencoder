In the market for some healthy snack choices, I picked up a box of these cookies at my local IKEA store.  What a wonderfully delicious treat for barely any calories!  Plus, a serving is a sizeable 6 cookies, so you can munch on these and feel satisfied.  At only 133 calories, and 5.2 grams of fat (only 1 gram saturated fat), this is a perfect choice for those looking to lead healthier lifestyles while still eating great-tasting foods.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to trying all the available flavors!
