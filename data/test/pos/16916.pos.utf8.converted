This is the best dog food we've ever used, and we've used some that are more expensive.  We also had them on a raw food diet for about a year and were giving probiotics at that time.  They love this and they don't fart anymore!  I still give them the occasional raw egg for a treat.  They're in great health.  Also, better digestion means less dog turds to clean up in the yard.
