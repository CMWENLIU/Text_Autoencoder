I have tried different types and brands of curry powder in cooking various dishes such as rice, veggies and Indian cuisine.<br />So, far The Spice Hunter has been the best of all the brands I've tried.<br /><br />What makes this brand superb is that to get a quality curry flavor. I don't have to use half a jar to taste the curry, nor are the spices<br />too strong.<br /><br />Furthermore, I also like that it is salt-free, which enhances the curry flavor instead of tasting salt.<br />For those of you who like a saltier taste, this probably isn't the brand for you, unless you want to add salt youself.<br /><br />For me, this curry is perfect for my taste and at a reasonable price as well.
