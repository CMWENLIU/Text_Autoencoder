A Brother from my church gave me a little bag of Pero in January of this year and I've been hooked ever since. I gave up coffee and this is the next best thing, it's all natural and it taste great - at least to me.  Finding a bargain like what I found is awesome, so glad that I was able to find it on  Amazon.com.
