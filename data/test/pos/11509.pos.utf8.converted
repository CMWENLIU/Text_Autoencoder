Considering that its low carb, its pretty tasty.  It coated well, stood up to frying well, and did OK in the oven (a little soggy on the bottom for a few pieces).  Be aware that there is a little bit of an aftertaste, as with almost all low carb products, but in this product its not overwhelming (remember: individual tastes may vary!), and if you use a lot of hot sauce on your chicken like I do, you don't notice it at all, hah.  It also works well for regular fried chicken with a bit of salt, pepper and paprika added.<br /><br />I will be buying this product again (and again).<br /><br />Note: if you are looking for a frying batter coating, use this from Dixie - do NOT buy Dixie's "Plain bread crumbs", it had a really bad sour taste and aftertaste.  This stuff is good.<br /><br />I now can put home made Hot Wings and breaded chicken breast tenders back on my diet and enjoy a favorite food without blasting my blood sugar and still keep my diet low carb -- Thanks Dixie, and pass me the hot wing sauce!
