It has been a number of years since I was a real milk drinker. During that time I had sort of switched to evaporated milk for my milk needs. It doesn't go bad in the time it is open and cold or hot cereal without some milk is impossible to choke down. I had tried the dry milk you buy in stores and have found it impossible to choke down even on cereal. All varieties in the store seem to say "Instant" which means they dissolve easily, weigh nothing so they fill up the box, and stink to high heaven even if they age in the bottle after mixed for a few days.<br /><br />I searched in the local stores to find a bag of Bob's milk to try it out, to no avail, so I decided to take the plunge and order from Amazon. The milk comes in the same sized bags as all of Bob's other products -- 4 per case-box. I read one review that said it tasted a lot like fresh cows milk. It has been a long time since I have tasted fresh cows milk, but Bob's milk may taste more like fresh cows milk than the manufactured stuff you buy in the mega-mart. Now you might find that taste offensive, but compared to evaporated milk or even store bought, it isn't all that bad. It does have a slight taste of the evaporation process, but is very drinkable on its own.<br /><br />When I first got the milk I weighed it out, to see about making it in other containers rather than the quarts. I found that it weighs light, meaning a slight half cup really is more suitable for about 750 ml, which is the stainless steel water bottle I mix it in. I add a little water to the bottle, pour in the dry milk, add some more water and shake it up really well, let it rest and shake it again. After each shaking it gets pretty foamy, so once the foam then dissipates I top off the bottle with water.<br /><br />I don't make foo-foo coffee, but it might even work there, again different from store bought milk but no more strange than soy milk, just different.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a real milk product, with a long shelf and pot life, I would recommend Bob's Non-Fat Dry Milk Powder;
