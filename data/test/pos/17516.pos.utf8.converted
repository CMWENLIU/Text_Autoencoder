Due to allergies on the part of one dog, and pickiness on the part of the other, I've switched to natural dog food over the past year.  Of them all, my dogs love this stuff the best.  It has a nice smell and texture, and is more easily chewed by the elderly dog.  Relatives who hadn't seen the dogs for a few months immediately commented on the healthier appearance and renewed vigor of the dogs.
