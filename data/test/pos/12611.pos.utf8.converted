These truly are the absolute best gummi bears I have ever had!  The flavors are wonderfully intense.  They are not waxy or hard, just perfectly soft and chewy.  It turns out 10 pounds of gummi bears is even more than I thought it would be.  They will definitely last you a good long while!  Enough for a whole party of people.  Everyone was asking me, "aren't all gummi bears pretty much the same?" but once they started eating them, they couldn't stop either!
