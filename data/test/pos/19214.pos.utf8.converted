If you love dark chocolate, nutritionists now say it's good for you.  As a friend said, "Chocolate is a vegetable--it's a bean!"  About square or ounce of dark chocolate per day above 60% cacao is now recommended by health experts.  I love this affordable Ghiradelli chocolate.  I can eat less than an oz. and be fully satisfied.  It's a great after dinner treat and quite low in calories.  Less than 100 calories depending on size.  This 86% Cacao chocolate is not too bitter for me.  I now prefer it over milk chocolate.  Highly recommend this chocolate.  It's a non-guilty pleasure--one of the few out there.
