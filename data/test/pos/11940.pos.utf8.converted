I love a good cream of wild rice soup.  I first tried Bear Creek's version because the grocer was out of my favorite canned version. I haven't tasted any better than Bear Creek's even at restaurants. Now I always keep this soup mix on hand for a quick meal, and sometimes add whatever meat and vegetables are on hand for a hearty dinner for the family.
