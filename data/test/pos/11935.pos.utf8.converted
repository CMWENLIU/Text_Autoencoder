I love Indian food. I own two Indian food cookbooks, but find the list of spices so daunting that I've never tried any of their recipes. I heard from a coworker that prepared Indian curry pastes were available at specialty stores, so I looked for them here at Amazon and was delighted to find Patak's curry pastes. The spice level is nice, for those of us who like our food hot and spicy, and you can always add more paste if you want more kick.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients: Vegetable oil, cilantro, salt, tamarind, water, cumin, turmeric, chile pepper, ground ginger, garlic powder, maize flour, spices, acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid.<br /><br />And here is a basic recipe from the label:<br /><br />Shrimp Vindaloo, serves 2<br /><br />1 medium onion, diced<br />2 tbsp vegetable oil<br />8 oz. fresh shrimp, peeled (or any other meat)<br />3/4 cup water<br />4 tbsp Patak's hot vindaloo curry paste<br />1/2 cup diced canned tomatoes<br />hot, cooked rice<br /><br />Saute onion in oil. Add shrimp and saute until pink. Stir in curry paste and cook about 1 minute. Add tomatoes and water. Simmer, uncovered until the shrimp is cooked, about 5 minutes. Serve over hot, cooked rice.<br /><br />I tried it with beef (which you'd never be able to order at an Indian restaurant) and simmered for 25 minutes, and it turned out pretty well. Not exactly restaurant quality, but very good for a prepared paste. I now keep Patak's paste and some tomatoes on hand, in case I want to whip up a quick, spicy dish using leftover roast chicken or beef. I look forward to trying the other Patak's pastes.
