We bought a home Cotton Candy Maker this year, and it works with both sugar and hard candies.  We did some experimenting one evening and had a great time, but when I saw these Cotton Candy Floss Sugars, I had to try them and I was absolutely amazed at the difference they make!<br /><br />This sugar makes the best fluffy and flavorful cotton candy.  We made it at a summer block party and both adults and kids just loved it, with many coming back for more.<br /><br />I will certainly be getting this sugar again!<br /><br />Tip - if you are going to use this for a party or big group, buy some wooden dowels to use in the place of traditional cotton candy cones.  The sugary floss sticks just fine to them, they are easy to wash, and they are less expensive than the cones.
