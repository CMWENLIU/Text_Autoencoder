This coffee came with the "starter pack" for our Keurig coffeemaker and was near the last of the pack to be sampled.  It rated 5/5 and #2 of 25 by Dad and #3 by Mom.<br /><br />Brewed/reviewed using the largest (automobile tumbler) water size.  As stated, a "bold" taste with a heady toasted coffee aroma.  This is a medium-body coffee, despite the implication on the packaging that it is a dark coffee (it is not a dark or french roast).  Finishes clean with little or no aftertaste and no metallic taste whatsoever.  (People's coffee all had metallic finish for us.)  This is our winner for "anytime" coffee.<br /><br />The big winner was Van Houtte single-source coffees.  Absolutely perfect, but alas, not carried by Amazon, and twice the price of blended beans.<br /><br />Timothy's Morning blend was our winner for a lightly toasted coffee.  Gentle, smooth, and goes well with afternoon snacks or light lunch.<br /><br />All of the teas were perfect, but at the price we'll stick with teabags.
