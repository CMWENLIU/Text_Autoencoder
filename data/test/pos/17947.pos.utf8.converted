Be warned - if you like these, then you are setting yourself up for many re-orders! I personally love the marriage of vanilla and cashews, and while I wasn't sure about the pomegranate - it helps to create a unique blend of flavors. They have become my go-to munchie and the only complaint I have is the relatively high cost. Most stores have them for around $5/bag, but ordering this package saves you $1 per bag overall. Go ahead and treat yourself - they are a great alternative to the usual cookie, cake, etc. type of snacks.
