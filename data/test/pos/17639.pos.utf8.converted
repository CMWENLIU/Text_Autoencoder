Love this almond butter - very different from any other that I've tried... the consistency is more like that of traditional crunchy peanut butter than like a "natural" nut butter.  The roasted flavor is great!  I love the chunks of crunchy, roasted almonds... this stuff is addicting - I eat it by the spoonful out of the jar!
