The cans are packed full--not like some of the cans you buy in the stores---where most of it is juice.<br /><br />Very pleased with the fresh color and taste. A few cans were bent, but we have had a lot of ice and snow. I know the delivery people want to get back in their trucks and stay warm. There was nothing bad enough you couldn't eat them. What a fantastic way to get your groceries. It is worth it to me not to have to carry a 12 pack in.<br /><br />The green beans were great...
