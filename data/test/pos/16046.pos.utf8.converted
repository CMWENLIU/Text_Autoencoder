I have been gluten free for several years, and I generally don't even attempt to eat bread anymore, even the gluten free kinds.<br /><br />When we discovered that gluten seemed to really affect my autistic son, we had to come up with something for lunches for school.<br /><br />This mix had good reviews so I decided to try it. I have a dedicated gluten free breadmaker that was a gift.<br /><br />With a little toying, I was able to program my machine correctly for the bread. The first loaf I made was underdone in the middle, so I increased the baking time by five minutes for the second one. It wasn't a total loss, because I put the underdone pieces in a buttered skillet and fried them until they were done in the middle.<br /><br />You will need to choose the lightest crust setting you have and change it so there is only one rise time for the bread. Also, while the bread is mixing (it mixes for about five minutes or so), push the mix down on the sides with a rubber spatula about halfway through mixing. This only takes a minute. Now that my machine is programmed, all I have to do is hit the button, come back in about three or four minutes to push down the sides, and then in an hour I have a loaf of bread.<br /><br />As all gluten free bread, it will fall apart a bit if you cut it while still warm. The best way to do it is to make the bread, unmold it onto a paper plate, wrap it in plastic, and put it in the refrigerator. When it is cold it is much easier to cut with the bread knife. Also do NOT cut the whole loaf ahead of time or it will dry out within a couple of days.<br /><br />The bread tastes fabulous. There is milk contained within the mix, so it's not good for gluten free casein free people. I gave a fresh slice of it to a friend who is NOT gluten free and he thought it tasted great. I'll never buy store bought loaves of gluten free bread again, though. This tastes a hundred times better!
