You will bunny hop for joy when the Fedex man delivers your whole fresh rabbit! He was so meticulously wrapped and engagingly charming. I promptly named him Juan, for that sly, sexy look that he gave me, or would have given me had he had a head.  I took him lovingly into my arms a the heat that built between us was too much! Alas, he burst into flames and I let him slow roast for about an hour and served him on a bed of wild rice with a side dish of glazed carrots.
