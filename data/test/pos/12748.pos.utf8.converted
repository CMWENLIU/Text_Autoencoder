This was such an awsome birthday card. We have this to my father in law as this was the year he was born and he loves history. I think he loved this 30 minute disc better than his birthday gift. It shows actual footage from back then and it is crazy to see such old footage playing on your television. Absolutley an awsome little gift to give to anyone who loves history and is interested the worlds events the year they were born.
