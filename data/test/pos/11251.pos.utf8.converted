I decided to go with a CBTL machine recently instead of Keurig. I liked that CBTL machines do espresso and the one I got, the Americano can accomdate tall travel mugs, has a good sized reservoir and I was happy with the reviews of the coffees and espresso capsules. But I also like a good cup of tea and was excited to try the Moroccan.<br /><br />Very pleasantly surprised. It brewed an amazingly good cup of tea in literally seconds. One thing I hesitated on was the description of peppermint. My wife and I are not peppermint people. But this was just a nice fresh common garden mint taste. Not pepperminty at all. The perfect strength for me at 10 ounce choice and the Americano makes it at just the correct temperature; slightly too hot to do more than sip at first but quickly hits the ideal temperature. If you like a medium depth, mint tea, do get this. Turns out CBTL machines make great tea as well.
