I live in Venezuela, where the worlds finest cacao beans are grown in a remote village that is only accesible through the sea. The cacao beans grown there are dried in front of the village church in a process the whole town participates in. Ironically, if Venezuelans want to taste their cacao beans turned into chocalate, they must buy it from the extremely high-end Italian chocolatier Amedei, as Amedei has the exclusive rights to all the production of the beans from Chuao, to the last bean. Therefore, when in Europe, I searched for the bars. Amazingly, you can find them easily in classy shops at 10 euros a bar at least. I finally found the gold medal winning Chuao one. I took it back to my hotel. Drank some Perier to wash out all flavor from my mouth. Sat comfortably, and mentally went over the ritual of tasting fine chocolates. I took the first piece, placed it whole on my tongue (you're not supposed to bite), pressed it against the palate and let it do it's magic. The richness, strength, and intense flavor impressed me from the start. As it melted evenly on my tongue, I felt the gnarl of chocalate's natural bitterness, but more woody, remiscent of Royal Salute scotch, but with a sweet smoothness that relaxed my mind. The impressive effect was the aftertaste. The taste of nutty bittersweet wood stayed on my tongue as if the chocolate was still there. Not until I drank more Perrier did it go away. A unique experience in chocolate tasting.<br /><br />I do not recommend a Bud guzzlin' guy to spend money on high-end chocolate such as this one. You can, but you might end up saying that a good 'ol American Hershey bar is better. It's like fine art. If you know nothing about it, you won't fully appreciate it. I recommend it for people that like chocolate and have tried and enjoyed AT LEAST mid-range chocolates such as Lindt and Godiva, and especially if you've tried high-end type such as Cluizel, Scharffen Berger and Valrhona.
