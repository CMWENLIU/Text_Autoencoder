Our son had a cough for over a month and he tried antibiotics and other cough medicine but nothing worked. When he was visiting us recently I asked him to try Wederspoon 16+ which I had just received from Amazon. After he took 1 teaspoon of this honey, 90% of the cough was gone within 2 hours and the remaining 10% the next day.  He was so impressed with this honey that he took the 17.6 Oz jar with him.  BTW, exactly the same situation occurred with our younger son who lives in a different city. I strongly recommend that you always keep a jar handy at home.
