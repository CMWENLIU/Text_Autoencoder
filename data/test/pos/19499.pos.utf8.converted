Boil 1/2 hour, let sit 1/2 hour, then rinse - this is the simple recipe for a wonderfully chewy and gooey treat known as Boba.  I have been putting mine in hot chocolate and eating it with a spoon, like a chocolate soup.  Since the balls themselves are rather flavorless (unless sugar is mixed into the water during soak), they will never clash with anything, so don't be afraid to experiment!
