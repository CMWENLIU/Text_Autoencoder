I went on Subscribe and Save, got six bags of flour no shipping, no tax, comes out to LESS THAN half price (one bag normally costs $5.99).  The bags are of a substantial size at 24 ozs each. I made coconut cookies with this flour and coconut flour combined--no white flour at all, using a cookbook entitled GOOD TO THE GRAIN.  The recipes on back of bag are a good place to start.  At this price, you can share the wealth by giving as little gifts to other Foodies you know.
