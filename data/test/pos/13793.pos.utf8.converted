What is great about the Salad Greens Seed Kit is the AeroGarden. The instructions make everything very easy and it has been such a pleasure to watch the tiny seedlings pop up. Watching the greens leaf out, waiting for them to grow large enough to start harvesting was such a pleasure and then to snip off leaves right in the kitchen to toss into our salad bowls was a real treat - and healthy! We are now watching baby herbs sprout!
