I LOVE licorice and this is the BEST I have found without red dye #5 and blue dye #3.<br /><br />The vines are shorter than with licorice found at Wal-Mart.  But that is no problem for me.  The candy is still delicious.  I have tried the cherry and black flavor.  Love them both.  Next on my list is the strawberry.
