I've suffered from acid reflux and have postprandial hypotension.  I drink Evamore because of it's ph level. Evamore tastes great - I crave this water and can easily drink 32 oz. Drinking any other water I feel bloated and full after 8 oz. Not with Evamore. I physically felt better after drinking it. Don' have to make as many pit-stops with Evamore - seems like my body is absorbing more of it instead of just flushing it like other water. I'm glad to drink Evamore & know there are no prescription medicines in it. Go to Evamore website for good info on them. I order it from my health food store by the case & they give me a 10% discount.
