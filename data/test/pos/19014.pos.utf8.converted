Coconut oil is a wonderful product for African American hair and I absolutely love it. You can even use this, solely, as a deep conditioner, or melt it and mix it with your current deep conditioner to give it an extra boost.<br /><br />This seller is wonderful.  I ordered this yesterday and received it today.  Amazing.
