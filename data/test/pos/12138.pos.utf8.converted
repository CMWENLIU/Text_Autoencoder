I am not a vegeterian.  I am a lover of good flavor, texture, and food of every kind.  A friend brought this item to a quilting potluck and instantly the flavor & taste had me 'guarding' the dish.  I like the ease of preparation.  I like that it stores on the shelf.  I like that it is easily portable & can be served right out of the package.  I like the price.  I like that my friends [from many taste levels] cleaned out the dish last Saturday.
