I use coconut oil whenever i can in my cooking.  Its good for your heart, your immune system , and your metabolism.  Coconut oil does well with high heat cooking, without the negative health aspects from high heat that other oils have.<br /><br />In addition to moisturizing effects, coconut oil promotes skin elasticity. I use it on my skin as well.<br /><br />Since i use alot of coconut oil, i have tried many brands. Nutiva is the best brand by far.
