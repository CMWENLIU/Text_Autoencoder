I have owned a Senseo machine for about three years now and was using Senseo brand coffee for a full year before I found the Baronet coffees on Amazon. I buy this Medium Roast and Izzy's Blend Medium Roast and they are delivered to me monthly at a price cheaper than the Senseo brand pods at Target (which is the cheapest I have found for the Senseo brand). The thing that really sells this for me is the amount of coffee per pod - much more than the other pods on the market. Not all Baronet pods are this super size...be sure to check the weight. There is a good 30% more coffee in these pods than the other brands.  I am on auto delivery which cuts the price by 15% they are delivered to my front door monthly or whenever I need them.  All this and the flavor is wonderful!
