Can't beat the price.  No sales tax and no shipping is awesome!<br /><br />And the best part is just try finding low-sodium Salmon (or any other products) at your regular grocery store and if you can then you usually pay a premium for it.<br /><br />I am on the low-sodium DASH type diet and plan on buying this product again in the near future.  Oh yeah!  It is very delicious especially with a splash of Tabasco, right out of the can or make a nice Salmon salad out of it!<br /><br />I am getting hungry just thinking about it right now.  :^)<br /><br />Go Amazon!  Get some more low-sodium and NO-SALT/SODIUM products and you will definitely be getting a lot more business.<br /><br />There are many many people suffering from high-blood pressure that need these products and I will certainly spread the word!
