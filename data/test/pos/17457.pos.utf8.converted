<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HJ7AIY">Woodstream 05140 Safer Pantry Pest Trap (2 per box)</a><br /><br />I have had great results with this product.  Those who say they work for a while and then quit need to remember that the traps are only meant to catch flying stages of the insect.  I use these traps once or twice a year, whenever I see a moth or two, once the infestation problem has been solved.<br /><br />1) Use Pantry Pest Traps to eliminate all ADULT moths.<br /><br />2) Next, go on a larva hunt (in the early stages they look like caraway seeds -- dark little crescent shapes about 1/8" long).  Check all the food in your cabinets.  Take it all out.  Anything can house larva. Look in the flour, cereals, boxes, bags, anything with a seam or crevice.  Think like a mother -- she is trying to hide her young so that they will survive!<br /><br />3) We have a pantry cabinet with adjustable shelves.  When moths kept coming back, I got a flashlight and discovered that there was larva in every single hole for the shelf brackets.  Swabbing the holes with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol produced mixed results, so I finally placed a piece of tape over each hole.  If the larva survived the alcohol, they starved to death in their little cell.<br /><br />Using this method, I buy traps when moths come in with the groceries.  I use canvas shopping bags that I wash every now and then so that the bags from the store (especially paper bags) don't bring in larva.
