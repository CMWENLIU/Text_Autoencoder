My daughter is egg, soy, peanut, tree nut, sesame allergic and corn intollerant. Annie's Homegrown Organic Bunny Fruit Snacks are the first "candy" that my 8 year old can eat and she loves them.  We think they taste great and she does not get puffy and itchy after consuming them. Thank you Annie's!
