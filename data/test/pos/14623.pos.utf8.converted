I love this evaporated goat's milk for my son! It is not real expensive, and he loves it. Walmart also sells this, if you would prefer not to pay shipping. I would rather use this and supplement a few supplements then use canned formula. It has lots of harmful ingredients that this does not. The goat's milk here is fed a kosher diet and the goats are not pumped up with antibiotics and hormones! This goat's milk is closest to mother's milk!!!
