When you love Indian food, but don't have the time to cook it, Kitchens of India is a really great alternative. I have yet to be disappointed in one of their dishes and this one is no exception. The great thing about Indian food is that they are mostly sauce (or "gravy" as they say), so I will cook up some meat or steam up some veggies and add one of these packets to make a fabulous meal. Their really aren't much in the way of veggies in these packets, but that is typical in Indian food, no matter where it comes from. American's tend to use gravy or sauce as the secondary component while Indian's use it as the primary component and sop it up with lots of bread or rice. By steaming or sauteing some additional vittles, you can really stretch one of these packets.
