McCann's Irish Oatmeal has more texture, fiber and flavor than your garden variety oatmeal; I think it's the best. I like to add dried fruit and raisins to it sometimes, or you can throw in brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg if you like. By the way, I can verify that it's true what they say about oatmeal's ability to lower cholesterol; my total cholesterol dropped some 30+ pts this winter (yes we had winter here in FL). Thank you McCann's, for a great product!
