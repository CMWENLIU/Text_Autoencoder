I have been rotating through the many varieties of THK for several months now (nearly a year) and I've seen much improvement in my girls!  Healthy skin and coat, lots of energy and they love the taste.  Keen is also lower priced of all the formulas, making it very cost effective to feed.  Great stuff!
