I have tried several gluten-free breads over the past 7 years of living a gluten-free diet.  Most of them have either been really dry and/or taste like cardboard, or be too moist and good for toast but not sandwiches.  This is by far the best bread I have found for sandwiches and hamburgers.  I don't even miss wheat bread anymore.  This bread is worth the money.
