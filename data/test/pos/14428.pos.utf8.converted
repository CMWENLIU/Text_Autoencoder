It may sound crazy but from time to time I do taste what I feed my dogs especially when they are made with all natural ingredients.(no I don't taste test can food or their normal dry food) You can actually taste the blueberries. I always wonder if a pet product says it tastes like peanut butter or filet mignon, or jerky, does it? etc. I certainly wouldn't want to do more than my taste experiment but I think my dogs are getting what you pay for and they like them(my dogs love everything). Also I feel the price is reasonable and you can split the treats in half which makes the box stretch. I have found that even big dogs don't care about the size of the treat as long as they get one.
