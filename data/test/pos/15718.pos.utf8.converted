I picked this up at Costco at a pretty good deal after seeing this here. Best next thing to my old Vivarin fix but better as it is in somewhat of a food form without the crash.  Do NOT take this more than the recommended 5 Hour intervals!  First you'll be wired and more on the EDGE than anything.  Taking two of these in less than 9 or 10 hours was a shock to my system and it actually knocked me out for a minute, but after that I was wired more than anything, almost ready to fly!!  Again great booster, maybe too great sometimes. You gotta remember this is basically a double shot of the regular.  You could probably just drink 1/2 of these and get the same effect of the original obviously.
