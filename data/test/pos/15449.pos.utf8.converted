I compared this yeast to a popular brand of jarred, bread machine yeast. This yeast gets an "A" while the other yeast gets an "F" (which coincidentally is the starting letter of its name.) The "F" yeast did not last a month, even though it was stored properly. Within 4 weeks, it had lost its potency and failed to make decent bread. Meanwhile, this 2 lb bag of Red Star, kept in a sealed plastic tub in the freezer, has worked for months on end. I found that in my bread machine recipes, the same amounts work, no matter whose active dry yeast is called for; 3/4 tsp per 1 lb loaf.<br /><br />Just make sure you store the opened bag in a proper container to keep it dry and cool, and make sure to bring the yeast up to room temperature before throwing it into the bread machine. This is a very economical way to buy yeast. If it's too much for you, split the bag between you and a friend.
