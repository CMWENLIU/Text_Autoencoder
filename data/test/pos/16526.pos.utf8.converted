And this one is no exception. My mouth is watering as I write this.<br /><br />I am a SERIOUS Parmigiano-phile, who can eat at least a pound in one sitting. My poor Nonna Lucia could not keep a wedge in her humble Bronx home without my sister and I devouring it piece by piece until only a tiny chip was left sitting in the fridge -- much to everyone's dismay when it was time to put the cheese on the table to go with Nonna's homemeade spaghetti (LOL.I can laugh now....).<br /><br />Nonna eventually took to hiding the Parmigiano until The Right Culinary Moment came.<br /><br />This cheese has a wonderful grainy texture, a VERY good "Mouth" feel to it, and is bursting with sparks of intensity. Why wait for the grater? Take out the Chianti or the Merlot, cut a hunk or two from the wedge, and enjoy this cheese -- now!!
