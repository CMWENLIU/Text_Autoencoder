I looooooooooooooved this candy in my pre-diabetes days, so finding it was available sugar free was thrilling.  And this version is every bit as tasty and smoothly textured and chewy and nutty and satisfying as the original!<br /><br />Every blessed carb in them is sugar alcohol, so don't be a piggy and wolf half the box down like I did, or you'll pay for it with, err, intestinal distress.<br /><br />Still, such eruptions are not the candy's fault.  They're wonderful and worth the risk if you have better self-control and enjoy in moderation.  Distinctly fruity (in lots of helpfully labeled flavors), laced with a few nuts, and a pleasure to work over in your mouth.
