I recently discovered I could make kale chips in the oven but those are NOTHING in comparison to these. These are extremely tasty with the ranch flavoring.  The ranch dressing is dried on to the kale "chip" and the chips are light and has a great crunch.  These kale chips are dried rather than baked , ribs are removed as well so there is nothing but a great crunch.<br /><br />These chips are dehydrated not baked or fried and even though 100 calories for an 1oz seems like a lot since these chips are so light and fluffy an ounce is a rather good portion.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts:<br />Serving Size 1oz (28g)<br />Servings per container: 2<br /><br />Calories:100 Calories from Fat 41<br />Total Fat: 5g<br />Saturated Fat: 1g<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 190mg<br />Total Carbohydrates: 10g<br />Dietary Fiber: 2g<br />Sugars: 1g<br />Protein:6g<br />Vitamin A: 112%<br />Calcium:6%<br />Vitamin C: 80%<br />Iron: 10%
