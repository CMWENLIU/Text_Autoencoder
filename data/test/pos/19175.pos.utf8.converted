My husband and I love this oatmeal!  I prepare it the night before by boiling 2 cups of water.  I take the pot off the burner and pour in 1/2 a cup of oatmeal.  I let it sit covered overnight.  At the same time I place some raisins in a small container with water to plump them up overnight.  The next morning I cook the oatmeal for 10 minutes, I throw in the plumped raisins, an apple- sliced, cored and cut up, add cinnamon and some agave (natural sweetner) and the rest is history.<br /><br />We aren't hungry til lunch.  A great way to start the day.
