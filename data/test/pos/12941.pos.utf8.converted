The tomatoes are wonderful, not acidic and watery.  The bonus of being canned in puree makes it easy to put together a nice thick sauce.<br /><br />Also, props to Amazon.com, as my first order arrived with most cans dented.  I contacted customer service, and they replaced the case immediately, no extra charges.  Definitely worth ordering, for the taste and the no-problems customer service.
