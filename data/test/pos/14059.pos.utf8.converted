This product is great. You get the benefit of the fiber in the steel cut oat with only a 7 mintues cook time vs. 20+ minutes. I think it needs just a pinch of salt added, but this is great to because you control how much salt is in it vs. the traditional oatmeal that is full of salt. I was able to purchase it once at the store then they quit carring it. So I found it here on Amazon.
