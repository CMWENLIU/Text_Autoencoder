This delivers! I love it in my soy milk, sometimes with raspberry or peach accompanying it.  Or making chocolate violet creams. Can't forget putting it in club soda or mineral water.  Try making violet/peach or violet/raspberry yoghurt too...Lovely violet flavoring- so hard to find. Thank you Monin- I'm thrilled to find you!!!!
