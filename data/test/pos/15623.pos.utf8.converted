What an outstanding combination of flavors!  I must say, the dried fruit was not hard and chewy, as found in other brands I have tried.  The nuts were fresh and tasty - not an "ewwy", old-tasting nut in all three cans I received (and have since eaten!).  Highly recommend for those looking for a healthy yet satisfying (and tasty!) snack!
