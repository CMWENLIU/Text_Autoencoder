I absolutely love the grapefruit mash drink. I was excited when i found it for sale thru until I saw the price.  I buy this product at a store where I live at its $1.69 a bottle. The price per bottle thru amazon is double that at $3.25 a piece!  I understand it costs a great deal of money to ship liquids, but this is outrageous.  Look for it in stores, its a great drink, but not worth the price on amazon.
