Kokuho Rose is a variety of medium-grained rice developed and grown in California by Koda Farms. It is very similar to Japanese rice (japonica), which is short-grained and fat. Introduced to the American market in 1963, it is well-suited for Japanese cuisine because it's very sticky and glutinous, having the same taste and texture as Japanese rice. It is a very popular choice for making sushi because it is relatively easy to find and inexpensive.<br /><br />To make sushi rice, the kernels have to be washed until the water is clear, then steamed. I use an electric rice cooker like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009E3F68">Panasonic SRG06FG 3-Cup Automatic Rice Cooker</a>, but you can get fancier ones that cost upwards of $100. Cooked perfectly, the grains are firm, slightly elastic and have a shiny, pearl-like luster.<br /><br />You should be able to find this at your local Asian supermarket, as it is a widely distributed brand. Some bigger American supermarkets may also carry it. Another popular brand is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HQKHUI">Nishiki Premium Rice</a>. These are the two major brands I use and recommend. If you can't find either of these, a third brand is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MCHN8Q">Botan Rice</a>.
