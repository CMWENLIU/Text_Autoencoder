Vegan. Natural. Crisp breads are a very traditional food in Scandinavia. Rye is the most traditional flavor. The rye flavor in this crisp is very mild. Good choice for appetizers or with your favorite soups. Very crisp. For a real treat try with orange or other fruit marmalades for breakfast or anytime treat. Easily resealable in a quart [litre] ziplock bag. Long shelf life. Can last through the long Scandinavian winter until the glorious spring. Made in Espoo, Finland. Approximately 33 crisps per box. Only 20 calories per crisp. Also really like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJM4RY">Finn Crisp Sesame Rounds, 8.8-Ounce Units  (Pack of 12)</a>.
