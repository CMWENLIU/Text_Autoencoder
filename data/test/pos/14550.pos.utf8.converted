This is the first time I've used Stevia.  The product arrived quickly thru Amazon's subscribe program, in excellent packaging.<br /><br />I feel I need/want to use more than the recommended dosage by just a little, but then the tea, coffee, lemonade, etc., tastes as sweet as I like it.  I agree with others that the bottle will still go a long way, so it is healthy, effective, sugar free sweetening for a good price.  I'm definitely satisfied.
