I finally ordered a couple products from this seller for myself(not as gifts) and I am really happy. This Jade Bonsai is really cool and it arrived fast and in perfect condition. It's in my living room and I get tons of compliments. It's already grown some too and the pot it came in is really nice, looks expensive! Much bigger than I thought it would be even.  Thanks again!!
