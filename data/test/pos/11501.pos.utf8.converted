Great Horny Toads! This is great stuff! I tried it on a whim while suffering dreadful sinusitis and nasal polyps. OK, it didn't cure anything, but it sure made me feel better, got the sinus passages to open up, and enabled me to sleep. I ended up needing sinus surgery (The whole caboodle: every sinus) and I used this every day up to the day of surgery to keep the drainage going while I was on prednisone.<br /><br />Best advice is to bring a bottle of water with you into the bathroom while you soak, and don't make the mix too strong. Keep it to two ounces per full tub.  And do sit for 20 minutes, even if you have to keep topping off the tub with more water. It will loosen up phlegm and get that blood circulating.<br /><br />Then, you MUST get into bed and stay warm. Don't get chilled afterward.<br /><br />I was able to do the brief cold shower ritual only once. The mustard bath makes me too sleepy and a little light headed. So normally I wrap up in a huge towel and exit the bathroom to dry off and change. Then under the blankets for at least an hour.<br /><br />Wonderful stuff!
