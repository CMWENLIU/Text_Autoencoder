My 9-year-old toy poodle has been eating Innova for the last three years and Innova EVO for the last year. In six months, the pain he'd been experiencing in his rear legs had disappeared and his gait was back to normal. He also has more energy than he's had since he was a puppy.<br /><br />Innova may seem more expensive, but the returns in better health and continued companionship from your dog make it a true bargain.
