Arrowhead produces several puffed cereals but this is my favorite. First off, it doesn't get soggy. You can take several phone calls or even a shower and come back and find this stuff is still holding up to the milk. And because the kernels are small it's ideal for someone like me with jaw problems. The flavor is similar to popcorn, just milder. Only downside is that occasionally you'll get a bag where they haven't done such a good job of eliminating the hulls...bothersome buggers that have a tendency to cling to your gums etc. I start every day with a bowl.
