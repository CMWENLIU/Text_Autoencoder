OK here is what the problem is.  When I first made this mix it did not come out.  It was very moist and did not rise.  I blamed the yeast.  I called the company to find out what was wrong with the mix.  I was told to add 3 table spoons of flour.  I did on the next box. Well that was the problem.  The sweet mix has such a high moisture in the mix.  It need that extra flour.  Plus the bread came out nice and sweet and soft.  I also baked it on light bread not Med.
