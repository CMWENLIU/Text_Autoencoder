Blue Buffalo Wilderness is a virtually pure protein dogfood.  It's free of any additives or junk.  It's also free of all those grains and carbs that they fill up other dog foods with -- like corn (which dogs can't digest anyway), soy, etc.  If you have a dog who is diabetic (and lately diabetes is as much an epidemic among dogs as it is among people), Blue Buffalo is essential to you.  Since we started our 6 year old diabetic pug on Blue Buffalo Wilderness, his blood glucose levels have stabilized, he has lost weight, his overall health has improved and he has more energy.  Prior to finding this dog food we had been making his food ourselves and with two other dogs and two cats, that ain't easy!  Thank you Blue Buffalo for creating a product that diabetic canine parents can give their dogs without worrying about a bad impact on our dog's health.<br /><br />And, please ignore the poor review left for this product which was actually a criticism of Amazon's packaging.  That is an inappropriate product review -- it has NOTHING to do with the quality of this product and should not be posted at all.
