As an avid buyer of organic food, i was surprised to see this new item in produce at Whole Foods when i was traveling on business in California. It was by far the smoothest and freshest coconut water i have ever tasted. I went back to the same store the next day and it was sold out, so I actually traveled to the next closest whole foods just to buy another couple bottles.  As an avid runner i have tried almost every coconut water out there post workout to aid in my recovery, and with this one i actually felt a serious difference. Unfortunately it doesnt appear that it is available on the east coast yet, so I will definitely purchase this when it becomes available on amazon.<br /><br />Thank you for finally coming out with a 100% organic coconut water!!!
