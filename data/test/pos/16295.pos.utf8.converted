This is our favorite jerky spice mix and use it so much it was more convenient and much more affordable to order in a large quanity. My only complaint was that it was short product quantity. Amazon couldn't have been better in sending out another order to take out what was missing and return the rest. The second order was also short. 18 cure packages instead of 24. So order with confidence but make sure you count it.
