I bought some of this for my husband last Christmas with a stovetop popcorn popper (the kind with the stir rod.)  Now it's our favorite brand of popcorn and our favorite way to make it.  The packages come with pre-measured oil & popping corn and you just cook it all up.  Each box has 5 bags.  Each bag makes a big bowl (?20 cups?)  We only have to add salt and we love the taste.  I highly recommend this with a stir rod popper, too--either the stovetop or electric kind.
