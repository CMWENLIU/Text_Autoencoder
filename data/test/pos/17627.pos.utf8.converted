Great sweet potato flour! I would buy again from this farm. They did a great job. I would recommend buying two or three bags if you plan on using a lot. I bought this and the blue cornmeal flour which was fantastic.<br /><br />FYI - To avoid higher shipping - buy larger quantities or a variety of flours. I made that mistake and was surprised at the charge due to the flour weight. You can trust this vender. They do take a little over a week to get their product to you but it's worth it.
