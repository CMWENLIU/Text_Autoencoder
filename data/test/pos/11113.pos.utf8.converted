My husband drank Pero when he lived in Argentina, loved it, and has been frustrated because it's been hard to find.  He gave some to a friend who was trying to quit drinking coffee and get rid of caffeinne in her diet.  She loved it too, and then found your site offering whole cases of it!  We immediately ordered a case ourselves.  We've shared our Pero with others who want a good-tasting, caffeine-free hot drink, and it's been welcomed enthusiastically.  Thanks for a great service.  Thanks for making a great healthy breakfast drink so easy to get.
