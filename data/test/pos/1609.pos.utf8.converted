Hands down, Rishi Tea Tumeric Ginger tea is my all-time favorite tea. I love the taste of ginger and turmeric together in one tea. The flavor is zesty and aromatic (lemon oil and orange peel) at the same time.<br /><br />If you like the combination of both balances, you will love this tea. And it is organic! The loose leaf tea arrives in a tin canister, enveloped in aluminum wrapping. You receive two canisters of tea.<br /><br />The ingredients:<br /><br />organic ginger, organic orange peel, organic licorice root, organic lemongrass, organic turmeric and lemon oil.<br /><br />T.B.
