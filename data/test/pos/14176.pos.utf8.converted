Mexican is one of my favorite foods and smothering a bean burrito with red sauce and onions is one of my quick, stand-by dinner options. With such a simple meal, it is imperative to have fresh and tasty ingredients. I've tried many red sauces and some were quite good, but this one is excellent.<br /><br />Frontera makes two types of red sauce. One is vegetarian and the other has chicken.  My husband is a huge fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTKVDE">Frontera Foods Inc. Sauce, Enchilada, Clasc Red, 16-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>.  That product has chicken components.  My husband raved about the sauce.  As a vegetarian, I could not eat it so I was excited to find the 8 ounce pouches of sauce that are vegetarian.<br /><br />I find this product to have a rich tomato taste.  The sauce spreads easily and is not thin or tomato paste thick. The pouches, however, are relatively small.  I can cover about five burritos that are wrapped in six inch tortillas with a thin layer of sauce.  Two pouches are really optimal for a dish that has five - eight burritos.<br /><br />I've purchased these eight ounce pouches off Amazon but also purchase them from my local co-op for about 2.75.
