I just discovered these tomatoes on Amazon.<br /><br />Unlike the previous reviewer, I have actually tasted these tomatoes . . . at lest a dozen times. I can buy them locally here in Chicago.<br /><br />They have an excelent taste. I use them on special occasions and with cetain recipies. They are much better than a half dozen other national brands of canned tomatoes. I don't find anything wrong the others. This is just a lot better.<br /><br />They are also less expensive then the real Italian D.O.P. certified San Marzano tomatoes, so I consider it a value buy.<br /><br />I'm not sure why someone who never sampled the product feels its appropriate to vent about it. Maybe its a disgruntled ex-employee?
