First of all these things taste delicious. They really taste like there is milk in your cereal. When in the office I have one every day for breakfast. I do a lot of coast to coast air travel and I never leave home without a couple of Cheerio's Milk 'n cereal bars in my carry on bag. They're life savers when you're stuck in the airport or on a long flight, since the airlines have cut down on their snack service. My local Safeway never has them, so I've started ordering them by the case from Amazon. I wish I would of thought of this long ago!! P.S. The servings are larger than the average snack bar, and I've proven they stay fresh, even when left in my bag, during a coast to coast to coast round trip!
