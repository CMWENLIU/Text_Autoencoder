I make my own yogurt.  I use 2 cups of Bob's RedMill Powdered milk with a gallon of milk and a small carton of plain yogurt for the starter from the grocery store.  The powdered milk makes my homemade yogurt set up and get thick.  Yogurt is heat sensitive, a temp of about 100 degrees for 5-6 hours incubates the yogurt.
