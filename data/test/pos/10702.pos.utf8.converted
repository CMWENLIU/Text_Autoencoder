I have high blood pressure and love pretzels.  I felt deprived of my favorite snack until I found this product.  I had tried other low salt pretzels, but they were just not very good.  Then, while visiting in Florida I discovered Snyder's of Hanover Unsalted Mini Pretzels.  They are delicious and only 75mg. of sodium for 20 mini pretzels.  The bonus is that they are fat free.  I could not find them anywhere in my area so Thank you to Amazon for selling them, and at a cheaper price than Snyder's website.  I even gave my doctor a bag.  He has high blood pressure too!
