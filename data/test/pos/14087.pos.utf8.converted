You will not be disappointed with this mix! When made as directed it will give a homemade pan gravy a run for it's money. It is rich and creamy and just the right blend of seasoning - don't let the 'just add water' fool you, it is a powerhouse of flavor all on its own.  I received a bag of this mix from a friend who was moving away and was hesitant to use too much of it at one time for fear of running out... until I found it here on AMAZON!! Now - it's gravy time.
