I gave up coffee about six months ago and had been drinking various types of teas and herba matte since then. I stumbled across Ayurvedic Roast on line and decided to order a bag to see if I liked it. Like it? I love it! I really like coffee and don't mind tea but one thing I really missed with tea was the full body texture of a cup of coffee. Ayurvedic Roast comes very close in texture and I really enjoy the flavor. Just ordered myself a 4lb. bag so I don't have to worry about running out anytime soon.
