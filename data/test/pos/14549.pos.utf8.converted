Liquid Stevia is SO expensive in the stores.  This is economical AND wonderful to boot!  I put this on a bi-monthly subscription because I use it combined with extracts to make home-made sodas. Oh SO good!<br /><br />Note: I notice that this stevia works great in cold things but use VERY sparingly in hot things as the heat seems to bring out the bitterness of this product (where-as in cold things I don't notice any bitterness at all).
