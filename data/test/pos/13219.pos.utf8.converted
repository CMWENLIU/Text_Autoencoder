you'll never go back to wheat flour for pancakes and cookies after using this!  I saw another review saying the pancakes were tasteless...I don't understand, as my entire family, gluten-eaters as well, now prefer this to regular home-made pancakes.  The recipe calls for water, but I use rice milk or almond milk, or whatever milk I have available - sometimes half water and half milk, and they are superb!<br />The chocolate chip cookies recipe....oh my goodness.  These are so yummy! We made these to take a party and everyone was raving about them before they even knew they were gluten free!  They turned out perfectly - soft and chewy with a great texture.  YUM!
