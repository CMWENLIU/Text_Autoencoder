This is as close to a perfect sports drink as I can find.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* When used at the recommendation concentration the solution is 7% carbohydrate. Studies have shown 7-8% is ideal for gastric emptying and absorption rates. Many drinks are much sweeter, which makes the gut draw water from muscles to dilute the mixture. Thankfully that is not the case here.<br />* It mixes very well, and tastes great.<br />* Good price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Only one: it has 200% RDA of vitamin C per serving. Since about 2g of vitamin C in a day is the safe upper limit, that puts a limit on how much you can drink in very long activities.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />* Contains glutamine and BCAAs (2mg per serving). If you have an energy deficit, which you almost certainly will when you drink this, they will probably just be burned as energy.<br /><br />Other drinks all seem to be either a) expensive, b) more sweet than they should be, c) mix poorly and/or taste terrible, or d) full of protein that is not appropriate during or immediately after a workout. I won't be using anything else now that I have found this.
