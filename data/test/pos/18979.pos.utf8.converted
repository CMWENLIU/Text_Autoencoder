I had been looking for something to help minimize my hair shedding during my transition period from relaxed hair to natural hair.  I have not tried other brands, but after using this brand of coconut oil I'm hooked.  I also used it on my skin and it absorbs well and leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft.  No more lotions full of chemicals for me!!
