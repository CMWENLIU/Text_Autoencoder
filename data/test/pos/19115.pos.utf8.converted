<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VVVJ6W">32-oz. - Gold Label Virgin Coconut Oil - 1 quart</a>My family and I use Tropical Traditions Gold label Virgin Coconut oil - not only is it great for cooking and baking, but its wonderful for your skin too. We keep some in the shower for daily use and also use their coconut oil skin care cream for any skin problems or rashes - works great! However there are two other things I look for when buying online - fast shipping and good customer service. Tropical Traditions has both - I've been buying their products for years - their customer service rocks!! I recommend this company -you can purchase this item with confidence.
