I love this peppermint tea, by Celestial Seasonings, so much.  It's great as an iced tea or brewed hot.  I've also noticed that when I have a stomach ache or a sore throat, this really helps me soothe my pain.  This is great tea to have around when company is coming and ideal when served with cookies or a nice slice of cake.
