If you're overweight or "fat" as some would say, you shouldn't eat this. It's got lots of sugar that's not gonna help you much. But if you're a healthy individual with an insanely efficient metabolism, like myself, eat away. This cereal is top notch, second only to Lucky Charms in my opinion. Each little piece of "toast" is coated in the most delicious sugar/brown sugar mix you will ever expirience, and anyone who specializes in the art of cereal consumption, again like myself, will know that this fact makes for some mouth-watering leftover milk.<br /><br />I must warn you however, if you searched Cinnamon Toast Crunch here on Amazon, you may have seen the "reduced sugar" version of this cereal. STAY AWAY! If I didn't know any better, I would say they replace the sugar with some sort of beach sand. It tastes terrible and makes you're mouth feel like you just comsumed several sticks of chalk. Stay with the full sugar version and you'll be satisfied.
