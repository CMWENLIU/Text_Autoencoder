I am extremely pleased with the vegetable mix I ordered and the very fast delivery. The shipping charge is a little high if you only order one item which induces a person (like me) to order many more than just one. I'm sure the company doesn't mind.<br />I will definitely order from Marshalls Creek Spices again.
