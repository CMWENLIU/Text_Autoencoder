Like my title suggests, I've just started to try different alternatives to animal protein.  I really liked this product.  It was easy to prepare by soaking in water for 15 minutes then frying it up with some spices, tomato, onion and garlic in a bit of olive oil.  The texture is close to ground beef though not exactly the same, just a bit softer.  I think I like this product the best of the various protein replacements I've tried.  My only complaint and it's minor, is that it tastes slightly sweet.  Perhaps more experimentation with it and I can figure out how to offset this.  In any event I'll be ordering more!
