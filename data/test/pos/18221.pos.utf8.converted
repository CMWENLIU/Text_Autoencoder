Most decaffeinated teas taste flat and weak to me. Taylors tea is an exception. It tastes almost as good as a cup of high quality caffeinated tea. So far I have never found another decaffeinated tea as good as Taylors Decaffeinated Breakfast Tea. Most of the Taylors teas are very good. For some reason, I think the tagless bags make better tea than the bags that have tags. Also, Taylors produces at least two sizes of bags and the larger bags seem to make better tea. Maybe that's simply because the tea made from larger bags is stronger, given that I do not vary the size of my cup.
