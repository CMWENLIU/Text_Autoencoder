I bought Do Matcha second harvest back in December and enjoyed it through January.  I went to reorder and opted for a bulk package of generic matcha for $11.  BIG DIFFERENCE!  I don't believe the quality is nearly as good as Do Matcha and along with it all the health benefits.  It appears this generic matcha delivers a great deal more caffeine as well.  So, I'll be ordering Do Matcha next time!  If you are wavering over trying to decide about the Do second harvest, STOP!  It's a great product and the best value in matcha.
