Folks, if you're looking for a soy sauce that'll knock your socks off, skip over the La Choy and Kikkoman stuff.  I was introduced to Aloha Shoyu when I was stationed on Oahu for five years in the Navy.  Nothing comes close to the flavor and quality, and if you're looking for a low sodium version, Aloha is no ka oi (the best).<br />Mahalo and aloha!
