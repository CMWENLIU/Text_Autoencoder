We were introduced to Robby's pancake mix by a friend several years ago.  Of all the many prepared and scratch mixes we have tried in the past, Robby's is by far the best we have ever had.  Although when prepared with milk Robby's tastes excellent, it is by far better when prepared with buttermilk! We use the same Robby's mix (prepared with buttermilk, of course) for waffles with the same wonderful taste experience.  You will not be disappointed.
