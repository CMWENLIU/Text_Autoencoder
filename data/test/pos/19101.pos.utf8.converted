These sticky rice bowls are real winners. They take two minutes to prepare in the microwave and they give you a nice  serving (or two)of very good sticky rice. You can add vinegar to make seasoned sushi rice for your own sushi, make rice balls, serve with vegetables or  protein or just eat as is. Reasonably priced given the convenience. These are becoming a staple around our house. They can be  the basis for a quick lunch,a nice side dish or a foundation/element of much more elaborate preparations. We put this in lettuce wraps with some leftover duck and a few seasonings and had a very elegant and successful snack for unexpected visitors.  One bowl usually serves two normal appetites or one very large, very Hungry, man quite nicely,  I've added this to  soups and stir fries etc. and one bowl was actually enough to serve three or four people when used that way.
