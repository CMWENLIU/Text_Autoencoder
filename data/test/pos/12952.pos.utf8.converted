I drink a lot of diet decaf iced tea and had difficulty finding it in the local supermarkets. When I did find it I had to pay almost $5.00 per bottle. By ordering it through Amazon I can get 6 jars every month (or whenever I want it) on automated delivery and the price is down around $3.50 per bottle. That's great in these tough times when every penny seems to make a difference! This is a great way to have a ready supply and not worry about going to the store and not finding any, and the delivery is FREE! Thanks Amazon!!!
