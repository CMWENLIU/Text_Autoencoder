These dried tart cherries are excellent and a real buy but only when ordered through amazon.com (rather than Traverse Bay) in the 4-pound box.  We get them to help with our arthritis, taking 10 morning and evening.  You will know within a week whether or not they will help, but most of our friends have found they help.  Of course a piece of cherry pie would have the same effect, but these are lower calorie and much more portable!  They can be substituted for Craisins in granola, muffins, cereal, and so on.
