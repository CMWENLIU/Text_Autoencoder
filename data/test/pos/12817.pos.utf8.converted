I recently started cooking Moroccan dishes and therefore went through all the different harissa sauces to seek out the ones that I thought were the best - bottom line - this sauce is head and shoulders above the others in a variety of ways including overall flavor and spice - save yourself the timely process that I endured and use this one - you won't be disappointed.
