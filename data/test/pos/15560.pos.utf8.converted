This 6 pack is a great deal on a product that's sometimes hard to find in stores. My dad loves these, so I got them for him for Xmas. The flavor and creaminess of this chocolate is fantastic. Really nice quality, not unlike German chocolate with just a hint of orange flavor. Hard to stop at one section! Note, don't try and "slam" this orange to break it into sections on a warm day!
