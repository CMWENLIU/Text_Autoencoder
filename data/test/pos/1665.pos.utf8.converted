What were they thinking? Not the makers of Miracle Noodles, but the people who rated Miracle Noodles anything less than 5 stars! You are not a real 'pastaholic' on a low-carb diet if you don't LOVE the satisfaction Miracle Noodles give you. Yes they smell fishy when you open the bag, but as EVERYBODY has told you, that smell goes away after you rinse and boil. And there is NO fishy taste whatsoever. The Fettucini noodles are my favorite even though the Angel Hair is the best seller. I love how substantial the Fettucini noodles are and how their shape helps sauces hold on. I'm finding myself eating about 1 bag a day (I put anything and everything on them just to satisfy that carb craving), so I'll probably join the automatic shipment program so I'll never be out of them!
