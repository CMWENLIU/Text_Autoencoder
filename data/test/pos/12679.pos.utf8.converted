I love chai, and black tea with milk and honey, so I was not expecting this tea to taste "good" without adding a sweetener. To my surprise, it is exactly as its box describes - sweet and spicy. It has no sweeteners, however, as the sweet flavor comes from its unique blend.<br /><br />While there is artificial flavor in it - an artificial spice, according to Good Earth's site - there is also an organic version (which I haven't had yet.) I am convinced it's just fake cinnamon, because if you steep the tea too long, you get the same tongue-tingle as eating red hots (cinnamon candies) when you were a kid.<br /><br />All that aside, this is the best tasting tea I have ever had, and like most teas, it has very few calories. (3 calories, according to other sites I've seen.)
