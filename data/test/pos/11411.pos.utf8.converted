I am having a lot of fun with my Keurig coffee brewer. There are som many flavors of K-cups out there that it is fun trying samples of all the flavors. This is a new flavor that I wanted to try. I have found a lot of the flavored coffees do not taste all that good and only a few brands have decent flavored coffee. What I like about this Kahlua flavor from Timothy's is that the flavoring is not overpowering and lets the taste of the coffee come through. It is very pleasant to me and the wife and a good change of pace from what we normally have in the pantry. This is one flavor I will try to keep in stock.
