I would give it.  This hot sauce is the best hot sauce that has ever been made with human hands.  To compare this to Tabasco is an utter mockery, but that is the most common "hot sauce" that most Americans have experienced, so that is the one that I will compare it to.  Anyone that would try to genuinely compare the two should have a CAT scan done.  A 7 out of 10 as far as hotness, Tapatio can go on anything that you need to make spicy and tasty.  Try putting a couple of squirts of this Mexican nectar in a bag of Doritos and you WILL NOT be able to put them down.  Buy the 32 oz. size, you will not regret it!
