This is my favorite flavor so far, and it's really vegetarian, too, though obviously not vegan. There are no animal products listed in the ingredients, unlike the savory soy sauce flavor, which contains beef tallow. It's really spicier than I expected, though you could throw a little red pepper in there, if you're very committed.
