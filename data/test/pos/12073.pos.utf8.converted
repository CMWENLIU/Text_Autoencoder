A friend bought these last year and shared them with me.  They were so good, I immediately went to the same store to buy some more and they were already out of them.  I have searched everywhere for these pumpkin spice Kisses and could not find them.  I even called Hershey's but they couldn't help me either.  I finally found them here at Amazon (yea Amazon).  If you like pumpkin, these Kisses rock!  I highly recommend them.  Only problem you'll have is portion control.
