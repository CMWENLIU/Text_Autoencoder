I tried this product because I have read about the health benefits of dark chocolate, and because it is an "all natural" product, and because 10% of the profits are donated to help support species, habitat and humanity.<br /><br />It is really quite good, and very rich.  But you should know that the flavor is a lot different from a Hershey bar.  This particular one is 88% cocoa with only 5g sugar in one-half of a 3 oz bar.  The 3 oz bar is a nice size and is more chocolate than I would eat in a sitting, not that I eat a lot of chocolate anyway.  It tastes something like the DARK Hershey bar WITHOUT the sugar.  That could be a somewhat bitter taste to someone, especially if you are not expecting it.  There are also 0 mg of sodium (salt) and 0 mg cholesterol.  There is 4 % calcium and 15% iron, as well as 6 g fiber and 210 calories in one-half of a 3 oz bar.  The back of the paper label tells you about the leopard and jaguar.  The candy bar (if you really want to call it candy) is wrapped inside a foil wrapper.  (I think of it more as a health food.) The cacao is purchased from small family-operated properties to help sustain the habitats and communities in which they exist.<br /><br />I have a bar in my desk at work, inside a baggie.  Ever-so-often, I schnick off a piece. Then I let it melt in my mouth. Good stuff, just a little different.
