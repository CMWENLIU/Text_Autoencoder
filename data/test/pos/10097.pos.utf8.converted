I love this product.  I wanted to stop drinking soda, and I don't care for coffee, but I still needed caffeine to make it through the day. The 120mg in this more than meets my needs.  Not sure why it is so expensive on here though.  I have no trouble getting it at the local Wal-Mart for $1.97 a box.
