This is one of the most awesome pieces of japanese everyday cooking you can find. A thick, sweet curry sauce that's great with white rice. Always keep in mind the best way to prepare the meat for this kind of curry is in a slow-cooking pot the night before. This way you'll enjoy the melting taste of soft meat along with the exquisite curry sauce, and maybe you'd like to add a cup of water to the meat in the slow-cooker so you can use the broth later to replace part of the water needed for the sauce. This will increase the taste. Also, choose your meat carefully! Very soft pieces will literally melt in the slow cooker, while harder pieces will become tastier and just as soft as we want them to be.<br /><br />That aside, the rest is to follow the instructions in the box. Enjoy!
