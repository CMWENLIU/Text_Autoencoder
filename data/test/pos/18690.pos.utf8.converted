My little one likes to eat another brand of "organic fruit chews". I think they're just ok. I got these on a whim, they are sooo good. I like eating them too. the name says it all..."Tasty". My little one liked them so much, when he finished the pack he began holding them up to the car window and told me he wantd everyone to try the super good new fruit chews. I highly recommend them! they even have 100% of your vit C for the day ;-)
