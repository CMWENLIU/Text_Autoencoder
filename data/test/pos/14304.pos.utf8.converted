This bread is satisfying for hours. No more carb cravings. Agree with other poster about how it seems to stabilize blood sugar levels.  Slices are long. Cut it in half and toast. One slice is one serving, is 6g of fiber, has 4g of protein, 1 g fat and only 350g sodium. Ingredients: whole kernel rye, water, oat kernels, whole meal rye, iodized salt, wheat germ, oat fiber, yeast. That's it, nothing else.
