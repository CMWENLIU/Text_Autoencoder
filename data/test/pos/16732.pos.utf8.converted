I ordered this date sugar because I had a recipe for GAPS-legal brownies that called for 2 3/4 c. date sugar.  The first time I made the recipe I bought dates and put them in my food processor--I didn't realize you're supposed to dry them in the dehydrator first!  So I ended up with a huge sticky ball of very sticky date "sugar" that I used.  Some portions of the date got stuck in the sticky, sticky ball of stickiness without totally being blended so I got little chunks of date in my brownies.  I had trouble blending the sticky date ball with the butter and cocoa, and it was tough to mix into the rest of the recipe.  It wasn't the end of the world, and the brownies were good, but the texture was a little off.<br /><br />SO, I ordered this date sugar and I've made the brownies again.  Holy smokes, it was so much easier!  Instead of buying this date sugar, you COULD buy a bunch of dates, dry them out in a dehydrator, and put them in a food processor.  I won't do that again though, because that takes a bunch of time, and it cost me more to use dates from the store than it cost to buy this already turned into date sugar.<br /><br />The texture of this date sugar is uniform enough that it works well in recipes, but the color and size of the granules varies enough that you know it comes from real food instead of being some sort of chemical product.  The date sugar is quite sweet, and very easy to work with.<br /><br />I will definitely continue to buy this date sugar.
