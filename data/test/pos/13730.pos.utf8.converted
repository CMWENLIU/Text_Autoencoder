I really enjoy Gevalia's coffee. The Traditional Roast is my perfect coffee - smooth, not too strong, not too weak, doesn't seem to lose it's wonderful flavor even after sitting in the pot...it's wonderful. When I took my first sip, I was highly impressed and amazed at how different it is than regular ol' store bought stuff - Foldger's, House, generic brands - they really don't even compare. Normally, I use some non-dairy creamer and a packet of Sweet N Low for all of my coffee. When I tested the taste to see how much I'd need, I was blown away by the fact that the Traditional Roast coffee was so good, I didn't feel the need to put anything in it - that's a first.<br /><br />Excellent Coffee and I definitely recommend it.
