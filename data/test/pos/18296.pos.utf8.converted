I've received my second order of this product.  This time I ordered the larger size.  This is an excellent alternative sweetener.  It has no after taste like a lot of the artificial sweeteners. I use it in my drinks, cereals and cooked dishes.  I've never tried baking with it.  I highly recommend this product - try it, you'll like it!
