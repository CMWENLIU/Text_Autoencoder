If your pantry is inundated with moths (or weevil-types) - this trap will take care of the moths that hatch after you clean out your pantry. With the long life cycle that these pests have - you need something to catch new ones. Even if you clean out your food and put everything kept in storage containers there may still be some rogue eggs (you would be amazed at what these pests like to lay their eggs in!) I found eggs in clean brown lunch sacks. It wouldn't even be unreasonable to use these traps before you have a pest problem. Very safe!
