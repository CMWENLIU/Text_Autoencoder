I am not a sugary foods eater anymore and I read some reviews where the reviewer said this product was taste-less.<br />And I sure it was to them so not to belittle that experience ... but for me this product has great taste and crunch.<br /><br />Texture and taste are important and this cereal had both.  This cereal is Organic, Gluten Free and Unsweetened.<br />Therefore, I bought this product.  So many gluten free cereals are sweetened and I don't want that, esp. in the morning.<br /><br />This cereal is simple but the cereal holds up well to the unsweetned almond milk, meaning it doesn't get "soggy" too quickly either.<br /><br />To me, these flakes taste "toasty", as in toasted corn and that is where the flavor comes from.<br />I add liquid Stevia (all natural chemical free sweetner) directly to my Almond Milk. This is where I get my desired added flavor<br />and sweetness.<br /><br />Good to use for recipes calling for Corn Flakes too. Chances are your recipe has all the sugar and flavor you want already so why add more sugar via corn flakes if you don't have too.<br /><br />Most people taste buds are conditioned by our American processed foods to taste, register and like sugary and salty only.<br /><br />This cereal allows you to determine if you want sugar in that breakfast bowl or not. Not alot of cereals give you that option.<br />Esp. those that are organic and gluten free as well.
