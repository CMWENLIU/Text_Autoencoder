Lapsang Souchong is what some might consider an acquired taste, because the smokiness and aroma of it are quite strong. Its aromatic reminiscence of woodsy smoke does not take away from the taste of the tea itself, which is rich, flavorful, and not at all bitter as one might suspect from the first overwhelming sniff. The taste is actually mellow and yet refreshing, the color a golden amber, and, as the reviewer below mentions, it is best when not steeped for too long. It's also best served without milk, as this takes away from the taste...but personal taste is personal taste.<br /><br />I must admit, I am not what you'd call a lapsang souchong snob, but I have tasted several brands, and Taylors of Harrogate offer the best I've ever tried. Their tea is divine, and I'm going to order some more of their other teas.
