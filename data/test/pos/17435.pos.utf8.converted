Lakewood organic grape juice has an excellent, fresh, full-strength Concord grape flavor. It's actually pretty intense, which is a good thing if you like grape juice.<br /><br />In addition to it being organic, the big plus to me is that there are no added sulfites. Lakewood prints that in bold letters right on the front of the label.
