I love this variety of Chex mix. Unfortunately I can't find it in the grocery stores anymore, but was excited to find it on Amazon. The caramel bits are especially yummy.  I fell in love with it before I decided to diet, and now that I'm on Weight Watchers, I really appreciate finding 100 calorie snacks that taste great.
