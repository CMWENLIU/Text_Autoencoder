After moving to the South from the Northeast, finding good products to cook food from my Italian heritage has been hard.  I haven't been able to find a substitute for my beloved Redpack tomatoes.  We buy those by the box up North, but that company doesn't distribute in the South.  After some research I found the label difference was "packed in Puree".<br /><br />Most other brands are packed in tomato juice, and that makes a watery, inferior sauce.  "Purea di Pomodoro" - that's what I want to see!  But when I saw this brand, I saw the magic words and gave it a try.  In fact, last night I cooked up a big pot of sauce and brought it over to my Southern neighbors, and it was a hit!<br /><br />It short, this Brooklyn born Southerner recommends this product, especially to those who are out of the area of the usual Northeastern brands.  I just wish Amazon would put this on their subscribe and save - I use four cans each time I make a pot so getting this regularly to my door would be great.
