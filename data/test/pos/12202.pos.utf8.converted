I feed my baby organic baby food from several different brands.  I must say that Sprout tastes the most like real table food.  If you look at the ingredients, you can tell that a lot of thought is put into making these taste like real food.  Plus, they are extremely filling and nutritious.  I have tasted this one, and if salt were added (of course I wouldn't want that in my baby's food), it would taste like a very delicious canned soup.<br /><br />If these are available locally, I would suggest buying one pouch of several different varieties before investing in 12 pouches of a flavor that your baby may or may not like.  My local grocery store carries them as well as Walmart.<br /><br />ETA:  I just noticed that amazon doesn't list the ingredients.  The ingredients for this flavor as well as all of the others can be found on the Sprout website.  I will copy them here.<br /><br />Organic Ground Chicken, Filtered Water, Organic Yukon Gold Potatoes, Organic Corn, Organic Peas, Organic Cream (organic cream, carrageenan), Organic Carrots, Organic Onions, Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Organic Garlic, Organic Vegetable Base (organic carrots, organic onions, organic celery, organic canola oil, organic carrot powder, organic potato flour, organic onion powder), Organic Sage.
