I too have made a hobby of tasting most of the k-cup's brewers' offerings, and have found this one to have the best flavor, balance and boldness without being overly strong and dense.  I ordered other blends just to have a choice, but keep choosing this one!  For decaf, my favorite is Timothy's Columbian Decaf - again after much sampling.  Oh, and just for the record, I LOVE my Keurig K-cup brewer!
