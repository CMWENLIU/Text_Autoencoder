These are the best chocolate covered gummy bears ever!! I originally got these at the Sweet Factory but when I went back to get more they just didn't taste the same. It turns out they changed the company who provided their muddy bears and they weren't nearly as good. When I asked who made the old bears I was told they were Koppers. Thankfully I was able to get more online and they are the same great Muddy bears. I highly recommend them!
