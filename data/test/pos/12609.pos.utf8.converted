I love this meusli.  So easy to make and "sticks to your ribs" til lunchtime.  Tasty as can be.  It is awful big, and I often wonder why they make it in the bigger cups instead of the smaller sizes.  Still, I usually eat half and keep the other half in the refrigerator for the next day.  A spritz of water, and microwave for a minute, stir and it's just as good as the first day.<br /><br />This stuff also hits the spot when I get the munchies watching t.v. at night.  It's sweet enough to hit the sweet spot.
