I bought this tree last year to honor my daughters birth. When I recieved it in the mail, It was in good green condition and looked very healthy BUT it was tiny, it had one half inch leaf growing from the tiny stem. I thought "this thing will take forever to grow!" But I stuck it on an end table by a window and watered it about once every week and half to two weeks, I am absolutely amazed at how huge this tree has gotten! It's healthier than I ever though, It has probably 75 leaves on it and it approx. 2 feet tall. Which is great for what I had gotten. So, yes my inital impression of the company and tree was not too great but now here I am ordering my second tree for my brother for his 1st daughter as well. These trees have an amzing growing quality. I am not a huge green thumb person or anything, I simply watered it and stuck it by a window..I would 100% reccommend this company.
