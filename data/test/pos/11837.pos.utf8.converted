I bought this salt on a lark because I didn't want to drive 40 miles to the nearest store that carried natural sea salt but I will buy it again.  The flavor is wonderful.  I'm not a big salt eater, never have been, just don't like the taste of commercial salt but this sea salt is wonderful.  I real winner that enhances the flavor of food instead of covering it up as regular salt does.
