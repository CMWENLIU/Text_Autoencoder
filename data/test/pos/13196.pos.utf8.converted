tried several brands of dried tart ("sour") cherries, but the preservation process always added sugar to the point of candy-sweetness.  These are actually sour; terrific for baking (which is why I ordered them)& ADDICTIVE tangy snacking.  Yes, a large quantity, but they stay soft in airtight containers, in cool or cold storage.  EXCELLENT VALUE.
