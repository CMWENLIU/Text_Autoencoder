I really hope I can continue to purchase this product on Amazon. Vegan white chocolate chips are really hard to come by, unless you shop at places like VeganEssentials.com (which gets pricey at times). Trying to make your own vegan white chocolate is a little tedious. Real cocoa butter is delicious, but fussy and melty. This white chocolate coats and hardens like conventional white chocolate. That comes in handy for things like cake pops, chocolate covered fruits and homemade frosted circus cookies. I will keep this stuff stocked in my pantry!
