I ordered your Basket from the UK, to be delived in the US.  FedEx went that extra mile after a misunderstanding with the Zip Code.  I did't see your basket but the recipient of it, described it beautifully and if it's anything to go by your pic .. I'd be more than happy.  Thank you for an excellent product and an excellent service. It's the perfect gift for anyone, for any occassion. - JD, UK
