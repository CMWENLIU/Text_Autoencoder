After suffering from IBD - inflammatory bowel disease for a number if years, I discovered( to my horror ) that the synthetic ingredient  Carrageean and guar gum were a major reason why i had this disorder.  Carrageean and guar gum are known carcinogens and contribute to inflammatory conditions in the intestines.  Read the report in Cornucopia.org.<br /><br />Since eliminating all foods that contained these ingredients, specifically, carrageean, my small intestine and colon have begun to heal.  For years, my doctors thought my inflammation was allergy related or wheat or gluten related - I now suspect it was the synthetic carageean  ingredient. Google the dangers of  Carrageean and you will understand how it inflames your colon and contributes to IBD, IBS, Crohns, UC and colon cancer.  the horrible ingredient is also in some milk and dairy products and pet food.  PLEASE READ all labels before buying products.<br /><br />Anyway, This coconut milk is a bit more challenging to use, yes, BUT it tastes great and you know only coconut is the ingredient so it won't inflame your gut which is more than I can say about the other coconut milks I've researched - most contain that horrible carrageean ingredient I now stay away from.  READ every label.<br /><br />Peace
