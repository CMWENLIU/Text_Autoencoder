These are the PERFECT solution for re-using K-cups. They snap very tightly and handle the Keurig's brewing pressure.  I may even be able to reuse these lids a few times.<br /><br />Each K-cup has a filter inside that does not get punctured by any of the needles.  If you tear off the foil top, clean off the filter by rinsing and lightly brushing with a tooth-brush and the letting them dry (if you want), then you can refill them with your own coffee and snap one of these lids on.  It works perfectly.  I can even store them in my carousel - no leaks, no spilled grounds, no problems at all.<br /><br />It took me 30 minutes to prepare and clean 100 K-cups, 2 days for them to thoroughly dry and about 10 minutes to refill them by dumping the coffee in a stock pot and scooping the K-cups through, then snapping on a lid.  No fuss, no muss, no mess.<br /><br />These things are AWESOME!
