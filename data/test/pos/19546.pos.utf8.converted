I am a colombian, born in Bogota. I used to go to a Colombian grocer in Silver Spring MD just to get my hands on 10% imported Colombian (cafe sello rojo). I tried this coffee today..and wow! I can't tell the difference. For once someone who claims it is 100% Colombian not only spelled Colombia right (they spell it with a U sometimes and it drives me crazy) but it really IS 100% Colombian. This is nice and strong, with a bit of bitterness that lets you know this was ground from some mean beans.
