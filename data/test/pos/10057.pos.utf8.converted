Thses are the best flavor Jolly Ranchers in my opinion, and apparently in my family's as well as every time I buy a bag at the drugstore I am left without any. So I figured the only way to solve this problem, as we seem to be WJRF (Watermelon Jolly Rancher Fanatics) was to buy only watermelon flavored ones... one problem... they just don't sell Watermelon flavor bags in the stores anymore... a few years ago you could get them, but no longer. "Fire" flavor? sure. "Green apple" flavor? no problem. You could even find bags of "Cherry" flavored Jolly Ranchers, but no watermelon to be found anywhere. In desperation I turned to the interent and finally found these. One box of these (160 candies) is enough to satisfy even my family's cravings.... but just incase, because of our long-time watermelon depravation I bought two. These candies are wonderful.
