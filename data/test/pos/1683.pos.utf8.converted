I was looking to supplement my breastmilk, but was having a horrible time finding something that worked.  I tried at least 8 different formula's  including the new Alimentum, but this was the only formula that my son could tolerate physically and still tasted good to him.  You can buy this formula for cheaper at Walmart for $23/can.
