I finally got to a point in my life where I could sell my business and mortgage my house and order a box of these, and it was well worth the wait.  My wife doesn't understand, but that's what happens when you marry someone who isn't a true gourmand.  Well worth every penny of the 1.8 million dollar purchase price, although I thought $5.95 for shipping was a little steep.
