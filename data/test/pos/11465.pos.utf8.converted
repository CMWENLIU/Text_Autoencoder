Lurking in the shadows of the Hershey's kingdom... fomenting a dark, sweet & salty revolution and spreading their rich vision of deliciousness across the land - these are off the heezy fo' sheezy.  Even though I bought a whole box I still feel possessive of them and tend to lash out viciously at anybody who even looks in their direction.  Some may feel that darker chocolate does not work as well as milk chocolate for a peanut butter cup.  They would be wrong.  Some may argue melting points, ratios, sugar/fat content and the like, but they can kindly shut it - for this is the ultimate in mass produced chocolate/peanut butter cups.<br /><br />You're not allowed to order any... AT ALL because I can't spare a single cup.  Not one.  They're all mine.  Nothing to see here.  Move along.  Thank you!  Go back to your ongoing, intermittent perusal of the internet.  Yes, Virginia you can't have one.  It's not you, it's the peanut butter cup.  The dark chocolate's in the mail and I promise not to melt in your mouth.  I think I'll have another one.
