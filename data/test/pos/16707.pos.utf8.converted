When I am making chai or Turkish coffee for friends I always grind whole pods (a quality product is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FVPAZ8">Indus Organic Green Cardamom Pods, 3 Oz</a>). Sometimes, though, I want to quickly brew a chai or a fast Turkish coffee (or even flavor regular coffee when brewing). This ground cardamom does the trick.<br /><br />Turkish coffee with cardamom is both easy to brew and delicious to my taste. Just add cardamom to the grounds and make it your preferred way.<br /><br />Cardamom is also a key ingredient in spiced chai (masala chai). I Normally grind a pod with a part of a stick of cinnamon, clove and a single black peppercorn. I mix it in a half and half water and milk mixture that I bring to a boil, add black tea and grate a piece of ginger).  When I am lazy, use powdered ginger and this ground cardamom. Not quite as good as freshly ground pods (and grated ginger), but significantly better than most chai mixes you can buy off the shelf.<br /><br />This spice is also used in sweet dishes and pastries, but I must confess that I have to forgo sweets for health reasons so know little about how it's used in that respect.<br /><br />For sweetening coffee, chai or even desserts I recommend using one of the following in lieu of processed sugar: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005F5K5N2">Goya Panela Brown Sugar Cane 1 Lb - Redonda</a>, known as "jaggery" in India. A convenient alternative is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050IM27Q">Turbinado Sugar - 1 box, 1 lb</a>. Either is especially superb with chai.
