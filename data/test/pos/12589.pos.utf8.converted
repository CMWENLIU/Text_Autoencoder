The title pretty much says it all.  I reserve 5 stars for what I consider the best of the best.  I wanted a gluten-free cereal that was different from the few I've been eating over the years.  This is definitely NOT like the usual "crispy rice."  It's much more substantial (not "90% air"), has a nice, though not too strong, cocoa flavor, and doesn't get soggy in the first two minutes after milk (or other drink product) is poured on it.<br /><br />Another rater talked about empty calories.  I'll be generous and assume that reviewer is not particularly familiar with reading (and comparing) nutrition labels.  If a high quality rice is also considered "empty calories," that review would be valid.  But comparing the Koala Crisp nutrition label to the nutrition label on a high quality rice reveals almost identical nutritional values - perhaps because Koala Crisp IS a high quality rice.  Just as rice has never been claimed to be a fully balanced meal, neither is Koala Crisp.  What it is, is a high quality product made with high quality ingredients (none of the artificial vitamins and minerals added to "grocery store" cereals to make them look better).  And it's designed to be used as part of a balanced diet.<br /><br />With that out of the way, It's just plain good.  I buy it by the case, and eat it several times per week for breakfast, I like it that much.  And no, I have no connection with the company at all - I just love their products (many of them - not just this one).  Now, if they'd just add this one to their line of Eco-pak cereals (large, bulk bags), I'd be even happier.
