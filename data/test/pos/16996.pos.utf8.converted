I don't know how or why it should, but it works. I tested it to see if there was a difference between using it or not. What a difference, the loaves were like night and day. One with the enhancer was uniform in it's bubbles and stood proudly while the loaf without the enhancer was a good deal shorter and had some large holes in the bread. I'll order some more tonight, I'm not going to do without this stuff. It's great
