I may be the wrong person to ask, because everything from Dr. Harvey's is the best. I have tried almost all of their products and the quality is impeccable,always! But I recently found this vegetable mix and it has made my life so much easier. I feed raw to two of my dogs and slightly cooked meat to my other two, who are older and do better with the meat cooked. I used to spend 2 hours every Sunday cutting up vegetables to add to their meals. This product has really changed my life. It is so easy and my dogs love it. I know how important it is to add vegetables to my dogs' diet.  They are much healthier since I have changed their diet to an all natural regime. Finding Veg to Bowl was great. It has nothing but vegetables, no filler of any kind. I love this product and this company. Dr. Harvey's products can be trusted no matter what you chose. I also use all of Dr. Harvey's treats for my dogs and for my cat.
