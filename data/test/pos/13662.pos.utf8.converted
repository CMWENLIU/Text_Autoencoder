I have to say that I am a bit biased when it comes to Bob's Red Mill products. I love everything they make and this TVP was no exception. This by far is the best deal around because I would pay far more at Whole Foods for the same brand. Quality means a lot along with taste, and Bob's Red Mill has both! Use this in place of all your ground beef/turkey recipes. I'm vegan and my family is not, they can't tell the difference when I make burgers, spaghetti or sloppy joe's. That's a good thing! Full of better nutrients than any meat could ever provide and this is much better for you. Do your own research then give this TVP a try. You will be satisfied. I liked this so much, I now have it on the "subscribe and save" here on Amazon!
