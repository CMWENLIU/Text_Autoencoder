Anyone with or WITHOUT insulin issues should use this in place of table sugar or artificial sugars!  It taste like a good maple syrup, with half the calories and a very low glycemic load.  I use this in my hot tea, over fresh fruit, in baking recipes, etc.  It has endless possibilities.<br /><br />As for price, you cannot beat the price here on Amazon!  I order this two pack for the price of 8 bottles at Whole Foods.  Try a smaller bottle from WF and if you like it, come back here to Amazon to save BIG.
