I started using this product by chewing 1 chew after each of my 3 meals a day and 5 weeks later had my lst blood test.  The stunning news was my Cholesterol had dropped 43 points and 41 of those points was the LDL, which we call the "Low Down Lipids" because it's the bad stuff in your arteries. That huge drop was due to the Benecol Chews AND without medication. Nothing else in my health regimen had changed except this....so I am very pleased and will stay on these as long as they make them and/or the FDA makes them stop making them because they work!
