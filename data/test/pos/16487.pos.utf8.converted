Like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.  No high fructose corn syrup--way less sticky sweet than Nutella.  Don't get me wrong, I love Nutella.  But I feel much better about my son eating this than almost any other sweet treat.<br /><br />FANTASTIC flavor.  A few tiny pieces of nuts or chocolate or something, but generally very smooth and creamy.<br /><br />I am going to order other flavors!
