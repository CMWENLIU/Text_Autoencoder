I learned about this product on the Master Cleanse website. I had tried some of the organic sea salts available at our local market. Using the recommended 2 teaspoon per 32 oz of H20, the store bought stuff was hard for me to gag down. I ordered the Celtic Grey on Amazon, and was pleasantly surprised by the taste. I actually came to like it, and it's also supposed to be loaded with beneficial minerals.
