This is the first time I can remember buying Dry Non-Fat Milk Powder but I thought I'd give it a try considering that a gallon of milk at the grocery store is nearing 4.00.  So after reading the reviews on this one I figured I'd try it.  It mixed well in the blender, I added 1.5 cups of water to 0.5 cup of milk powder, blended it for a little, and then added 2 more cups of water to blend.  It came out fine, but at the bottom was lumps of foam.  Not really a con but I guess it all foams up down there where you add the powder.  I will try mixing it different ways to see if I can get rid of the foam or something, but it's not a huge deal.  It smells like that fresh milk you get from the farm, it doesn't smell like the over processed store milk you buy.  I really don't mind it because I am sure it will just taste fine with my cereal and other things.  For the price of this milk, you get a good deal.  I made a quart and it doesn't even look like I put a dent in the one 26-ounce package.  This stuff can last about 2 years on the shelf.  If this continues to work out, I will never buy expensive milk at the store, this stuff is probably better for me anyways.  So all in all, I gave it a 4 out of 5, because of the foam and because I thought it would taste exactly like the store milk that other people said, but it is a little different.  I am pretty picky when it comes to taste and everything.  I think non-fat and skim milk are two totally different kinds of milk.  I used to think they are the same but I could be wrong.  Skim milk is my favorite.<br /><br />EDIT:  The foam has gone done once refrigerated as I expected so that is good.  Finally took a taste of the milk and it's not at all what I expected.  I guess I just don't like the taste of Fresh Milk but if YOU do then this is the stuff to get.  I guess I can use it for baking or something else or maybe even as cereal milk.  We will see.<br /><br />EDIT(2):  I had the quart of milk in the fridge for a little over 4 hours now.  I added ice cubes to it, about a tablespoon of vanilla extract, and just a couple pours of regular skim milk.  The taste is sooooo much better and tastes like a Vanilla milkshake.  I am so happy with this taste and I suggest you do the same thing if you want it to taste good.  I really think just adding the ice and let it get really cold helped the taste the most though, and the Vanilla was just icing on the cake.  I don't think I needed to add the couple pours of regular milk but I thought I'd give it a try because of what some websites said.  But overall I am now happy I bought this stuff because it's gonna save me so much money than buying a Gallon of milk for 3.75 a gallon and have 1/4 of that be spoiled, etc.  Now I can just make milk whenever I need it and not worry about it.  I suggest you do the steps I have as well.  Don't judge it by how it tastes right after you mix it because if you did, you'd give it a 1 star rating like I was going to.
