Piroulines, in all flavors, are a family favorite at our house.  They are great by themselves, even better with coffee as a small and delicious dessert, perfect for lunchboxes, and perky stuck at an angle in a bowl of ice cream. They are crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside -- a treat sealed two by two in airtight bags so they keep for a long time, if you can resist them.
