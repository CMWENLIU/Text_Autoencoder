Pros:<br /><br />These energy shots really work! Some ingredients not listed in the description are Ginko Biloba and 5HTP, which  many experts say increase focus and energy. After drinking one of these, I noticed a significant focus and energy boost, and there was no crash like I have gotten with other energy drinks. The flavor is good, though obviously it's not going to taste like nectar since it has so many concentrated ingredients.<br /><br />BIG PRO: This has stevia as a sweetener -- no artificial stuff. I have always liked stevia and that is part of the reason I decided to try this one. Also, there are no artificial dies or flavors.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The only cons I have come from the packaging. The energy shot cap has a paper cover that just sits in there. If you drink part of an energy shot and then drink the rest later, you have to take the cap off and remove the soaked paper cover. This is really a minor issue so I decided not to knock off a star in my review.<br /><br />The shot is a little on the expensive side, but in my opinion, why buy cheap energy shots that have mediocre ingredients? It's just a few dollars higher than 5 hour energy, which did not work for me at all.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Since the ingredient list is not in the Amazon item description, here it is:<br /><br />EBOOST blend: Aloe vera leaf, vegetable glycerin, green tea leaf/caffeine complex (150ml caffeine), elderberry fruit extract, N-acetyl-L-tyrosine, glucoronolactone, blueberry juice concentrate, blackberry juice concentrate, blueberry puree, grape skin extract, maqui berry juice, Gingko biloba leaf extract, pomegranate concentrate, agave root, huperzine, mango fruit concentrate, quercetin dehydrate, acai fruit (Euterpe oleracea), grape seed extract, resveratrol, 5-HTP (from Griffonia simplicifolia seed extract).<br /><br />Other Ingredients: Purified water, natural flavors, citric acid, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate and stevia leaf extract.
