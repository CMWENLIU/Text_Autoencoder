I am a fan of Blue Diamond Almonds "Bold" series, and the Habanero BBQ flavor is my favorite.  I have tried two other flavors (Jalapeno Smokehouse and Wasabi Soy), but these are the most balanced.  The habanero packs sufficient heat without being overpowering or painful.  I like "hot" flavored things for the taste rather than to experience pain or burning.  The heat is balanced with the sweetness of the BBQ.  As a bonus to the great taste, you also have almonds which are one of the healthier snacks.  The bold flavor helps guard against overindulgence too.  I like to keep them around the house and grab a handful between meals when hunger strikes.  If you like spicy and sweet flavor and almonds, give these a try.
