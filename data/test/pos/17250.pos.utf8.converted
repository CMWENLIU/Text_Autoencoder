I was pleasantly surprised at the full, rich taste of this cocoa. Mix in a tablespoon with a 1/2 cup low-fat or skim Ricotta cheese, crushed raspberries, and walnuts for an excellent low-fat to no fat dessert. Better than ice cream! Or add 1 tbsp of organic chunky almond butter(without sugar; Stevia, to taste, is great instead)to the Ricotta cheese, and cocoa. Also great if you're on the HCG program, phase 1, mix in 1 tsp with your coffee; or sprinkle on strawberries or oranges and mix the cocoa with the fruit's natural juice. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0G2Q8">Wonderslim Pure Fat-Free Cocoa Powder, 6-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)</a>
