I regularly get the Starbucks coffee syrups for my lattes because they are easy to get and have great flavor. I hoped to buy the pumpkin spice syrup from Starbucks however they are not sold at any store.  So I found this after reading the reviews i was hopeful as one person tried the pumpkin spice and said it was horrible then they tried this one and enjoyed it.  I was excited to bring in the fall with a pumpkin latte this morning.  However i was surprised. my wife warned me that it was bitter and did not taste good.  I didn't believe her and made a latte following the instructions on the bottle which is nice. 2 pumps (it suggested 1.5) and I didn't taste much just some bitterness. so i doubled it and put in 4 pumps. it tasted nothing like pumpkin pie that i have made or bought in a store it was bitter and had a spice flavor to it.  it also tasted nothing like the Starbucks pumpkin latte i have had in the past, i tried drinking it to see if it got better but i could not do it. so i tried the syrup by itself and it was gross! bitter and nothing like pumpkin pie.  not sure if i got a bad batch or if this product just is horrible.<br /><br />Edited update.<br /><br />I just got off the phone with Amoretti and remade myself a latte with some new information.... First the Starbucks syrup that i use has 19 grams of sugar in every pump Amoretti has 4 grams.  This is significant if you have a sweet tooth and if you try to watch the calories.  In the 4 pumps of Starbucks syrup for my latte I am getting 76 grams of sugar with Amoretti i got 16 grams of sugar.  If you have a sweet tooth like me that makes a huge difference. Second the syrup is more of a syrup than sugar water like Starbucks so it is full of flavors.  When I put 4 pumps because it wasn't sweet it did make it bitter because i put in way to many spices.  so when i remade my latte (total 16 ounces) I put in 2 pumps, 1 at first and didn't taste anything so i added another one, with some agave nectar for my sweet tooth.  When i tried it there is no bitterness just pumpkin pie flavor that i can taste :)  So lesson learned read the directions and don't think every syrup is made the same.  The Amoretti is healthier and full of flavors, to much and it will be bitter, follow the directions around 1 pump for every 8 ounces.  Amoretti had great customer service when they called and explained the difference in the syrup. I assumed it would be like Starbucks and was wrong. Right now i am enjoying a pumpkin latte with the Amoretti pumpkin syrup.  They have a full line of syrups and i look forward to trying the CREMA DI syrups which have a creamer flavor which i like, can't wait for them to arrive.
