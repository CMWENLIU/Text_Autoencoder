I am still amazed at the number of people that have not experienced "The Rooster", as we have come to call it.  I have been using it for over 10 years, and have to say that it is hands-down the best, most versatile hot sauce in the world.<br /><br />The best part about this sauce is ability to not only add some heat to your food, but also blend seamlessly without overpowering it.  Pasta dishes, tomato soup, chili, to name a few that really benefit from The Rooster.  Come to think of it, I probably put it on 9 out of 10 meals I eat.  I have a bottle at my desk (which my coworkers' lunches have come to benefit from, as well), a bottle at the dinner table, and, of course, one on standby or travel.<br /><br />I only have two small complaints, and both are packaging related:  the green cap, in recent years, has become  a bit of a hassle.  Nothing major, but just noticeably problematic.  No one believes me, but I swear they changed the green cap.  Anyway, over time, the cap tends to leak out the red chili oil form around the threads.  It also seems to clog up faster than I have experienced before.  I tend to have to remove the cap and clean it out at the sink in order to unclog it and remove the excess chili oil from dripping down the side of the bottle.  Nothing serious, but when you use it as much as I do, it can be a bit of a nuisance.<br /><br />Anyway, I swear by this stuff: it is my "island condiment" (the only condiment i would ever need should I get stranded on an island.)
