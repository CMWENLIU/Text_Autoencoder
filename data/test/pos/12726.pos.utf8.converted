I received these as a Christmas gift.  I opened them New Years Eve and I am online looking for more!  They are incredibly delicious.  Sumptuous white, dark and milk Belgian chocolate covered shortbreads, wafers and biscuits.  To me, worth the price.  Grab a cup of coffee relax and open this tin of cookies and enjoy!!
