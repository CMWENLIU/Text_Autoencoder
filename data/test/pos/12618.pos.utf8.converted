By the end of a breakfast with Fiber One and some fruit, you could have already met 70-75% of your fiber needs for the day. (Fiber One by itself provides 57%.) It's 14 grams of fiber per 30-gram serving is 40% more than Kellogg's All Bran. Unlike some high-fiber cereals, this one (the "original" Fiber One) contains no sugar, but derives its sweetness from Aspertame. As far as I'm concerned, it's the tastiest high-fiber cereal on the market.
