If you like real black Licorice you will love these yummy soft and creamy licorice caramels. When i was younger growing up i used to enjoy licorice toffee by a company in England i believe the name was Collard & Bowser ? These Dutch licorice caramels are just as good or better and i plan on repeat purchases of this product.
