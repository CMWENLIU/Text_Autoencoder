We purchase both the Chicken and the Beef Liver for our dogs...and the cats love the chicken.  Really, where else beside the butcher's shop can you get 100% meat with nothing added for your pet?  These are great for training and for an everyday treat.  I can't wait to try the Cheese product when it comes out.  HINT...to get the most for your money, sprinkle the dust at the bottom of the bag on top of their food.
