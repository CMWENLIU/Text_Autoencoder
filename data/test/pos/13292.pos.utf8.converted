I tried three tortellini products from Amazon including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FD92Z6">Davinci Tortellini, 7 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HQR5JG">Racconto 5-Cheese Tortellini, 8.9-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>  The Barilla was easily the best. (Racconto the worst) The pasta stayed reasonably firm while the filling became soft and tasty.  The rating is meant to compare this to other dried, filled products, not fresh.  A great staple to have around the house.
