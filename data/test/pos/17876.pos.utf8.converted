My husband is diabetic, yet wants some sweets in life.  He is also gluten and dairy sensitive, so the stuff he can eat is very limited.  He likes these candies because they are good (not good for sugar-free candy) and give him a fix for his chocolate cravings when he has them.  They are creamy and have good dark chocolate taste.
