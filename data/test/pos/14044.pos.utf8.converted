I really like these protein bars! I found them at my local grocery store for $1.99 for a box. The major selling point for me was that there were no gluten containing ingredients on the label (not even oats). The label was extremely clear; for example, it listed "rice maltodextrin" rather than just maltodextrin - that way the consumer knows what the source of each ingredient is. The bars aren't marked as "gluten free" but I felt confident enough in the labeling that I was willing to take a chance on it, and it didn't make me sick so it turned out to be a good gamble! I'm always looking out for handy things I can grab and go, or keep in my purse or diaper bag, and this was just perfect.<br /><br />I will say it tastes like a protein bar, NOT like a granola bar or a candy bar. If you don't like protein bars in general, you might not like this. But I thought it was great.
