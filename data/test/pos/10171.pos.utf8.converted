This chocolate is vegan, ethical, and sublime.  I only wish that they would disclose more details about the blend.<br /><br />Very balanced.  Not overly acidic like Lindt.  Not overly bass-y like others.  More flavorful and better ingredients list than Green & Blacks (our favorite before finding Theo).<br /><br />We had been buying one bar per week, and decided it would make more sense to buy more at a time for less money overall.  We're glad we did.  It turns out that the bars from Amazon are actually fresher than those we were finding in our local shops, which means improved flavor.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
