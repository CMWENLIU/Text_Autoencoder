About ten years ago a friend made amazing Algerian couscous for us in which she used a bottle of ras-el-hanout purchased in France under the Ducros brand name.  It was fabulous and for years I tried finding the same spice/flavor/scent in hopes of duplicating our unforgettable feast - with repeated disappointments.  I read the reviews for the Zamouri ras-el-hanout and decided to take a chance, even though I was about to give up hope. And what do you know, this IS the real thing - just incredible. Do yourself a favor and saute some crushed garlic and onion in olive oil, add some diced assorted vegetables (peppers, tomatoes, zucchini, eggplant etc.), throw in some raisins, garbanzo beans, 1T cumin and 3T of this wonderful ras-el-hanout... serve over couscous and you're off to a very happy evening!
