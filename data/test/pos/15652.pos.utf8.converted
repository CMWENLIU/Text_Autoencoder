We bought these bottles to use with our Medela PIS and Ameda Purley Yours Breast Pumps, yes, we bought both. We chose to use these bottles since the Medela 5 oz bottles cost a bit more, and the Ameda bottles are not BPA free. The Lansinoh bottles work great with both brands! The only thing I don't like is that the caps are two piece caps and the Medela Bottles have the solid one piece lids. I just use my 80ml Medela bottle lids with these since we are no longer using them anyway, and they work great and there are no pieces to loose. You can put any standard bottle nipple ring on the bottles so you don't have to change bottles if you don't want too, and you can just throw some nipples and rings already put togehter in a zip bag and throw them in your diaper bag for later. You can also find the Lansinoh storage bottles here on amazon in the 8 and 12 pks!! Hope this helps.
