The Seller: All Star Health is great to deal with.  My Brother-in-law and I have used them many times.  They ship relatively quick (3-5 days).  They always have competitive prices.  Until they recently bumped their price on the 10lb container it was the cheapest buy on the net.  Now 2 5lb containers are the cheapest way to go.<br /><br />The Product: I have tried Vanilla and Cocoa.  Per serving Vanilla has 18 grams to Cocoa's 16 grams of protein.  Both Mix INCREDIBLY well. I have a shaker cup and do not use it with this stuff.  I use a spoon. Thats it. Vanilla tastes really good.  Compared to other brands this is the best vanilla I have had that is not loaded with fat and other junk.  The Cocoa is my favorite.  It was not at first, It is not Chocolate.  It is Cocoa.  There is a distinct difference.  It came to be my favorite, however, when I warmed up the water in the microwave for about a minute and a half and then added the protein. It tastes just like hot chocolate and mixes even better in the hot water.  So now every protein shake is like a large glass of hot cocoa, and when you live in Minnesota, thats a really great thing :).  There are a bunch of good amino acids in all of these flavors. I really honestly have nothing bad to say about this product. The only annoyance is that it appears like everyone is steadily raising the price on this stuff.  I purchased 10 lbs from one place online for $47 within the last year.  The next time I went to the website it was $67.  I went to all star with my last purchase and the 10lb tub was $51.  Now it is in the 60's. Even at the price it is now, the product is all I buy as far as protein supplements go.<br /><br />Summary: You will not be disappointed.
