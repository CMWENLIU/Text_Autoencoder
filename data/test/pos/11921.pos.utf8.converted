Mmmmmm!  These scones are delicious, and I have never been a real fan of scones.  They turned out very moist.  I added orange flavoring + 2 Tbs sugar to the first batch, and made a simple orange glaze to drizzle on top. Everyone loved them!  I look forward to using this mix for cheese scones, chocolate chip scones, cranberry orange sonces, etc! This 6-pack was a great deal with the special promo code.
