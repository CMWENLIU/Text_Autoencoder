Misty is about 1 1/2 years old and came from a large family.  As usual with cats, Misty is very picky.  Since I started her on Fancy Feast Gourmet she would rather go hungry than eat anything else. And sometimes she won't eat her dry food!!!  There was one time when she went a day and a half without eating ANYTHING!!!!  I had put another popular food in her bowl but it just sat there while she meowed at me.  Dumb me!!!  She is my angel as well as my pet.  She woke me up one time when I stopped breathing - she literally crawled all over me.  She isn't beautiful except to me - she has gray fur all over except for one hand-sized white round spot on her tummy. It is worth it to me to give her the best.
