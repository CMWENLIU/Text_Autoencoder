I think a few reviewers have gotten carried away (or maybe they just never had anything but canned before). These beans are a good value and definitely taste better than canned, but they're not going to change your life. The light packaging, long shelf life, and simple preparation make this a good product for camping or emergency supplies.<br /><br />It's not easy to tell from the picture, but the bags are zip-lock type so you can make a portion of the package and reseal the rest. However, the instructions only cover the amount of water appropriate for the whole bag, so you're on your own to measure for a portion. Hint: start conservatively because it's easy enough to add more water later.<br /><br />Overall nutrional values are better than average. I like to mix both cheese and salsa into my beans, but the result is fairly high in total sodium. Sodium level of the bean mix itself isn't too bad, but I wish they added less salt because anybody can easily add salt if desired, but you can't take out what they've already added. Since many people like to add things to their beans anyway, it would be ideal for the beans to start out with as little sodium as possible.
