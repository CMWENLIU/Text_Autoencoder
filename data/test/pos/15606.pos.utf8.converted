About one year ago, I underwent some (blood) testing that showed that my digestive system was hyper-sensitive to Gluten and Dairy.  Everything pasta/bread and cheese-like was a main staple of my diet.  To find something that I should be eating, is convenient enough AND tastes good - well...that's like trying to find a needle in a hay stack.<br /><br />My first encounter with Annie Chun's was with their White Sticky Rice.  I ate that for several months and then when Amazon had it on back order (gasp), I took a leap of faith and ordered this.<br /><br />I have always loved rice but brown and/or sprouted rice...not so much.  Now, I prefer it MUCH more over Annie's Sticky White.<br /><br />The Basics (which apply to both products): Very portable, cheaper if you order it on bulk through Amazon than purchase it locally ($3.99 x 6), and microwavable.<br /><br />Why I like this better: It's easier to digest, it isn't as "sticky" as the white version, it has some fiber (white does not), and the minerals - although not a huge part of the overall package - are still a good thing to have in your diet (i.e. iron, Vitamin E, lysine, niacin, amino acids), and when I mix it with whatever (beans, chicken, veggies)...it still has its own, subtle taste.
