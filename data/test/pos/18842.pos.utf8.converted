All of the Stella & Chewy's freeze-dried products are excellent. I know exactly what my dogs are getting and they love it. It's expensive so I recommend it for small dogs. I am delighted that I can get it through Amazon because few pet stores carry it and usually not much of it. It's perfect for picky eaters. The treats are also great.Stella & Chewy's Freeze-Dried Duck Duck Goose Dinner for Dogs, 16oz<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NVBVCW">Stella & Chewy's Carnivore Crunch, Freeze-Dried Beef Treats for Dogs and Cats, 4oz</a>
