First of all, these Gummi's are delicious and fruity and are just the right amount of chewy. But I was most impressed by the fact that my Amazon delivery of them sat on my porch in 100 degree Memphis weather and they did not melt or get sticky! They were a bit squishy when I first opened them but after being inside the house about 30 minutes, they were perfect again! Sounds silly, I suppose, but it is good to know!
