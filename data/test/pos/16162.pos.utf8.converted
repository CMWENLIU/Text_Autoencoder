When it comes to breakfast cereal, I can't think of any type that I enjoy more than Cheerios.  They have a delicious taste, I never seem to get tired of eating them, and best of all, they are fairly healthy as well.  The crunchy, slightly powdery taste of Cheerios has a certain quality that can't be described except to say it is delicious, and when one looks at the vast array of sugar-overload cereals available now, Cheerios remain a steadfastly healthy way to start a day.  Healthy for your heart, your diet, your well-being; what more can you ask?  Also, they make a great snack at any time of the day.  There's not much to diss about Cheerios- there's a reason they've been around for almost 70 years.
