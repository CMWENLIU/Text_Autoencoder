I first tried this powder at the Dole plantation in Hawaii. They sprinkled it on pineapple bits and passed out samples. It was amazingly good, and totally changed the taste of the pineapple. Of course, I bought some and took it back home with me, where I passed it around to family members. Although I experimented using it on other fruit, my favorite is still the pineapple. My mother really likes it on oranges. But it's good on apples and other fruit, too. I've bought some every time I've returned to Hawaii, and I've had friends pick some up for me on their trips. I was glad to find out that I can now order it online, because I haven't been able to find it on the mainland. It gets a high rating from me and from my family.
