Thought I could never eat cake being on the Atkins program and was pleasently surprised when I tried the various cake recepies from Atkins that included the bake mix.  I sift it, add lemon rinds and juice and some nuts to each recepie for crunchness and it's DELICIOUS.  It make my Christmas and my family loves it too. I'm on auto ship with this product.
