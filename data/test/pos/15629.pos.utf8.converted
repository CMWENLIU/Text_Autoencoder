I've been eating Fri Chik for over 30 years.  This low fat version is not much different in taste.  I fry it in a flour mixture and spices that I like, soul flavor, garlic, onion.  I use the liquid with added water to make a simple gravy from an envelope mix, a few boiled potatoes, veggie , salad... whatever.  perfect meal.  When I was younger, my family used Fri Chik along with the canned vegetarian burger to form a mock turkey loaf for holidays.  I also love to eat the Fri Chik straight out of the can.
