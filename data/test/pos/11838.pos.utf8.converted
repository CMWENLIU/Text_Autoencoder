I bought this salt after listening to a podcast of the Splendid Table with a man named Mark Bitterman. Yes, Bitterman (not Bittman). He wrote an entire book on salt <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580082629">Salted: A Manifesto on the World's Most Essential Mineral, with Recipes</a> and recommended this salt as an everyday "table salt" alternative. It may not be the most appealing color, but it was what I would expect of a product called "Gray Sea Salt" (or Sel Gris, if you know some French).<br />As someone who has thus far in life considered Kosher Salt the "fancy" alternative, I now know where I will continually spend a little extra for a lot more. I've put this on everything, from roasted chicken to potato soup. If you rub together your fingers as you sprinkle, you can make a fine coating, but it's perfect in soups because it has such a high-moisture content that it sticks to its own bag. If you are a die-hard iodized table salt fan, this is not the salt for you. It tastes and looks substantially different from your everyday grocery-store salt, and behaves very differently when used in cooking. If you are baking, and the recipe calls for "salt," you may want to taste before you stick it in the oven, and start small, and add as you taste. The moisture content may also alter certain more sensitive recipes, so you it's best to plan ahead if you wish to experiment.<br />The flavor difference is truly indescribable. I think I would prefer to use this in savory dishes, as that is the flavor palette it gave me, but it may also work well in desserts or on fruits that like salt.<br />I encourage you to do a taste test as soon as you get it home against your regular table salt. You will immediately thank me, other enthusiastic reviewers, Gu&eacute;rande, France, and the Bay of Biscay.
