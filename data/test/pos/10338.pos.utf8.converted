These are my all-time favorite snack! It tastes like whoopie-pie dipped in chocolate syrup (hardened, of course, unless microwaved). The cake is delicate and light, but that is only to make you into a complete addict. There is nothing wrong with the chocolate on these cakes as compared to any others. It tastes like. . . .chocolate.<br /><br />It's a definite good thing, though, if you don't like these. In order to feel satisfied I need to eat an entire box! I decided to mix two into a bowl of ice cream because I just eat them too fast by themselves. And yes, they couldn't hurt putting a little extra filling in there, but just get a tub of cool whip to dip them in. That should fill ya up.
