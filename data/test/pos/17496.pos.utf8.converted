I used to buy these in local grocery stores (Vons or Ralphs) but they stopped selling them.. I was so happy that I found these on Amazon (much much cheaper as well.)<br /><br />The assorted hard candies taste very good :) They're very small, probably the size of your index fingernail, but I usually eat 2 or 3 at a time. You can control your sugar intake with this!<br /><br />I wish more people knew about this candy.. it's probably one of the best tasting hard candies out there. Highly recommended.
