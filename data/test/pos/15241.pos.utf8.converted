Miracle Rice is amazing! I added it to chicken vegetable soup, and also created a delicious dish of ground beef, fresh basil, garlic, onion and the rice. The rice really doesn't have any flavor at all - it just adds volume to your dish, making it more filling, but still with a very light consistency. Also, I was pleasantly surprised by the texture - in my opinion, less like rice and more like little pearls, or Israeli cous cous - not chewy at all, just blends lightly and beautifully into your dish.  It's so easy to imagine many recipes to which the rice could be added to increase volume guilt-free, without adding any calories or fat.  This is truly a miracle product!
