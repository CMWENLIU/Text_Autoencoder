This is the great cereal of my childhood (which used to be produced in a town named "Wheatenaville", honest!  It has tons of fiber and a nutty taste and really stick-to-the-ribs breakfast.  Even my little 18 month old grandson loves it.<br /><br />Glad I could find it at Amazon.  However, one caveat: the price that its sold at plus shipping makes this a gourmet indulgence indeed.  Buyer, beware.  You've gotta love it to buy it.  However, I bought a case of it anyway.
