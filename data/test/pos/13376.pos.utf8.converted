I love these noodles.  They are carb free, calorie free and GLUTEN FREE!<br /><br />Note:  I find it helps to rinse and dry the noodles before using them.<br /><br />The flavor is . . . well . . . no flavor.  The noodles absorb the flavors added to them.  If you rinse the noodles then dry them in paper towel before using, they will absorb the flavors even more.<br /><br />My favorite way to use the noodles is with pesto sauce, especially if I'm eating low-carb.  They are VERY filling and an excellent way to stay full while losing weight.  Love it!
