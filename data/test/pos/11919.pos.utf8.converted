I was very skeptical that this would taste as good as the other reviewers said, but it was on sale so I figured I'd give it a try.  My 5-yr-old son LOVES scones.  Well, not only does it taste great, but it's ridiculously easy to make and my son was able to help me.  In addition, my family comes from England so I've had my fair share of all sorts of scones.  I have to say these taste pretty authentic.  After they were done I wished I'd had clotted cream to go with.  And organic to boot, what a find!<br /><br />Also, being a mom who has to juggle, and never finding a recipe I didn't have to tweak, I found an even easier way to make them than the instructions on the box.  Using 2 boxes I dumped the mixes directly into a disposable foil 1/2 size lasagna pan.  Then I put in a full stick of butter that was room temp.  I forked it till the dough was little lumps.  I didn't add a flavor because I wanted to see what "original" was like.  (Great.)  Then I put in a cup of milk and forked it around till it was smooth dough.  There was still some dry mix at the bottom of the pan so I added the couple of tablespoons of milk.  Then, I got my hands in there and it wasn't too difficult to pick up the stray bits till the pan was clean and the dough was a ball.  Then I smoothed out the dough evenly in the pan.  Then I took a knife and scored it in quarters till I had 16 triangles.  Baked it and done.<br /><br />Mind you, I must say that my "easy" way of doing it is only if you don't mind not having the crusty edges on each triangle, the mark of a "real" scone I suppose.  To me, I'd rather save the time, the dishes, and it tastes the same, delicious!
