Q Tonic has changed my life. It's amazing. Best gin and tonics ever. I've found that because Q Tonic is so dry (even compared other fancy tonics like Fever Tree and Stirrings), I can actually taste the difference between gins in my gin and tonics. And saving calories these days doesn't hurt either...
