I would give this 10 stars if I could!  This is my new FAVORITE flavor!  I hope Arctic Zero keeps this flavor as a part of their permanent line up. Trying not to eat an entire pint is hard; it's just so dang good!  Eating a whole pint won't hurt at all as far as calories are concerned, so go ahead and indulge!  The only problem is that it's so expensive I have to ration my supply!  I've tried all their flavors, and if you're having a hard time deciding what to order, go for this one!<br />My flavor ranking:<br />1.Mint Chocolate Cookie<br />2.Chocolate<br />3.Chocolate Peanut Butter<br />4.Pumpkin<br />5.Strawberry Banana<br />6.Vanilla
