I don't like brown rice unless it is fresh and organic; the rice oils in the bran layer go rancid easily, so I generally buy more expensive brands of rice in small bags. This way, the rice will be fresh. Lundberg is a well-known rice grower, and the jasmine rice has that delightful smell when cooking. The texture is chewy, as all brown rice tends to be, but moist. I make mine 2 cups of water to 1 cup dry rice, and I let the rice soak for a half an hour in its cooking water before I cook it in the rice cooker. This hydrates the rice more and I get a better texture for eating plain or with stir fry.<br /><br />This rice is good plain, with a small sprinkling of soy sauce, or as a breakfast cereal with a dash of cinnamon and maple syrup or raw sugar and a dab of organic margarine or butter. It's very nice in pilaf and as stir-fried rice. I keep the opened bag in the freezer, with a clip on the bag, to retard its getting rancid.
