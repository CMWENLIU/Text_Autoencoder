I bought these at Target hoping they wouldn't be just another crappy tasting healthier-alternative food - they're AWESOME! I looked on Amazon to see if I can find them cheaper (they're about the same price unless I subscribe), and realized there was only one review on it. I love reading reviews before settling on what to buy and therefore I feel I must contribute!<br /><br />These are certainly granola cookies, meaning it's like eating a cookie with some dried oats in it, but the chunky chocolate semi-sweet chips make for a perfect blend. I'm not into granola bars or oatmeal cookies, but these are great! Throw 1-2 together for a snack or as part of your work/school lunch and it's a nice top-off for the meal.<br /><br />I think if I could gripe about anything it is the amount of cookies in each box (eight) - there should be more! Keep in mind that these cookies are a tad wider than a Chips Ahoy cookie and a bit thicker than an Oreo. I'm a chocoholic and I was shocked to find that a single one of these satisfied me just fine, which is very unusual for a cookie for someone like me (I like eating 5-6 Oreos at once and still want more but have to resist). The serving size is one cookie and each cookie has 10g of whole grains, 130 calories and 45 calories from fat, 2g fiber and 20g of carbs.
