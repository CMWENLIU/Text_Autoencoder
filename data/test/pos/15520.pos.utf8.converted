I recently made the switch from lifelong vegetarian to unapologetic carnivore. However, I didn't want to eat grain-fed meat so I started searching for alternatives. The grass-fed meats are beyond my budget. This week, I found these wonderful sardines. They are nothing like the fish steaks packaged as sardines that one finds at most markets. With a sprinkle of cayenne pepper and a bit of fresh lemon juice, they're a gourment (and health) treat.
