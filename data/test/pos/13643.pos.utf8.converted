Our whole family loves this snack. These make a great toddler snack (they're kind of puffy, so if you don't actually chew them, they'll just melt). My 2-year old has been eating these for a year now, and is constantly asking for his "Peapods?" A portable snack, far superior nutritionally to the typical cookie, cracker, goldfish, pretzel and other processed junk most kids are eating. These are just dehydrated snap peas, corn oil and salt (and there's still LESS sodium in these than Pepperidge Farm's low-sodium goldfish!). A great alternative to the usual snack highly processed of white flour, sugar, salt and/or chemical preservatives. They're better for you, and they taste great. We love them.
