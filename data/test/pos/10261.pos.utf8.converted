As a decaf coffee drinker, almost exclusively, I have sampled a number of different K-cup decafs.  There is a surprising range in quality of these coffees. The Caribou version is extremely good to me and deserves five stars.  It yields a fairly strong coffee even when made in the largest size.  Decafs seems to be more expensive than regular coffees in general and this is true for the Caribou brand. However, it sure isn't the most expensive and is consistently of good quality. Getting the 24 count package provides a nice supply.  I do usually have maybe 3 or 4 brands available, but go to the Caribou most frequently.
