This is a great deal - you get a large 16 oz bag of high quality Bay Leaf.  A friend of mine decided to buy one bag and split it between us because the quantity was more than either one of us wanted for our regular cooking needs, so the deal got even better after that!<br /><br />This is good fresh Bay Leaf with nice strong flavor. Given the quantity one might be tempted to use more Bay leaf than the recipe calls for, but the flavor gets stronger as you cook and too much of a good thing, in this case, is not a good thing.<br /><br />Bay leaves release their flavor during slow cooking so I like adding bay leaves to casseroles, stews, soups, marinades, and pasta sauces.  I also add it to the steamer when I steam vegetables, fish, seafood, or chicken. Bay leaves add nice flavor to the food with which they are cooked, but if you bite into them in the final dish they are not pleasant to taste. I always make sure to remove the leaves when the dish finished cooking. It is easier to do when use whole bay leaf as their easier to see when time comes to remove them.<br /><br />I recommend this product!<br /><br />Ali Julia review
