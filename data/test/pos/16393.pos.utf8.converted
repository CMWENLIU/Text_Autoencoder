I used to buy canned hearts of palm at Trader Joes, until they discontinued them. They still sell jarred HOP, but they taste "treated" and I don't like the texture. The Reese HOP at the grocery store cost almost $5 per can and I can't justify that expense. I'm glad I found them here - they taste great, I rarely get any stalks that are inedible, and at $3 a can the price can't be beat. They always arrive quickly, too.
