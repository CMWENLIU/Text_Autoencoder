I picked up Hodgson Mill's Buckwheat pancake mix at my local grocery, not expecting anything much, but knowing how good buckwheat is for one's health.  Wow, was I surprised to find pancakes or belgian waffles made with this taste great, too!<br /><br />I find that pancake/waffle batter is a wonderful place to hide healthy additions like soy protein powder (add a little water), flax seed, etc.  I use organic coconut oil and add fun items like chocolate chips, banana, or walnuts to the batter for a breakfast that makes me (and my whole family) feel upbeat and energetic for many hours into the day, even if I only have one pancake!<br /><br />Well done, Hodgson Mill!
