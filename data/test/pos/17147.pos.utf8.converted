Life Extension did an article on Green Tea Extract and if you have Kidney disease, high cholesterol or HPV, I highly recommend Green Tea Extract. Make sure it has the 98% Polyphenolds in it. Someone said it made them nauseous; make sure you take GTE with food as you should with most supplements. A large study found GTE:<br /><br />* prevented kidney damage<br />* powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, both in the kidney and in other tissues<br />* Helping maintain healthy blood cholesterol, LDL and triglyceride levels already within normal range<br />* Enhancing immune function<br />* produce a rapid clinical response in at least 69% of women with human papilloma virus (HPV) lesions on their cervixes, which in turn dramatically reduces their risk of cervical cancer<br />* cancer cells can be triggered to undergo programmed death; green tea extracts are among the many nutraceuticals capable of inducing apoptosis
