I opened the first bag ordered and received today, wondering how they could be as good as I'd anticipated.  Well, they are.  The 5 pounds is the drained weight and they are fresh, firm, tasty and not too salty.  There is a minimal amount of liquid, and I've not seen any that are mushy.  I separated the olives into jars for three and put the remaining half (yes that's right, half) into a FoodSaver medium sized cannister and vacuum sealed that one.  I gave two of the jars away and received great thanks and praise for this thrifty online purchase of high quality olives.  The spices are minimal, which was a concern of mine.  Can't wait to receive the Antipasto Olives next week for comparison.  I'd definitely buy these again and serve them to any person who loves olives.
