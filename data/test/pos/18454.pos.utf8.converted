Sugar Twin Brown has always been a favorite.  None of the stores I shop in would order it for me.  The last time I bought it was when Raley's was in Las Vegas. It is the only product that will make a decent BBQ sauce - using vinegar, tomato sauce, some hot sauce, & what ever else in on hand. Since I make all my own high fiber muffins - sugar twin works well to sweeten them.
