My alternative medicine doc, who is also an MD, recommended this product due to my leukemia.  There was a study by the Mayo Clinic of patients with CLL  [my form of the disease]  and there were some statistical data showing benefits for CLL patients who took a green tea extract -- strength not specified by the Mayo Clinic.  I ordered this product as soon as I was diagnosed, and found immediate relief from swolen glands, and night sweats.  I contacted the manufacturer, using the info on the label, and they have oncologists as consultants. The response to my question: "how much can I take?" came back as 3 times daily.<br /><br />Five months later, swelling is minimal, night sweats rare.  Doctor says my WBC is stable....  Those results are hard to dispute, in my opinion.<br /><br />Given the info above -- this is a great product, full of good anti-oxidents, but with some minimally proven benefits for CLL patients, like me.<br /><br />Shipping was extremely prompt, so I couldn't have asked for more from them.<br /><br />Five stars!!!
