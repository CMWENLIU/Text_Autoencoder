Agree with previous description of this item as "puppy crack".  We have a 5 month old mini schnauzer mix who is happy to ignore us on walks, tugging on the leash with perceived strength of a small grizzly bear in order to reach the "OMG I HAVEN'T SMELLED THIS ONE YET" leaf 10 feet away.<br /><br />We cut up pieces of this lamb roll (about 5mm cubes) to use as treats, and once he smells it he transforms into the "OMG OMG. GIMME. I'LL BE GOOD. GIMMEEEEEEEE!" dog we all wish we had. He'll follow right next to us on walks, eyes upward in hope/greed.<br /><br />Tips:<br />- Satiate yourself before you handle the meatlog, lest you be tempted to try it!  It smells delicious.<br />- Cut off only as much as you think you need that day, as smaller pieces tend to dry out (even in tupperware in the fridge) and lose their ultra-attractive smell. Alternatively, cut larger pieces and tear off smaller ones as you go.<br />- Consider the 2.5 lb or 1 lb versions if you have a small dog.  We have a 15 lb pup who goes on 3+ walks a day and we estimate the 2.5 lb log will last us several months.<br /><br />I have no experience with using the meatlog as his regular meal as I would prefer it stay high-ranked on his list of "OMG AWESOME STUFF".
