Any true southerner knows of the ecstasy brought on by popping one of these salty treats in their mouth.  But only those of us that have left the south have learned the true value of the green peanut.  They simply do not exist outside of the south.  While their is no substitute for buying a bag of fresh raw green peanuts and boiling them yourself, the Margaret Holmes green peanuts are the best substitute one could hope for.  For those of you without the luxury of driving down the highway and pulling over to stop at a peanut stand this product is perfect.  The texture and taste are just what a boiled peanut should be.  I am not a fan of the cajun style myself so this classic  salted batch was just what the doctor ordered.
