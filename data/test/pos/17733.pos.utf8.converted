The Victor M380 and M502 traps are unreal -- total fly genocide. Pretty stinky, but I can only smell it if I'm right nearby (within a few feet).<br /><br />I just uploaded some photos. Be warned: they're pretty gross. But they show how effective the M502 is as a chamber of doom. I shot them after maybe a month and a half of use, just before I threw it away.<br /><br />Pro tip: the water can evaporate, so splash a little water in the top after a week or two, and then spin the trap a few times to mix it in. Really kicks the aroma back into high gear and gets another couple weeks of life -- I mean death -- out of it.
