I'm not a very good breakfast guy, or oats guy... but I've been trying to work out and my trainer loves him some oats.<br /><br />I always love Bob's Red Mill for my flax and flour, and this got good reviews, has a good price, so it's what I went with.<br /><br />I ended up just following the instructions on the package although there are lots of good prep techniques in the various steel-cut-oat reviews here and elsewhere. They came out just fine.... and the reviewer who suggested refrigerating the leftovers for an even better oat experience is correct I think... these things are yummy with each subsequent round.... this makes a batch-prepping your breakfast for a week really easy.<br /><br />So far I've enjoyed this with greek yoghurt, flax-meal, chunky peanut butter, organic honey.... but I'm sure you could do any combination that works for you obviously... I'm trying to get the flavor ratio down for ultimate addiction but haven't gotten there yet.... there's just so much food to eat (yum!), not enough meals (*tear*). It's a good lucky problem to have I guess ;)<br /><br />I've got freezer space for the uncooked oats so that's where I keep them.<br /><br />Very pleased with this round and hope to be better about breakfast going forward!
