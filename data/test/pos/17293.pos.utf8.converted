Just so you know, this is a LOT of bay leaves. Like a restaurant-sized bag of them. I figured since they're about $5 for a tiny jar at the store, and this being Amazon, my ~13 dollars would get me the equivalent of 4 or 5 jars. Think more like 40 or 50.<br /><br />I cook a lot and this is still like a 5 year supply. Maybe longer.<br /><br />I can't really complain about it. Just be sure to order a large storage tin to go with these puppies.
