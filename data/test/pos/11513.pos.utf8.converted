This elderflower cordial, from England, has just the right taste; it tastes closest to the one my mother used to make in Europe.  You mix it with seltzer, for a wonderful drink, or with Greek yogurt, for a wonderful dessert, or with cream for ice cream makers. The one from Sweden has too much lemon, to my taste.
