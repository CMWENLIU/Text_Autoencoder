I've been a veggie for 2.5 years, and in that time I've missed the texture and taste of jerky more than any other meat product. Worried about being disappointed, however, I put off trying this product until today. I wish I hadn't waited so long! While I can't attest that the taste or texture is what a regular meat-jerky eating person would expect, it does fall well within the memories I have of jerky, and it is delicious.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants an extremely healthy meat alternative, and I will certainly be buying more!
