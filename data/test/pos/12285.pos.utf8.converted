My cholesterol had been high -- 265 - for some time.  I did NOT want to take statins, so I tried many methods said to lower cholesterol, like eating oatmeal everyday, cutting out red meat, and exercising.  That dropped my cholesterol to 257.  However, after using Benecol -- taking one or two chews with a meal twice a day -- for five months, my cholesterol is now 219!  I am thrilled.  I have referred several other friends to this wonderful product.  Some people like to eat a "chocolate mint" after meals, I eat a Benecol chew !  Thank you for carrying this product.
