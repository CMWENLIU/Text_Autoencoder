I recently discovered Truffle & Salt as a condiment and have tried a couple of other brands in the 5% to 7% range.<br /><br />This is, easily, the most pungent of the lot.  Delicious truffle flavor in a solid quality salt.<br /><br />Surprisingly, priced less than other brands and, as it is available through Amazon, Prime folk can take advantage of subsidized shipping.
