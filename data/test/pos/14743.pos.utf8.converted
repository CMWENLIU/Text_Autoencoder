ill get the neg's out of the way. ....the bag. fist time i used it the glue holding on the ziplock part, came unglued. thats it.<br /><br />as fo the product its great. many servings for a great price considering acai is an expensive product and difficult to handle. i emailed navitas and they informed me that this product is considered "RAW" so it is not denatured and none of the benefits derived are damaged or altered. plus with the powder over the liquid, you get the skin kept in the mix which with fruits and such, this is where most of the beneficials come from. so i say A+<br /><br />oh and taste is great. i literally teaspoon some and just put it in my mouth twice a day. study acai and stop your other supps so you can buy this as a replacement. benefits are endless in this nutrient deficient society. and real food is the most bio-available source!!
