I cannot stress enough what a picky eater my cat is. Just to get her to eat more than a quarter of a 5.5 oz can of food at a time is quite the ordeal. For some time, I had to mix Nutri-cal with her food, because she is tiny for her age and isn't gaining weight at the rate she should be (she is a kitten). I was just about to settle with Earthborn Holistic canned chicken, as she seemed to like it more than any other food I had tried feeding her. It also appeared and smelled far less disgusting to me than the mush that comes in most cans; the consistency of the Earthborn is chicken shreds in gravy, which my cat seems to prefer. But as I was browsing in the cat food section today, I noticed Weruva Paw-lickin Chicken and picked it up to try because according to the description, it seemed that it would have the same consistency as Earthborn. It's also Grain-free and has no veggies (only this flavor is veggie free though) like Earthborn. And it costs the same, so I figured it wouldn't be difficult financially to switch over to Weruva, if she happens to like it.<br /><br />When I opened the can of Weruva today, I immediately noticed that the quality of this food is even better than Earthborn. The formula is almost soupy, with thinner shreds, which are easier for my kitten to chew and swallow. The smell is VERY tolerable and it actually looks like food a human would eat. The BEST part however is that she ate almost ALL of the 3 oz can. I was so shocked to see that once she was done eating what I spooned into her bowl, she went over the open can and began eating.<br /><br />I was a bit concerned initially when I noticed that even though the food is not described as adult food, in the back in small print it says it is for adult nutrition. However, according to Weruva's website, it is fine to feed it to kittens. The only difference between adult food and kitten food apparently, is that kitten food is supposed to contain more protein, because they need more for their growing bodies. But if fed a sufficient amount, this food, especially because it is very protein rich to begin with, provides complete nutrition for kittens as well. Seeing how much she ate confirms that.<br /><br />My only concern with this food, which is any person's concern with any premium quality food is the price. These foods ARE pricey and it can be difficult to justify spending so much on cat food, but if you can afford it, the benefits of premium quality foods (those that are byproduct and grain free, and preferably veggie free) are:<br /><br />-Their poop becomes significantly less stinky. The difference is very noticeable.<br />-The food itself doesn't smell so bad. And this really depends on what type of meat and consistency you buy as well. If you buy a chicken or turkey flavor food, it will be less smelly than a fish food. I don't see the point in feeding your cat fish other than as an occassional treat if she likes it, because it contains some levels of mercury and is not as nutritious to begin with. I've noticed that the mushy formula food smells considerably worse than the gravy foods. Also, I understand that cat foods are smelly because cats will only eat food that has a very strong smell, but that being said, there's a difference between a stench that permeates your room and a smell that remains concentrated in the general area where the food itself is.<br />-You end up saving money on vet bills, because these foods provide superior nutrition and a healthy animal is less likely to be a sickly animal.
