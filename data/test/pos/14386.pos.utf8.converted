In response to those who say this is no different than typical artificial vanilla, Molina Vanilla actually contains both real Mexican vanilla and artificial vanillin. It's much different than the stuff you'd buy in the supermarket. If you don't believe me, do a side by side taste test. You'll immediately notice that the Molina vanilla is much more aromatic, with a fuller range of flavor.  Personally I prefer Molina vanilla over both artificial vanilla and even the typical pure Madagascar vanilla.  I would recommend it to anyone.
