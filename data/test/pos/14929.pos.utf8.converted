I was at wits end with my chronic gastritis.  I had been to several doctor's and had an endoscopy to find I had h. pylori and gastritis.  The specialist put me on PPI's (proton pump inhibitors) which made me feel worse.  They also put me on several antibiotics which made me sick and caused my candida to get out of control.  After second dose of antibiotics I felt a little better but then back again.  Doctor suggested another endoscopy which I refused and decided to go online and see what I could do naturally.  I found Manuka honey which was over $100 a bottle and decided to look it up on Amazon as I have bought several items  here that retailed well over $100 and found them here for a fraction of the price.  I came across Wedderspoon Manuka honey and read alot of the reviews.  While waiting for my honey to arrive I got 2nd degree burns on my arm and chest from boiling soup.  I thought, gee, let's try the honey on the burns too since many of the reviews said it was great for burns.  I must say my burns are healing beautifully from this honey and much better than any of the other ointments I was using.  My stomach is gradually getting better and I dont have that sick gnawing feeling in the pit of my stomach.  I contacted the Wedderspoon company and was told that it can take a few months to rid myself of the h. pylori but even the antibiotics can take that long yet cause other problems.  I just ordered my second jar and love the taste.  I actually cannot wait to eat it.  My mom also was suffering from allergies and took a teaspoonful a day and saw quick results.<br /><br />I am hoping this is the answer to my digestive problems.  It has been a long hard road to find something that will actually cure this.  I am optimistic that Manuka honey is my answer.  I have to say alot of the reviews I read helped me make the decision to buy this great product and I hope to leave another review when I am totally healed.<br /><br />One last note..........I was very impressed with the fast delivery and packaging was great.  I know some left bad reviews due to poor packaging but I am sure the company saw this and made some changes as both my jars were in perfect condition and arrived quickly and safely.
