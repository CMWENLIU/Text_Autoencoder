This is some of the Best Japanese rice I have tasted, I usually by smaller 5 lbs bags at jewel-osco in the Asian section. But this is way more of a saving for my family of 4. I would recommended this stuff to anyone who like sushi and Japanese rice, I know they also have brown rice and my Wife is a firm believer in brown rice. So If I try it I'll update later.
