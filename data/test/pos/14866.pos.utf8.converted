Parmesan is known as the queeen of Italian cheese. Kraft Grated Parmesan, 16-Ounce Plastic Canister (Pack of 3).  Kraft Grated Parmesan cheese has been around since 1945.  The container has been updated, but the cheese is still the queen.  There are more delicious variations, such as freshly grated . . . and now Kraft has a kind with the grater included so we can  grate our cheese to serve it fresh.  I still buy large amounts of the good basic grated parmesan in the refillable green shaker container. It is quick, and most people are in a hurry these days.  It will keep if we leave it on the table when we eat at the cafeteria.  Ususally at home, I keep it in the refrigerator.<br /><br />It is great for a wide range of dishes, including pastas, soups, sauce, snack, bread, and meat. With only ten calories per teaspoon, we can sprinkle on all we want without feeling guilty.  The cheese taste is one I crave, and eating Kraft's Parmesan is a good way to satisfy that craving for cheese.<br /><br /> Perhaps parmesan cheese has been around since the eighth century B. C. or was it developed about 400 years ago in in the Italian city of Parma?  There was a story that near Parma there was a mountain made entirely of parmesan cheese.  On top of the mountain a community of macaroini makers cooked hot pasta, bathed it in butter, and rolled it down the mountain to the hungry people below. There is a legend that it was used by Roman legionniares becaue it lasted throughout their long journeys.  (I found these stories on Kraft websites, and I could not resist sharing them with you.)<br /><br />Some of our recipes in Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook and The Collard Patch call for large amounts of Kraft Parmesan.  At my house we use Kraft Parmesan cheese in lasagna, meatballs,  collard tortellini, and casseroles containing collard greens! It's delicious.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.
