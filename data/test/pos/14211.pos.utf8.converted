Great Value! Same quantity (60 oz) of Bob's Red Mill toasted hazelnuts (on Amazon) is $20.00 higher! Plus, you can get the Amazon Subscribe & Save price on these! Keep them frozen up to a year and they are real easy to toast in the oven yourself. It's hard to find natural, raw hazelnuts, and Diamond brand is the highest quality. For baking, raw nuts are best so they don't get overcooked and bitter. Recommended.
