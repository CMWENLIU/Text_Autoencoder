Since becoming a diabetic, I have studied foods in an attempt to better control my blood sugar.  Some foods (like ones with lots of sugar) spike my blood sugar.  If a meal is not carefully balanced my blood sugar and my energy drops too much.  So, I am always looking for healthy foods, especially snack foods.  What I usually find are great tasting snacks that are too high in sugar, low in protein, and low in fiber. They are good for normal people, camping or taking long hikes, but not for my daily health snacks.<br /><br />ExtendBar Mixed Berry Delight meets my requirements. This snack has 12 g of protein, 0 sugar (4 g of "sugar alcohol"), and 0 cholesterol. "ExtendBar's" 20 g of carbohydrates is uncooked cornstarch, which is designed to be slowly processed in digestion.<br /><br />Reviews written in 2007 and 2008 mentioned that the taste was unpleasant and the color of the bar was pink.  They must have improved the product because, to me, the taste is pleasant, one of the best snack bars I have ever eaten, and the color is now an off white.  It is not sweet, nor tart. It reminds me of a mix of strawberries and blueberries. The bar's taste is almost as good as the actual strawberries and blueberries I eat regularly.  As with all snacks, I  always consume it with a fluid which helps avoid any dryness.<br /><br />The Extendbar Mixed Berry Delight is valuable. This is one of the best items for overall health that I have seen on the market. It is low in sodium and sugar (no high fructose corn syrup), and gluten free. On the other hand, high in protein (12g), good fiber (6 g), and sustained energy level. All this good nutrition and only 150 calories. .<br /><br />The advertised sustained energy level is real. I have tried this for awhile without blood sugar spikes and without low blood sugar (amazing how they do it, but they do). I highly recommend this product.
