Personally, I hate green mountain as a company. But we received a few GM items with the Keurig machine, including this hot cocoa, so we gave them a try. I was amazed at how great this cocoa was.  I'm not sure if GM reformulated this cup or if the people giving it 1 star are just crazy; but this makes an amazing cup (yes, at the 8oz size). Great chocolate flavor and creamy.<br /><br />Update: Too much saturated fat in this product. I guess I won't be buying it, afterall.
