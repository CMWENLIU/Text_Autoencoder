From my wife Sarah: These are so delicious! They taste like you're dissolving pure honey straight from the honeycomb in your mouth.<br /><br />I use them when I'm dieting to satisfy a craving for something sweet. They're only 15 calories a piece and 2.5 grams of sugar a piece. They're low enough in calories so they don't sabatoge my diet, but they satisfy my sweet tooth effectively calmed. They're low enough in sugar so they don't negatively impact my blood sugar that I can discern. They're gluten free and they're fabulous!
