What a zesty change from my coffee routine. As I get older, coffee no longer agrees with my stomach. I started drinking pu-ehr tea last year when I traveled to China and it has helped my digestive system a lot. I then searched for it on Amazon because I needed an American supplier and came across this version of the tea. I live in Korea and have tasted their ginger tea which has a bite to it. This tea has the bits of ginger to give the pu-ehr tea a fuller flavor without the bite. It is smooth and mellow, and I love it with honey or sugar in the raw. Highly recommended for serious tea drinkers and those who would like a change from their coffee habits.
