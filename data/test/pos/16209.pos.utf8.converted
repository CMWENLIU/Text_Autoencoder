Our morning routine isn't perfect-- sometimes our little one wakes up later and we end up rushing around trying to get the day started. These Plum Organics pouches are a lifesaver-- they are a yummy combination of protein, grains, and fruit. A complete little smoothie that tastes great, is 100% organic, and healthy. Fantastic solution if you are traveling, on-the-go, and need a healthy snack that will complete breakfast.<br /><br />Super helpful to have these in toddler-sized portions that little ones can easily hold and squeeze on their own.
