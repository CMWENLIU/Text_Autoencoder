I rated SeaAloe a five because of the health benefits, the company is another matter. SeaAloe, previously named SeaSilver, helped get me back on my feet after back surgery and a rough time with Sciatica and Fibromyalgia. It was a miracle to me, after spending over a year in bed.<br /><br />I don't eat right, I admit it. This a terrific product, especially if you have poor eating habits. The taste of this product is tolerable (it's not great), compared to so many others I've tried. The company claims this is the exact same formula as SeaSilver but I have noticed a slight taste difference.<br /><br />When I first began taking SeaSilver (SeaAloe), I didn't really notice a huge difference in my health, until I stopped taking it. That was when I realized just how run down I was feeling. Now, I take it everyday and have noticed I have more energy and I'm able to stay up all day, without taking a nap.<br /><br />As for the company, they send me an email each time I order, trying to get me to subscribe to their automatic shipping service, which I've ignored. While I appreciate knowing when my product has shipped, I like ordering through Amazon because I trust them.<br /><br />SeaAloe arrived packaged well (complete with styrofoam peanuts, which isn't environmentally friendly) and arrived within four-days of placing my order.<br /><br />I really love this product and have found the health benefits to be worth the cost. After combining SeaAloe with plenty of exercise, I sleep better and my quality of life has drastically improved. I was in pretty bad shape, when I started taking it. I decided to give it a try because I had nothing to lose and everything to gain.
