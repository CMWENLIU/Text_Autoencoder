I've always loved the Near east taboule and bought it at my local Stop and Shop. When they stopped carrying it I bought the Red Mill Bulghar wheat, grew my own mint and scallions and made it during the growing season. It was good but soooo time consuming. This Taboule tastes fabulous! I wish they'd make larger packages.
