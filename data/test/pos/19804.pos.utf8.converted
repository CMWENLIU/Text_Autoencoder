In a household with two dogs, we have several requirements for our dog food.  We have a Great Dane and a Samoyed.  The protein levels and calcium levels are both important with a giant breed and this food falls into the right range.  With the glucosamine and Omega 3 in the food this one fit all of the nutrient requirements.  There are a few foods out there that hit all of those points.  Our Samoyed has a sensitive stomach as well - so something he both likes to eat and doesn't upset his stomach is important also.  As a side benefit - talking to other great dane owners, they are feeding much larger quantities of food than we are.  Less food to maintain an optimal weight provides two benefits - a lower food cost and they digest it well - which means less comes out the other end.
