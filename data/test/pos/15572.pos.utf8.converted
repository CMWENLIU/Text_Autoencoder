What a great thing to have a natural ingredient to help with aches and pains. I just take it straight, and it is tart, but a sweet taste that is gone in a couple of minutes. This stuff gets rid of the pain in my shoulder when I don't get relief from over the counter meds don't work. And that stuff is bad for your kidneys, (actually dangerous).
