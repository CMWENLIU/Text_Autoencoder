Heaven :) So hard to find a marshmallow I'm not allergic to and here it is. It taste like a real store bought package marshmallow. Nice seller listed ingredent list on amazon.com. Product was fresh, soft & had that powder coating that helps make a marshmallow a marshmallow. I ran this bag though the testing lab lol... It toasted well, melted down in hot chocolate, worked on candy sweet potatoes and was yummy out of the package. I plan on getting more for my holiday cooking. Shipping is pricey but understand if you want it fresh, fast delivery is a must... for me I love stale marshmallows so I'm going to check to see if it can be shipped standard ground.
