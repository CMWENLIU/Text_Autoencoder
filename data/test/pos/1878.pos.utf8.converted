These are legal but crack is not, I don't know what this country's coming to.  Delicious, addictive, and if you eat enough your heart starts racing so it's as good as exercise, right?  Also consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KB2ASM">Dark Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans (1 Pound Bag)</a> by the same seller, I got one of each and mixed them.<br /><br />Amendment:  Having tried a few other brands now, I think these are my favorite.  The bean-to-chocolate ratio is nice (my most recent purchase are essentially chocolate drops with a tiny coffee bean) and you can't go wrong with simple dark or milk chocolate over a variety of candy coatings.
