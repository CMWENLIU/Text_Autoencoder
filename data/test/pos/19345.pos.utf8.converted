it really annoys me that people give a product 1 star rating because it is not vegan. really?  1 star? you didn't even taste it. i mean come on, it's chicken broth powder people. can't you read? so someone on amazon tagged it wrong, don't rate the product poorly because the product happens to be great.  sorry you don't eat meat & are upset about being duped by amazon's vegan tag....but try to be mature about it. some of us do eat meat & you are unfairly rating a delicious and useful product that you haven't even used as a 1 star product.
