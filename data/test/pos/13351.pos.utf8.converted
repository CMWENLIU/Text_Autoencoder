My husband and I have raised honey bees for years, though we cannot call our honey organic because we live in an area where other farmers use chemicals which our bees may bring home to the hive unintentionally.  This honey is the most delicious honey I have ever tasted!!  We did have one time when we raised bees in Southern Illinois in a large clover field that was close to this good, maybe even as good though flavor somewhat different.  YS Royal Honey is so good it was hard to not eat too much.  We should all practice temperance in eating, even if it is something that is "good for you."  Although the price is high, consider it like gourmet candy. Because it is not heated to high temperatures in processing, it crystallizes much quicker than more refined honey products.  But, it can easily be liquefied by placing the jar in a pan of hot water (not on the stove).  If you put it in the microwave to soften it, you will kill some of the beneficial elements in the honey.  Microwave ovens are great for heating water, but must be used at low power levels for short periods of time if you want to maintain the beneficial micro-nutrients in your food!  Also, research has shown that if you use plastic containers in the microwave, chemicals are released from the plastic which are then absorbed by the food.  The chemicals accumulate in your body and can eventually lead to cancer.  Use glass or ceramic only in the microwave because they do not release any harmful chemicals when used in the microwave!!!!
