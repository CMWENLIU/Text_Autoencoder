These seemed to be the most consistent pods. I tried a sampler pack before of many different brands and the Illy and Lavazza pods had the most consistent least bitter taste. Lavazza pods have nice creme. The water flows faster compared to the Illy pods so need to run the expresso machine for a little less time. The Illy pods are probably a little better quality - but at twice the price are not worth the additional investment. I would strongly recommend these. And the shipper was on time and the goods packed well. They do come loose so you will need a container to store them (unlike the illy pods that are boxed)
