As a dentist I see many patients that have dry mouth as a result of medication use or due to cancer radiation therapy of the head and neck area.  I ALWAYS RECOMMEND BIOTENE CHEWING GUM FOR THESE PATIENTS.  Biotene is a biocompatible gum that has natural salivary enzymes that help remove plaque from the teeth.  Gum chewing also stimulates saliva release and any natural saliva that can be produced is of benefit.<br /><br />This is a great product for those with dry mouths and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Jim "Konedog" Koenig, DDS
