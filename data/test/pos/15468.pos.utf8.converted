I've been suffering with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (a.k.a. Myalgic Encephalomyalitis, CFIDS, CFS and ME) for 21 years and one trigger I've found is sugar. After too much I find myself crashing hard. This is not the case with Agave Nectar. I love this stuff, it lets me enjoy sweets without some of the horrible effects.<br /><br />Agave Nectar has a very low glycemic index. This causes the sugars to be absorbed into the body much slower. I have found that this prevents me from 'crashing' after a sugar rush.<br /><br />Glycemic index is a system that ranks foods by the speeds at which their carbohydrates are converted into glucose in the body.<br /><br />I use this just about everywhere I would use sugar, including my coffee. I also make chocolate bars using it with bittersweet chocolate.
