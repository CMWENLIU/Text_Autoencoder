This is the stuff you pray for if you are searching for real divinity candy. It is fresh, well packaged, and tastes the most like the kind my sainted Great Grandmother always made for Christmas. It comes in immaculate little packages of two candies each and the sweet pieces don't have that old yellowed look and lardy taste that some other companies try to temp you with. There is no shiny, waxy satan, outer coating here to devil you ; just innocent, fluffy white clouds that  melt in your mouth like the heavenly host or manna with pecans.  The shipping charges can be sinful but well worth the indulgence!
