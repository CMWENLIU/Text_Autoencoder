For a few years, I have been buying the Numi Golden Chai in individual bags and just recently went looking on here for bulk teas. I was pleased to find my favorite tea, and Chai tea, in bulk. The price seems a lot for tea, but compared to what I paid for the bags, it's a bargain. Plus I'm not throwing away anything (until I kill the bag) each time I make a cup. The bag is the standard foil interior bag, and seems to keep well, and has a ziplock top.<br /><br />As for the tea, it smells so good, and I love the blend. Some chai that uses green tea adds pepper, and is a bit "spicy," so on most occasions I prefer a black leaf chai. It has a stronger taste, but isn't overwhelming since it only adds cinnamon, cardamom, ginger and anise. I can go through 3 cups/day and will vary how much I use depending on how strong I want it (1.5-2tsp), but I could still see one pound lasting me close to two months.<br /><br />Like all Numi teas, it's Fair Trade, which is a big plus for me. Organic ingredients is good too.<br /><br />If you like Chai, you should be pleased with Numi's Golden Chai, whether or not you prefer green tea or black tea. Buy a box of bags first before you invest in the 2 pound package though.
