We love Dorset cereals and the Berries and Cherries variety is no exception. This Muesli is not overly sweet, pleasantly tart due to the berries, and very filling. My husband prefers it with milk, I tend to enjoy it with my Greek yogurt - it's great both ways and definitely a healthier alternative to these sugar ladden cereals found normally in grocery stores.<br /><br />My only gripe is that Amazon does not carry all the varieties - we have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LL4N3O">Dorset Cereals Simply Fruit And Seeds, 12-ounces (Pack of 5)</a> on subscription and just wish the others were available for that as well. Are you listening, Amazon?
