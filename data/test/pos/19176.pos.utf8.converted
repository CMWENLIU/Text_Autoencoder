Having been turned onto steel cut and Irish oatmeal by Alton Brown, I much prefer these to any other oatmeal out there.<br /><br />I make Alton's overnight oatmeal recipe in my Zojirushi rice cooker <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007J5U7">Zojirushi NS-ZCC10 5-1/2-Cup Neuro Fuzzy Rice Cooker and Warmer, Premium White</a>. The results are outstanding all the time. It is delightful to wake up to this creamy breakfast waiting for me. True breakfast comfort food. I like these oats because there is still a bit of bite to the oatmeal after it is cooked.<br /><br />OVERNIGHT OATMEAL<br /><br />Equipment:<br />Rice cooker with timer or slow cooker<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />1 part steel cut or Irish oats<br />4 parts water<br />cream<br />dried fruit<br /><br />Method:<br />The night before add ingredients to rice cooker/slow cooker.
