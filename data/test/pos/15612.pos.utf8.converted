First off, the company sent me a HANDWRITTEN thank you note. When do you see that in the age of computer print outs. I thought it was an extra touch as far as customer service. I will be returning to this company again.<br /><br />The flavor is OMG. My best friend is Hawaii so I often use the red Hawaiian salt, this BEATS its. It has a subtle but GREAT flavor. I will buy again!
