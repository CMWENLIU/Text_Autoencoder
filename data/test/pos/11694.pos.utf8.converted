When I opened the jar and got a whiff of this seasoning, I just knew it would be great.  Smells just like the tacos I made with the saltier seasoning blends, ONLY BETTER--because there's no salt!  The first thing I used this with was eggs...it was great!  Frontier has not disappointed, so I will be ordering more of their salt-free seasonings soon!
