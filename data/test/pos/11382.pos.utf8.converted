I AM VERY UPSET AND DISAPPOINTED. ANOTHER GREAT SUGAR FREE DRINK BITES THE DUST. THIS SUCKS FOR US DIABETICS. FIRST WAS SUGAR FREE GRAPE TANG WHICH WAS AMAZING DISCONTINUED LAST YEAR. THEN THE ORANGE SUGAR FREE TANG DISCONTINUED ALSO LAST YEAR. NEXT BEST THING WAS THE SUGAR FREE GRAPE KOOL-AID BUT THE CHERRY AND TROPICAL WAS GOOD TOO. NOW THAT IS LEAVING US. SO THAT IS WHY THEY ARE SO EXPENSIVE NOW BUY WHAT YOU CAN BECAUSE SOON OUR BELOVED SUGAR FREE KOOL-AID FLAVORS WILL BE JOINING THE DISCONTINUED KRAFT GRAVE YARD...DAMN YOU KRAFT!!!!!!
