Boxers are known for being susceptible to gas. My Boomer is aptly named, but since switching to Wellness dry with about a third of a can of Wellness canned food, fed once  a day, he stays slim, energetic and blessedly flatulance-free. I also note, over a few months, that skin bumps are disappearing. I've tried several top brands, and this seems the most healthful.
