I guess I'm in the minority in saying that I love the large size of this product :)  I normally would make 2 "servings" as described on box of oatmeal - or two packets from a box -- so this product is perfect sizing for me! 320 calories doesn't seem like an overly large calorie amount either.  Even if you were a smaller person and only consuming 1200 calories a day, this would only be 1/4 of your daily calorie needs, and a very healthy 1/4 of your calories it would be.<br /><br />This is lightweight and easy to throw in a bag and bring to work - just add boiling water, or add tap water and microwave and let steep.<br /><br />I like the occasional sweetness of the cranberries and the occasional crunch of the almonds.  It's pleasant without being too sweet.  It's also got 8 grams of fiber in a cup.<br /><br />If you're trying to decide between flavors, I found this tastier than the hot apple cinnamon variety cereal from McDougall.
