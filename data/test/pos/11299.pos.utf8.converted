The search for caffeine alternatives takes on new meaning in this elegant, rich, and satisfying blend.  Although Numi's "Puerh" is a black tea, and does have some caffeine - in smoothness of buzz and taste it's way above Tazo's "Awake" - though the buzz does not last as long - maybe five hours per cup at the outside. I also rate it above Bija's "Yerba Mate" - a golden tea, the best over-the-counter, commercial Yerba Mate I've found, again on the basis of body and taste.  There is a bit of Amazon Rainforest's "Shipo Treasure Tea" texture to the drink - sans the "muddiness", and it seems to provide as much energy boost at about half the price.
