This was 12.50?! This is an amazing deal on a great pound of tea. The mint flavor is not overpowering, which I really like. This tea is amazing iced with a little honey and Splenda. I steep it for about a minute, strain it through a mesh strainer, bottle it, and put it in the fridge for a few hours. The remaining tea dust and small leaves that make it through continue to brew the tea while it cools, which gives it a nice, pungent kick.<br /><br />But do note that this is not a true Moroccan Mint tea. Moroccan tea is brewed with a lot of sugar, then fresh mint leaves are added to the brew. The tea most widely used is Gunpowder, and usually green. But this is a fine substitute for when you're not in Morocco at the moment.<br /><br />I drink a lot of green tea, and I needed a cheaper source. Davidson's was the answer. At 12 to 13 bucks a pound, with good quality, it's close to a steal. I have no idea of where the tea was grown,  which is of no issue to me, b/c it tastes great, and it's organic. No Mercury or Lead to worry about.<br /><br />This is a whole pound, so please make sure you can drink that much tea within two months, or else it will lose it's flavor. Since it is shipped in a paper bag, I recommend transfering it to an airtight container as soon as you get it to preserve the flavor. Or better yet, vacuum pack some of it into multiple bags and open one up when you need it.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
