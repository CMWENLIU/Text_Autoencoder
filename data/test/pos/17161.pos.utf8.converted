I started looking online for a milk alternative since I'm in college, need breakfast, and don't want to pay $4.50 for a half gallon of milk. I decided on Saco after reading reviews, and this stuff rocks. It tastes better, drinks fresher, and doesn't give me gas in the least bit. I'm never buying store milk again.
