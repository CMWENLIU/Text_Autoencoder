Ok, maybe not quite.  But that is the first thing that popped into my mind when I saw this at the store today.  I bought a little squeeze pack to try it and.... OH MY.  This is sooooooooooooo delicious.  It's a bit salty, a bit sweet, and really does make me think of Nutella.  A couple of things, though... this nut butter isn't completely smooth and it isn't really even close to being like Nutella.  BUT it so much more satisfying because it is a nut butter not just chocolatey sweetness like Nutella is.  I am so in love with this Chocolate Hazelnut butter that I am buying the three pack as soon as I am done typing this.  I bought a squeeze pack of the Chocolate Almond as well and I don't like it as much.  It is good, but the Hazelnut is totally out of this world.  And because it is a rich, satisfying food I will be less likely to eat the whole jar in two days like I do on the rare occasion that I allow myself to buy Nutella.  Thank you, for this product.... it allows me to think of my childhood in Germany without making me totally nuts with guilt over what I am putting in my mouth.  That's not to say that I will never buy Nutella again... because I will, but I don't think I'll feel the overwhelming urge quite as often with this stuff in my house.  Yum, yum.<br /><br />Before I sign off, though, I would like to emphasize once more (so I don't get hate comments on my review):  This is not a Nutella copycat, not even close... but if you love that and you love nut butters then you will be in chocolatey, nutty heaven with Justin's.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/09/2012:  Yes, yes the formula has changed. I'm guessing because Hazelnuts are expensive. That being said, I broke down and tried the new BLEND this morning... and you know what? It isn't anywhere near as bad as all of these 1 star reviews are making it out to be. Yes, the flavor of Hazelnut is not nearly as strong, but it IS there, and I still thought it was delicious. In fact, I found the blend to be just a little creamier than the original all-hazelnut version and I rather liked it. Did I prefer the pure Hazelnut? Yes. Do I like the new "Blend"? Yes. I liked it enough that I stand by my original five star rating.
