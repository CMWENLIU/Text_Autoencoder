I don't really need to review Cheez-its, do I?  We all know what they're like.  D-lish!  I did want to comment about buying CheezIts from Amazon.com.  The price here is far cheaper than what any of my grocery stores or discount department stores offer.  With a discount and a coupon, I can get about the same price as here on Amazon.  But I don't always have a coupon and they're not always discounted... I have a Prime membership so shipping isn't a concern.  I did worry a bit about having a box of cracker crumbs... and that wasn't the case at all.  They were as intact as if I'd purchased them from the grocery store shelf.  If you're a fan of Cheez-Its, this is a pretty good way to keep them in your cupboard.
