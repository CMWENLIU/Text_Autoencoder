I came across this Mina Harissa spicy sauce by chance.  It absolutely knocked my socks off, and I am in love.<br />My first time at it, I started off pretty conservatively with scrambled eggs.  After the first bite, I have since<br />fallen TOTALLY in love with this sauce, I put loads of it on and cover every square inch of my plate, and I refuse to make scrambled eggs unless I have this sauce...<br />no joke, buy this sauce, and you will experience happiness.  That is, until you run out ;)  If you dig hot sauce, you should probably buy two or so right off the bat.<br /><br />Once you try this sauce, you will be hooked.  Gauranteed.
