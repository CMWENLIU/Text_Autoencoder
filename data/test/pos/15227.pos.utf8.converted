This arrived very carefully packed,..and boy the jars were much larger than I envisioned.  I ordered the Blackberry and Peach preserves.  I put them both in the fridge,..I prefer them cold. Had some the next day on some toast,..super super delicious!!  A little sweeter than I'd like,..but all in all they really are fantastic w/the majority of ingredients being the fruit.  I think they have like 3 basic ingredients.  Taste very homemade.  Anyone who loves preserves will absolutely love these.
