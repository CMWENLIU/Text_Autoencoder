The sport beans are awesome.  I trained for a 15k running race this summer and taking the beans with me on my longer runs really helped sustain my energy.  They are easy to take along and very easy to eat.  They break down nicely in your mouth and are easily digested.  The flavors are tasty so you don't cringe when eating them during a hard run.  Also- it is a jelly bean- what better texture?!  I just moved to a tropical climate (Hawaii) and can't find them in stores here.  I need them to help with my training since it is so hot- the electrolytes and vitamins will really make a difference.  Planning on buying them on Amazon.
