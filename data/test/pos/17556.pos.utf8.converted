This is worth always having on hand in case your cat gets sick or can't eat because of a mouth injury, cancer, etc. Also stock up on oral syringes (the 3 milliliter size works well for cats' mouths). There are 33 calories per tablespoon, and it's very syringeable with 1:1 PDG:water mix (you can make it even more concentrated and still syringe it, but it's easier for the cat at 1:1). So I add a tbsp of water to a tbsp of PDG, and this fills about three 3 milliliter syringes. I feed about 1/2 milliliter at a time with no trouble (let the cat swallow and lick in between...), so in a few minutes I can get 33 calories into the cat with no fuss. An inactive small cat only needs about 4 to 5 times that much in a day. Some cats can eat up to 2 tbsp of PDG at a time. This works well when the cat isn't even able to eat baby food meat, and even when they can - it's good to supplement them with some syringe feeding to get both of you used to it and to get cat-specific good stuff into the cat. I don't restrain the cat, just put one hand on her shoulder and put the syringe up against her teeth, then when she opens her mouth I squirt about 1/2 milliliter into her, aiming toward the back of the mouth and to the side (don't want kitty to choke...). Just be gentle and you shouldn't need to do anything more than that. You also should try the PDG/water mix in a little bowl, some cats will lick that up all by themselves. Whenever syringe feeding, it's a good idea to have easily eatable food right there also, since sometimes cats just need a little jump start with syringe feeding and then they'll eat on their own. It takes energy to eat, for one thing.<br /><br />Cats should never go more than 24 hours to 48 hours max without food- their livers aren't all that efficient and they can get very sick very quickly without food, toxins release too quickly from stored fat for the liver. Dogs and people are different, they can fast without harm. But cats can very quickly go off their feed for various reasons, even if their nose if just stuffed up from a cold (if they can't smell it, they don't want to eat it) or if they are uncomfortable for some other reason.
