I ABSOLUTELY love this product, so when I saw that there were 1 and 2 star reviews, I had to write a review for myself. As a first time mom, I had high hopes of making my baby's own baby food, but once I returned to work, I felt as though I wouldn't have the time. Then a coworker recommended the Beaba to me, and I am so glad he did. It is a bit pricey, so I bought a used one, and as one reviewer pointed out, the water reserve did have some brown stuff in it. In order to clean the reserve, I used hot water and a toothbrush and scrubbed it all out. I have NEVER seen any of the brown get into the water after the steaming. Since I bought the item used, it didn't come with the manual, but it is so easy to use, that I didn't need one! After my first use, I was in love. For a full time working mom, this steamer blender makes me feel as though I was able to slave away in the kitchen all day to make the best possible food for my baby. Carrots and potatoes only take about 20 mins to steam, and then maybe 2 mins to blend up, so to all the people who say that it isn't big enough, how much food do you need to make?! I am able to make over 12 ounces at a time. Besides, this means that I can change it up for my little one so she doesn't have to eat the same thing day in and day out. And for all the naysayers out there saying that you get the same results with a blender and steamer, you're right. But you can wash dishes by hand too, or use the dishwasher! To all those on the fence about this product, BUY IT! [...].
