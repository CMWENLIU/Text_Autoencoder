I'm sure I don't need to enumerate to this customer base the benefits of green tea: We've seen it in our family over and over again. Appetite control, nutrients, energy, healing properties--the list could go on. However, green tea alone isn't exactly going to win any taste tests for the uninitiated.<br /><br />The whole family enjoys this Bigelow Jasmine brew. We consume it in criminal quantities because it lacks the bitterness of other green teas. It is light, flavorful, and inviting. Add it to your Amazon shopping list, and you won't be disappointed.
