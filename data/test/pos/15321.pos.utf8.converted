I tried this flour for the first time last night. Amazing results. I have been making homemake pizza for 20+ years now and always used bread or high-gluten flour. (Mostly King Arthur).<br /><br />In the past I have read about using Italian "00" flour but have not tried it. King Arthur offers "00" flour but I always thought the protien content was tool low, looked more like cake flour then something I would want to use for pizza.<br /><br />Surfing the other day I came across this flour and read about how much people loved it for making pizza. Seeing that it had a higher protien content (11% compared to KA's 8.5%) I though I would give it a try.<br /><br />Well based on last nights results I'm a fan and may never go back to HG flour again for pizza.<br /><br />The dough was very easy to work with (you will not be tossing this dough) very soft and easy to work with.<br /><br />I used the following bakers percentages:<br /><br />Italian "00" flour 100.00% (1 lb 4 oz approx 4.5 cups)<br />Water  57.00% (11.4 oz - approx 1.333 cups)<br />IDY  0.17%  (.03 oz - approx .333 tsp)<br />Salt, Fine  3.00%  (.6 oz - approx 1 tbsp)<br /><br />I use two 16 Oz balls for two 14" pizza
