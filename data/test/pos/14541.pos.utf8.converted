I have been using SweetLeaf Stevia liquid for the past year for sweetening my coffee and teas.  A little goes a long way and these little bottles last a very long time as a result.  The dropper makes it very easy to use and with just a couple drops I have a delicious cup of healthy tea without any excess calories.<br /><br />I also use stevia for cooking but for measuring purposes I prefer to use stevia powder -<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006QRU5ZQ">100 Grams (3.5 Oz) Stevia 95% Steviosides Bulk Powder</a>.  The powder is actually a bit sweeter than the liquid so just remember the golden rule when measuring, a little goes a very long way.  One teaspoon is equal to about a cup of sugar!
