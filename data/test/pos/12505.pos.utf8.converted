Despite what the above reviewer (competitor?) writes, this product has zero transfat.<br />It is also very easy to make.  My wife and I bought at least 25 different mixes over a two year period.  This was by far the best.  Easy to prepare.  Cooks perfect every time.  Outstanding flavor.  Perfect texture.  We used to buy from the manufacturer in Wisconsin and they'd mail it to us in California.  But they kinda consistently made mistakes on our order.  They make some other flavors but they aren't great to us.<br />We also tried several waffle makes including a professional model from Wells like you see in restaurants.  The best we found was a $300 Kitchen Aid from William Sonoma.  It makes two huge round waffles at once!<br />With a lot of mixes (especially pancakes) I like to doctor them up a bit by changing ingredients.  But this is perfect.<br />WE LOVE WAFFLES!!!
