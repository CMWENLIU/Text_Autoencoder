I've used the refrigerated Int. Delight Irish Creme before, and it's easily my favorite flavor. However, being a college student with a rather small fridge, it's hard to make sure I have it when I need it. It's also rather hard to go and pay $6 for a bottle that could easily expire if my power goes out in the dorm (which is often). I paid $.06 per individual package- far less than I would have otherwise.<br /><br />I went and bought this last week for the start of term, and I must say, having the single serve packages is much more convenient than a large bulky bottle. I can put the extras away in my closet, and keep a few out on my desk without worrying about keeping them cold. The taste is exactly the same as what you would find in the cold section of your supermarket. I highly recommend getting this if you love your creamer as much as I do, and are either on a budget or need the extra space in your fridge.
