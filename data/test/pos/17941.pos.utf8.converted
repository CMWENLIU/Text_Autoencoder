This Goya product is the best way to cook Paella with seafood and impress everybody. I cook paella every month and this Goya product makes me look like a pro. I have even surpassed my mother's and sister's paella. I am a hit!<br /><br />I add some extra ingredients, like that $3 bag of frozen seafood, one dozen fresh clams, one dozen mussels, and 12 prawns. Besides that I put Oscar Mayer sausages cut in little slices and two chicken breasts cut in thick slices.<br />When the Paella is done, you can feed 6 people and there are leftovers.<br /><br />The secret is in the high quality rice, that does not stick (very important), and, in the can of seafood and squid that comes in the Goya Package. The spices in the rice add enough flavor to make you think you are eating actual saffron (which is ultra expensive).<br /><br />I recommend this product for those of you that miss the Paellas from Valencia and want instant satisfaction. In 40 to 60 minutes, you can have superb paella. I forgot, you need to add sliced roasted bell peppers for presentation.<br /><br />It's the best. It will make you look like a high cuisine chef!
