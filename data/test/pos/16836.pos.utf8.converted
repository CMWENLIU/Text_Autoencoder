I ordered a couple packages of Asbach Uralt chocolate squares for friends and family, and ended up eating most of them myself after a little taste. You can't have just one. Very dangerous chocolates and an expensive habit that's hard to kick, but well worth the rush. Stock up during the winter with a minimum $100 purchase, as these chocolates are seasonal.
