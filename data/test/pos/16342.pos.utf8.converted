We throw an aluminized survival blanket (only a couple of dollars) over unit which reflects light back onto plants and also keeps them warmer which increases growth in addition to eliminating the light glare - Love this unit - fun, productive, educational, organic, easy and probably money saving in long run - worth every cent
