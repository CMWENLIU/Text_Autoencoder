I bought it because I wanted to make my own shakes and the price was incredible. I am too lazy though and just dissolve a scoop of it in water with a spoon.  It dissolves great, tastes like flour.. I wouldn't recommend doing it this way.<br /><br />I need to find some good recipe's for it.<br /><br />Tip:<br />I dumped all 4 bags into one of those big Creatine / Whey Protein jugs you find at walmart and it fit perfectly.
