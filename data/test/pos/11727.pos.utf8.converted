I love Maldon salt. I discovered it when we visited England and had carefully hoarded my box until my daughter, when visiting England brought me back a box.<br /><br /> Maldon salt is large square bowls of salt mixed with big broken chunks, perfect for on top of bread or vegetables.<br /><br />This box will last a very long time making it a very affordable luxury.
