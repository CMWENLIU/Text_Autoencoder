If you're looking for a more adult version for raisin bran, be sure to try this.  The flakes remain crunchy for quite some time, the raisins are larger and more frequent, and it's packed full of vitamins.  Great, great stuff, even my cat likes it so hey, you can't beat that!  We consume quite a bit of this stuff in our house.  Highly recommend!
