They aren't really like spaghetti, more like a rice noodle.  Yes, they do smell bad at first.  There is nothing rubbery about the texture in my opinion.  I decided to try these to cut back on carbs.  I put milk in a pan and added butter, fresh garlic, and a little parmesan cheese.  Then I tossed the noodles in.  We really liked them.
