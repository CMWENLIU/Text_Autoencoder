As most of you cinnamon buyers know, cinnamon in grocery stores is outrageously priced! The best I could ever find was $7 for a 1.2 ounce jar. And that only had 12 sticks. We brew a crock pot of apple cider practically 24/7 from October to March and like to add about 3 sticks per half gallon. That was really adding up but I was skeptical when I saw this offer. With free 2 day shipping from Prime, I got 32 ounces for less than the price of 2 grocery store ounces! And I will confirm that this stuff is legit. 3 sticks a day for 120 days!! Cider party!!!
