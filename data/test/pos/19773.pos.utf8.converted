I grew up drinking Diet sodas.  No joke.  I'd never tasted a regular Coke until I was 13.  I thought I'd gag.<br /><br />In recent years I've scooted from one Diet brand to the next, avoiding all those empty calories and eventually avoiding caffeine.<br /><br />All these new 'Zero' products may not have sugar or caffeine but they are loaded with artificial sweeteners that I've generally heard nothing but bad things about.<br /><br />So, get fat with sugar or get cancer with artificial sweeteners.  Doesn't seem like much of a choice.  And, of course, I am prone to exaggeration on this matter.<br /><br />Having used Stevia before (an all natural herbal sweetener from South America) I was thrilled to find Zevia...sweetened by aforementioned sweetener.<br /><br />If you're used to the taste of Diet or Zero anything, then this won't be a far leap for your taste buds.  I love this stuff!<br /><br />The only down side for now is the price.  AT nearly $6 a 6-pack (or more) it's a pricey artificial sweetener alternative.<br /><br />But if you aren't a soda-holic (less than a can a day on average) then this really isn't so bad.
