I first heard about this sea salt in the book, "Real Food", by Nina Planck, who touted its health benefits and delicious taste.  Unlike most  salts available today -- including gourmet sea salts, kosher salts, and table salts -- Celtic Sea Salt is hand-harvested, unprocessed, and unrefined in Brittany using centuries-old techniques.  This means it retains its original natural minerals, the absence of which in today's diet can contribute to a range of health problems.<br /><br />So fine, it's good for you.  But how does it taste?  As a regular user of expensive sea salts (purchased in gourmet food stoes, Whole Foods, etc.) before finding this one, I can say it is by far the best tasting one on the market.  It actually has a delicious stand-alone flavor and tastes less metallic than other sea salts I've purchased and more like authentic salt should.  I purchased some at Whole Foods and kept it out in a salt cellar on our table.  It quickly became the only salt we use, both to season our food at the table as well as in a wide range of recipes.  Now I buy it in bulk via Amazon, which offers a better price per ounce than the small jars sold at Whole Foods.
