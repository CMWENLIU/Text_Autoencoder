This is absolutely my favourite of the Yogi Teas I've tried.  It's got a lot of body without being bitter, and works well with and without milk.  Having stevia means that it doesn't need sugar, but isn't too sweet.  Rather than tasting like a typical herbal tea, this makes a good, caffeine-free substitute for standard tea and coffee.
