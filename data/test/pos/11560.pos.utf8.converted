I am a chocoholic. I have been through every chocolate cereal out there. I have tried coca puffs, cocoa krispies, cocoa pebbles, chocolate honey comb, and any other chocolate cereal that has come out. Those did NOTHING for my chocolaty cravings!!!!<br /><br />Krave double chocolate is my second favorite chocolate cereal but we will get into that later.<br /><br />what do i love about this cereal?<br />I love that it actually tastes like chocolate..it has a smooth chocolate filling kind of like a truffle.<br />I also love that it is multi grain with a good range of vitamins. A healthy chocolate snack...although sugar is kind of high.<br />I also love the 1 dollar coupon on the back of the box....with sales and the coupon, I can get two boxes for 3 dollars!<br /><br />Now, while i love this cereal, there is one cereal I love even more. That is Kellogg mini wheat little bites chocolate...best chocolate cereal hands down.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X8T8DK">Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites Chocolate Cereal, 15.8-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>1
