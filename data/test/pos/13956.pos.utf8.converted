In my humble opinion, Maine lobsters taste better and have more meat than any other lobsters in the world. The title "Alive Maine Lobsters" is not quite accurate, because catches can be in the coastal area from North Carolina to Nova Scotia. My father placed an order with Hancock Gourmet Lobster Company for me and they were delivered at 6:18 am on Dec. 24th.  The lobsters were alive, healthy, and ready to cook.  I got a pot of water boiling and my wife walked into the kitchen to see what I was doing.  She got mad and wouldn't let me put them in the pot.  I had to buy a salt water aquarium for them and now they are my new pets.
