**UPDATE Mar 25, 2012: I found a spice grinder here on Amazon that does flax seeds: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SPEU">Krups 203-42 Electric Coffee and Spice Grinder with Stainless-Steel blades, Black</a>. If you're looking for a good flax seed grinder, take a look at my review of the Krups grinder.**<br /><br />I purchased this grinder specifically to grind flax seeds two tablespoons at a time. It works... if you've got all day. I put two tablespoons of fresh flax seed into the grinder and twisted...and twisted....and twisted... After about a minute of grinding I had a litte bit of flax seed dust. So I tried grinding with various coarseness settings. Same result: very few of the seeds were ground. Desiring to be "fair", I filled the grinder with as much seed as it could hold, thinking the added weight of seeds would push the others into the grinding wheels to produce more ground product faster. Nope. This grinder still produced little product for the effort. Finally, I decided to stand there and grind away for as long as it takes to get my two tablespoons of ground flax seed. My wrists began to ache after 3 or 4  minutes and I still didn't have quite the two tablespoons full, but it was enough to get on with breakfast.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I put some sea salt rocks in this grinder and wow!  It grinds sea salt like a champ. Then I put some peppercorns in this grinder and wow again! It's great with peppercorns, too. I wish I'd known this before I bought the two expensive salt and pepper mills I already own.<br /><br />With my curiosity now out of control, I broke a couple of cinnamon sticks into shorter pieces and popped them into this grinder. it works well enough for those rare occasions that I need freshly ground cinnamon. Wanting to be thorough, I covered a couple of sticks of cinnamon with a paper towel and crushed them with two or three whacks of a hammer (a meat tenderizer would work, too) and put the pieces into this grinder. Phenomenal! It did a great job of grinding crushed cinnamon sticks.<br /><br />Summary: If flax seed is what you want to grind, don't buy this grinder unless you have plenty of time and strong wrists. If you're looking for something that looks great on the casual dining table and happens to do a great job of grinding salt rocks, peppercorns, and crushed cinnamon sticks at a great price, buy this grinder. I wanted to give zero stars to this grinder because it does a terrible job of grinding flax seeds. But because it does a great job grinding salt, pepper, and cinnamon AND is reasonbly priced, I give it 5 stars and plan to buy two more.
