I bought two bags of this along with some beef broth from the same company.  Despite the negative reviews from a couple of folks here that it has MSG, and that it also contains chicken broth (really??....Duh!), I highly recommend this powder for its excellent value and rich taste.  Since it comes in a powdered form it is much easier to personalize to your taste.  It also contains a little less sodium than cubed bouillon.  (For anyone that cares about that sort of thing). I don't make chicken soup every day, and hardly ever during the summer months.  So when I do I want it to taste really yummy.  And that means using the best tasting stock I can find.  Unless you are someone that is either sensitive to MSG, or just chooses to avoid it, I highly recommend this chicken powder. Trust me, I think you will like it....Bon Appetite!
