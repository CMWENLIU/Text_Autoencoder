I'm a long time coffee junkie.  I think I had my first cup when I was five or six years old.  One of my most potent memories as a child growing up in New York was going to Schraffts or Chock Full 'O Nuts to enjoy a cup of coffee, New York style.  I've gone from stove top percolated pots to electric pots to camp-fire brewed to drip machines. And I must include several years of "chow hall" coffee while in the military.  I've been using whole beans for many years and even spent a few years roasting my own beans.  In all, some sixty years of varied levels of products & as varied means of delivery.  Then a friend recommended Yirgacheffe.  Now I cannot compare Coffee Bean Direct's Yirgacheffe product to other roasters but I can say, without exception, this is one fine tasting coffee.  Two cups, prepared with a French press, and my day begins in a most positive way.  The price is right, the quality is outstanding and the taste - well you have to try it for yourself.  Do yourself a favor, you'll enjoy the flavor.  Coffee Bean Direct has a winner with this coffee.
