These are my absolute favorite go-to GFCF muffins! At first I was put off by having to add the flavoring myself (having previously used Jiffy mixes), but now I like the ability to personalize the flavoring without having to stock dozens of different mixes. However, since my 9-y-o ASD son has texture issues, dried fruits are NOT an option for us (he just drops the fruit, or the rest of the muffin, when he comes to it), so I just measure 3/4 cup of all-fruit spread. Easy and versatile! I've also used fresh mashed banana and canned pumpkin. Even made it one time with just OJ instead of milk and no mix-ins (we were at my folks' and had already started mixing when we realized there was no GFCF milk); they were delicious that way, too!<br /><br />One tip I would like to share with everyone: Instead of mixing the whole package of dry ingredients and the whole cup of milk at once, mix like an old-fashioned cake recipe and alternate the dry & the milk. It makes the batter lighter and you get more muffins. (I average 22!)
