Once you try grating your own nutmeg, fresh for each use, you will NEVER buy the ground spice in the a jar again ! This product wafted through my house, at Thanksgiving, as I grated it for a sweet potato dish and in hot apple cider for my guests.  The memories that were invoked took me back to the 1st time I had freshly ground nutmeg in Antigua....that was a happy WARM memory for this Ohio Girl !
