This is undoubtedly the best tasting coffee I have ever had, and I've tried lots and lots of different brands.  It is so mild and mellow.  There's nothing like sitting on the porch early in the morning or late in the afternoon with a cup in my hand.  I'll challenge anyone to just give it a try.  You'll never go back to your original brand.
