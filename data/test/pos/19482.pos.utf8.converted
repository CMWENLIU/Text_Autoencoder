I need 5 pounds of gummy peaches. And you just might, too. Truth be told, I bought these so that I could qualify for Super Saver Shipping. It seemed like a good idea at the time. Now it's a month later and I still have a ton of the greatest gummy peaches on earth, and I still think it was a good idea.
