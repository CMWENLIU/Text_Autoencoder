One reviewer rated this product poorly on account of soy being an ingredient.  I personally think that is a pretty silly reason to rate this with one star.  "All natural" does not necessarily mean that it contains no products that can cause allergies.  Anything you might hand out to your kid's friends could potentially have some allergy-causing ingredient in it and therefore parents of highly allergic kids must take responsibility to let everyone who has interaction with their child know. But away from this, these fruit gummies are excellent! I have two little gummy addicts in the house who ask for "gummy packs" throughout the day and thinking of all those artificial colors going into their little bodies on a daily basis horrified me.  They love these every bit as much as the junk food ones.  They taste the same but are natural.  Well worth the few extra bucks spent!
