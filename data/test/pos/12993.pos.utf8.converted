I have recently become a vegan and one of the things I missed was scrambled eggs. Well, not anymore. I actually prefer this mix to scrambled eggs and it is better that the "do it yourself" tofu scrambles that I have made on my own. To make it even better, add in some tomatoes and onions and serve it with oven fries and you won't miss eggs again.
