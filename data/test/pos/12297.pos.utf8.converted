I tracked down Boo Berry because my wife brought up, in a conversation with the kids, that her favorite cereal was Boo Berry, and she could never find it any more.  It's true -- it is only available in our area of North Carolina around Halloween, and the only store that seemed to carry it was an hour's drive away.  So, for a little surprise, I found it online through Amazon, and got her 3 boxes.  Our daughters also enjoy it, and I got a few brownie points in the process.  Have fun, stay young.
