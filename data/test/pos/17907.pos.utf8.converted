Good heavens, I can't believe no one sells or buys these! These are the best, most authentic shortbreads available! I've had authentic Scottish shortbread, I've made respectable shortbread from a Scottish recipe, and I'm telling you, this is the closest thing you can buy, folks. If you see them for sale, you should just snatch every one off the shelf and stick 'em in the freezer because it may be a long time before you see them again.
