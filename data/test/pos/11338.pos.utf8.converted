Pacific Natural Foods' Organic Vegetable Broth is a savory contrast to the usual drab veggie broths available on the market today. It stands on its own, so it's perfect if you're having to stick with clear liquids. Since it's great on its own, it's also good as a base for recipes. Its spices aren't too intrusive; they accentuate whatever is put in the broth. As an Organic Vegetable Broth from Oregon, it's a savory harvest!
