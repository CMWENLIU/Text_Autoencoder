I love gum, it helps me stay awake during boring meetings or long hours at the computer and keeps me from snacking, problem is almost every type of gum made now has aspartame which tends to give me a headache. So I love this gum as it has none, plus the calories in each piece are even lower.  The peppermint and spearmint are my favorites and last the longest, the fruit is a little sweet for me and does not last as long.  None of them last as long as your standard commercial gum, but for me, it is definately worth it.
