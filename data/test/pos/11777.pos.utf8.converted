I buy this product for my two cats. I know there are dogs on the cover, but they sure go ape $#!^ for these chicken bits. These are great treats to reward any animal, they are healthy and don't have any invasive odors like a lot of other pet treats. I hate to admit this, but I have tried these treats as well, don't judge me too much I know you have thought of it as well. Aside from being a little bland, they are pretty good, put a little hot sauce on them and it could pass along with most of the frozen snacks that kids eat. If you are looking for a premium treat to give to your pets I suggest Pure Bites.
