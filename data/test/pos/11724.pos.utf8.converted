I couldn't believe that Amazon sold bonsai trees. I just got an urge to try my hand at one, and started looking around on the internet for recommendations of where to buy one. And I thought, well, I buy so many other things from Amazon, I'll try there. Sure enough, they had several to choose from. Starting at the least expensive one, I saw that other purchasers had liked what they got here, so I ordered one for myself. I still couldn't believe that I could by a tree this way. But it arrived a few days later, was in great shape, well packed and looked like a really good start on my Bonsai effort for under $10. I've had it now for about a week, put it in a nice pot with some nice potting soil and all is well. It's going to be a while before it's large enough to really work with. But I'm happy and on my way.
