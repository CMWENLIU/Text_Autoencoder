TVP is the same base ingredient used for Morningstar "Crumbles" and Boca "Ground Beef" substitute.  The difference?  Pure TVP doesn't have the HUGE amount of added sodium in the aforementioned products (check the labels), plus it is cheaper.  Also, you don't have to freeze this product, and it will last a long time if stored properly.  All you have to do is rehydrate it and use it.  It takes on the flavor of whatever you are cooking and adds welcome protein to the meal.  For our household, this is a staple product.
