Makes a great cup of sugar free-fat free 25 calorie hot cocoa!  It's not quite as "rich" a product as some of  the gourmet cocoas, but for those of us on restricted diets, it's a really good product. I like the canister because it's convenient and pretty much spill proof.  I took the little single serving packets on vacation and they just don't travel as well as the canister.  PS Add a dash of cinammon or maybe a little almond flavoring if you feel like having a gourmet cocoa!
