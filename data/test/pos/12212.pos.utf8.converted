Ok.  Almost silly to write a review for these.  Yummy chocolate.  If you are not familiar with Ghiradelli they are one of the best chocolates you can buy.  This was a nice gold box special so I bought six of these and six of the dark cocoa ones.  Amazon Prime free shipping and you get a bag of these for about 1/2 the price that you buy them in the store.
