Don't be fooled by the simple packaging of this mixed spice. This is not a simple flavor.<br /><br />If you like the steaks served at a certain "Australian" styled steak house you may well like this seasoning. A friend of mine introduced it to me at a little cook out, where he rubbed a generous amount on some new york strip cuts and grilled, and I fell in love. He then told me that this was the above mentioned steak house's secret seasoning for it's steaks, him claiming to know this by having worked their for a time. I know he had worked at just about every chain restaurant at some point, but that's about all I can confirm in regards to this rumor one way or the other as I've never had a steak there, nor worked at one. Regardless of the truthfullness of that statement, I can firmly attest to fact that this is an excellent mixed spice.<br /><br />I've used it on just about every type of meat except sea food, though I suspect it would be good on that too, with a noteable preformance on eggs. It is mildly spicey and fairly salty, but not overpowering unless you really load up.<br /><br />Reminds me of cajun seasonings in simular packaging, but is not as "hot". I highly recommend a good cut of beef, pan fried in olive oil with a generous amount of Cavender's Greek Seasoning rubbed in.<br /><br />It is also priced very well, and one container is more then enough to last a while. If you for some reason don't love it, you won't be out very much money and if you end up loving it as much as I do, you'll have plenty of it to last you a long time. A seasoning every kitchen should have!
