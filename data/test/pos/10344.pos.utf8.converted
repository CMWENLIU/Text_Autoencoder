This chocolate is excellent quality and VERY sweet and smooth for being such a high percentage of cocoa. Eating a small bit of the darkest chocolate you can get immediately after taking your medicine helps the medicine work better (info given to me by a cardiologist)... and it does!<br /><br />Also, what could be better than helping an endangered species; ensuring that the workers who work in the fields are getting a fair wage for their efforts; AND enjoying some delicious chocolate?? It's a win-win-win situation!
