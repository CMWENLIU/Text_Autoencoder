Combine Millet flour with White Rice Flour (3/4 C Millet + 1/4 White Rice) for most baking recipes.  The White Rice gives the Millet the needed glutinous texture to resemble gluten flours.  You can use most recipes by just substituting this combination. I caution you not to open the Amazon box or the inner box with a box cutter or anything that might puncture the bags of Millet flour. I learned this by experience and having to repackage the product.  Happy baking!
