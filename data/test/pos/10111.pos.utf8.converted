This thing is HUGE and my Great Dane absolutely adores it! I purchased 2 chews, a knotted one and this braided one, and I must say that I am very happy. That's saying a lot because I usually hate rawhide -- my dog normally devours most rawhide treats in about 15 minutes and during that time manages to tear off at least one soft wet chunk big enough to choke on and scare the daylights out of me. These are designed in a way those scary moments haven't happened!<br />These chews are truly CHUNKY - the ring is easily over 8 inches diameter and the braid is about 3 inches across, the rawhide is super thick and the whole thing is HEAVY. The braided design makes it so he cannot pull large pieces off to choke on and he has to work very hard to get even small pieces off. Normally if he has to work hard at a chew he will just give up - but not these! He carries it all over the house, plays with it by throwing it in the air (which is very loud on my wood floor), and then settles down for some chewing time -- this chew keeps him entertained for a good hour or more. In this hour of chewing he does NOT devour the rawhide like many other brands we have tried, he just barely manages to get a small 4 inch section gnawed soft then gets tired and takes a nap.  In 3 days he has not gotten bored with this routine and we still have 98% of the original chew left! To me - that is a cost effective chew toy! He seems to prefer this braided ring over the knotted type - maybe because the circle design enables him to hold the chew firmly with his paws (see picture) or maybe because of the tasty beef basting. Even more impressive is that the basting looks to be thoroughly embedded into and throughout all of the rawhide not just brushed on the outside; it does not come off on his white legs or my beige carpet - how WONDERFUL is that?!<br />I feel it is important to note that these are all-natural rawhide chews MADE IN THE USA (Illinois). They do say "a product of Brazil" on the outside of the package because they are made from free range, natural grass-fed BRAZILIAN beef hides (without chemicals, preservatives or bleaches). They are also antibiotic, hormone and preservative free. All of their rawhide products are lot-coded for traceability back to the cow. They are a PetAg product (a USA company founded in 1930) which is a division of Borden (another USA company).<br /><br />So in closing: They might seem a bit expensive at first glance, but I have discovered they are high quality, long lasting, and dog entertaining... that to me is worth every penny and if my dog ever makes it through the 2 chews I we already have -- I will happily purchase more!
