Sometimes, you do get what you pay for.<br />I'm not in the market of spending more than $5 per box of delicious tea but I decided to try something new, fresh and Matcha. I read other reviews on this specific tea then tried it. . .WOW!!! Great color, fresh taste and no residue when mixed well. I make traditional tea, ice cream and blend the powder into my smoothies. Simply wonderful.
