I found this tonic water in a store 60 miles from my home.  I avoid high fructose corn syrup which is found in almost every tonic water unless you buy diet which tastes horrible.  Whole foods has a couple with sugar which I buy when I'm there but that is 90 miles from my home so I don't go often.  This tonic is even better because it's sweetened with agave nectar and has fewer calories than the ones with sugar.  I ordered it because I don't travel to the store where I found it often.
