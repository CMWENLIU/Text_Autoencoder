This is what you need if you want to make not good, not great but beyond amazing pizza dough. I've been making pizza for a decade and I thought I know what I was doing and what to use... and then, I tried this flour. Wow! Big deference: it has more elasticity to it so makes for easier tossing, and then the taste... poems should be written about the taste.<br />I've learned about Antimo Caputo "00" flour on Taylor's Ultimate episode - the ultimate pizza, it's where he goes to NYC, then to Italy, Naples and learns how to make pizza dough. The Italian woman who is teaching him shows him this flour and says that this is the only kind that pizzerias throughout Naples use. `Nuff said.
