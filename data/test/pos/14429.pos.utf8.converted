No corn<br />No wheat<br />No artificial colors, flavors, or by-products<br />Made in the USA<br /><br />I've always liked the Zukes offerings and so do my pooches. When I noticed they made a product called turkey 'n taterz, I had to buy it so my girls could try it. Evie the bichon loved them right away and gobbled several of the flat-bottomed, oval treats in short order. Ever the fussy one, Piper the shih tzu had to be cajoled and had to see if Evie liked them. After her first taste, Piper was a convert soon begging for more.<br /><br />The crunchy treats come in a convenient small size, but have an indentation in the middle so that one can more readily break them in two for dainty dogs who like small bites. (Namely Piper the shih tzu)<br /><br />Made with USDA turkey and fresh potatoes, these wholesome treats are bound to get the attention of spudophiles everywhere. Give them as treats or rewards or sprinkle them on the dinner plate for those reluctant fussy eaters. (See Piper above)
