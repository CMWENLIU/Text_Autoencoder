I've found this to be a good sweetener. I have to use more than they say (about 10 drops when I'm using lemon), but I use extra packet sweetener, too. Very happy. I'll just have to figure out how many "servings" I get from a bottle, but I'm guessing it's more economical than the stevia products I get at the grocery store.
