This is a great starter! I tried using plain Dannon for my first batch, and it was nowhere near as good. The Eurocuisine starter makes a nice, smooth consistency, delicious yogurt. Vary percolating time to change the level of tartness. I make mine with 1% milk and add a touch of honey. Store bought tastes like artificial flavored pudding to me now.
