I have spent the last year, after a long discussion with  nutritionist friend, doing some strong reading on artificial sweeteners, ingredients, and FDA testing results.<br /><br />I won't bore you with all of that as it's certainly easy enough to get with a few hits of google, but suffice it to say there is STRONG evidence that we should be concerned with other sweeteners; even the most populara ones were refused by the FDA many times before (**cough, cough**, lobbyists) they were passed. And with very interesting results in health later.<br /><br />Even Splenda, which says it's made from sugar, is processed and bleached rendering it unnatural.<br /><br />That said, even though I am always concerned about a healty weight, I had concern about using stevia...not because of health...its totally natural and shows no ill effects (it's about to be used in all the major diet sodas in replacement of artificial calorie free sweeteners) but because the early stevia on the market had a licorice taste.<br /><br />Well, that's been corrected...<br /><br />big fan of stevia. I think it's a strong threat to any other calorie-free sweetner and could vastly improve some health issues. Plus the fact that many new studies show other no calorie sweetners can cause real sugar cravings. I debate if this has happened with me...I sometimes think it has though when I have a diet coke.<br /><br />stevia is now a staple in our tea and coffee!
