My German Sheperd will not eat the frozen raw patties no matter what brand I try, but he eats all the Stella and Chewy's freeze dried with no hesitation.  I buy in bulk to save money and give him 6-9 freeze dried patties per day.  It has really helped his ear problems since I've incorporated this into his diet.  He no longer needs ear meds or cleaners and he has been staying symptom free.  I have tried so many different frozen paties -- different brands different proteins.  He had no interest in the frozen stuff no matter what tricks I tried, but there has never been a problem with getting him to eat the Stella and Chewy's freeze dried. He especially likes the Duck Duck Goose.  My cats like it too.  (I emailed the company. All of their products are for both dogs and cats.)<br /><br />I like that the brand has the organic ingredients, the high meat content, that it's pathogen free (safe), the organs, and mostly that my dog can get a raw meal with those good enzymes each day now.  It's a complete and balanced food,not just a supplement, like some other freeze dried.  It's in his daily diet now that is part of a fresh meat home-cooked diet that I supplement with Wysong Call of the Wild (a powder that is added to fresh meat and that also gives him some raw food ingredredients).  I've found that with a combination of Stella and Chewy's freeze dried raw, fresh cooked meat with Wysong Call of the Wild, cooked wild salmon, a cooked egg most days, sardines, fresh organic fruits and vegetbles and blueberries that my dog, even though he was not receptive to a raw meaty bone diet or a frozen raw commercial diet, is getting nearly optimal nutrition.
