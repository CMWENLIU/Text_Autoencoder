I am immediately very happy with the great quality of these fine Earthmate 23 Watt Super Mini-Spiral 2700K Bulbs. They are constructed very solidly, yet are compact, about the same size as a small regular older-tech 100 Watt bulb. I was able to immediately replace most of my overhead light-fixture bulbs with these. The 2700K color is so nice, I did so, after trying-out the first one. They seem cool to the touch as compared to my older bulbs -- I got burned a bit when un-screwing an older 60 Watt bulb that had been on for only twenty minutes. Yet, these 23 Watt bulbs seem easily as bright as my older 100 Watt ones. But, at only 23 Watts, I am going to replace almost every older bulb with these Earthmate 23 Watt ones. They are bright, yet yellow mellow [slightly-golden creamy-white], good for about any indoor fixtures I have. I retain a newer-tech [hallogen] floodlamp for my reading chair -- but may change even that one for one of these CFL Super Mini-Spirals as they are so bright and cheerful. These are at once economical, ecological and cheerful. If they really last as long as claimed I will be a long-term user of them +++
