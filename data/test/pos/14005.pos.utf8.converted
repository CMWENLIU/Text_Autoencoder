I need my coffee.  I love flavored creamers.  My husband likes his black.  I need something with a little extra zip and he doesn't like dark or espresso roasts.  This is a great way to meet in the middle.  We got hooked on this when our local store carried it and when they stopped I Googled where to get it.  THis is great because it comes right to the door on a schedule that I determined and I never need to worry about running out.  It actually turns out to be the same cost too!<br />Love it, will buy it until they quit making it.
