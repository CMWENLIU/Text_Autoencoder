I'll keep this short and sweet, I bought this for my wife on Mother's day, i figured I would get her something out of the ordinary (chocolate wise). So I decided to go out on a limb with this, needless to say my wife loves it, she can't stop raving about how the candy actually does taste like the desserts. Hope this helps.
