My husband and I have these noodles everyday. I can create easy meals with them. Love to stir fry onions, garlic, fresh tomatoes and add seasonings , taco sauce or salsa , chili powder, ginger all in water. Then maybe some meat 3.5 ozs . Can slice frozen chicken breasts in processor then stir fry till done. Just a few minutes then rinse noodles in strainer and add to stir fry when everything else is done. You have a plate full of food and most calories are from the meat. Very satisfying. My husband has lost over 40-50 lbs and I have lost over 30 lbs. This is one addition to the rest of our lives. We can make this meal in less time then going for fast food. And even better make double portions for lunch the next day.
