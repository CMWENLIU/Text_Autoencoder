Wow! 20+ bucks more in just the last month per case.<br /><br />A 45% increase in 1 month for a simple vegetarian food staple!<br /><br />This is becoming a bit insane.<br /><br />Previous Update (2/2011): My last shipment of Rediburger confirms that the quality has resumed at the factory. The product tastes great (like it used to), and is much less mushy. I can now treat it as a solid product when making sandwiches, instead of it falling into squishy blobs. One suggestion: when the producer errs and produces an inferior product that is receiving many complaints from loyal consumers, the producer has an obligation to rectify the problem, demonstrate a bit of contrition, and perhaps send a credit to the consumers to ensure product loyalty. In this case the Kellogg representative blamed Amazon for improper storage of the product, and shirked any responsibility for a very inferior product. Not cool.
