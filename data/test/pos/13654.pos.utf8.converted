Although I've been a vegetarian and even vegan at times in my life, currently I'm not.  I was so happy to find this great price on Bob's Red Mill TVP.  It's less than half of what I'd pay at my local grocery store--and only one of the stores in my area regularly even carries it.<br /><br />If you worry about both health and price, TVP is a great addition to your diet. I use it in conjunction with ground beef.  I rehydrate it using beef stock, and then add it to my ground beef.  If you're new to TVP, I'd start with rehydrating 1/4 to 1/2 cup and adding it to one pound of beef.  You can go up to a 50/50 blend--and most people will not be able to tell the difference, especially in things like chili and meatballs.  My kids and husband have no idea. :)<br /><br />If you buy the 80/20 ground beef--by mixing it with no-fat, high protein, high fiber TVP, you will halve the fat you eat per serving.  Because it doubles the amount of beef you get, you can also use this as a way to buy free-range or lower fat meat for your family.  Although $4 or $5/pound is a lot for many families--by cutting it with TVP, your true cost is $2-$2.50.  Much more affordable.<br /><br />I really recommend giving it a try. You can buy one cup at the bulk foods section of many health food stores to give it a try. Definitely hydrate it with beef stock for added flavor.  If your family likes it, then buy it on Amazon.  Good luck!
