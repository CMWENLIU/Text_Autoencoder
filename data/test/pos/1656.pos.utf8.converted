I usually don't do reviews but this item is a real treat.<br />You can usually find shirataki noodles at any korean/chinese supermart.<br />And when you open it, it does have fishy smell, just rinse a few times it goes right away.<br />Next, what i do; I boil my noodles in sauce of my like, the great thing about them is they take on<br />any flavor your put them in.  I boil them and let them sit for about 30min or more, because I like them<br />to absorb all the flavor and soften.  Which they do very well when boiling over 30min.<br />They are great for HCG dieters which I currently am on.<br />A lil trick I just learned was after I boil about 2 to 3 bags I put them away and eat as needed.<br />So I would take a piece of my allowed HCG diet food IE 3.5 oz meat or veggie or both.<br />Take Pam and cut up a few pieces of onion and pan fry the noodles, onion and meat or veggies.  YUMM!!<br />A complete meal cal count of 8cal to 95cal and you feel full.  Can't beat that.  Good Luck! :)
