Trehalose is a tasty sugar substitute (tastes like a powdered version of Marshmallow Peeps) made from 2 joined glucose molecules.<br />I've been consuming the Trehalose I purchased over the past few weeks without suffering any ill effect or any signs of indigestion.<br />I ordered another 5 jars of Swanson's Trehalose just this week.<br />I am still playing around a bit with cooking techniques to master the best properties of Trehalose while minimizing the slight reduction in sweetness.  Trehalose can convert into a glass phase (think hard candy) just like sugar with much less caramelization (it tends to be clear like glass rather than browning like sugar).<br /><br />It is only about 45% as sweet as regular sugar, but has some very interesting cooking and preservative properties.  Plants like the Resurrection Fern can survive freezing and drying out of 97% of its water mass and still robustly return to life in the presence of water.  A very novel sweet molecular pair indeed.  Don't be mistaken in thinking that Trehalose is a "fake sugar" because humans can digest it back into 2 glucose molecule (the human body's energy reserve molecule) in the lower intestine for energy with the enzyme Trehalase, but at a much slower rate which does not cause rapid blood sugar spikes like High Fructose Corn Syrup does.<br /><br />Only recently have some wonderful scientific manufacturing companies have been able to mass produce Trehalose in large quantities for sale.<br />I expect it won't be too long in the near future when Trehalose is as inexpensive as sugar, but that will only happen when larger demand levels allow a price reduction as an economy of scaling up the production.<br />I invite you all out there to take a taste of this wonderful sweet human-safe alternative to sugar.<br /><br />(Addition on April 18th, 2011 to my January 16, 2010 Amazon review)<br /><br />Okay.  It's been over a year and I have some new stuff to add.  Still a great product, additional suggestions on usage for baking and consumption.  A teaspoon-full of the standard granulated Trehalose (what you get when you purchase this product) added into baking batter acts a bit like baking soda in that baked goods will be a bit softer and rise higher, yet also slightly enhances the normal flavors of the baked goods.  For better food usage, you can put dry Trehalose into an empty blender (not adding liquids and filling above the blending blades) dry blend-grinding granulated Trehalose to a superfine powder for 2 minutes.  This increases the surface area, reduces some of the "powdered marshmallow" flavor, and increases absorption for other uses.  The best dietary cellular absorption I've found is by adding powdered Trehalose to melted chocolate candy squares (to your preferred taste of course).  I suspect that Trehalose is incorporated easiest into human cells by natural semi-solid fat oil-suspension over watery suspension.  Superfine powdered Trehalose does not substitute for confectioners sugar when dusting baked goods.<br /><br />As for other uses, I've added powdered Trehalose to liquid soap for an energizing showering experience which leaves the skin feeling young and the powdered Trehalose is absorbed better when added to skin moisturizers.  Again, no negative side-effects or any "sticky residue" as would occur with sugar or other sugar substitutes.  I have not done very much home-testing on the value of Trehalose as an additive for plant food yet (it should help I'd think given nature's usage in the Resurrection Fern and in cold-surviving & desert-surviving creatures).
