I tried this mix for the first time today and the pancakes were SO good! They have a nice texture and delicious flavor. The nutritional value is great. They have 5 g of fiber per serving as well as 6+ grams of protein depending on how you prepare them. I will purchase these again. This is just another wonderful product from Bob's. I am a huge fan of their products.
