I have a six year old Golden Retriever with an extremely delicate digestive system.  Recently she bled internally after chewing a rawhide.  Needless to say, once I calmed my guilt, I had to find a healthy alternatve because she loved to chew on cheweeze rawhides as a treat.  (My Vet told me rawhides can be extremely dangerous for some dogs.)<br /><br />I knew she liked sweet potato, so when I discovered Sam's Yams, I figured, why not give them a try?  The result, she absolutely loves them!!!  I have to keep reordering 3 bags at a time because she barks at the cabinet we keep them in until I give her another.<br /><br />Sam's Yams is such a wonderful and healthy alternative to rawhide.  It is also a low fat treat, which is wonderful for breeds that have a tendency to put weight on.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about this product.  My dog loves them, my Vet approves and that makes me a very happy owner.<br /><br />They are sliced in different sizes for small, medium and large dogs.  If your dogs love to chew, why not give them a try?
