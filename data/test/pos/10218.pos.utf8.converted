I have not been able to eat pre-packaged jerky in a long time due to my severe migraines and the fact that nitrates and MSG triggers them. When I saw this jerky I had to try it. I was very glad that I did. It had a great flavor and was tender. My only complaint is that I couldn't put the 4oz bag down, so I think that I'll try the 1oz bags next since I obviously have no self control when it comes to this jerky! I also am back to try some of the other flavors but I did love this flavor.
