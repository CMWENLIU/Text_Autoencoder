RiceSelect Organic Texmati has become the rice of choice in this house, and is consumed nearly every day. Wonderfully consistent texture, rich, nutty flavor, and it fluffs nicely. The packaging is convenient (and non-BPA).<br /><br />To the 1-star reviewers, claiming that this product is GMO, 30 seconds of research would have shown you that it is NOT.<br /><br />"...all RiceSelect products are produced from our non-GMO proprietary seed and is grown by our farmers under strict supervision in the United States. This complete control through the production process allows us to ensure that our products will not be co-mingled with other varieties that may have GMO traits."<br /><br />I love this this rice. Would recommend it to anyone who likes brown rice!
