I first stumbled across the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YBNKC2">GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Turkey Stick + Crunch, 3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> at an overpriced airport store.  I dutifully shelled out six bucks for this rescue from a delayed flight; I loved it.  Since then, I have been sampling each flavor that interests me.<br /><br />This box is the front runner so far.  As much as I loved the turkey stick box, this one feels more like a meal.  Maybe it's the process of stacking a cracker and pepperoni slice with a smear of cheese. Sure, the pepperoni is greasy, buy hey!  It's pepperoni.  At under 300 calories, you would be hard pressed to find a treat this satisfying to compare. I definitely like this better than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YBNJQ4">GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Steak Nuggets + Cheese, 3.-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  I just placed my next GoPicnic order; I'm looking forward to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YBP6Q0">GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Hummus + Crackers, 4.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.
