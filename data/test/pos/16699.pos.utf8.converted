Caramel Apple Pops is simply the best candy ever created. The flavor is both sweet and tart and the flat shape makes each piece of candy truly unique. I buy these pops year-round. The only problem is that if you order them online- shipping is very expensive.<br />* These will melt (it has caramel on the outside), make sure if you are having them shipped that they pack the box according to the weather as most good shippers will do anyways.
