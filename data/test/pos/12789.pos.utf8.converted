I love this GF flour for cookies, pancakes, pizza dough and pie crust. It produces results that are INDISTINGUISHABLE from regular flour, to my extremely-GF-product-leery husband. My son has celiac disease, which usually requires me to make separate cookies, separate pancakes, etc. But at this bulk price, I can just use this flour for the whole family.
