I got hooked on these thing while living in Switzerland. They are not you're average chocolate covered cherries. These wonderful little pieces of decadence have what I call "three stages." First is this dark chocolate that isn't too rich, but has just the right mix of sweet and bitter that melts on your tongue as you bite down. Then there's the first impact of the Kirsch (cherry liquor, only better). And finally, the chocolate, cherry and Kirsch all mix into this wonderful burst of flavor. If you haven't tried them, you've missed something special!
