This stuff is like maple crack!  I just can't get enough!  Unlike regular Grade A maple syrup this had a x10 flavor boost as well as being thicker and richer!  Haven't you ever wished maple syrup had the thicker consistency of the corn syrup maple flavored junk at the stores?  Well this does but with a delicious maple flavor that is stronger and tastier than your grade A maple.  I wish they carried grade b in the stores.  Thanks amazon for carrying grade b maple syrup!  I just love it.  If I'm ever brave enough I may even try grade C!
