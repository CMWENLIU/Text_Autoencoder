Since wheat was about the only grain on my menu, I decided to try some new ones. For pasta, Kamut is my favorite. Whole wheat is great for bread but does not work well in pasta. Kamut pasta is great. Don't be put off by the darker color. The flavor is very mild and it tastes better than semolina pasta. Also, the texture works well for any dish. My kids like this pasta plain with a little Smart Balance and sea salt on it. Once cooked, I like to saute this pasta with some vegetables and olive oil. I've also thrown this pasta into soups and chilis. The elbow shape works well and this pasta doesn't expand too much and get soggy.
