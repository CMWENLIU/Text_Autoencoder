So glad I tried this.  Thanks to the first 2 reviewers, I had confidence and am not disappointed.  Product is firm, not mealy and more nutritious then processed wheat.  I wasn't able to have spaghetti for the longest time.  Addendum 12/4/09: you do have to pay attention while cooking this; this pasta is not forgiving in being over-cooked; I have found that adding olive oil to the water before adding pasta helps to lessen sticking, although cooking shows may dispute that this works for regular pasta.  I am still buying this product.
