If you can get one at the store first, obviously try it before ordering a 16 pack.<br /><br />This is the plain Jocalat bar and I can say I am hooked.<br /><br />We gave up processed sugar and are going the organic route on everything. And this is perfect for a chocolate fix. It's great because there is no added sugar (or sugar substitute) unless you count figs.<br /><br />If you are addicted to the fat (butter) and sugar of the majority of candy bars, this is different.<br /><br />Tastes what I remember a brownie to be like except less sweet.<br />When you get off sugar, your tastebuds change. It's worth it though. Some other people, if they are referring to this actual flavor, probably are thinking it isn't sweet enough.<br /><br />Did not care at all for the orange flavored one. Haven't tried the mint. Coffee/hot variety goes against what I'm doing health wise. I'm alright with pure chocolate though. I think this is as good as it gets.<br /><br />------<br />UPDATE: Haven't eaten these in a long time. I am finding I do better with soaked nuts. I also prefer to eat as close to 100% organic as I can.
