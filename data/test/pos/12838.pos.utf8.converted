As a daily user of Agave Nectar I was going through the smaller bottles very quickly. Since I was not ready to opt up to the gallon size this was great second step. The larger bottles are great for cooking/recipes and can be used to refill a smaller bottle for table use.  The agave nectr itself was DELICIOUS! I would highly recommend this product and will be buying it again in the future.
