I work at a nutrition shop that sells protein bars/protein and other supplements, and i got to say...This is the BEST protein bar i EVER tasted in my whole life. This does not taste anything like all the other protein bar which has this milky paste over it. Price is ok but taste? just WOW!!! here are the nutrition fact for the product, Calories 210, Calories from fat 115, total fat 13g, saturated fat, 5g, cholesterol 0, sodium 80mg, potassium 195mg, total carbohydrate 10g, dietary fiber 1g, protein 13g!! I hope this review was very helpful :) have a great day and enjoy the bar if you plan to get some!!
