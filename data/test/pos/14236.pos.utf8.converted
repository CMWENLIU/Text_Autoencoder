My cats have been eating Innova EVO, another grain-free food, for a while.  I've noticed a great improvement in their general health but I was never really happy about the fact that their binder is potato.  Nature's Variety now makes Raw Instinct, which uses tapioca as a binder instead.  The kibble is square with some rough edges, which is an interesting shape.  The manufacturer applies a freeze-dried meat and pre-/probiotic mixture to the kibble before it goes in the bag.  My cats dig right in, and although most of their diet consists of wet and raw food, I like to feed them a tiny bit of dry to add some crunch and texture to their food.  This is a great food if you want high-quality meat proteins and no grains in your cat's diet.
