This was my first sampling of the varieties of sea salt out there.  I didn't really expect there to be much difference between the products (other than the color of  the salts), but I was *so* wrong.  Here's a rundown of each salt's characteristics:<br /><br />New Zealand Salt -- tasted the most like table salt, but it was SO strong!  You definitely won't need as much of this salt as with regular table salt.  Probably less than half as much to give your food the same amount of saltiness that you're used to.<br /><br />Alderwood Smoked Salt -- like regular salt, but with a smoky barbecue-ey flavor.  Even food cooked indoors tastes like you grilled it over an alderwood fire.<br /><br />Alaea Hawaiian Salt -- the most mild of the three, with a slight "ocean-ey" flavor and aroma.  I think this would be the perfect salt for seafood.<br /><br />After trying these three salts, I realize that the different sea salts really do taste different.  I now want to try them all!
