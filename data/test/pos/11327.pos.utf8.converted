Awesome quick fix for curry craving.  Instant laksa curry is hard to find, let alone this is more of a restaurant brand, not a typical store-brand that you can find in Asian market for curry mixes. I've searched high & low in Northern-Cal to no avail, jumping with joy that Amazon carries it now,<br /><br />Follow the instructions, and add some seafood of your choice, fried tofu, sprouts, rice noodle, and whatnot, then you will have a satisfying treat.  Give it a try, a good chance you would like it if you dig creamy broth, and South Asian food.<br /><br />Oh, don't forget to add finely minced Vietnamese mint if you can get some, or even Thai basil. For fresh herbs enhance the flavor; eat like the locals.  5 big, enthusiastic stars!
