Needing to lose a few pounds, I was looking for an alternative to my usual potato chips and pretzels.  Also, I wanted to reduce my daily salt intake.<br /><br />I learned about Wasa crispbread from a favorable Consumer Reports review. So, I decided to give 'em a try. The texture and "mouth feel" is like eating a hard cracker. But unlike other brands of hard crackers, the Wasa "sourdough" crispbread actually has some flavor and decent taste, with just a hint of salt. I like the slight tang of the "sourdough" rye crispbread; which is my favorite.  Taste vary - but I like and recommend the Wasa "sourdough" crispbread.<br /><br />Package Nutrition Info (per serving):<br /><br />Calories = 35<br /><br />Total Fat = 0g<br /><br />Cholesterol = 0mg<br /><br />Sodium = 45mg<br /><br />Total Carbohydrate = 9g<br /><br />Dietary Fiber = 2g<br /><br />Sugars = 0g<br /><br />Protein = 1g
