When I went to purchase the rosewater, a salesperson suggested I try the orange blossom water, too. Said it was very good for digestive issues.  One day I did have a tummy ache so I tried it in tea, and it did work wonders for me! Mind you, a little bit goes a very long way. Orange blossom water also works well in orange juice and I like to put a little bit in my bathwater or in a spray bottle to use as perfume.
