Love this stuff! I was on semivastin(not sure on the spelling but its prescription cholesterol medicine) and I was unhappy with the side effects. After listening to oodles of advice from family, I did some research and found this stuff. My cholesterol had been 234 all my adult life and 150 on medication. Stopped the meds and took this for 6 months with no healthy modifications to my diet. I eat chicken skin prime rib fat, you name it if it's greasy I eat it. Even so I never went over 184 when taking the Beta Sisterol, which is good, even my doctor said he liked the score. A year later still steady at 184. It seems great for cholesterol and good for the prostate too. Very very pleased!
