Compared to the price of fresh milk per quart where I live, I'm saving money using dry milk. Other dry milks I tried were OK on cereal or in bread machine recipes, but were nasty to drink. Saco is the first I actually can drink and enjoy! Highly recommended and I will continue to order this brand as long as it is available.
