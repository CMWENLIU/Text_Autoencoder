This bread mix is very good. The bread is a little chewy, but has a good flavor. I have to use the manual cycle and bake it in the oven in two pans, as my bread machine has only a 1-1/2 lb. capacity. The first time I used it, the bread rose so high it popped the top off and didn't finish baking. So if  you don't have a 2 lb. machine, you'll have to bake it in the oven.
