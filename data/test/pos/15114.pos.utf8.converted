I purchased this along with a 45lb bucket of Hard White Winter Wheat, and a 25lb bag of Great River Organic Milling's Soft White Wheat. Using my Victorio's grain mill to grind the wheat into a fine flour has produced some of the best bread we've ever baked, or eaten, hands down. To give it a decent shelf life, and to keep it safe from weevils or grain moths, I've packed it in a 6-gallon food-grade plastic storage bucket with a mylar liner, and a dessicant packet inside. This price is great for organic hard red wheat. We're beginning to experiment with cooking our breads in the Global Sun Oven (also purchased here at Amazon), for those times when the power might not be available in an blackout or an storm-driven outage. Since my grain grinder is a hand-grinding model, power outages won't be a problem in baking daily breads.
