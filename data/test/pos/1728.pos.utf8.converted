I've yet to run into a product where, after sampling, I'm asked to go buy more for the office multiple months later. Add to that the boderline health benefits that come from the dark chocolate and fuit filling, and you have the best of both worlds. The tartness of the fruit begins to overpower much of the flavor later, so you can't have more than a small handful, but they're so rich, you won't want to anyway.
