First time I brewed it, I measure the amount of tea by guessing from the way I measure green tea. The result was way too strong tea that stained the inside of my white cup. After a bit of experiment, I ended up with microscopic amount of tea per cup. If I could measure it on my scale, it'll be like less than 0.1gram. Compare to this, I use 0.5 gram of green tea per 8oz cup. I think this one pound box will last for years to come.<br />The taste is nothing fancy but what a good tea is supposed to taste like, then again I'm not a gourmet drinker, otherwise I'll be reviewing something else with higher price. It's good enough for me for every day use.<br />The tea in the dry state looks like round pellet, which is easier to control the amount when you scoop up.<br />I'd recommend this to anyone specially who hasn't tried loose tea in a while. I also recommend Finum brewing basket to go with this. Little things that make your life a bit more enjoyable.
