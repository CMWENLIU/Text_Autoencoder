I actually tried Vplenish in a Subway when I was on vacation in Washington.  I was so impressed.  I was excited that Subway was really promoting a healthy lifestyle.  My kids and wife took the vitamins no problem and having no taste, they wanted more.  It was great!  I had buy a box to keep at home.
