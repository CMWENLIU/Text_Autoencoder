When I saw this product I was elated.  With the desire to add more fiber to my diet and not being excited about some of the products on the market these seemed ideal.  Swallowing pills is unpleasant, mixing and drinking is not ideal to me and seems messy so the idea of just eating something in gummy form appealed to me right away.  These fiber gummies are WONDERFUL! I only wish every supplement I ever choose to take would or could come in this form.  No worries about chalky texture, bitter after taste if you don't swallow them right away and they begin to dissolve on your tongue and above all they aren't the horse pill size of some supplements on the market.  I will be purchasing this product from now on.
