I've been using this product for quite a while now.  I order it online because, unfortunately, it isn't available for me to purchase locally.  It makes a really rich stock.  It's easy to use just the right amount to make what you need.  It's a thick paste so it's easy to measure.  It's a little difficult to get off the spoon, so measure it with one you can stir in the hot/boiling water with to get off all the paste.<br /><br />This is by far the best boullion/stock product I've ever used.  It tastes better than the dry cubes, dry powders and canned/packaged stock products.  There is less fat swimming on the top of your mixture than with the canned products as well.  It tastes as close to homemade stock as I've ever seen in a packaged product.  I've also used the beef as well and it is an equally good product.  It also does not taste as salty as the other products.
