Hello!<br /><br />This is the best chocolate powder!  The flavor makes it worth every penny. I used it in smoothies, baking, any place where the recipe calls for chocolate powder.  It is more expensive than other powders, but it is also vegan and raw.Vegan is appreciated because I like honoring a business that honors life and raw is supposed to be better for me.  Unsure about that, BUT, they very clearly take care that their powder is comprised of the best product and it shows in the flavor.<br /><br />Oh - if you add this to a smoothie - you should plan on adding some sweetener.<br /><br />Thanks!
