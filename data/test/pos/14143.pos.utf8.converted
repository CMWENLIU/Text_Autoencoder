I prefer the red quinoa to the more common variety (white? brown? beige? golden?), or you can mix them for an interesting color combination.  If you use no more than half of the other quinoa, the taste is almost the same.  It's really easy to cook quinoa in the rice cooker:  1-1/2 cups of quinoa to 2 cups of liquid (water, chicken broth, etc.); add a little salt if you like and v&oacute;ila!  A delicious breakfast or a side dish for dinner.<br /><br />You can get the more common color to mix when you cook: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDG3UE">Bob's Red Mill Organic Whole Grain Quinoa, 26-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>; Eden Organic Quinoa, 16-Ounce Package (Pack of 5); Arrowhead Mills Quinoa, 14-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6); <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKUTLE">Ancient Harvest Organic Quinoa, Traditional, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5IF8E">Melissa's Quinoa South American, 8-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>
