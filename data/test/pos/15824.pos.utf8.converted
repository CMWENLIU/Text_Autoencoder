Ribena is great, whether made from the concentra or bought in a lunchbox size carton. My mum always told me it was rubbishy sugar water, and I'm sure diet-wise it's not the best. But the taste is amazing, and I often pour myself a tumbler instead of a glass of wine in the evenings. A warning to fellow Ribena lovers, at some stage I bought a diet, or reduced sugar, or 'lite' version of Ribena (the exact branding escapes me now), and it tasted terrible. Watered-down and reduced flavour was what it was. Yucko, stay away. But the real stuff, bring it on!
