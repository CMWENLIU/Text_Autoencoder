Last time I had powdered eggs was in the Army several decades ago....Well, I ordered these to put in my emergency food supply thinking they'd be better than nothing in an emergency. I tried them out as soon as them came in and I was amazed at how good they are! I love eggs, scrambled, over easy, poached, soft boiled, etc. I cook them carefully because I'm particular about their flavor and texture - no overcooked rubbery scrambled eggs for me. I followed the direction precisely, making enough for about 2 eggs (4 parts powder and 6 parts water). I cooked them gently, took them off the fire just before done and let them finish in the pan. They were very moist and full of flavor. They are very close to 'real' eggs in texture and flavor. I was very pleasantly surprised and pleased with them.<br /><br />I am especially pleased that they require so little water to re-constitute. I think the 2 eggs took about 3 tablespoons of water! That would be ideal in a survival situation, as my goal is to have my emergency foods require no water to prepare.<br /><br />I don't know if it is only this brand that is so good, so I'll check out some other brands and update this review.<br /><br />The only drawback is the price. At $9, they are about 6 times more expensive than eggs. But, if you're sitting in a pile of rubble that used to be your house, the cost wouldn't be very important....<br /><br />-Mike
