I have been using Simply Organic's Vanilla Extract for several years now.  I find it to be perfect for my needs.  This is about 2/3 the price that I pay for the vanilla locally.<br /><br />I suppose that I could go into the aroma and all that good stuff; however, I'm going for boring in this review.<br /><br />The only thing that would make this better is if Amazon offered this extract up on their Subscribe and Save service.
