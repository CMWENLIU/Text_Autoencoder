I got these for a pirate themed baby shower I was hosting based on the other reviews here.  I was very impressed with the company selling these, they arrived in perfect condition, not a single one even slightly melted or warped.  On top of that, the chocolate is actually decent, not that awful waxy chocolate you find in some gold coins.  On the front side the coin says "Fort Knox Gold Coins" on the back the coin says "E Pluribus Unum 1878" with a picture of a lady.
