I am vegan and use this a lot more than I ought to. You can add a bit to just about any vegan dish (other than desert... ew) to give it the extra "YUM!" factor. I don't think it really tastes like chicken (as far as I remember) but it is yummy anyway. I made green bean supreme with lots of tomatoes and garlic and added a bit of this and my omnivore friends begged me for the recipe (recipe link in comments).<br /><br />As for the price: please do not buy it from here. The price is insane! Iherb has it for 4.27 right now. If you haven't bought from iherb before my reward code HUM176 can save you 5 bucks off your first purchase. Shipping is free if you spend 20 bucks so it's a great deal. You can stock up like I did.
