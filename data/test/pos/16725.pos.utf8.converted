This is a great granola food.  Nice and pleasant, with that great apple touch.  There is the hint of blueberry as well.<br /><br />I tried this straight out of the bag like a dry snack, very convenient.  I haven't tried it as a hot cereal or cold cereal but I'm sure it'll be nice either way as well.
