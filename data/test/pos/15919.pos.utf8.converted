<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NY3A8C">Knorr All Purpose Aromat Seasoning 3oz./85g</a><br />This seasoning can be found in just about every home in Switzerland and probably most other European homes but for some reason Americans don't know about it. It is one of the most versatile seasonings ever and I cant imagine cooking without it. Its a MUST for veggies, pasta, eggs, soups, salads and sauces. I wish some importer would see the opportunity it this product and market it to the whole country.
