Having had a cat since 1986 (two cats in a row), I have tried everything out there.  A friend recommended this to me about 2 yrs ago and it is hte best litter, hands down.  I pay 8.99 regular price at Publix or $7.99 on sale.  I never see coupo buy in th paper offered by the vendor.  But, I am willing to pay the higher price.  Amazon's price is ridiculous.  Wish I could buy it in bulk.  But 8.99 for a full month is fine, too.  I change the box, and my air filter every month when I pay by mortgage.  This way , I never forget either.  Whether you buy the Pearls or the Micro is a matter of your cats' preference, as both work equally as well.
