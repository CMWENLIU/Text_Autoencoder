My cat loves Tiki cat, and the flavours in the variety pack are her top favourites. I try to give these to her 1 out of every 4 meals since cats are not supposed to eat a lot of fish.<br /><br />Though I first ordered this from Amazon, I now order it from National Pet Pharmacy as it is listed for $10 there, and with their promo codes and if you're willing to buy in bulk, you can get get a discount on the shipping cost and a great deal for this overall.
