My wife and I ran out of cumin. Where we used to live, grocery stores had bulk aisles where you could buy lots of cumin for not lots of money. Here, the same amount sets you back close to the cost of a meal at a nice restaurant. Obviously, a solution was needed.<br /><br />I searched around and found two pounds of cumin on sale from Frontier. Prime shipping, no tax, why not? I clicked "order" and didn't think about it until I got home from a business trip and noticed two massive bags sitting on the kitchen table. I'm not sure exactly how much I thought I was buying, but two pounds of cumin is a lot. I'm pretty sure I won't need to be needing to buy cumin for the next two to three years. In fact, I might be able to sell some to my local grocer and supply them for the next two to three years as well.<br /><br />That said, the quality is fantastic. Lightly toasted and put through the spice grinder, and there is a noticeable improvement over generic supermarket cumin. The price and quality are both fantastic.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good way to go if you need some cumin - especially if you need a lot of cumin. Share some with your mother, grandmother, aunts, uncles, neighborhood watch society - whoever... you'll have plenty. But even if you keep it all for yourself, you'll be glad you ordered.
