i have tried every non-hydrogenated peanut butter from homemade and trader joes and MOM to amish markets, skippy natural and every other natural brand sold at every grocery store i've ever been to! as far as taste goes, this is delicious; like eating fresh roasted peanuts. only 3 grams of sugar, even though both sugar and molassas are listed as ingredients. only 75 mg of sodium!!!!  i couldn't believe it. an exceptional choice for anyone watching salt! 190 calories per 2 TBSP serving...fantastic! the only downfall is the palm oil added (though prefaced on the label as "containing 2% or less of the following"), which i assume is to prevent separation--thus no stirring, which is another bonus.  while i wonder about the shelf life, i loved that "no preservatives" is listed as well as "no refrigeration necessary". hands down, this is the best peanut butter i've ever tasted, as well as the only one i'll ever buy again! now if i could just find it in crunchy too...
