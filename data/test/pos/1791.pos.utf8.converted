HP is like Marmite; you either LOVE it, or you HATE it (I hate Marmite).<br /><br />I'm a huge HP fan, but if you stock up on the glass bottles, you'll end up paying a fortune, plus you can never get the last drops out of the damn bottle.<br /><br />So, this huge jug of HP sauce is the best thing ever. The only thing I hate about it, is getting the sauce out of it, it also looks pretty weird sitting on the table next to the poor ketchup bottle. The bottle REALLY needs a pump, but I haven't been able to find one that fits the it yet.<br /><br />FWIW: this HP sauce is now made by Heinz in the Netherlands, when Heinz purchased HP from Dannon, they shut down the UK factory and moved it abroad. Thankfully this hasn't impacted the flavor one bit.<br /><br />If you like HP sauce, you have absolutely no excuse for not buying this.
