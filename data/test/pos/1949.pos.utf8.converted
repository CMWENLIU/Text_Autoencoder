I have enjoyed herbal teas for many years.  Several years ago my wife and I started to entertain groups in our home.  At the first session I decided to offer the guests some tea.  Many of the guests liked my tea, so at subsequent meetings I always put on a pot of tea.<br /><br />I offered numerous different teas to my guests until someone gave me a box of Celestial Seasons Black Cherry Berry.  Guests raved about this tea.  Some of my guests drink it hot, other prefer it cold, but everyone likes it.  After some months of constant praise for this tea, I decided to make this my tea of choice when entertaining.  Now when I entertain I make several  pots of Black Cherry Berry and everyone is happy.<br /><br />Black Cherry Berry has a simple mildly sweet taste.  Black Cherry Berry is caffeine  free and has zero calories, and no sodium or sugar.  The tea has all natural ingredients: such as hibiscus, rosehips, roasted chicory, blackberry leaves, hawthorn, natural black cherry natural flavors.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tea for entertaining guests.
