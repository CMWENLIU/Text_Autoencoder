After living in India, Southeast Asia, Central America and a native of California - I've seriously become addicted to coconut water.  Hydration, Nutrition, Refreshment and Taste.<br /><br />Hydration and Nutrition - working as a dive instructor in the Gulf of Thailand, often times travelers would show up in not so fresh of a state from the night before. My go-to was always to make them drink coconut water. Natural electrolytes!<br /><br />Refreshment and Taste - not only is this stuff good for you, it tastes awesome. Feels like water and tastes like fresh sweetness but without that gross syrupy fake flavor.<br /><br />With so many brands out there trying to sell me the magic water in the bottle, it's hard to figure out which company is the real deal. I like ZICO for one main reason:<br /><br />- 100% natural COCONUT WATER.  That's it. Some other brands out there are actually "coconut juice" and contain sugar, preservatives and even stuff like sodium metabisulfite...huh? I have a bottle from another company and it's been in my fridge for like weeks.<br /><br />ZICO's ingredient: 100% coconut water. :) Nice job ZICO.<br /><br />And I like the packaging.  The blue with beach picture reminds me of far off places while sitting in my office.
