If you've ever had as Bahlsen Hit cookies (normally a plain cookie with chocolate filling) you'll know these have to be good.  A creamy center that can easily be eaten separatly by nibbling off the cookie top and bottom.  A dry cookie that isn't too sweet but full of flavor.<br /><br />Great for a mid-day snack.  I always have a roll in my desk draw at work.<br /><br />Very Very Tasty!
