Set bread maker to 'rapid'. Heat 1 cup milk, then add 3 egg whites and 1 egg. Add 1 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast, 3 tblspns maple syrup and 1/4 cup oil. Mix and put in breadmaker. Add 1 1/2 cups tapioca flour and 1 cup garbanzo flour. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon xantham gum over top then press 'start'. Use a spatula to scrape down sides and bottom of breadmix as it is mixing. Ensure mixture is moist enough to flatten out within 20 seconds (if it stays in a ball shape, it will turn out too dry).<br />This has made THE fluffiest, tastiest homemade bread I have tried (and I've tried LOTS!). Don't use potato flour. Sorghum flour makes it taste yucky. Rice flour takes away the fluffiness.
