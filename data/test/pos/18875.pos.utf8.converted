This is one of my best buys you can find for the money. If your studying Japanese and you would like to learn more about the culture this the one for you. The candy in this product is nothing like the kind we have hear in america. The Pocky Sticks are great I would recommend ordering there pocky sticks bundle as well. Man I love this stuff. The had some gum that tastes like milk and strawberry very great.<br /><br />Please buy this package the high chew candy is off the chain You will be coming back for more I'm sure of it.
