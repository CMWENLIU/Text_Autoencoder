Our three-month-old son has GERD and we were in dire straits trying to find a solution. The doctor tried several medications but it really didn't matter because he'd spit them up every time. She gave us a sample of this formula to try and voila! Our son still struggles with his reflux but he's not the vomit factory he once was. Bonus - he sleeps 12 hours straight at night now (don't hate me).<br /><br />We are converts. Our daughter was a Similac baby but Enfamil A.R. saved our sanity and our son's health.
