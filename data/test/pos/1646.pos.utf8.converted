When I suffered from a low milk supply with my 3rd child I tried many formulas until I found this one. My baby refused all others. This one is the closest tasting to breast milk, has the best ingredients, and spit up is no where near as foul as with other formulas.<br /><br />It can cause a bit of constipation, so I recommend talking with your ped about it. Mine recommended giving my baby 2oz of prune juice 2x a day. (And he was a Preemie) It does bubble up a LOT if you shake it up when mixing. Use a spoon instead, or add 2-3 drops of gas drops into the bottle. (Wal-Mart sells the generic form of Mylicon for around $4 and you get double the amount, instead of $12)<br /><br /> I have had another child since I first found this formula and I would use nothing else! Oh, and remember to save the UPC codes to mail in...you get 1 can free for every 12 you buy!
