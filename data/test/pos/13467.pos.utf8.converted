It may seem like a lot of muffin cups to buy at once, but these are absolutely the best ones to use.  Not only are they one small step in saving the environment, but they work better than regular ones.  Muffins come out so much more easily.  I like the look of the little brown boxes.  Some of mine will be used for small gifts for family and friends.  I live in a remote area now and don't have access to stores that carry specialty items like these so I have to buy in quantity from the internet.  I was so happy to find them available at Amazon.
