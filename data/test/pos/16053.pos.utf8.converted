I have no problem with this bread and am sure it could meet a lot of people's tastes and needs. Rice based breads have their problems though -- dry, crumbly, GF taste and texture. Definitely give this a try but my recommendation is Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Homemade Wonderful Bread Mix. Read my review there. Power to the garbanzo bean!!!
