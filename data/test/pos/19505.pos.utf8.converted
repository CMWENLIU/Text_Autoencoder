Members of my family think that tuna is raw chunks of fish served with ginger and soy sauce. They are mistaken. This is tuna. Packed in water, completely cooked and just a bit salty. My favorite ways to eat it are in casseroles or mixed with mayo on a sandwich with a dill pickle, slice of cheese and some sprouts.<br />Since it keeps for a very long time, we usually keep some on hand for quick meals and snacks.
