Ordered this trying to find an organic/natural beef jerky that isn't sweet and loaded with sugar. Really like the taste. Ingredients on our batch are completely different than listed on Amazon: beef, sea salt, celery powder, sugar, garlic powder, spices. Also nutrition facts are different-- lists &lt;1g sugar on package. Best organic jerky we've tried.  Good flavor, just right chewiness.
