Finally, a really tasty bar thats all natural and does not have soy or artificial stuff in it plus it's high in fiber! I am always looking for a bar to carry in my bag when I'm out in the field and just need something to keep me going but I don't want something I feel guilty about eating. No bar can replace a good healthy meal but sometimes you just need something to hold you over. The battle is always coming across bars that taste awful, have the texture of wall plaster or have artificial sweetener and flavorings, soy or too much sugar etc. but here is one I feel good about eating. It has a moist but firm texture and tastes mostly of cocoa with a bit of cinnamon with a very satisfying texture of whole oats, nuts and raisins but is not too sweet. I like these bars far better then any other brand I've tried. They taste like something I would make myself. I can't wait to try the other flavors but I would buy the oatmeal raisin again for sure. I really like this product and it doesn't put me in a sugar crash. THANKS EAT.THINK Smile, great product!<br /><br />All bars are a bit of a trade off depending on your personal needs.
