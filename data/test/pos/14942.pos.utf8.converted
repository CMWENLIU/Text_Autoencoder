I have had numerous allergies ( seasonal, and environmental )for years. I have been on three different medications, year round,  at the same time for these allergies. Now, I take 1/2 teaspoon of honey in the am and half teaspoon at night and I don't need any of my allergy medication. ( Zyrtec, Nasonex and Mucinex) During the fall pollen/mold time, I might need my Zyrtec and Nasonex for a few weeks, but then I can stop. It is excellent honey and worth the money. It also quickly cured my son's cold sores.
