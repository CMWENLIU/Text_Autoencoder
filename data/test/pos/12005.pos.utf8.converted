I've never run across a Timothy coffee - I use decaf - that has failed to satisy me, and this is no exception.  Plenty of body and a nice hazlenut flavor - I mix it with French or other dark roasts to get the strength I like, and I really don't mind decaf at all now since I've switched to premium brands such as this.
