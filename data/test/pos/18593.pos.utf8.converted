Magnesium is vitally important on many levels.  It not only helps your muscles to relax, but also aids sleep and allows for a more calm & balanced state of mind. Low levels of this mineral make nearly every disease worse, whether you are dealing with asthma, diabetes, depression or cardiovascular disease. It  assists in the assimulation of calcium & potassium, so those with osteoporosis concerns should be looking to include Magnesium in their supplements.<br /><br />I have been using Magnesium Calm for the past year and have found it very helpful for relaxing muscle tension, & getting a good nights sleep, not to mention its calming effect on my state of mind ! Its easy to take and comes in several flavors as well. I recommend it to many of my massage clients, so they can decrease the pain and discomfort in their bodies.
