I have lost considerable amount of weight with the Medifast system; however, their bars taste like cardboard to me.  These Thinkthin bars have a much more natural taste.  It both looks and tastes like something found in nature.  You can see the peanuts and dried fruit in them.  The Thinkthin bar even has less sugar than the medifast bars that I have paid double the price for.  Also, they taste better than Clif bars too.  And I continue to lose weight with the Thinkthin bar substitution.<br /><br />I like this product and now have purchased them a second time.
