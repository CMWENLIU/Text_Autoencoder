I love these!  They're the closest thing I've found to actual Thai food in an instant form.  The sauce is a little spicy, which I like a lot.  One caution, though: put the noodles, water, sauce etc. in a bowl instead of making them in the carton.  I made it in the carton the first time and they tasted like the cardboard container with Thai flavor.  Made in a bowl, they're awsome.<br /><br />Also, I've noticed a couple of people saying that the noodles aren't soft enough.  Be sure to let them sit, as that's when they soak up much of the liquid.
