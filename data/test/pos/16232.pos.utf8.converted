I love having something in my desk that I can just dig into at lunch without even having to go stand in line for the microwave in the breakroom. But finding something really satisfying and tasty, and for under $3, is amazing! I've always loved Bumblee Bee tuna anyway, and their tuna salad mix is fantastic. The peaches and cookie both taste great, and the whole thing makes for a really satisfying lunch...and perfect for at work.
