To be honest, the thing that made me want to try this was the bottle. It has De Cecco "stamped" in the glass on both sides. Simple but very effective.<br />Those Italians, they never cease to amaze me!<br />When it comes to the oil: perfect for cooking.<br />Except for when I do Asian cooking, I always use olive oil. This one is perfect for the job. It has a nice balanced taste giving the food the needed twist without overpowering everything else. And when in need you can of course also use it for salads. It's that good.<br />Highly recommended!!!!!
