We all know that too much sugar, or fructose, is bad for you. And that includes agave, which is concentrated fructose. However, I like the taste of agave, especially as compared to other sugar substitutes, and I can use less of it than sugar (see below). It has a lower glycemic index (meaning the body metabolizes it slower reducing the risk of an insulin spike), and it is natural rather than chemically engineered like high fructose corn syrup. The key to all sugars is moderation. Unfortunately, almost all baked or processed foods that we buy are loaded with sugars, especially high fructose corn syrup. At least by baking my own foods I can have more control over my family's sugar consumption and I am happy to have found agave so that when I do occasionally bake sweets, at least I can use less of it.<br /><br />Raw organic blue agave is not chemically processed as some have indicated. It is the pure juice from the blue agave plant. The juice is extracted by stripping the leaves of the plant, then chopping up the bulbous base of the plant which is heated to no more than 118
