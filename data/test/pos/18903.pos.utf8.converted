I bought this for a road trip across the crountry and back. My dogs are raw fed and this seemed the closest to what I made at home. We spent 15 days on the road and our four dogs enjoyed every meal the entire trip. They ate the food with gusto and had totally normal poops the entire trip. I used ziploc bags to fix a meal ahead (they eat twice daily) and stored the soaking food in our ice chest. Now I use this food for weekend trips and have some stashed in our disaster kit.
