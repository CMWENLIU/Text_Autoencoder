My holy Grail-like search for brown rice noodles is over!  For several years (since I've been on Weight Watchers) I have been looking for a brown rice noodle. I very much look forward to making pad Thai as well as Singapore noodles with this fantastic new product, as well as Vietnamese fresh spring rolls. Because these last two are generally made with rice stick noodles, I'm hoping w can look forward to Star Anise offering a brown rice stick in the future. Great job filling a long-wanting niche, guys!
