Since we discovered Traverse Bay  Michigan dried cherries several years ago, we have continually bought and enjoyed them.  They are not available in the area of the country where we live and we were glad to discover them on Amazon.  The tart cherries are dried and processed with a bit of oil to help prevent them from drying out.  They are excellent in everything from cereal to salads and can be used in place of dried cranberries to give foods a sweet/tart tasted.
