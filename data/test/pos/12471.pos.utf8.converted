Among all of Twinings' breakfast teas, this has become my latest standard. Steeping for only three or four minutes produces a deep, full-bodied liquor, which I find to be a bit richer than English Breakfast (which is still a fairly stout tea unto itself). As it's such a strong tea, Irish Breakfast holds up very well to milk and sugar.<br /><br />If you're looking for a lighter morning tea, Twinings Ceylon Breakfast is very nice.
