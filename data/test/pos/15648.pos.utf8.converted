I buy Hemp Pro 70 because it has the highest concentration of hemp protein that I've been able to find in any of the hemp protein powders. I use it primarily in smoothies. It does not alter the flavor of the smoothie at all, as far as I can tell. Nominally, it's a relatively expensive product but when compared to others, in real economic terms for the amount of protein per ounce it's a decent price. Everything is expensive nowadays. If you're into being healthy though you know that what you put into your body is not the place to cut corners on spending. After all, "we are what we eat".
