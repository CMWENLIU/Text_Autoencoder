My favorite flavor of Snapple. The reason you know its good is because I am allergic to peaches in their natural form-AS A FRUIT - and they kind of disgust me. TEH DRINK, on the other hand, I am in love with. Does it even taste like peach?? probably, but I'll never know. It's very yummy, and does taste like its made "FROM THE EBST STUFF ON EARTH!" I'm sure if you are looking at this ad, you know what I'm talking about haha.
