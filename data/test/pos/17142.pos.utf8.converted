This manuka honey is the same one sold at Whole Foods and my local organic stores.<br />"Kiwi Kosher Pareve" is the Kashrut grading in New Zealand, not a brand, as mentioned by another reviewer.<br />If you click the picture, you can clearly see "Kiwi Kosher Pareve" printed on the bottle on the left side.<br />I googled "Comvita bio active" just out of curiosity, and found same results elsewhere.<br />iHerb website offered some insight into the brand name confusion, which states "Please Note: This brand is no longer listed as Comvita, it is now New Zealand Honey ( HNZ ). Thanks."<br />Comvita company now uses a different measure of manuka honey's antibacterial property in UMF (Unique Manuka Factor).<br />Regardless, this manuka honey is of excellent quality and taste.
