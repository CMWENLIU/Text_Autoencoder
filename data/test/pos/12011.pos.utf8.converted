This makes an amazingly delicious red curry! I add 1 packet of paste, 2 cans coconut milk (the real stuff, with the fat), 2 Tablespoons fish sauce, 3 chicken breast, 1 red pepper, 1 can of pineapple, 1 small can of bamboo shoots, and 1/4 cup sugar. Chop and simmer it all for about 30 minutes, and serve over rice. It has just the right amount of heat, and tastes like something you would get from an authentic Thai restaurant. Of course, you can use whatever veggies you have on hand, these are just my favorites. I make a large pot, and freeze it in individual containers for a super-fast meal. Taste of Thai Red Curry Paste, I don't know what I would do without you!! (Actually I do, and my Thai take-out bills would be outrageous!)
