My local grocery store carries 2 types of sunmaid jumbo raisins - 1. mixed and 2. only red jumbo raisins. After studying the ingredients, I bought the mixed one since the only red one has some oil added. Recently my local grocery shop ran out of the mixed jumbo raisin and I am glad to find them on Amazon.<br /><br />I like these raisins so much I plan to send them as a gift to my folks in India.
