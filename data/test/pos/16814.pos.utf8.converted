Until I started drinking this tea, I had not had a "normal, natural" period in years.  I had to induce my period with Rx drugs about every three months or so.  Since I started the tea in October 2010 (5-6 months now), I have had THREE natural periods, and have not had to induce even once.  That is amazing!  I also have a general increase in energy since I started drinking it, and have reduced my coffee intake to just one cup daily because of it.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I don't love the taste... it tastes a bit like a celery tonic to me... however, I am slowly acquiring the taste and even if I wasn't I would still drink it for the health benefits, which are truly amazing.
