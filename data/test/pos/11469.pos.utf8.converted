I have used MaMade as the basis for my home made Marmalade ever since I discovered it in the UK years ago. Thick cut (my preference)is harder to find than the thin cut. The way I use MaMade eliminates the difference anyway. I buy 2 large Navel Oranges, 4 large Lemons, and 1 Pink Grapefruit. I then use a paring knife to remove the outer skin of this fresh fruit and chop it all into small pieces. I then extract all the juice I can from this fruit and usually it is more than the 425ml called for in the MaMade recipe. I then boil the skin pieces in the about 500ml of combined juice to soften them up then add sugar to raise the boiling temperature to speed up the cooking process. After about 30 minutes of boiling I add the Mamade and rest of the 4lb of sugar. Because there is too much liquid in the mix to allow the marmalade to set without hours of boiling I add Pectin to the mix. MaMade already has Pectin in its ingredients but not enough if one adds more than 425ml of water. The added juice and pieces makes this the best marmalade you have ever tasted, plus you get more than 6lb of marmalade promised on the can.
