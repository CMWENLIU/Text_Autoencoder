First, my dog gobbled it down just like it was canned food. It was pleasant for a human to work with. Super easy-just add water. High quality human grade ingredients. Tasted it myself.Felt like I was really giving her something healthy and alive instead of uniform baked brown kibble. Very versatile because it can stand on it's own, or you can mix it with their kibble. You can even add in your own touches if you want such as goat cheese, yogurt, extra fruits and veggies or raw meat, but it is complete and balanced as is. I'm hoping to clear up some skin and coat issues that just occured after 5 years of doing fine on Eagle Pack dry kibble. I'm willing to give live a food a shot and have often though of feeding raw but didn't know enough about dog nutrition to ward off doing more damage than good. With this food, I feel confident that she's getting the benefits of raw, with the convenience of instant oatmeal! Did research on the company. Very good clean facility, small family owned. I'll update in a month to see the progress we've made on this food. As far as cost, I was already paying $57 for 33lb dry kibble form Eagle Pack so This is actually a bit more cost effective because the 10 lb box makes 40lbs reconstituted. Eventually, I may switch to a different formula and add in my own fresh meat, but for now, it's a great way to get your feet wet in the raw food category without too much effort or knowledge.
