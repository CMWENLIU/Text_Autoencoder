That's right. Just taste these Sockeye salmon. It's true I never had Sockeye Salmon before because of the price. I always bought the pink salmon (which is not bad) but the taste of the Sockeye Salmon is wonderful. So, wait for the monthly sale in grocery or if you can't try them you won't be disappointed . Taste, Taste, Taste Retired Early
