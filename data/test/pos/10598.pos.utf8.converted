I have a 4 year old Boston Terrier/Jack Russell mix and a 2 year old Boxer/American Bulldog mix who had been eating Purina Beneful (Healthy Radiance) since I have owned them. I noticed the younger dog was emitting a nasty odor through his coat and the older dog was itching all over.<br /><br />After doing some research I found this food highly recommended online. The difference in the foods is the ingredients. This food contains REAL meat and by-products. Though I was skeptical because it was more expensive, it was well worth it. Both dogs gobble it up and they smell normal with no skin irritation.<br /><br />I recommend giving it a try and see the results!
