Love this product for my daughter who has a terrible sweet tooth and is borderline diabetic. Everyone who tries it likes it as well. Even my hubby is almost sold, and he is a die-hard white sugar lover!<br /><br />First heard about product from my raw sister who is a purist when it comes to her diet. She doesn't bother too much with processed foods, and I am striving to be like her. Bless you Seshatms!<br /><br />Product is a little sweet for me as I gave up sugar and honey long, long ago in my drinks. But it is excellent for cooking ... just don't use to much as it is very, very sweet.<br /><br />For those still holding on to sugar and honey, it is a great way to get rid of those cravings.
