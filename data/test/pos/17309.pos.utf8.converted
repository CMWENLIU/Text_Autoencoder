I was very pleased with the product. The fruit was well ripened and semi-dried to provide a delicious alternative to sugary snacks. My emphasis and reason for buying the product was to give my family the nutrient value of the fruit at a time when fresh fruit was difficult to come by or at least very expensive. This product allowed me to accomplish that goal with its wide variety of seedless and pited, well preserved fruit. A tasty and cheifly beneficial treat for the bleakness of winter. Thank you and God bless you! >&lt;>
