This is my favorite Nong Shim to date. It not only tastes great but also has about half the sodium content of the others (40% vs. >90% for whole package). It's not healthy per se, but is probably a lot better for you. The dried veggies seem more substantial than the mere onion flakes in the other packs; this one has carrots, some tofu-like pieces, and green things. The sauce is also more savory than salty which is a good change of pace. Just be warned that it's korean style chajang noodles with a dark sauce. The sauce is a bit difficult to mix evenly and tends to clump up, so sprinkle it evenly on the noodles when you mix rather than just dumping it all on one spot.
