I found this stuff in our local market a few years ago. Recently they quit carrying it. So<br />I turned to the internet and found it on Amazon. This is a blend of the traditional Lawrys<br />seasoning with a couple of twists. First, traditional Lawrys is very fine and easy to over<br />apply to your food. This product is course and is an excellent compliement to steak, burgers,<br />chops, chicken and even veggies! The second thing that I like about this product is it contains<br />cracked pepper. So I have an all purpose seasoning in one container.
