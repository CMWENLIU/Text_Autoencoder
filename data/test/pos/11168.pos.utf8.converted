Went looking for an alternative to coffee and Postum a year ago. At that time I was delighted to discover the Teeccino products. We also use the Java, Maya Caffe, and Mocha flavors. Husband was a die-hard coffee addict but for health reasons needed to cut back on caffeine; I liked coffee-flavored Postum, but it was no longer available. This 'herbal coffee' has been an excellent find for us both. Very tasty. (though the ex-coffee addict says it's NOT coffee, so don't go into this thinking it's going to BE coffee minus the caffeine! He suggests adding more chicory from a separate source to help that factor. I think it DOES taste like brewed coffee.. so there ya go!)<br /><br />I like to add a little Torani's sugar free French Vanilla, Irish Cream, or Classic (must be the 'Classic'!) Hazelnut syrup, and/or sugar free cocoa, stevia, and milk/cream; he simply prefers stevia and a little milk. A little goes a long way ~ one rounded tablespoon per small coffee maker (though husband likes to make his a little stronger using 1.5 TB).
