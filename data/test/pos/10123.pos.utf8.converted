Senseo coffee pods are frequently difficult to find in stock at our local stores and now that Amazon no longer offers subscription service, I decided to try the MELITTA Coffee pods because they fit the Phillips Senseo Coffee Maker Machine.  Guess I should stock up to avoid "out-of-stock" or "discontinued" situations again because we use our Phillips Coffee Pod Maker Machine several times every day.  That said, if the cost of these coffee pods keep rising, we just may switch to another brand of coffee pod machine or depend entirely on our automatic coffee maker for a good hot cup of java.
