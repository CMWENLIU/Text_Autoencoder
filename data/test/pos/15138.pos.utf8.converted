Thought I'd give this tea a try since it had such good reviews. I'm not a big fan of hot tea, but this has a strong spearmint taste which is enjoyable. I have been very pleased with the results - much less pain overall and definitely less joint pain after drinking this tea. I make it double strength - 2 tea bags in 8 oz of water and drink it quickly.<br /><br />Great price for this on subscribe and save!
