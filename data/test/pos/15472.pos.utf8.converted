I love this nectar and wish Amazon would quit raising the price!  Seems like every time I go back to purchase more the pack is a few dollars more.  This is some of the best agave I have tasted.  Very thick and rich in flavor.  I use this primarily to make homemade chocolate syrup for my iced soy mocha's and it's just wonderful!  I also use it on hot cereal, such as Quinoa flakes or plane oatmeal.  Can't say enough about it. LOVE IT!
