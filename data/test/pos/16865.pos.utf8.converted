I don't think I have ever had such fresh celery seed before.  Most celery seed that I have bought in the grocery stores has tasted only vaguely like celery.  When I use this celery seed in my cooking, the whole house smells as if I was cooking with fresh celery stalks.  I will definitely buy this product again.
