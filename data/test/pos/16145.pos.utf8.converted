Our family makes popcorn on an almost daily basis, so paying $4.99  for a 1 1/2LB bottle of popcorn kernels feels like highway robbery. The Paragon 12 1/2 LB bag is a much better bargain (especially if you already pay for prime shipping). The kernels pop up very well, have a good fresh corn taste, and after one month- still no stale taste or increase in unpopped hulls. You may want to store the opened bag in an airtight container to keep it fresh and for ease of scooping.
