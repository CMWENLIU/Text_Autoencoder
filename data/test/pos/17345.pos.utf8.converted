We moved our cats out of state two years ago and the drive took three days. One of our cats had a panic attack every hour or so. Neither cat would eat/drink/go to the bathroom the entire day--they would wait until they after they got adjusted to the hotel at night. We moved out of state again about a month ago with our two cats. We added Bach's Herbal Rescue Remedy for pets to their water every day a week prior, during, and after our move until they got adjusted to their new home.<br /><br />The difference between our first trip two years ago and now was like night and day. They were both laid back (not comotose-which, I understand, can happen from medications) and panic attacks were significantly reduced (if not entirely absent--it really was a smooth uneventful drive). They still didn't eat/drink/go to the bathroom until they got to the hotel but they would adjust much quicker. And, whereas two years ago they took three months to fully adjust to the move, they took no more than three days to adjust to their new surroundings this time around.<br /><br />I cannot say with certainty that Bach's Rescue Remedy "caused" them to be more calm; this was not a controlled experiment, it was their second interstate move, they stayed at "Grandma and Grandpa's" house while the packing was done wheras before they witnessed all our stuff being boxed up (which might have freaked them out), etc. However, I certainly think Bach's Rescue Remedy had something to do with putting them at ease the second time around. [Note: we tried Feliway (both the spray and the plug-in product) and it didn't help calm the at all.]
