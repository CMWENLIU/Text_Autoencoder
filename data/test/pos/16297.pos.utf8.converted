These sandwich cookies have a shortbread-like exterior and plenty of sweet-tart lemon filling.  They've been my favorite commercially baked cookie for years.<br /><br />Dare is a Canadian company and also makes chocolate, cocoanut, maple and perhaps other flavors of sandwich cookies, and they're all excellent.
