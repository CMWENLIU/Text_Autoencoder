I got in on the cookies a few weeks ago from Bahlsen that had the chocolate filling. They are wonderful cookies and at less than $1 a pack you cannot go wrong. These things were made for a quick coffee or milk dunk. Don't let them soak as the light cookie will fall apart, but a quick dip sets them up just fine!  They come well packed and wrapped. Recommended highly!
