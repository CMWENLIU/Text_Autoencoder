I've recently begun eating a lot of rice.  My favorite is Black Japonnica rice cooked for 50 minutes.  The best !<br /><br />However, for those meals when you run out of rice or when you're on the road and have access to a microwave, this is a wonderful option !  It is sticky rice for sure but it is really good.  I really like the nutty flavor of this black rice. One container served with any of the TastyBite Indian meals(also microwaveable) and you are set for a yummy, filling feast !
