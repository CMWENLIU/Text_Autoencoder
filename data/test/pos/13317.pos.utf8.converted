I would say the flavor is at first reminiscent of steak sauce..that's what it reminded me of anyway. So the flavor of this sauce could be better. But the heat from the Jolokia peppers really shines through. Mad Dog 357 Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce honestly brings the heat and the pain so i would recommend it be used sparingly. The heat from just a taste of this sauce actually builds up and becomes hotter than the initial burn so prepare for it, but if you like it hot like me then i certainly recommend buying a bottle.
