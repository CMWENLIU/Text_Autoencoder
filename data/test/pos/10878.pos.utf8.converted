I have been accused of going over-board on some things and my K-Cup obsession has been no different.  I have tried almost every bold K-Cup on the market (really, my kitchen is full of those little boxes).  Many of them are very good, and some (like Timothy's Rainforest Espresso) are excellent.  Still, for day to day drinking I always go back to this blend.  I find it to be smooth and satisfying.  I use the second to smallest setting on my Keurig B70 (7 1/4 oz.) and I usually enjoy three to four cups in the morning (I never reuse a K-Cup, but if it works for some people, fine).  If I want more or a cup later in the day I switch to the decaf version, also very good.<br /><br />I miss my Newman's Own so much when I travel that I have started packing a Keurig B30 with me so I can enjoy this coffee on the road.  This one is perfect for me.
