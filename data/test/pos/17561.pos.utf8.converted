I have had a huge problem with moles in my yard and had no clue how I was going to get rid of them. I hated the thought of putting out poisons so I purchased this trap just to see if it would work. I have never used a mole trap before but figuring it out was very easy. I already knew where the active tunnel was so I pressed down on it and inserted the trap into the ground. I lifted it up and down several times to make sure debris was out of the way of the spikes. After I set it I went in the house and about 15 minutes later I noticed it was tripped. I went out and dug and sure enough I had a mole. Talk about quick results. I can't figure out why others are having trouble with it, but my experience was good and I would recommend this product to someone wanting to get rid of moles.
