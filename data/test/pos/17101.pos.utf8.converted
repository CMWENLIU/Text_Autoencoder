One of my cats has a sensitive stomach and throws up a lot.  That went down significantly when I switched to this food.  The other cat also likes it.  It seems to be very filling, as they eat less of it than their previous food.  Buy the big bag so it's a little less expensive.  Overall, this is an excellent food, and the cats seem healthy and happy on it.
