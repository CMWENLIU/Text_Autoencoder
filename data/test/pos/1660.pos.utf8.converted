I gave these noodles a try and although they are not the tastiest they still get the job done.  I am amazed at the nutrition label.  Calories?  Zero.  Total Fat?  None.  Cholestrol?  Absolutely not.  No sugars, no protein, no guilt.  I have been trying to lose weight for quite some time with different diets and these noodles are getting the job done.  They do have a scent when open but that goes away once you rinse under cold water as the cooking instructions states.  I wouldn't recommend eating these noodles by itself.  Instead, add to a pasta sauce, a salad dressing or soup and it'll taste fine.  They absorb the sauce very well.  Perhaps the best thing about them is they make you feel full after eating just one 7oz package.
