Let me start by saying thank you to DeliDirect for shipping this basket out to our troops in Afghanistan. This basket arrived the same day riots happened over in Afghanistan and I received multiple thank you messages from our troops as this basket was actually taken into a bunker with our troops during a rocket attack. As I was told the cheeses and meats were shared by soldiers huddled together in a freezing bunker and helped immensely in the moral as they sheltered from incoming rocket fire. I also have to say I had ordered from Swiss Colony another basket alongside this one, but Swiss Colony notified me 5 days after I ordered that they canceled because they would not ship items to APO addresses, so again DeliDirect, Thank you so much for supporting our troops when another would not.<br />  Soldiers mentioned they loved the Pepperoni/ Peppered Cheese/ Grained Mustard Combination. The Havarti Cheese and Merlot were also big hits. There was one comment that said soldiers joked, "Hey if this is my last meal I am glad it's Wisconsin cheese and not that MRE Peanut butter." You guys are Awesome!
