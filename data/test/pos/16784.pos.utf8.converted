Wow!  This is a silky soft, lusciously textured tuna with a fresh-from-the-sea flavor.  Just salty enough and so good it can be eaten straight from the jar.  I've tried a bunch of other high-end tunas (bonito del norte, regular yellowfin, high-quality albacore, etc), and yellowfin ventresca (from the fatty tuna belly) is the only type that felt like it was worth every penny.  Other brands are also good, but I especially like tonnino!
