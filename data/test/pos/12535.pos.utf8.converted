I bought a case of these and have really been enjoying them!  Delicious, wholesome flavor, taste more natural than standard store-bought canned fish. Since there is no salt added, I mix anchovies with this salmon, and enjoy the combination.  I like my fish salty.  Highly recommend this brand!<br />  -------J. Lehman
