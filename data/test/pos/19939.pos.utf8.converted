We make caramel macchiatos at home and have been searching for a long time for a better alternative to the sundae syrup you can buy at the grocery store.  The syrup is very tasty & has a good consistency ... tastes a lot more like real caramel than others we've tried.  It would probably be great on ice cream sundaes too!
