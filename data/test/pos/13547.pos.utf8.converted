I carry the Vplenish packets in my purse so I can sprinkle some extra vitamins in my drinks and foods when I'm out and about. I love it because the vitamins are coated and totally taste-free, so it doesn't change the flavor of anything I add it to. I used to use Emergen-C packets, but noticed they have over 6 grams of various forms of sugars and 20 calories, while Vplenish has less than a 1/2 gram of sugar and is calorie-free. The best thing is not having to swallow a big pill, and not getting the upset stomach vitamin pills can cause. Great idea. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051HCX20">Vplenish Taste-free Vitamin Boost Powder Packets (Case of 2,000 Individual Packets)</a>
