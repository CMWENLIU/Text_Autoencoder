If the only oatmeal you've eaten is Quaker Oats, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how much better Silver Palate Thick & Rough Oatmeal is.  The texture is chewy rather than mushy, and the taste is nutty rather than bland.  I make it with milk rather than water for extra richness.  Throw in some raisins, dried cranberries, fresh fruit, walnuts, a little cinnamon sugar -- whatever you like and have on hand.  It's a delicious, nutritious and satisfying breakfast.  Be sure to follow the directions carefully if you cook it in the microwave.  You'll need a deep bowl and no higher than 50 percent power level; otherwise it will boil over.  It's not an instant breakfast by any means, but well worth the time.
