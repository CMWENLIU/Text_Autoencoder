This coconut water is much better than the Brazilian sourced coconut waters such as Zico.  The Thai sourced coconut water is sweeter and and the flavor is more interesting, but there is no added sugar like you find in a lot of coconut "juices".  I really enjoy the pulp bits, gives you a little coconut to chew on, just like a fresh coconut would.  I could see how some people wouldn't like this though, so if unsure you may want to get the pulp-free water.  The prices are great on Amazon if you get a subscription, as the 9.5 ounce bottles are $2 pretty much everywhere in NYC, so for the same price you get a lot more in these cans.  Only down side is that they are so good that you go through them really fast, we can't keep them around more than 3 days before they are all gone!  At least it's better than a diet coke addiction.
