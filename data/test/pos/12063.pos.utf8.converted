this product is the best litter I have ever tried, and I have tried them all.  there is NO SMELL at all (besides the light clean fragrance of the crystals) and no scooping up clumps of wet, urine soaked clay that never dries and constantly smells.  while yes it may be a bit more expensive than other litters, I don't have to keep refilling my litter box ever time I scoop it.  I fill it once and don't have to replace it for a whole month.  that means I end up saving loads of money.  and for someone with multiple cats in a small one bedroom apartment, saving money on pet supplies and having a clean fresh smelling home is worth its weight in gold.  did I mention there is NO SMELL?  you would never know I had cats upon entering my apartment whereas with other litters people wouldn't even be through the door when they would say "oh, you have cats, don't you?".  best litter EVER!
