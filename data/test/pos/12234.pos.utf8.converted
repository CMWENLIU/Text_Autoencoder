We are in the early stages of gluten-free living, and we've tried many gluten-free "pastas." This is by far the best. It held it's shape and the texture and mouth feel are much closer to traditional pastas than the rice varieties we've tried. There is no strong "corny" flavor. I am glad to be able to order by the case because it costs about half what we paid in a health food store.
