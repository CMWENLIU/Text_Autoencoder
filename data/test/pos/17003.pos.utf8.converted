When I ordered this product I expected a small root cutting in a makeshift shredded newspaper support packaging. Thankfully this was not true, Hirt's had an amazing treatment in plant care. My prayer plant was properly wrapped to prevent leaf damage and then filled with packing peanuts with a heat pack for shipping in winter. It was well established and actually overgrowing in it's 4" pot (could be divided into two plants)! I received my plant within a week of placing my order, which is twice to three times as fast as other plant growers. Also to this day my plant is thriving without shipping shock or any other ill effects. I will definitely order any type of house plants from Hirt's again.
