Bob's Red Mill Buckwheat Pancake mix is an excellent value.  Buckwheat pancake mix has been impossible for me to find in any grocery in five states so it was a pleasant surprise to find Bob's.  It makes excellent pancakes and is a great value.  For those who enjoy buckwheat pancakes, it is a great find.  It's especially good with eggs and bacon!
