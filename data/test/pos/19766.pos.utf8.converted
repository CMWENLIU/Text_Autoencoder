This pie crust mix is the easiest and most consistent I have used.  I love it.  I have been dealing with Celiac Disease for over 10 years.  I also live in a small rural community and can only get gluten free products with when going into Albuquerqe NM and visiting the health food store. Before my diagnosis I was a pie making queen (goddess if you will).  It was very hard to give up, but if you can't taste your wares, you loose all quality control.  I have experimented with different flours, tried different recipies and books everything.  This is the one that works the most like a typical pie crust.  This is my advice: 1) Use a hand mixer to cut in the shortening.  I don't know why it works, it wouldn't with regular flour, but it does.  2) Keep it in a ziploc bag at least over night.  The way the shortening combines with the dry ingredients overnight makes it much easier to work with.  3) Keep sweet rice flour, corn or potato starch on hand for rolling purposes, and roll it out using wax paper or foil.  I also prefer to make smaller tarts using a muffin pan just because rolling to that size is easiest and you can control serving size that way.  Good luck!
