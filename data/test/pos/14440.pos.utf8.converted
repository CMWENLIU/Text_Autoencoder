I am the only coffee drinker in my family of five.  And I am not a die hard coffee drinker at that.  For years I've been trying to coerce someone else in the family to drink coffee w/ me so that my coffee maker can be brought out of the cabinet at least occasionally.  Fortunately, my teen daughter agreed to drink coffee w/ me if I would buy this Chocolate Velvet, which we found in a local grocery store.  She loved it, and now we enjoy heating up the pot every morning.  This coffee is a medium roast with just a hint of chocolate.  Very smooth flavor.  We enjoy it w/ sugar and half 'n' half.  Well worth a try, especially if you can get a small sample bag.  Just noticed that Amazon offers this flavor in decaf, so I will be switching to that when our current bag is gone.  Probably won't be long!
