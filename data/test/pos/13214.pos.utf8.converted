I have gone through many brands of cat food for my Maine Coon mix female. She's about five years old now. I discovered this food first at a boutique type pet store... I was looking for our regular Eukanuba brand. This fancy place only had some pricey food, including Royal Canin, which I was not familiar with. I bought it anyway since I had never seen food especially for the Maine Coon breed. Well, our cat Vita loved it. She can't just scarf this food down and then throw up like she does with other food! She eats it properly and, amazingly, does not leave food in the dish. Her favorite trick is to always leave food behind and then complain that it's stale. For instance, with the Paul Newman food, she eats a few bites and then walks away. Then she comes back and camps out by her dish waiting for a few more "fresh" morsels. When I give her Iams, she gobbles her food like a little demon. Then I go to work or do some chores and voila, I find a pile of thrown-up kibble on the carpet. Of course, I try giving her small doses of kibble... boy, does this cat eat a lot. She is very healthy though and not too fat. The main point of my review is: so far Royal Canin Maine Coon 31 Formula is proving to be the right food for this big girl.<br /><br />Other important points: The price through Amazon is much better than through the pet store. The convenience of finding it online versus not knowing where the heck it might be stocked is wonderful. The most surprising thing was shipping was super fast. I ordered on Saturday night and got it Monday afternoon. How did they do that? I've never experienced such fast FREE shipping with Amazon. Also, I paid no extra sales tax. I really hope to keep this up and have the same experience. You can't beat this.
