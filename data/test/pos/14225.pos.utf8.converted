OMG-dreams really do come true.  I wished for a product that was healtful, gluten-free, easy and quick to prepare, fun to eat, and tastes amazing and found Happy Pho.  I have made it the vegetarian way each time and even my carnivorous husband loves it!  (I take all the credit, but all i really did was boil the water!)
