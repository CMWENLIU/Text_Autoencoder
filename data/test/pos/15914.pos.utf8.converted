Bought these for the guy who can never have anything hot enough. He eats fresh habaneros like apples (seeds and all!). The only pepper flakes that make him happy are Penzey's Extra Hot Red Pepper Flakes. But finally there's something hotter. Granted, habaneros have a 'fruitier' nose than the red chiles in traditional flakes. That stands true with these, making them slightly more versatile, but limiting in the authentic-italian arena. We're happy with this purchase and will be back for more. The container is one of those restaurant-style, large clear plastic shelf-containers with the red flip-top lid, not a "jar" as the title says.
