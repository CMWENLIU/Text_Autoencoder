I have 2 cats.  One is fluffy and finicky and won't eat anything but wet food and human meat.  The other one is athletic, lively and will eat only dried "crap" food.<br /><br />Well, the athletic one started having terrible eye problems (red and weepy) and she constantly scratched at them.  We tried oral Lysine, Terramycin antibiotics, and swapping out the plastic dish for ceramic.  Still she had eye problems.  So, guessing it might be a food allergy, I bought her Newman's because it doesn't have corn gluten, the primary ingredient of almost all dry cat foods. Newman's #1 and #2 ingredients are MEAT.<br /><br />She ate it immediately. Within 2 days her eye problems disappeared, so I am assuming she had developed allergies to the corn product in the dry food (and by the way, what felines eat corn in the wild?).<br /><br />But what really amazed me is that fluffy and finicky passed over her usual wet food and went right for the dry Newman's.  I just about wet my knickers!<br /><br />There you have it, 5 stars.
