Our Himalayan cat is an extremely picky eater.  To add to this she has intestinal trouble with many foods (diarrhea, vomiting).  We only feed her quality foods with no grains or fillers, and this narrows our selection down quite a bit, knocking out most grocery store brands.<br /><br />We initially tried Wellness and apparently it was too rich for her with all the additional unnecessary ingredients (squash, zucchini etc?)  Then we tried the Natural Balance DUCK and pea, and she hated the taste and texture, which was extremely mushy.  We then put her on this Venison flavor, and she absolutely loves it and the more meaty texture.  She is enthusiastic every time she eats.  She loves the dry as well.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this food to anyone, especially those who have a cat with a sensitive digestive system.  Not only is it a healthy grain free, artificial/dye free food, but it is also a limited ingredient food, meaning pets with food allergies or bowel problems are more likely to tolerate it.  And it's very reasonably priced!
