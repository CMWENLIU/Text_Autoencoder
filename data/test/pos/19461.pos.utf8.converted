Once, we walked into a Swiss Raclettestube in Zermatt. The overpowering odor of melting Raclette cheese caused one of our party to double over and have to be carried out. Sadly, no raclette for us that evening. Whimp! And Raclette in nearby Germany is served with butterkaese, a non-smelly alternative that just doesn't do it.<br /><br />Raclette is a traditional Swiss meal of cheese toasted originally by the fire and now, in a rather effete fashion in a raclette maker, a grill with a toaster underneath where you can put the cheese to melt in individual pans. The traditional things to serve with raclette are small boiled potatoes, gerkhins, and grilled sausages. These sausages, you grill on top of the raclette maker (and hence you see the attraction to the Germans. Wurst with everything.)<br /><br />This cheese is the real thing, smelly, tangy and great with potatoes or just on rye bread. It will put hair on your chest.
