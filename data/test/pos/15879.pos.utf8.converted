I am absolutely shocked that I love this coffee. I do like some flavored coffees but I also like Extra Bold strong coffee, black. And I wouldn't even call myself a huge blueberry fan. I only tried the blueberry because it was in a sampler box I bought. But the smell as it was brewing was amazing. Still I was skeptical as I took the first sip. I mean, really? Blueberry coffee? But it is delicious! Will definitely be getting more!
