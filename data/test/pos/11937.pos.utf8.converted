I am a big fan of lemon treats so I couldn't pass up trying a bag on my last trip to Whole Foods.  These are SO GOOD that I searched on Amazon for them & to my luck & surprise not only found their delicious selves, but signed up for the Subscribe & Save!  Once a month discounted deliveries. Oh yeah & Oh yum!<br /><br />I am considering trying out their other cookies.  I just can't make up my mind which to pick.  However if they contain agave, I will give them a pass...<br /><br />These Lemon Cookies contain no agave sweetener.  Just sprouted sesame seeds, dates, coconut & lemon.  All Organic & raw.  Nourishing goodness - the way food should be.<br /><br />The cookies are tiny & crisp/chewy.  You are forced to slow down when you eat them or you may end up with a tired jaw.  These need to be nibbled at.  If find you ate an entire bag it's not all bad.  The whole bag contains way less fat & calories regular cookies.
