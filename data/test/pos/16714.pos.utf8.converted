This is the best panettone I have tried. It is not dry like some I have tasted in the past. The flavor was just sweet enough. The raisins and chopped orange peel soaked in wine gave it just the right amount of sweetness. Since this is a traditional Italian Christmas bread, I gave several as gifts for Christmas and everyone loved them. If you like panettone I recommend this one highly.
