To be quite honest this product was not for me but for my bestfriend. Her father is dying of cancer and told her he wanted spagetti with this specific sauce. She is not very good on the computer so I did the research and ordering for her. We received the product quickly and her father was very happy. Especially after it was made. He was unable to eat alot but it made him happy and that is all that matters.
