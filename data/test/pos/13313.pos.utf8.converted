Buying this cereal in bulk for our family's celiac diets would be a terrific bargain, if not for one LARGE obstacle... the packaging.<br /><br />This is the second shipment in the last four days where over four cups worth of the cereal was wasted because the zip lock bags it is supposed to be secured in had leaked its contents into the shipping box. The first shipment, the seam on one of the zip lock bags had failed... spilling the contents. The second shipment, which arrived today, had one zip lock bag that was not zipped shut.<br /><br />Amazon customer service was very good about replacing the first shipment; I have not yet contacted them about the second shipping problem.<br /><br />The cereal gets 5 stars, Amazon customer service gets 5 stars, but the packaging gets ZERO stars... it definitely needs improvement.
