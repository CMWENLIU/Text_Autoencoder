These hulled sunflower seeds are lightly salted. If you crave salt, you may wish to add it. Another reviewer wanted to blame China. The package clearly reads:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: Sunflower Nuts (USA)<br />Roasted in Sunflower Oil, Sea Salt.<br /><br />The Bergin Nut Company is in St. Paul, MN<br />There is a Kosher symbol on the package.<br />Processed on shared equipment with peanuts, tree nuts, soy, milk, egg, or wheat products.
