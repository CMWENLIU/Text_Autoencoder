Nothing helps a cold more than ginger tea.  Ginger tea is good plain, or you can add some lemon juice or orange juice.  I used to go to the trouble of making my own (boiling ginger root in a glass pot [never metal, which interacts badly with ginger] for half an hour).  Well not any more. This tea has a nice strong ginger flavor and is moderately sweet.  I would actually prefer it a little less sweet [I even take coffee without sugar], but most people will probably like it just as it is. Ginger is good for colds, stomach upsets, and inflamation of any sort, including arthritic joints. A cachet of this tea would spice up a stew or curry as well if you don't have real ginger root around the next time you make one.  I have tried a number of other commercial ginger teas, but they are not gingery enough.  A great find.
