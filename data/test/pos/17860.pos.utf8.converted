I made the applesauce cake as described on the package (though I did not add the shredded apple) with cream cheese frosting, & had to go out & buy another package within 2 days to make another; I'm the only gluten-intolerant person in the house, but everybody went nuts over this cake.  It's so good I actually prefer it  without the icing, which is just about a first for me.<br /><br />I did add an additional 1/2 t or so of cinnamon, but otherwise the applesauce cake mix was perfect; the finished prodect had moist, dense texture (but not that lead brick denseness of many GF cakes), no trace of sandy texture (like many GF baked goods).  It rises beautifully, & is just all-round unbeatable.  I won a prize in a baking contest with a homemade applesauce/spice cake once, & that scratch cake (made with wheat flour) wasn't any better than this.
