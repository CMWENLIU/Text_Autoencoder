I was completely surprised when one of my customers brought this cake mix to me to use for their wedding cake, I made it and it was wonderful.  They paid $5.25 per mix, so once I realized how easy it is to use and how wonderful it is I began my search and was so excited to find it at such a good price.  I tried mixing in different ways, according to package directions and also separating the eggs and beating the whites and folding them in as the final step in preparation.  It was an effort to see how much height I could get.  Beating the whites separately did give a little more height, but all in all I determined it was not worth the extra trouble.  It is wonderful as it.  I used one mix in a 10 inch square pan, baked three layers and stacked them.  It made a very tall, nice, rich brownie-like cake.  I don't need gluten-free but am so crazy about this mix I have a case now, for my personal use.  I highly recommend it.
