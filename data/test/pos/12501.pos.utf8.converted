I absolutely love this stuff. Like another said, there is a slightly sweet taste to it. I have gotten around that with sauteed onions and garlic! Of course, I am just beginning to learn how to use the stuff.<br />The first dish I made with TVP was Minestrone. It was fabulous!<br />The next dish was Vegan Tacos. This stuff makes the best Sloppy Joes too.<br />So, if you're an omnivore playing around with the idea of turning vegan, you might want to give TVP a try. Also - Barry Farms shipped my order FAST. I will continue to shop from them.
