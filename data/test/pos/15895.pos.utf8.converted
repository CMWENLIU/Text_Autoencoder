Nutritionists recommend that you get a serving of vegetables with every meal, but how to accomplish that with a breakfast has always been a tough one for me since I don't like starchy vegetables like potatoes, and aside from cutting up a tomato, few other things go well with yogurt, egg whites, oatmeal, or any of the other stuff I like in the morning. A simple glass of V8 works perfectly. I've always loved V8 juice for that reason, but found it just a tad too salty. The low sodium version has made V8 perfect in my opinion. It has more flavor than most tomato juices, with a nice hint of celery seed. (It also makes a mean Bloody Mary!). These cans are perfect for taking with you in the car. They're not as cheap as the large 48oz bottles, but for the sake of convenience, they're well worth it.
