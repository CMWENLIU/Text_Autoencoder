I tried this tea because many of my favorite teas have Assam as a main ingredient, in particular Earl Grey.  This tea does remind me of Earl Grey in flavor and aroma, only it has a more intense flavor.  If you like cream and sugar in your tea, this is a good match because it keeps a strong tea flavor without being overpowered (as some weaker black teas are). If you prefer light bodied teas like chamomille without cream or milk, this may not appeal to you.<br /><br />I have never had Taylors of Harrogate before now, but took a chance because I prefer loose tea to tea bags.  My local stores only sell two kinds of Twinings brand of loose tea, English Breakfast and Earl Grey. I prefer more variety.  This was a good buy for the price.  Since the tea is so intense, it doesn't take much to make a good cup.  I don't drink tea every morning, so this should last me a few months.  However, this would go a long way even for daily tea drinkers.<br /><br />I also recommend a one cup coffee maker for brewing loose tea (of course you can NEVER brew coffee in it or it will be ruined for tea).  Fast, easy and never any loose tea in your cup:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQX150">Toastess TFC-326 Personal-Size 1-Cup Coffeemaker, Black</a>
