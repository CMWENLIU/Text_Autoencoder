My breeder recommended this food and I'm so glad we have stayed with it.  My puppy is 16 weeks old and has been on this food since she was weaned.  I have been feeding it to her and she has put on 1/2 a pound in the last 5 weeks on it (she is a chihuahua and was 1 1/2 lbs when I took her home and at the vet's office today she weighed a hefty 2 pounds).  I love that the first ingredients are a good source of protein and that there is a mixture of fruits and veggies for her too.  It's a little more expensive, but totally worth it.
