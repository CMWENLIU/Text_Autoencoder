I have used this product for five years now for both of my shelties. They like the taste, there coats are much smoother and it has lessened the number of seizures my female gets and there severity. I will continue to use the fish and sweet potato food regardless of price.<br />Update:<br />On Thanksgiving day of 2010 my female sheltie passed away. This broke my heart, she was my best buddy. I can't help but think her Whitefish and Sweet Potato food had something to do with giving her a very long healthy life. She lived to be 17, and was playful up to the end. My vet agrees that this food and good exercise was instrumental in extending both my shelties lives. I now have a new sheltie puppy and a rescued 6yr old sheltie female. Needless to say they are both on Wellness brand Whitefish and Sweet Potato food. There snacks have always been Blue Dog Bakery products supplemented with fresh baby carrots.
