The Pomi tomatoes are a fine product, and worth the extra expense.  Their taste and texture are far superior to those of canned tomatoes, and frankly, most fresh tomatoes most of the year.<br /><br />My complaint is that the Pomi cartons were sloppily and loosely packed, and thus vulnerable to damage during shipping.  They were packed more as common household goods rather than food.  If the shipping box had been more banged up than it was, one or more of the Pomi cartons could have been ruptured.  This is an easy problem to fix; I hope Amazon takes note of it, and takes steps to prevent its happening again.
