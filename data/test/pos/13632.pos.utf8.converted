I love Eden Organic products - I will not buy any other canned product AT ALL. I recommend that anyone interested buy them at amazons price - you won't find a better one. There isn't much one can say about red beans. But I can tell you that this is a high quality product that you can feel good (and safe) about eating and feeding to your family. If we start buying more of these products, we will see a greater variety offered, lower prices and maybe other (not safe) brands will take notice and follow Eden's practices when it comes to canning their food safely. Eden is the only one on the market that can truly claim to be safe. Even other organic brand canned foods are tainted by their poisonous cans. You're wasting your money there. Go Eden and you can sleep soundly at night.
