I changed cat foods after one of my cats had a bout of chronic diarrhea that was not going away. This food has no dyes in it and he's tolerated this food much better than anything else we've tried so far. In just one month we noticed our cats have such nice shiny, soft coats! They also love the taste and we can't keep enough of it in the house!
