Okay, first a few disclaimers...<br /><br />This CAN be a little different to work with, so don't expect the typical, (gorgeous) glutenous, stretchy feel that happens with wheat crusts... (sigh.)<br />It's GONNA be messy... but don't let that stop you. This crust is delicious, and totally worth it.<br /><br />Here's what I do.<br /><br />I follow the directions on the package, with a few substitutions.<br />First, for more flavor punch, I warm some veggie broth in place of the warm water that is called for. I add the yeast right to this, (taking care that it isn't hotter than 105 degrees F, or it will kill the yeast.) I even throw in a smidge of sugar to nudge the yeast along.<br /><br />Then I mix in the dry indredients, which is basically, the mix. To that, I add a bit of flaxseed meal (You may also use flaxseed meal as a substitute for eggs, as it describes on the pkg.- with tasty results. I find that the flaxseed gives the mix a nice texture, so I will often add a bit in addition to eggs when I am not cooking for my vegan friends.)<br /><br />Don't forget the Xantham Gum! This helps out with the texture... helps to give back some of that lovely "glutenous" feel... Amazon has good prices, so snoop around... don't recommend baking without Xantham or Guar gum. Per another reviewer's suggestion, I tried 1/4 tsp. xantham gum for each 16 oz. pkg. I found that advice to be spot on, and I am so glad I decided to try it! Recommended!<br /><br />Then, I add finely chopped, fresh rosemary leaves from the garden... and I do mean, finely... nobody wants chunk of tree in their pizza.<br />This just elevates the crust, almost gives it a focaccia feel. Yummy.<br /><br />Then, after the pan is greased- one review suggested Crisco, and I think I want to try that next- I sprinkle a course grind of kosher or boutique salt-judiciously- on the pan.<br />See, I went to a wonderful gluten free bakery in Washington State- wish I could remember the name of the place, or I would totally give them the credit- did exactly that... finely chopped rosemary, with the lovely crunch of salty goodness on the bottom of the crust as it was baking.<br />Incredible. You MUST try it!!!!!<br /><br />Like others have stated, I do not roll the crust out. I follow the directions on the pkg, which say to use wet hands (mine were more just damp, so that they didn't get sticky) to smooth the crust into the shape I wanted...<br />Then, I poke my fork around to within an inch of the edge... this helps the perimeter to stay puffier then the center, and helps keep the toppings from sliding off the pizza.<br /><br />As others have said, pre- baking is absolutely essential for gluten free crusts. I should try Alton Brown's trick of brushing the edges with a little egg, see if that helps brown up the edges a little more. So many fun things yet to try!<br /><br />Finally, I think that even though this crust is gluten free, and there are definite differences between GF and "regular" baking... I think what Gramma said still holds... "If the dough is too wet, add more flour..." (I always have a stockpile of extra GF flours on hand, just in case... )<br /><br />If I stumble on any other ideas, I will update promptly.<br /><br />This mix is a great addition to my kitchen, it's quick and easy, and tastes great.. (A bunch of us gals went away for a weekend, and I made pizza- first time- using this mix, and everyone was delighted... a double batched scarfed down quicker than I would have thought possible!)Gluten free success!
