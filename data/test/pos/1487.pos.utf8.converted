I bought the Tassimo (Bosch machine) for the darker Starbucks coffees available on it. But I've gone and tried many of the European and other brands available as well.<br /><br />The only brand that stands up to Starbucks for my personal taste test is Carte Noire. This is a little funny, because Carte Noire is a supermarket brand in France. (Kraft markets both Starbucks and Carte Noire in grocery channels, and they developed the Tassimo system.) To my taste, it's full-flavored without being overly bitter.<br /><br />This Carte Noire Kenya is one of my favorites. It's in between the espresso discs and Starbucks coffee discs. It is bolder/darker and more intense than the strong coffees like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WDCAJ2">Starbucks Verona</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WD93EW">Starbucks Kitamu</a>; but less bitter than straight espresso. The volume produced is in between as well--it underfills a coffee cup, but overflows an espresso cup. Finally, the Kenya is programmed in the Tassimo to add the "crema," the dark foam on top of an espresso, on a short cup of coffee.<br /><br />If you have Tassimo, and if you like the darker Starbucks blends on it, and you want to check out one of the European brands--this is the one to try.
