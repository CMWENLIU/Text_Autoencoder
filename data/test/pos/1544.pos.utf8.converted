These have so far been the best option for our corgi although no replacement for brushing teeth, our vet never seems to be able to notice :]<br /><br />They are nicely textured and my dog really seems to love the way they taste.<br /><br />I'm a little perturbed by the poor ratings on these treats. Like most things some common knowledge on your pet makes you a better pet owner. The reason these things have the texture is that so your dogs are encouraged to chew them.<br /><br />If your dog cannot eat food without gulping it then everything can become a choking hazard.<br />And while I do understand the concern of concerned owners, I do not think that these are any more prone to choking than say - rawhide or a dog toy.<br /><br />Please supervise accordingly.
