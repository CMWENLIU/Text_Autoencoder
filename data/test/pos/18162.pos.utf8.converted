I like strolling the aisles of my local warehouse store because you never know what you might find. For example, last week I found some delicious dried cherries by Kirkland Signature in the snacks isle. I've always thought the KS brand was of the highest quality, so I snapped up a bag in an instant. They're a somewhat tart Montmorency Cherry, and they're excellent. They're nice and chewy and have a wonderful taste. I use them as deserts, pack them with lunches and take them along on camping trips. Plus, they're easy to store so there's good quality fruit around even during times when a trip to the local grocery store isn't possible. Excellent product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
