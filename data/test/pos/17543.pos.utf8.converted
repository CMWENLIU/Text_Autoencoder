This olive oil is so good I use it for everything... cooking eggs, making popcorn, making salad dressing.  I even use a TBS on a baked potato instead of butter or margarine... it's that good.  I use it for everthing except frying and that is only because of the expense.  It is a bit expensive but so worth it.  I've been using this oil for a couple years now and would not consider using anything else.  Try it... it will not dissapoint!!
