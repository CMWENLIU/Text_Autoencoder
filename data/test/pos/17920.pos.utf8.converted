First I tried Diamond's almond milk in vanilla and unsweetened and sweetened chocolate flavors. The vanila is fine if you like almonds, I'm not wild about them. The unsweetened chocolate was undrinkable for me, and the chocolate was OK.<br /><br />Then I found the Pacific hazelnut, in plain and chocolate. I love hazelnuts. The plain in good, and the chocolate is terrific for a non-dairy milk.<br /><br />Unfortunately the three grocery stores I go to regularly don't have the hazelnut in either plain or chocolate so I am baffled where I got it. Now I will buy it from Amazon. I like that Amazon has the 8 oz. size, which I didn't know about.
