BE CAREFULL!<br /><br />How much you pay for this will depend greatly on how you order it from amazon...  the way I ordered it was for a four pack that qualified for free shipping.  Otherwise, you're better off trying to find this locally.<br /><br />I used to have gloppy "instant" oatmeal for breakfast.  Not anymore!  I make this THE NIGHT BEFORE with a four to one ratio of oats to water, bringing the water to a boil and adding the oats, along with some cinnnamon and vanilla.  It takes five minutes.  I let this sit overnight, and when I get up in the morning I add a little milk and have the best damn breakfast you can imagine.  The cinnamon and vanilla allow me to use splenda instead of sugar for sweetener, and I have a healthy breakfast!  I eat this five or six times a week!  I can't recommend it highly enough!  Make sure you order the four pack that qualifies for free shipping!  Guys will find many, many uses for the tin that the oats come in!  Swanky!
