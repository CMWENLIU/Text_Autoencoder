My cat has a problem with chicken in cat food. There are many premium brands of cat food that contain chicken in some way: chicken meal, chicken meat,chicken liver etc. and my cat cannot have any of that. She gets very, very sick. With Tiki variety packs, there is NO chicken in any form in the ingrediant list. She just goes crazy whenever I put it in her bowl! It doesn't matter which flavor I choose, she just loves it! I highly recomend it to any cat owner who has a cat that is choosy about what he/she eats due to food allergies or who wants something better for their cats than Friskies or Purina or other grocery store brands that are on the market.
