Mmmmm ... very delicious!  I could only find this flavour at Target, which sells it for $3.79 so, if you use this often, Amazon is the way to go.  Making it with low-fat milk makes it taste infinitely better than with water.  POSTSCRIPT: Oh dear!  I just read the ingredients list and this product contains 'Partially Hydrogenated Coconut Oil', which IS trans fat.  I have informed Amazon that its Product Features had erroneously listed this as having 'No trans fat'.  Well, I suppose I've just enjoyed my last cup ...
