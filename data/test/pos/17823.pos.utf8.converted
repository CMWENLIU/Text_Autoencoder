I use this oat bran every single day. Some days I use it in smoothies as an extra fiber source, and on cold days I cook it up with some maple syrup and frozen berries. This is the far best that you can buy. I tried everything, and this is what I ended up with.<br /><br />The oats it makes are soft and creamy. The smoothie isnt gritty or chewy. Its just a perfectly ground blend.
