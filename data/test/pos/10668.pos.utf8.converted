Everyone in my family loves cheese and we especially love French and Spanish cheeses.  We recently received this cheese assortment as a gift and we really loved all of them.<p>Our favorite cheese in this group was definitely the Manchego.  It was decadently rich and creamy and the flavor transported me back to the days when I was a student, hitchhiking my way across Europe.<p>Neither my wife nor I had ever had the Mahon Reserva, but we really liked it.  It's sharp and tangy, so we ate it in much smaller portions than the Manchego.  We had never had the Idiazabal, either, and I have to say this smoky cheese has become one of our family's favorite, rivaling even the Manchego.  It's perfect for cooler weather or to nibble on with an apple, a loaf of crusty bread and a glass of full-bodied Rioja.<p>The Murcia al Vino was divine.  This is a special cheese and one that we love sharing with friends.  All of the cheeses in this Spanish Cheese Assortment make a wonderful gift for yourself or for the cheese lovers in your life.
