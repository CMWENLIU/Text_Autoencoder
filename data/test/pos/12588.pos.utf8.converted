I heard about dragon fruit from an exotic fruits book that I found at the library, and up until that point I had never heard of them before.  I started searching the internet to see if I could find some, and after a lot of research I found a few companies that offered them.  The prices varied dramatically and 9GreenBox was the cheepest by far, however their description showed a larger plant than others I had seen offered.  I contacted the seller and asked a few more questions and then I decided to make a purchase.  It came the size that they said it would and in a very healthy state.  I was so impressed with 9GreenBox that I have since made a second purchase from them for a dwarf pomegranate tree which has come and is doing great.  I have only great things to say about 9GreenBox and I look forward to ordering from them again in the future!
