Like other reviewers have mentioned, I fell in love with this hot sauce while traveling in Belize. It really is found on nearly every table - similar to ketchup here in the US.<br /><br />The description says the red habanero is the hottest pepper known to man. This isn't true - at least not anymore. If you are looking for a sauce that will make you cry, you should look elsewhere. The original hot flavor is spicy, but isn't too much hotter than your mainstream brands like Tabasco or Cholula. The carrot base makes for a different (better) taste than any other sauce I've tried.<br /><br />It is rare to find it stocked in store shelves in the US, but it can be found at some specialty food stores.
