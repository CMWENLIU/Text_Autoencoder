I did a review for the Tofu Shirataki Noodles Angel Hair shape and so this will seem repetitive if you read that review.  For those who have read my other review, the only difference is the noodles are wider and seem as if it has a harder texture; but in actuality it just appears that way because the noodles are wider.<br /><br />The first time I heard about Shirataki noodles was years ago and I decided I would try it. I went to Fiesta and got the Tofu Shirataki Noodle both the pasta and the fettuccine shape. Shirataki are made from Konjac yams and the added tofu gives it a harder texture. The noodles without tofu added is 0 calories. The first time I ever made Shirataki Noodles I cooked it like regular pasta (the spaghetti shaped) and it turned into a gel--this was years ago. I learned that was the worst mistake to make and changed how I made these noodles. The next time I made it correctly and tried to eat it with pasta sauce. That didn't work for me, since the flavors did not merry and I was accustomed to the hard texture of pasta. When I tried the Fettuccine Shaped Shirataki the first thing that came to my mind was Lo Mein.  When I made the Fettucini Shaped Noodles with Soy Sauce, some ginger, and stir fry veggies, I realized that these noodles are better with asian style recipes.<br /><br />Always remember to rinse this product first.  To me this noodle has no flavor, it takes on the flavor of what you cook it with.  Be sure not to overcook it and you will be fine.  I personally do not cook it longer than 3 minutes.<br /><br />Update:<br />I did some more research on Shirataki noodles in order to expand my ideas with recipes.  I found that the reason that my shirataki noodles may have turned into mush was because it expired.  It seems Shirataki noodles is still good for a year and even after it is still edible however it would turn to mush if cooked too long.  These noodles also apparently shrink and become thinner, something it seems some people like.  I went to the store where I used to get my Tofu Shirataki noodles, and looked for an expiration date.  Lo and behold, it was expired by over a year.  I even saw some in the store expired by over 2 years.  It seems that non expired shirataki noodles will become alot more chewy if cooked too long.  My mom used it in stir fry, and I have also tried it baked which is also a great idea.  I have been lazy and just use any boullion cube with the noodles and that works fine...I just let it sit in the seasoning for a few hours to take the flavor of the soup.<br /><br />An additional update:  I found out that the government allows a company to list a product as 0 calories if it has 4 or less calories.  On the bag it will say 0 calories for half a bag.  The entire bag could be anywhere from 8 calories or less.  I researched this after seeing a pickle at 0 calories for 2/3 a pickle and seeing an entire pickle for 5 calories.
