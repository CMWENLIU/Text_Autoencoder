When I was growing up my German-French mother would tell me stories about how, when she was a little girl and suffered all winter from bronchitis, her French grandmother would take cherry stems, boil them all day long, and make a syrup out of them.  She would give this to my mother and it helped her bronchitis.<br /><br />Over the years I have heard how awesome cherry juice is for many things.  Since I am allergic to almost all medications, I have to find holistic ways to stay healthy.<br /><br />The tart cherry juice helps not only with arthritis but other things too.  My body feels so much better when I use it every day.
