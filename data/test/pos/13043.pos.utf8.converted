As a 100-year-old vinegar, this is a wonderful addition to your gourmet pantry.  I drizzle it on chunks of Parmigiano-Reggiano, berries, Cheetos, walnuts, and other high-class foods.  I also have a hardwood floor, and adding 1 teaspoon of this vinegar to a gallon of water makes a good floor cleaner also.
