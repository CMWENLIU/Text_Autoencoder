This is definitely an acquired taste.  You will either like it or hate it.  In my family only I and one of my 3 kids like it.  We like it more than peanut butter and only eat it on sandwiches.  I like it with a dark purple or red jelly, more subtle jellies like apple or orange marmalade just didn't work.  As the other reviewer stated it is dark green and very easy to spread.  If you are worried about addiction don't be.  My preschooler and I ate it 4-5 times a week for a month ( We ate about 1 can every 2 weeks) and when the store ran out and we stopped eating it for a while neither of us had any reaction.  Some other parents had weird reactions to the concept of hemp but I know it is healthy, legal and much better for you than peanut butter or sandwich meat so I ignored their looks.
