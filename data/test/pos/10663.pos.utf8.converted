I have tried many olive oils.  I respect olio like others respect fine wine.  I do not exagerate when I say this is the best I have ever tasted.  My wife brought a bottle home from Italy.  When I tasted it I was hooked.  I have paid as much as US$50.00 for a bottle when I couldn't find it anywhere else.  People think nothing of spending US$100.00 for a bottle of wine that is consumed in one sitting.  This olive oil is worth much more and lasts much longer. If you love olio like I do, treat yourself; beware however, there is no going back.  Enjoy!!<br /><br />Robert Keefer
