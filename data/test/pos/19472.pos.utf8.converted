This is a great tasting product, and is definitely the cheapest around, anywhere, period.  Yes, it is very expensive compared to regular sugar, even organic sugar, but anywhere else you will find it in the $20-$30 per pound range.  No, it is not a strong maple flavor, which I personally am glad about.  I can't afford to use it in all my baking, etc. but it is a nice treat for occassional use.  It is also much healthier than cane sugar in ANY form, including Sucanat.  I will continue to purchase it, although unfortunately not as often as I would like!!
