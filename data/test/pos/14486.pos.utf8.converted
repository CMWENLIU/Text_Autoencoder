Jet smoothies are absolutely great!  We started using this mix at my work in place of our old smoothie mix, and everyone loves them!  These smoothies are incredibly easy to make.  You just fill a glass with ice, then pour the mix to the top of the glass, then blend.<br /><br />The flavor of this smoothie is terrific!  Although it is made with green tea, you can't taste the tea over the intense fruit flavor.  One of my customers today made the comment that it tastes like you just put peaches in the blender.  The reason I'm writing this review is because I'm sitting at home, craving a smoothie, and since I won't have another one til I get to work tomorrow, I thought I'd come online and see if the mix is available for order.  I'm glad to see that I can get this for home use, because I'm addicted!
