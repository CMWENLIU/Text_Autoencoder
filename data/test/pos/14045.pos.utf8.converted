These bars are great.<br />- filling<br />- crunchy (but not too crunchy - good combination of chewy and crunchy)<br />- Nice touch of dark chocolate<br />- Peanuts and almonds<br />- 10g of protein (mainly soy based, but some from whey as well)<br /><br />They also contain less of the more questionable ingredients. It doesn't have "high fructose corn syrup" for example.<br /><br />Word of warning to the super food conscious:<br />- these are not super healthy (better than regular candy bars though)<br />- While it lacks high fructose corn syrup, it has high maltose corn syrup<br />- Various soy derivatives (not organic) like soy lechitin and soy protein isolates<br />- The always vague and all inclusive: "natural flavors"<br /><br />I am not a big fan of Nature Valley granola bars, but these protein bars are great.
