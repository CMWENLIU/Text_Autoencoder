My wife and I really enjoy saffron rice but the problem is that saffron is getting so expensive.  I was a little nervous about the quality of this brand because the price was so low.  Well, this is good stuff.  When this is gone I will purchase more of this same brand.  One hint, I live in a very humid area, Brazil.  I have thrown out more spices than most folks buy in a lifetime.  I now put all of my spices in 1/2 pint Ball or Kerr caning jars and vacuum pack them with a Food Saver.  Saffron normally becomes very soft here quickly but the Food Saver keeps it and all of my spices fresh.
