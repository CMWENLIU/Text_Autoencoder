I have never cooked tapioca, never in my life.  I have never made a merangue.  But I was tired of paying almost $5 for a small tub of pre-made, store bought tapioca so I thought I would try this because of the reviews from others.<br /><br />I cannot properly explain how this product has changed my life.  Instead of buying the tapioca in the store (the pre-made stuff - tasted okay, or so I thought before I cooked Bob's Red Mill Tapioca from scratch!  At first I wasn't thrilled at having to buy eggs, 2% milk, and vanilla extract in order to make this.  And when I tried to make the meringue that this recipe calls for I messed up the first batch because I tried making it in an old plastic bowl.  So I went online and learned the proper way of making a merangue (since I don't have a metal or glass mixing bowl, I ended up using a 2 quart non-stick pan - it worked great!).  Once I mastered the technique of whipping up the egg whites and making a merangue, I was set!<br /><br />I have made 4 batches of this tapioca so far and just cannot tell you how GREAT it is. So light and fluffy and it is made fresh, out of good, healthy, natural ingredients.  I am absolutely thrilled with this product.  I was so proud of myself learning how to do this that I left a large bowl of it for some friends from church - they love it, too!!!!<br /><br />I ordered this through the "subscribe and save" option.  This lowered the price and I get free shipping!  This makes the cost of tapioca almost free compared to the stuff I bought at the store.  Like I said before, I have made 4 batches of this so far and I seems as though the bag is still as full as when I opened it - this stuff is going to last forever!  I like it so much I am going to order a bunch of this to give as Christmas presents and I can't wait to try variations on the basic recipe.<br /><br />If you like tapioca pudding, I HIGHLY recommend buying this product.  After you make a batch or two is becomes really easy, even if you have no experience cooking like this - like me (I actually enjoy whipping the eggs whites by hand to make the merangue - who knew?!).  Get this product and order it through the 'subscribe and save" option, you can't go wrong!!!
