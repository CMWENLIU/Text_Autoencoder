I'm an avid cook and spice mix experimenter, plus I've been a fan of Chef Prudhomme's delicious recipes for some time.<br /><br />This is a world-class selection of spice mixes, and definitely a worthwhile gift for the chef in your family.  (Or yourself, if you like to try new flavorings on your food other than onion powder and ketchup.)<br /><br />Although Prudhomme is a well-known Cajun chef, don't think that his spice mixes are designed to burn your tongue out.  The hottest of the mixes in this collection is the Blackened Redfish Magic.  It's a chile-powder kind of burn straight-on, but it also carbonizes into a delicious crust when you're cooking most any kind of fish in the Prudhomme manner.  (Note to those who might try this at home: open the windows or switch off the smoke detectors, this is a smoky dish!)<br /><br />Other standouts are the Chicken Magic, which is a strong, herbal-scented spice, and the gentler, more complex Seafood Magic, which has notes of pepper and paprika among others in it.  And you won't go wrong with the remainder of the items, which rely primarily on the ground herbs and not table salt or MSG.
