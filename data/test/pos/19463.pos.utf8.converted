It took them a few days to fill my order but once it was filled it arrived the next day. Came in small plastic bag which was flat due to shipping. Had my pots and soil ready to go so planted them right away. Perked up the same day and I have new growth in just one week. They shouldn't even be surviving in my climate zone(North West AZ, its been 110 in the shade the last few days) but seem to be doing ok. Only get alittle morning and evening sun, full shade rest of the day. Please do your research about these plants, very toxic, I planted with surgical gloves to protect my hands from possible sap. Can't wait for my flowers to bloom.
