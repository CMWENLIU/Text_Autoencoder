K&uuml;bler is a Swiss blanche absinthe, which means than when poured on a glass, you will not see the classic and sought-after green color, but just crystal clear liquid, like water or vodka.  It does louche, of course, to a beautiful milky pearl color.<br /><br />I drank it with one sugar cube and 4-5 parts of water.  As always, the main flavor is anise, with a hint of bitterness in the after taste, but subtle and enjoyable.  Although I can not taste any other flavors, I would say that it provides a refreshing experience.  Depending on your taste, you may skip the sugar and enjoy it anyway.<br /><br />I would recommend it for beginners better than the Lucid, although more experienced drinkers may find it lacks complexity.  In any case, it will remain one of my favorites.<br /><br />P.S. I refuse to discuss thujone content and other non-sense and myths in my reviews.  If you are interested in thujone, go eat sage and forget absinthe altogether.
