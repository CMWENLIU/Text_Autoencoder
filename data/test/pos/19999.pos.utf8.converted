I've been drinking espresso since 1983 when I was introduced to it by Signor Forza in Rome. I found out that Italians have a saying "Only women and babies drink cappucino after 9:00". What that means is that all the men take a coffee (espresso) break at 9:00. Well since I returned to the states in 1985 I have tried all kinds of expresso beans, using mostly Starbucks. I happened across a can of Illy beans at a Tucson store. I vaguely remembered the Illy brand from my 8 months in Italy and decided to try it. It is inarguably the best espresso I have had since returning from Italy.
