I found this product 6 or 7 years ago in a healthfood store. when I found out what State it was actually made in-my home state of Mssachusetts I was shocked as to how long it took me to find it! This is one of those rare products that doesn't have to be advertised andd the company isn't interested in profit alone. this cereal is actually made out of the wheat berry-the best part of wheat-it is Organic wheat! The berry is rolled out under pressure to form a real flake. sprinkled with a little sea salt and dressed up with some organic raisins-you can't get any crispier,tastier or healthier than that! Raisin bran eaters are crazy if they don't try it!!!!!
