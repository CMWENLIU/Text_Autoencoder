The other review (entitled 'Fruit and Branch Mangler) is dishonest. The reviewer wrote negative things about ALL the fruit pickers except his. In fact he has written countless negative reviews of MANY different products. He is a dishonest marketer who is gaming amazon for purely selfish reasons.<br /><br />I don't know a THING about this fruit picker, but I feel an obligation to go to places where the reviewer has done his damage to warn people that the review he wrote can't possibly be true.
