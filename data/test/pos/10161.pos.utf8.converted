If you're like me, often you just don't have the time or forgot to buy some fresh garlic at the store, and pretty much bottled dry garlic just doesn't cut it - I've tried them all!  BUT.... that's where D&A Garlic comes in - their spices, Garlic, Salt, Pepper and others, are simply the best possible products is an easy to use grinder container. Yes, you can easily find similar products at the store, but NOT similar taste.  Go ahead, try the garlic - heat up some spaghetti in a pot, add butter to coat, and grind on a nice amount of D&A Garlic, stir and let sit for just a minute or two - the fresh and natural flavor, as well as small fresh garlic pieces will astound you (and no tomato needed!) Try adding some fresh garlic to your buttered popcorn, get inventive!  The Med. Salt and the Multi-pepper are equally fantastic on your steaks, eggs or other favorite standard fare - add some spice to your life today.  These are worth the extra price - you pay for what you get! (and if you want quality, taste, and unmatched excellence - this is it. (I even had some old Garlic that was 3 years past its recommended best use date, and it was still wonderful - better than the other junk I had just bought at the store, which is what prompted my to retry this brand from Italy - made in Florence, with care and pride).
