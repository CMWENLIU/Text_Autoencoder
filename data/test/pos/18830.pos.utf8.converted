I try to eat a limited amount of carbs and really miss having sandwiches, burritos, tacos, etc. Came across these at the grocery store (near the dairy section, for some reason) and tried them out: they really are great. 12 grams of fiber per tortilla helps, too! They don't have the same texture and flavor of a typical tortilla (I'd say they are thinner, somewhat drier and less 'doughy' than what I've previously used), but there's nothing at all objectionable about them. Oh, the joy of a tuna salad wrap, eaten while sitting in the garden. Happy days.
