I know tapioca is sooo old fashioned, but when made with the real pearl kind, and much less sugar than suggested in any recipe...and maybe some coconut flakes & vanilla & almond flavoring - really good. Or make it & pour (preferably homemade)caramel on the top before chilling...it will come out something like Flan.
