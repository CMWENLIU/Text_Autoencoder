Sent this to my dad for Father's Day, and it arrived on time, and he loved it.  He said it brought back many memories, and included some of his favorite candies from back when he was a kid.  He enjoyed the box it came in, and the candies tasted as they did when he was a kid.  If you know anyone from the 40s definately consider buying them this as a gift.  It makes a great gag gift to.
