Last spring, I had borderline high LDL (146, where it should be less than 130).  I started using this product in May 2011, but unfortunately, as I was traveling over the summer, I wasn't as good about taking it as I should have been.  My goal was to take it 3x a day, but in foreign countries, in the heat on the road, the little squares would often get melty and smashed in my small travel fanny pack, and then weren't very palatable, so often I only had 1 per day, not optimum.  When I came back from traveling in September, I had my cholesterol checked, and it was 136.  Lower, but not below the magic number of 130.  On September 12 I made a pledge to take the chews 3-4 times per day, and then recheck my cholesterol again in late November.  Full disclosure:  I also added in 1/2 cup of oatmeal every day because I had read this can lower cholesterol.  I also cut all dairy products, but did not cut out red meat, which I eat 2-4 days a week.  My diet was basically oatmeal (but no other carbs) fruits, lots of veggies of every sort, beef, pork, chicken and fish, with no dairy and very low sugar.  It was very similar to my diet before (when LDL cholesterol was at 146), but without the dairy products.  I was hoping that the combination of the 1 serving of oatmeal, no dairy and 3-4 Benecol chews per day would lower my cholesterol 15 points or so.  Was I EVER surprised when I saw the results... in a late November cholesterol check, my LDL was down to 81... a drop (from the May reading of 146) 65 points!!!!  Now granted, it's not clear how much of the result was from the Benecol, how much was from the oatmeal, and how much was from the no dairy/no sugar.  But I feel confident that the Benecol is definitely a big part of the success.  I will definitely keep using this product.  My only complaint is what is noted in the beginning of this review; if you are traveling it is hard to remember to take it at all the meals, and if you carry it around with you, it tends to get soft and squishy.  If you put in into a small hard container (like a medium-sized plastic pill bottle, or a square plastic soap container) that would prevent it getting squished.  You just have to remember to grab 3-4 each morning out of your suitcase and bring them with you each day.
