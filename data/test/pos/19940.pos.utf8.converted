I'm in the coffee business. I order various whole bean coffees through Amazon Grocery to check out the competition. Lately, I've noticed something odd. Perhaps it's a coincidence but the last couple of coffee orders that I have placed have been most satisfying. I go to Amazon to leave feedback and I find that the coffee is suddenly unavailable? Bizarre. Here's another one. I just got the coffee that I ordered. It's a lovely, dark organic. I have been quite delighted with every type of coffee that I have puchased from this roaster. They are putting out some high quality beans. I'm quite particular about French roast. It's my favorite roast and it has to be done just right. This variety was exquisitely roasted. The resulting brew was earthy, fragrant, and not too heavy on the palate. Sadly, as I write this review I see that this coffee is "currently unavailable." I just ordered it! Am I some kind of a jinx? Keep checking back. It's worth it!
