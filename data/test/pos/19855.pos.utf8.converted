If you've ever eaten Indian food in a good restaurant in India, you'll especially appreciate KOI's quick-fix packages. These are very tasty, a good value, and easy to prepare. This one's my favorite of the Kitchens of India recipes (neck-and-neck with Dal Bukhara). I like to pressure cook some brown rice (black japonica is even better!) with some lentils and fenugreek seeds (easy on those -- strong flavor), then add a package of the prepared mix. (It's also fine to eat right out of the package.)
