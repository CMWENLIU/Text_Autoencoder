I searched for these breadsticks when I was about 6 weeks into the very dynamic HCG Diet and boy was I surprised, in a good and bad way.  I was surprised that they tasted SO good!  I was surprised at how many broken ones were in each packet.<br /><br />Buying a whole case at a time makes for a very affordable treat whether you are dieting or not.  Overall, I ended up stashing the box in the garage and will bring it back out when I am on the maintenence part of the HCG Diet.  These little treats are so tempting that I found myself wanting more than the recommended 2 per day :)<br /><br />I also recommend:<br />Stevia Clear Liquid Vanilla Creme 2 Ounces<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H23X2S">Old London Melba Toast, Classic, 5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>
