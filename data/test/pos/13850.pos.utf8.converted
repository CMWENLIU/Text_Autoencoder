The reason I am trying this out is because I use instant dry milk and to make it taste smoother I wanted to add just a little cream.  I have added the liquid but since I live a long way from a store I needed something that would keep for a long time.  This really works.  I was a little worried that the expense of the jar would be prohibitive to use on a regular basis but you only need a tablespoon to a half-gallon of mixed milk to give it a creamier taste,that is at least for me).  I am sure if you used this product in puddings or other milk products it would work just fine.  I did use it to make yogurt and the taste was great.
