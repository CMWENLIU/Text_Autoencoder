I've been feeding my little guys Natural Balance for a while now and they love it. Their coats have never been shinier and meal time is always a breeze. They're not huge fans of NB's wet food, but the dry is at the top of their list. I love the fact that it's grain-free and the price is very good for what you get. A 10-lb bag usually lasts me about a month since I mix it with wet food. Definitely worth it for your furry friend.
