i laughed when i saw the title for a previous review of these ("don't tell the DEA how addictive these are!") because these are my equivalent of crack.  i can easily eat a whole bag of these in 2-3 days time, but i can also understand how some people don't like them (there ain't no subtlety to these guys...they have a strong, warm bite to them, which seems to have the same polarizing effect in my family as olives, blue cheese and michael moore do -- you either love them or you don't).  i really enjoy putting these in my hot tea, both to enjoy their dissolved flavor in the tea, as well as to enjoy the soft, warm chew that remains.  if you like the strong bite of ginger, you're likely on your way to joining our happy gang of ginger addicts.<br /><br />plus, the illustration of the slothful, reclined little gingerman on the front of the bag totally tickles me and reminds me of george hamilton for some reason.
