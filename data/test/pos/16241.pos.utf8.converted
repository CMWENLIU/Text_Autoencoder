I first purchased this product at BJ's wholesale club. This is the best flavored carbonated water I've ever had. Like other reviewers, BJ's discontinued in favor of another product, what a mistake! I wrote to Talking Rain and their new president requesting this product have an online outlet...and it seems they delivered. Yes, it is more expensive, but with super saver shipping and subscription service (15%) savings, I'm in for a few cases each month. Try it, you will love it.
