Oh my God, this hazelnut butter is so addictive I have to hide it from myself! :)<br />I originally got a couple of single packs at a local health food store because I didn't want to risk buying a whole jar of the 'unknown'. After I tried it, I RAN back to the store to stock up. :) The taste is out of this world and the ingredients are so simple, it's amazing. It really does taste a lot like Nutella, only in a more grown up way. :) It's also not as smooth as Nutella (it has a grainier texture) but I don't mind one bit. I actually prefer it to Nutella (even though I grew up eating Nutella and it used to be one of my all time favorite foods). I've also tried the almond butter and the maple almond flavors--both beyond delicious! Also, even though it doesn't say it on the jar, I'm pretty sure it's vegan too! I've signed up for email alerts from Amazon, so let's hope they bring it back soon.<br />In case you're wondering: no, I don't work for the company and I have no idea who 'Justin' is, I'm just in love with their products! :)
