Vigo knows how to combine flavors.  Living in the South, we have occasion to eat "real" home made red beans and rice fairly frequently.  Vigo, by far, makes the best store bought variety on the market.  Cook it up and add some hot sausage to it and you've got a meal that will be devoured in no time flat.<br /><br />We been long time fans of their Red Beans & Rice and Black Beans & Rice mixtures and I was delighted to find that they easily cook in our rice cooker by following the following steps:  I measured the contents of the package and then simply added an extra half cup of water.  Even if you're cooking 2 packages you only add an extra half cup of water more than the contents.  For example, if there is 1 cup of rice & seasoning, I'd use 1 and 1/2 cups of water in my rice cooker.  It never fails to come out perfect every time!
