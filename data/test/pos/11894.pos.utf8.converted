My kids remind me that they need their nordic berries.  They love them so much.  My daughter gets cold sores because her immune system gets weak. Ever since we started taking these vitamins, she is healthy and strong and doesn't get an outbreak. My son is a very picky eater so as long as he gets his vitamins I know he is getting the proper nourishment.  We have tried everything from the grocery store to the health stores.  My sister in law owns a health store and she introduced us to these.  The kids remind ME that they need their vitamins.  They are so yummy.  I wish I knew about them a long time ago! They are are expensive for our budget but it is worth the investment.  Just order online and enough to get free shipping.
