I've baked with other Bob's Red Mill products before and I finally got a case of the Active Dry Yeast. A great deal when you consider the price of those pouches or even the small jars in the grocery store. The yeast is consistently well behaved and the bags are a convenient size. Bulk without having to feel like you need to rush through before the yeast looses its efficacy.<br /><br />The only thing that bothers me is the labeling. I think Bob's Red Mill ought to consider fixing the front label where it says "Must Be Refrigerated". There's no need to refrigerate until AFTER a bag has been opened. A couple extra words explanation would keep from scaring off some would-be buyers not experienced with yeast.
