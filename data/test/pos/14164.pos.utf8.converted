I must state from the beginning that I never liked white chocolate before. I normally only eat the bitter, dark, hell colored stuff and to me that is bliss. I came across this bar by chance, got a taste of it and never wanted to be without it. This bar is pure heaven; I adore coconut shavings in chocolate even if it's milk chocolate and they work even better in white chocolate, giving it a chewy consistency - very satisfying though those who like to sink their teeth into their dessert.<br /><br />This bar is creamy, not overly sweet as the sugar doesn't over take. The buttery colored mass is rich and melts in the mouth as vanilla and coconut disintegrate in small burst. This is one of my favorite items that I get when I have my sweet cravings for something truly delicious. My other favorite Lindt bars are the Pear and also the Chili one, I wish there was a larger variety of flavored chocolates, I would love to see a bar with cardamom, nutmeg and other spices.<br /><br />- Kasia S.
