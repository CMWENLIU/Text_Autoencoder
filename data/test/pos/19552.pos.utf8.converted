I consider these bars to be in the same category as store bought packaged cakes as they taste fresh baked, but without the typical trans fat and unappealing artificial ingredients.  They taste great with plenty of cinnamon flavor and a soft and creamy texture.  Much better than a crunchy granola bar or hard sandwich cookie.  I can't find this flavor of Health Valley bar in stores and it is definitely the best, though the vanilla creme-filled chocolate ones are tasty too.  So I ordered a case through Amazon and sent them to my office address so I can enjoy them in the morning with a cup of coffee or tea.  They are a light and healthy alternative to the tempting snacks at my local bakery or coffee shop (which I purchase from time to time) and keep for months so you can store a box at your desk and enjoy them when you have a sugar craving.  I hope Health Valley doesn't stop making them as I only can find them for sale here online.
