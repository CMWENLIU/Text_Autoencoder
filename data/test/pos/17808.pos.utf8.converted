Every bite you can taste like they are just freshly baked and so much chocolate chucks in each cookies, it is hard to believe. This is not your store brand bought cookies. Seriously, I bought 3 boxes from the local store, they were gone in one week. They are a little pricey but you do get what you pay for! Try them, you'd be hooked like my family are.
