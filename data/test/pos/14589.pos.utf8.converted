I recently moved to an area without much in terms of specialty and high-end grocery stores, so I am so glad to see Dorset Cereals for sale on Amazon. They are, quite simply, the best mueslis I have ever had the pleasure of eating.<br /><br />You would think that a muesli is a muesli, wouldn't you? I certainly would. And that's exactly what I thought, more or less, until I tried my first Dorset Cereal.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure how they make their mueslis better than everyone else's, but I have a theory. I think they toast the grain flakes. Maybe not the oats, but perhaps the wheat and barley, to bring out the flavor. I'm not sure exactly. But whatever they do, it sure works.<br /><br />This particular variety of Dorset Cereals is simple but outstanding. In fact, it is probably my favorite. No exotic fruits -- unless you consider dates, sultanas and Chilean flame raisins exotic. The fruits and nuts percentage reaches 30%, which for Dorset Cereals is on the low side, as most varieties are at 50%. Lots of Brazil nuts and hazelnuts. Good eating all around.<br /><br />There are certainly other good mueslis out there, but often my favorites among other brands, like Germany's Alnatura, use tricks to make them tastier -- like chocolate. Dorset Cereals manage to outshine good chocolate mueslis without resorting to cheap sugary tricks.<br /><br />If anyone honestly knows a better muesli, I'd love to try it. I've tried quite a few, from lots of different muesli-rich countries in Europe, and so far Dorset stands head and shoulders above the rest. I will change the title of this review the minute I taste a better muesli (at least one that isn't loaded with sugar). Until then, I'll stand by my statement that these guys makes the best mueslis in the world.
