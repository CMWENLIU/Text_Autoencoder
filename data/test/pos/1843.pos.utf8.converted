I have been a diabetic for almost forty years.  I have tried many sweeteners over the years, some of which caused me some severe reactions.  Years ago, I decided I preferred stevia.  Lately I did another comparison between the different stevia brands.  Better Stevia Organic in the packets is the one I decided to go with.  I do not bake with sweeteners and eat very little baked goods since I am selective on how I expend my carb allowance.  Mostly I just use the stevia in beverages. The organic stevia packets are lined with an inner seal, I suppose to keep it fresh and to keep it from getting hard. However when you hold the packet over a cup of hot beverage the stevia draws moisture and clings to the liner making it difficult to pour out. I simply add the stevia to my cup before I pour in the liquid.  It also does not dissolve quickly in iced beverages.  It takes a minute or two for it to completely dissolve. I like this Stevia Organic enough to deal with these issues.  It does not have additional ingredients.  It is just organic stevia and I like it that way.
