Never used before but this summer I tried and felt better after a good workout. They claim that your body needs, but I watch my salt intake because I am a big guy trying to get fit. I sweat alot these pills makes you feel less run down after. I bought a extra bottle and gave to the mailman he came back the next day and said they made him feel better at the end of the day. Recommend these to anyone.(Mailman said he would buy the next batch.)
