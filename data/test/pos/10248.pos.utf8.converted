I know that coffee reviews are subjective -- we all have different tastes and preferences, right? So I'm writing my review based on my own preferences for a light roast coffee with a "soft" flavor (rather than overly bitter or bold). This is currently my 100% absolutely favorite k-cup flavor. While it's brewing I get the distinct aroma of cinnamon rolls. I brew in a Keurig B40 and choose the 9.25oz serving size and think the brew strength is exactly right. My usual method of serving is to heat about 6 ounces of skim milk in the microwave for 1 minute, add about 1 tablespoon SF Torani Vanilla Syrup and froth using my Aerolatte thingie. Then I add the coffee to the milk and stir gentle. It's as good as anything I can get at Starbucks!
