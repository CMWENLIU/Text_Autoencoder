I saw this in a specialty market and was so impressed by the wide ribbons of white coconut that I disregarded the gazillion dollars they charged and bought a bag.  At the Bob's Red Mill website, I investigated recommended recipes and found an enticing cookie recipe, then assembled the ingredients and prepared a batch of wholesome, chewy, flavorfully delicious cookies which we've been enjoying for a few days.  I'd used home dried cherries and grapes (raisins) instead of the cranberries listed in the recipe, but otherwise followed it as written online and on the Bob's Red Mill 5 Grain Cereal bag.  The coconut was so impressive that I immediately checked to see the Amazon price in preparation for buying more and after only a week, they now have it in stock at a much better price than the nearly five I paid for my first bag.  The 12 ounce bag probably contains 3 hefty cups of coconut as I split it with my daughter and nibbled some before measuring it for review.  She made fresh blueberry coconut ice cream with coconut milk and said this coconut was especially nice because the texture was more interesting than smaller shreds which she'd used in the past.  Nothing is added to the Bob's Red Mill Flaked Coconut Unsweetened and that's just what I want!  Toasted, it's even better when added to fruit and yogurt.  I have it in my Amazon cart ready to order!
