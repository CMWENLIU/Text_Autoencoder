These come in a large plastic bag which is double bagged. There is minimal olive oil brine and the tasty small to medium sized brown and black olives are pitted. If you are a fan of Kalamata olives you will be in heaven. They are so good I even started eating them as a snack by themselves. I'll just have to go w/o salt the rest of the week.Yum!
