Unlike similar products of several other brands, this fly trap is one that really works.  I hung the unit from a hook in my garage ceiling two days ago, and there are already two inches of dead flies on top of the water.  The bait is somewhat smelly - vaguely like liquified barnyard manure - so it's best used outside of living areas.
