Tupelo honey is so romantic.  Remember Elvis was born in Tupelo, Mississippi?  I never liked Elvis, but the honey is absolutely "love me tender, love me sweet".  Not too strong, not too dark, not like anything you've ever had.  I love honey, everything BUT the "honey-flavored" packets some fast-food-joints pass out,  trying to fool you.  HUMPF! Tupelo honey is the stuff shooting stars are made of, watch your honey's gleamerz light up when he bites into hiz morning toast!<br /><br />I will buy this again, though it only for special occasions, because it is sooooo expensive.  (But starlit eyes are irresitible, and worth it!)
