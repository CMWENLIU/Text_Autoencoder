I needed, nondescript, chocolate gold coins for my pirate party on Halloween night.  These were perfect!  I ordered three times what I actually needed, and so used some as Thank You gifts for people who assisted with the party and the rest made an evening of Poker a lot more interesting.  The shipping is somewhat expensive, but if you order multiple bags in one shipment, it brings the cost per coin down considerably.  However, they are worth the cost!
