I discovered these almond, pecan, cashew clusters about a year ago while shopping at Sam Club's. They were sampling them with yogurt. OMG ... one bite and I was hooked! I LOVE these. My kids love them. They are PERFECT by themselves or in yogurt. A serving size (~5 bite-size clusters) is 170 calories w/12g of fat (as is expected from nuts). They are very addictive ... almost like eating candy. Unfortunately, it's not hard to find yourself eating more than 1 serving. :)<br /><br />These are are 100% natural and the only other ingredients outside of the nuts are brown rice syrup, organic sugar, sea salt, and sunflower oil. I paid around $8 for a 24 oz bag at Sam's Club.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have been trying to reduce the amount of sugar in my diet, so I have switched to just eating raw/plain almonds, pecans, cashews and walnuts. :)
