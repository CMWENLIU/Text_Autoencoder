Arizona Diet Green Tea is my absolute favorite soft drink, and the fact is that I ONLY drink this or water.<br />I will say that nothing is as good as this flavor bought in the GLASS bottles (there's something about the plastic bottles that changes the flavor). However, for cost and convenience, these packets come very close.<br />Other than the great flavor, two things that make this stand out from other sugar free iced tea mixes is that it completely dissolves easily. There is NEVER any residue at the bottom of the bottle, and unlike some other mixes (Crystal Light for example), this doesn't cause acid reflux. That last part may not apply to everyone, but may be important to some (like me).<br />Highly recommended, especially at the subscribe & save price. A friend of mine bragged that she buys these for only $2 a box at Walgreen's, but I noticed that hers only have 8 per box ($0.25 per packet), while these have 10 per box ($0.2485 per packet at the current S&S price), so these are the same.<br />Since Poland Spring bottles go on sale all the time for $3.99 for a case of 24, the total cost for a bottle of Arizona Diet Green Tea is about $0.41. When stores are selling cold 20 oz bottles of soda for $1.50, $0.41 seems pretty inexpensive to me. It's even less if you get your Poland Spring at Costco or some other price club.
