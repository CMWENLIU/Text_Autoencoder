I have loved these since I was a kid. They are just awesome!!!! I started to buy these locally at one of the oriental stores (locally meaning a half hour drive - lol). Unfortunately The store I buy such products from had been shut down and there was no other local oriental store from which I could buy my favorite foods. Although shipping is a bit costly, it's not so bad if you buy a ton of packages at once, thus saving you on shipping costs. Being that I spent 2 years in Japan, I am addicted to quite a few of the foods they make there and this seaweed is an addiction for me. I just love it and I could eat 10 packets of these at once. You must try these seaweed packets. Don't be fooled by the other seaweed products. These are specific, slightly salted, excellent munchy snacks, even taste more wonderful than potato chips, pretzels or anything else. They have less calories. You just cannot go wrong with these wonderful seaweed snacks. If you don't buy these you really are missing out on the awesome foods in life.  XD
