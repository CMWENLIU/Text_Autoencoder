This tonic is really really good. Way better than the Canada Dry or other items you get in the grocery store. It is low calorie, and compliments your gin or vodka instead of overpowering the flavor. Really high quality stuff that I highly recommend or the best mixed drink. Try it out in a four pack to see if you like it and then go for the 24 pack as it is a great value. Worth the expense. Enjoy!
