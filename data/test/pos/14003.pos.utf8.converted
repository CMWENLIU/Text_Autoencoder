Ancient Harvest Quinoa is delicious! The Amazon price is the best I've found. It may seem pricey, but you get a lot of bang for your buck. Quinoa is more of a sprout than a grain and very nutritious (look it up on Wikipedia). Although quinoa is reportedly bitter, Ancient Harvest washes it very well and we did not taste any bitterness at all.<br /><br />There is a recipe on the back of the box and several more inside. I tried several and they were all delicious. We even like to eat it like oatmeal in the morning. I'm not much into "new wave" food, but this is a winner.
