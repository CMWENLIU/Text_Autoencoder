While it is certainly true that there are other superb Bitterwseet chocolates out there that can outshine Scharffen Berger in a one on one taste test, I have yet to find one that could consistantly deliver this same level of quality at this price point and still achieve all the things we look for in a very, very dark chocolate.  One would have to have access to a dependable Artisanal Chocolatier to find that and even then, I doubt they could came in at even less than twice the price.<br /><br />This is why Sharffen berger is the preferred chocolate of both home and professional bakers at this busy time of year.  We know it will deliver to us a nice evenly noted Bittwersweet taste not too waxy nor overly creamy in texture and that this 70% Cacao bar can be easily incorporated into ganaches, used to melt and then coat dried fruits for Holiday platters, serve as the basis of a decadedent Southern Chocolate layer cake 6 layers high or, be snapped off into the scored triangles and enjoyed by the cook as a not-too-guilty indulgence full of flavinoids and anti-oxidants your store-bought candybar has long abandoned in the name of cheap, artificial vanillas and tropical fats to replace to Coco butter.<br /><br />Some people I tried to tempt with a small serving of the bar, snapped off and offered as the perfect marriage of bitter and sweet just couldn't get over their love of rich Milk Chocolate but if you make sure the bar is warmed to at least 78 to 80 degrees, very gently on a plate, it melts a little eaiser in the mouth as it warms up to body temperature and loses the waxy sensation that people eating it at a colder 65 degrees tend to report.  So if you plan to serve the bar or eat the bar on it's own, respect the coco butter's richeness and the fact that there is less of it in this dark bar.  Give the bar the time and environment it needs to warm up.  I put my oven on 100 degrees, open the door until the interior temp goes down to 80 and then slide the prepared triangles on a serving plate onto the top rack sitting on a cookie rack and leave them there until I can see the chocolate loosen up just a bit.. maybe 10 minutes at best.<br /><br />For cooking, well - you simply can't beat this bar.  it grates well with a microplane, easier if warmed a little, and it incorporates well into nbatters.  it melts well but make sure your recipe actually CALLS FOR a 70% Cacao bar or you may need to add some fat to get the correct texture.  Use a reliable recipe or recipe book author and do a test run if you've never cooked with this before.  I would say to save this deliciously bittersweet chocolate for your company who know a good brand when they taste it and incoprate it into the frosting of a centerpiece cake or use it in one of my favorite recipes, the Wlanut Dark Chocolate Bourbon Pie , also known as the Kentucky Derby Pie or a Christmas Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Pie.  The intesnity of the chocolate matches up well with a good aged Bourbon in a dessert.  In fact a good, rich yellow caked soaked with bourbon, layered with wet walnuts ( or candied Black Walnuts) between and then spread with a Bittersweet Chocolate frosting  is a grandstanding finish to any Holiday party.<br /><br />Viva le Sharffen Berger!
