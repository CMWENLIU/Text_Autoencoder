I just tried this lite SPAM this morning for breakfast.  Just sliced it up and browned it in a pan and it wasn't bad at all!  In fact, it wasn't that "lite" to me, having never had orignal spam.  It was more than meaty and greasy enough to get me out the door and to work and not think about food for many hours.  Thanks SPAM lite!
