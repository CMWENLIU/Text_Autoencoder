These are the $0.99 size bag of chips you can buy at Walmart or a convenience store.  This is great for my family since I am not a big chip eater, but, my 8 year old son loves chips with a hot dog or a sandwich.  Now, I don't have to worry about a "big" bag of chips going stale before they are eaten, or having to buy chips every time I go to the grocery store!  They are great for school snacks and family picnics, too.  When the grandchildren or my son's freinds come over, they love them.  They can grab a bag and go outside to munch and play!  Good thing I ordered the 60 count box of Funyons, also!!!
