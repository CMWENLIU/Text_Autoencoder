I have used this product for years. There is no bitter taste as when chemicals are used to extract the aloe from the plant. One can drink it, gargle, swish the mouth. I have used it for sinus irrigation and feminine uses. It would be useful for colon irritations (orally) and as a prevention and part of a colon cancer therapy, but ask your health practitioner...
