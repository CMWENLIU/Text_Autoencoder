Maruchan Instant Lunch Ramen Noodles with Vegetables provides a hot, satisfying snack in 3 minutes!  Each unit comes in it's own container.  Just add boiling water to dry contents inside, re-close lid and 3 minutes later you have a hot soup ready to eat!<br /><br />This product is not the healthiest thing you might find yourself snacking on, but is certainly not the worst either.  The worst thing in this cup of soup is the 59% sodium, which is actually quite a lot of sodium compared to most packaged foods.  More sodium, even, than packaged macaroni & cheese, which packs a whole lotta sodium - 41%!<br /><br />So this isn't the kind of thing you want to eat all the time, and seriously do not expect this item to have enough nutrients to keep a body healthy, by eating it as your only item for meals.  I recommend this as a snack item only, and only a few times a week.<br /><br />As a snack-item only, this soup is very tasty and satisfying - and simple enough to make that anyone able to heat & pour boiling water can have a warm, substantial snack!
