My wife is a gourmet cook. She often needs spices and oils not easily found here in San Diego. Most retail outlets, even specialty shops cater mainly to southwestern and/or Latin American cooking. (we live only a few minutes from the Mexican border) She wanted to make something that had this spice as an ingredient. In the city of San Diego, this spice was hard to find. When we did find it was prohibitively expensive and it was only one ounce.<br /><br />We ended up purchasing that small amount and having that dinner party. However, we looked online and as always Amazon came through. We found cardamon of superior quality and in generous amounts for a price that was more than reasonable.  We got nearly 4 ouunces for less than the price we paid one 1 ounce.
