Tomato paste in a tube is the best cooking condiment ever -- it is so expensive here in the states, and in Italy it's about 50 cents a tube. But then there's the cost of going to Italy just for tomato paste in a tube. In bulk on Amazon, it's incredibly affordable, and I have a supply until I can accumulate enough miles to fly to italy again. Yum.
