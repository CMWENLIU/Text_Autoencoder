These are absolutely the most delicious lollipops ever!  We originally tasted them as a fund-raiser for the American Heart Foundation in Atlanta, GA.  As soon as we got home, I searched for them on the internet, found them here, and ever since, have been handing them to our family and friends.  They are simply the best ever!  Try them, I promise you'll like them.
