I am a big fan of the granola and this packaging makes it an even better value. The bags are not hard to deal with at all, I just chip clip them at the top once they're opened. The granola itself: It stays crunchy for a long time in milk, not too sweet, no wheat in it, loaded with health benefits. No fruit or nuts, so I add my own to taste. This is on my short list of products I can't live without.
