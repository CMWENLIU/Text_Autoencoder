This is one of our favorite flavored coffees. The caramel flavor is nice and smooth, and not syrupy tasting like when the coffee shop just adds a syrup to regular coffee to give it a certain flavor. Coffee drinkers have very individual tastes, but for me and my wife this coffee is delicious.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: Carefully check the price before you order this coffee from any seller. A box of 24 cups should cost less than fourteen dollars exclusive of shipping, and further discounts are available if you order multiple boxes, including free shipping.
