I saw this tea at a local farmer's market and bought it.  I read the description and thought I would give it a try. I have been dealing with PCOS for at least 6 years now and have had amenorrhea off and on.  I drank the tea as directed (2-3 cups a day). I drank it hot as well as an iced tea every single day, and have had normal cycles ever since.  I would recommend it to any woman who has similar problems and who might not want to rely on medication. In addition, it taste with a slight mint/citrus taste.
