It's amazing what the chemists come up with these days.  This stuff is amazing!  It can clean your hands with a little soap, it can turn into ice when put into the freezer, it can make soup, and did I mention that you can drink it if you're thirsty!  It comes in a clear square shaped bottle which is portable; yep, you can take it anywhere you go (except past those pesky TSA agents at the airport).  There are rumors that scientists and engineers are working on a system of pipes that will deliver this amazing stuff to your house and you could have it any time with just a twist of a knob, but that is just speculation. When this happens sometime in the future, I'm sure that they will give it to the fire department first, because, did I mention that it puts out fires!  This stuff is the miracle product of the 21st century.  If the world was perfect this stuff would fall from the sky.<br /><br />Sure, there are other brands of this stuff; but, why pay pennies per bottle when what you really want is something that tells your friends and family that you have really made it.  With Fiji you don't need to buy a Mercedes or Ed Hardy gear to rub your affluence in your friends and family's face.<br /><br />If you have the time, you can make this stuff with some oxygen and twice as much hydrogen; but, good luck finding that stuff.  But, then again why would you when Fiji has done all the hard work for you.<br /><br />Once you have tried this stuff you will wonder how you have lived without it all your life.
