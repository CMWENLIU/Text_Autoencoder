I really love the lemon zing of this tea when brewed in the Keurig K cup brewer.  It seems to have more flavor than it does when steeped in the regular way.  I only wish more of Celestial Seasonings herbal varieties were available in K cups.  I'm hooked on K-cups for tea as well as coffee and hot cocoa is also excellent.
