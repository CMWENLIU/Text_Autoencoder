The Lurpak Danish butter holds its own in comparison with the most expensive French butter. I actually prefer Lurpak over expensive brands like Beurre d'Echire, Celes-sur-Belle, or Isigny-Ste-Mere.<br /><br />Lurpak is a true lactic, or cultured, butter, and it is full of flavor. Therefore a warning is in order: once you start using this stuff there is no going back. Land O'Lakes simply will not do anymore and you will be stuck searching for this stuff wherever you go from then on.
