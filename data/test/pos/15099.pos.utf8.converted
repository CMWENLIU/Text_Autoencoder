Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Nice southwestern style soup. Goes well with organic tortilla chips and any of your other favorite Border-style foods.  Prominent black pepper and chipotle flavor notes with yummy pieces of fire roasted veggies in a flavor rich broth. Approx. 280 kcal, 8g protein, and 9g fat per can. Add more of your favorite beans or cubed tofu for even more protein.
