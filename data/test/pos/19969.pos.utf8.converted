I always hated green tea and I tried a lot of them and it always ended up that I  give away the box of tea,<br />I bought this one and didn't try it for long time. but after I tried it I drunk 2 cups at once. I never did that before with other tea.<br />It is delicious. I very recommend it.  Give it a try.
