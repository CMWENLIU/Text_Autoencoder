Tip I learned - you don't have to keep it in the fridge! Even though it's recommended, it's not necessary.  2 drops equal one teaspoon of sugar.  I keep my bottle at work in a desk drawer and sweeten everything from tea to coffee.  I love the sweet taste of sugar, so I put in 8 drops per cup - and the drink is never sour, it's as sweet as real sugar, if not better.  At home I make lemonades.  About 20 drops per one large water bottle [24oz], a nice squeeze of lemon juice, and a few drops of lime juice.  If you don't have real lemons and limes, just use concentrated juice.
