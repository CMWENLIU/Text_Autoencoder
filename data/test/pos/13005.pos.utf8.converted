It was by chance I stumbled on to this candy, thanks to a friend who chose an Italian Restaurant for us in Portland, Oregon today.  (And a right fine restaurant it is too, I might add.) I did not think any of the wonder from Christmas as a girl could come rushing back so profoundly.  But there was this candy.  We Italians, of course, were Catholic.  We were poor as my parents were first generation, and so only had this candy at Christmas.  In its cute, well actually, very lovely artisticaly pleasing, boxes.  Because we took Holy Communion and the wafers from the priest's hands to our tongues were the same egg white as what coated these candies, it was like the candy held so much more meaning.  I would lift off the egg white and ponder the signifiance of Communion and how the candy was also a bit Holy.  Little kids and their ideas.  I had not seen it in fourty or more years (I am 61).  By chance, a friend and I were talking about it with relish (pun intended) only a week ago.  Where have we been?  It's been here (in the universe) all along!  I didn't remember the name but she and I both remembered the candy.  I can't WAIT to give her some.  YIPEE!  My parents, and all of their generation are gone now, but thanks to this discovery and ability to gift my friends, they have been resurrected emotionally again.
