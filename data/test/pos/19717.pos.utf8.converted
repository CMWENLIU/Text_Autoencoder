these are some of the best caramels ever. they are not the chewy kind that rip your teeth from your gums, they are very soft, u can smush them easily with ur tongue. flavor is great. as the other reviewer stated, there are little pieces of sea salt that crunch and its a wonderful combination of salty and sweet. l would buy them again,  l keep going back for more and the bag is almost empty.....
