I think the Grove Spiced Apple Cider K-Cups are absolutely delicious!<br /><br />I found the 8 oz. setting to be a bit too strong for me, so I used the 10 oz. setting on my brewer and, for me, the hot apple cider turns out perfect, just the way I want it.<br /><br />I have to watch my carbs, so I was pleasantly surprised to discover that these K-Cups are only one carb each.  Before ordering, I noted that under "Product Features" it states that the product is sugar-free; and under "Product Description" it clearly states that the product is sweetened with aspartame.  Therefore, I think it's fair to say that those who prefer sugar over other sweeteners, and/or can't stand the taste of aspartame, may not care for this product.<br /><br />As for me, I enjoy it well enough that I've put it on monthly subscription.
