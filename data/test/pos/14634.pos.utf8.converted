I live in San Diego, and this is a good buy. The cheapest I can find this box is at Walmart for about .25 cents more plus 7.75% sales tax. Since I am a member of Prime shipping (I buy a large quantity of books), shipping is free. So for me, this works out to be a good deal, and I always have a case of tea on hand.<br /><br />I'd like to pass on my method of making iced tea, which I can drink all day with no stomach upset whatsoever. Seems very few know that an excellent, smooth brew is made by simply placing two tea bags in 2 quarts of water. Leave this alone for a couple of hours and you will find the best iced tea ever. No sun needed, ever. I learned this from a boating friend who swore by it. No fuel, no heat, and it is nothing short of the most refreshing drink ever. Converts are all over San Diego.<br /><br />It has now been demonstrated that black tea (fermented green tea) also has the antioxident properties of green tea...so to your health!
