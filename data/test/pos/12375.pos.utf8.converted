Myself and my children have Celiac Disease and we LOVE this mix. I use it to make cupcakes and cakes. I haven't tried the cookies yet. I did have to fiddle with the recipe to make it taste the way I wanted it to (like the real gluteny version) and it comes out better!!! My husband and all my friends say they are the best cupcakes they have ever had.<br /><br />My changes for cupcakes were:<br /><br />Veg. oil instead of shortening (use the same amount as you would shortening)<br />1 whole egg and 2 egg whites (instead of 2 whole eggs)<br />3/4-1 cup of water (the batter will look a little soupy)<br /><br />I beat the eggs 1st, then add the oil (beat some more), add water and vanilla (beat again 'till mixed), then add the dry mix (beat until fully mixed). I bake them for 12 min. The centers will still look slightly raw but take them out anyway. Because they are gluten free they have a tendency to dry out. That is why you want them to take them out at 12 min. and not allow them to cont. to bake until fully cooked. Trust me they will finish cooking after you take them out. Allow to cool in pan for 2 min. then take them out of pan but cover them to retain moisture. After they are fully cooled frost and then recover. If you have a cupcake holder/carrier w/ a lid that is perfect.<br /><br />For cake:<br />Same ingredient change as cupcakes except I bake the cake for about 23-25 min instead of 28 like the recipe says. Also, grease and flour the pan.
