In a city like San Francisco, you'd think these would be easy to obtain.  I used to buy these at Trader Joe's but they've stopped selling them. After going through a panicky search through all the stores I normally frequent, I was glad to find it on Amazon. I prefer Crown Prince skinless boneless sardines in olive oil to the Reese brand because the Reese sardines are drier, although Reese's are prettier in the can with 6 small sardines packed as if they were swimming in a school. The Crown Prince sardines are larger (3 to a can). For me, sardines are a comfort food -- my favorite way to eat them is after removing the lid and pouring off some of the olive oil, filling the void with soy sauce and heating (can and all) on the stove. Because sardines are not large predator fish, they are not known to contain harmful levels of mercury.
