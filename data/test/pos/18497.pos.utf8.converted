No one had told me about this product because I am breastfeeding, but when I realized I was going to supplement at night I wanted to find a formula that would work well with breastfeeding.  I tried everything on the market and all of them had added sugars and made my baby boy extra gassy and some even gave him a rash.  I started reading reviews and found out about Earth's Best.  It is amazing! It smells good, it lessened his gassiness and he absolutely loves the taste.  I predominatey breastfeed, but the two bottles he gets a day are always Earth's Best...you won't be disapointed.  (Too much sugar and carbs in the others).<br /><br />I guess people did not understand my reference to carbs, strangely.  I am speaking about the carbs in the vast majority of baby formulas on the market.  They are not complex carbs and they are processeds with loads of white sugar and synthetic starches that are made in labs in china.  My point was that although Earth's Best is more expensive than the other formulas on the market, it is a valuable investment.  Breast milk first and foremost, but Earth's Best in my opinion is the next best thing because of its quality production. I am sorry if this was not clear.
