We have two Schnoodles, and their little tummies are pretty particular.  Chef Michael's Filet Mignon Dog Food absolutely delights their little palates (I actually had to pull them away from their bowls their first few times eating!), and, the best part of all, no more tummy upsets!  Well, we have an occasional loud burp right after eating because we've made such piggies of ourselves, but no more grumbling, rumbling tummies, and no more picky eating because they just don't like it.  We've finally found a winner with Chef Michael's!!!
