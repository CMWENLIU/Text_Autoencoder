I was torn between this Amoretti or 3 times the quantity for the same price with Torani.  I am so happy I went with Amoretti.  I love my Peppermint Mocha's but at $4 a pop they get expensive, fast.  I've had the Torani at local cafe shops and thought it tasted really sugary, not quite like peppermint.  The Amoretti is like having a candy cane in your drink.  It's similar to Starbucks, but in my opinion just a tad bit better.  I'd never heard of nor used Amoretti but now I'm a huge fan and plan to buy more!
