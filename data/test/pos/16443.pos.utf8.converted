I just got my order so I'm not here to comment on how the product behaves for my particular baking needs, but I can say that before I ordered the product I called the company with concerns about the possibility of cross-contamination of their nut flours.<br /><br />I was diagnosed with celiac disease, only after significant damage nearly killed me.  Even after years of healing on a GF Diet, my digestive tract is severely damaged.  I have to be ever vigilant about my product choices.<br /><br />All food reactions should be carefully examined, but they should not be immediately or unduly blamed on gluten contamination.  I don't work for nor do I currently receive any form of consideration from this company. This endorsement is strictly so others can make an informed decision!<br /><br />Their number is (888)-810-3212.  I recommend you call since manufacturing practices are subject to change, even though it seemed that this company is committed to providing a safe product for celiacs and others on a GF diet.<br /><br />I asked if I could quote them and got their permission to write:<br /><br />" Nut flours are processed in a separate facility which ONLY processes nut flours.  Therefore, there's NO possibility of cross-contamination during manufacturing from gluten."<br /><br />I am very comfortable using and recommending this product from a Gluten free point of view.  I shall update the review here and on my blog as I use their flours in recipe formulation.<br /><br />[...]
