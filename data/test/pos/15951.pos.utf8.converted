Ok, my kid is VERY finicky. Things have to be made a certain way, etc. She also has food allergies, which in turn exacerbate her eczema, as well as seriously limiting what she can eat, even healthy stuff. Flax is good for eczema, but she doesn't like it added to cereal, won't do the oil, even when mixed w/maple syrup, etc. Enter these WONDERFUL crackers. Dehydrated at low temps to preserve the oil (& thus all the nutritional benefits), with no artificial colors or flavors, no gluten or other common allergens, etc., so it's the best flax cracker on the market (my opinion). We got some from a local health food store & gave 'em a try. She LOVES them!!! The only thing I don't like is the price, which is why I buy in bulk here @ Amazon. They keep for a long time! We plan to try all the flavors. She doesn't like the Onion n Garlic one (no one does but me - they say too spicy/hot), but I'm betting the Maple Cinnamon will be a hit. Ditto for the 'regular' flavor. Thanks, Amazon, for the great price!
