I must say, I was a bit concerned about how I received the salt fish in the mail. I cautiously cooked the salt fish this morning, and was AMAZED and very pleasantly surprised at the excellent quality of this salt fish. I did not find one single bone in the fish, and here I was preparing myself for the long drawn out process of having to pull the fish apart and remove all the bones. I WAS VERY HAPPY that this salt fish was of such excellent quality, and I THANK the seller for making sure the quality was excellent. THANK YOU. I am VERY HAPPY and cannot wait to have my ackee and saltfish :)
