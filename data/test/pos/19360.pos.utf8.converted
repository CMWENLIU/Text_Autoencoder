The flavor is intense!  It is a wonderful snack - - - far tastier than pop corn - - - and with zero fat!  It's so easy to cook with; adding as little as two tablespoons to a casserole or soup injects serious flavor.  It's great for topping a salad, too.  I can't say enough good thing about Just Tomatoes Just Corn!
