Thank the Lord they began selling Fresh Whole Rabbit on Amazon!  I was invited to a square dance birthday party, and the e-vite said, "in lieu of gifts, please bring food,", so of course I had to make my world-famous rabbit twinkies!  The only problem was, my husband/father hadn't brought any rabbit meat home that day (instead he brought road-kill raccoon- good, but not for twinkies), so I ordered some of this Fresh Whole Rabbit with some of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz.  Needless to say, my rabbit twinkies were a big hit!  GOD BLESS AMAZON!<br /><br />P.S.<br />I know ya'll will be asking for my recipe, so here it is!<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz<br />Fresh Whole Rabbit<br />Uranium Ore<br />37 boxes of Twinkies<br />A dash of wolf urine<br /><br />Combine all ingredients in your Relaxman Relaxation Capsule, (It don't matter how much of each ingredient, I like to just pour buckets of each into the RRC until it's fuller than a stuffed porcupine).  Turn on, and once all them ingredients are mixed, fill the twinkies with the mixture (I like to save the twinkie filling to put on burgers).<br /><br />Hope ya'll enjoy!
