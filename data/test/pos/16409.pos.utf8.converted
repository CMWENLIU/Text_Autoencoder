its such a relief to find this product at a discounted price.  As for the exp. date no problem for us fellow caffeine addicts, expires in a year I'll most likely have to purchase another box before that. If you have purchased this product at your local starbucks you know how much they go for, would probably be cheaper to get hooked on columbia's other chief export j/k.
