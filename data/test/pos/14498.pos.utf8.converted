My children love this variety pack! It has all of their favorite little treat snacks. My only complaint is that occasionally a bag may only contain a very minuscule amount of the product. My children have a tendency to pour their bag of cookies out on a paper towel and count them out for fun or to trade one with a sibling. Inevitably I get the "mom my bag of cookies only had 4 inside and my brother got 6"! I dont really understand why they dont just put an equal amount in each bag but...what can you do?!
