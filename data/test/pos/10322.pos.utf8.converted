You are definitely missing something if you have not used Demerara sugar, from England, in your tea.  This sugar was first introduced to me on my first trip to the U.K. about 22 years ago.  It is so good that I brought several boxes home with me and savored them until my next international trip.  However, if you ask your local grocer to keep this product in their inventory, then you can just pluck it off of the shelf.  You'll save on the cost of fuel!  8]<br /><br />HOWEVER, WHAT REALLY MAKES A GREAT CUP OF TEA IS A COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING: U.K. WATER, U.K. CREAM, DEMERARA SUGAR, AND TWININGS TEA(S)!  I have never had better cups of tea when I am outside of the U.K.<br /><br />If you can't make it to the U.K., then just go with Demerara sugar and Twinings tea.  These two products alone will increase your enjoyment of tea! ENJOY!<br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />Sorry about some info. in the above review.  Apparently, this product is made on the Island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean.  All of my boxes have'ENGLAND' (whether I purchase them in England or the U.S.) written on them.  Got me?  However, it's still great sugar!
