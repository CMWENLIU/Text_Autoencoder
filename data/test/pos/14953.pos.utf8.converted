Let me first say that I love honey, and I truly believe in the healing powers of the magic golden liquid. Those out there who have never experienced any honey other than the clover honey so common in the U.S. have never lived. It was when I lived in Yemen for three years that I discovered my love for honey, because it was there where I discovered Sidr honey, which is absolutely, hands-down, the best honey I have ever tasted in my life.  There you can get it for about $60/kilo ($28 or so per pound)...if you get it in Europe or the U.S., expect to pay $150/kilo or more.  In my opinion, it was worth it, and I consumed at least 1/2kg (roughly a pound) per month.  Sidr, like Manuka, is quite potent, and so long as i ate it, i never was sick: no stomach bugs, no head colds.  Meanwhile those around me without the honey were constantly sick with GI infections.<br /><br />That brings me to Manuka.  I have recently started experiencing H.Pylori-like symptoms (dyspepsia stomach pain).  I do not trust most doctors anymore for any GI issues, because my travels around the world have brought me my fair share of GI bugs, and the doctors almost always fail to help. Three things I've always used that NORMALLY work: Oil of Oregano (good for giardia, e-coli, entamoeba hystolitica, etc), Grapefruit Seed Extract (good as an antiseptic and water disinfectant), and Sidr honey (good for preventing bugs).  However, whatever it is i have this time has not responded to any of those.  So, after extensive research, I was encouraged by what i read about Manuka...plus I love honey and i've always wanted to try it. So i ordered some.  Although I still have not received my shipment from Amazon (i just ordered it a couple days ago), I found the same exact honey (Wedderspoon Active 16+) in my local organic food market, for only $32 ($5 less than Amazon). Because i wanted relief from the pain NOW, i was willing to buy a second bottle.<br /><br />I've only started taking it today, so I will post a follow-up in a week or two.  But let me just say, this is some STRONG honey.  You can smell the antiseptic nature of it, and you can taste it (almost a hint of pinesol). It is very thick (somewhere between regular clover honey and honey butter) and somewhat creamy.  Flavor-wise (beyond strength), it is pretty good.  However, it is absolutely nowhere even close to Sidr on taste...I devour Sidr off of the spoon...this stuff I would only consume for medicinal reasons...and I'd also say that Tupelo tastes better as well.  Having said all that, medicinally, a spoonful (straight) of this stuff hit my stomach like a freight train, partly because of the acidic nature of honey, and partly because it was going to work. The first round made me feel a bit light-headed as well.  Both of those cleared up shortly.  About 2 hours later i started experiencing a lot of mucus draining in my head (similar to what i get when i take oil of oregano), so I knew that it was in my bloodstream working on other matters as well.  By the time i consumed my second dose (this time on a bit of a muffin--gluten free and dairy free), my stomach was already starting to feel a bit better.  The second dose, possibly because of the muffin as a buffer, didn't hit my stomach as hard.<br /><br />For those with h.pylori: Please note that I also have an order of mastic gum on the way. Based on everything I've read, mastic gum seems to be the most effective cure.  I'm hoping that between mastic gum and munaka, i'll beat this thing. I don't know if Manuka on its own is strong enough to kill all cases of h.pylori.<br /><br />To conclude:<br />- Taste:  Do NOT buy this for taste. It tastes good, but if you're going to spend $37/pound, find yourself some Yemeni Sidr honey...if you can find it in a very raw form, it is also quite a strong medicine.  Also, Tupelo honey at about $7/pound tastes better than Manuka.<br />- Medicinal Properties: This is some potent stuff...the most potent honey i've ever tasted. I've got high hopes, and it's possible that once my dyspepsia is gone, i'll keep an emergency bottle of this in the cupboard (honey doesn't really go bad)<br />- Rating: Worth all five stars I gave it. I can't say it'll cure cancer, but it seems to be working on my stomach.<br /><br />Good luck.
