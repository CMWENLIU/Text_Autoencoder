This stuff is absolutely wonderful.  Here in the southern U.S., where bacon and ham hocks are the "traditional" flavorings for just about everything, Goya's ham bouillon is the only low-calorie substitute I've found.  You can't tell the difference!  It even helps ground turkey taste more like ground pork sausage, etc.  Well worth it!
