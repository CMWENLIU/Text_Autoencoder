Erythritol is the only intestine-friendly sugar alcohol and has the most sweetness per caloric content of any sugar alcohol. Sucralose, on the other hand, is also in this product and is made by manipulating sugar molecules with chlorine.. yuck.<br /><br />Regardless, I prefer this ingredient list to other chocolate syrups.<br /><br />Ingredients: water, erythritol, glycerin, cocoa, natural flavors, citric acid, xanthan gum, salt, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, caramel color, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, vanillin, artificial flavor, zinc sulfate vitamin e acetate, niacinamide and biotin.<br /><br />There is a bitter aftertaste, but it's sugar free for a reason and I'm sure anyone interested in this product will get used to it.
