This plant food is incredible. It's super-concentrated plant fuel. Whether you have a green thumb or not, I highly recommend Schultz. It's inexpensive and lasts forever (only 7 drops per quart of water). If you tend to notice last-minute that your plants are dying, this stuff will save the plant.<br /><br />It does promote incredible growth, though, so if your plants are healthy and you start using it every time you water, be prepared for that.<br /><br />I've never tried it on outdoor plants (I live in an apartment), but I've heard nothing but good from friends who also use Schultz.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Incredible value, Super-Concentrated, and definitely worth checking out.
