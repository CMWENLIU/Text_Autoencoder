As a 'Brit abroad' I have been receiving shipments of stem ginger via visiting friends from the UK but now I see it's here on Amazon!  Stem ginger is distinctly different from crystallized ginger or any other types of chopped ginger that I've found here.  When I described it to a co-worker she had no concept of what I was talking about.<br />In England we use stem ginger for a variety of purposes - making ginger cake with 'bits' in, in savoury cooking e.g. with chicken and with melon balls as an appetizer.  I even used to have stem ginger sandwiches as a child!  Stem ginger also pairs well with rhubarb if you're making a pie or crumble.  BTW if you are going to try the melon idea make sure you chop the globes of ginger really small - it's strong stuff!  Even the syrup is nice poured over icecream.
