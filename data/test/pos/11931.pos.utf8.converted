I am lucky to be able to purchase premium food for my two dogs, and I always choose Blue Buffalo. I have a Great Dane and a Sophie (we have no idea what she is) and both love the sweet potato and fish blend the best. Sophie has some digestive issues on other low end food, and this has cleared all of those issues up. My great dane doesn't eat as much with this food as she did with a lower end food, it is very filling for her. I did have a one time issue with a bag arriving split open and half empty, and Amazon's amazing customer service came through for me. They immediately replaced the bag at no charge and shipped it next day for me, no questions asked. The price for this food is high, but I feel that my dog's are a lot healthier because of the higher quality food. The price is great (and cheaper than my local pet mega-mart), I just wish that Amazon would offer a subscribe and save!
