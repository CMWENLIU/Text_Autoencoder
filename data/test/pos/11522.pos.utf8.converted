I ordered the oat groats by mistake, thinking they were steel cut oats. (my fault not theirs) Actually, the oat groats were better and more flavorful. I cook them in a crockpot which is a time saver and much less work. The product was well packed, very fresh and a great value. I wont buy steel cut oats again and when I buy the oat groats I will by them from this seller.
