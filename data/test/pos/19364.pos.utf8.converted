Jolly Time Buttery Seasoning for Popcorn.  Just call it THE Popcorn Salt.  It's fine grained, doesn't clot and has a taste that doesn't overwhelm you.  Most "buttery" popcorn salts are too much this or too much that.  There are even a few that you have to refrigerate!<br /><br />My local Fred Meyer stopped selling the Jolly Time Popcorn about a year ago.  I've tried to get them to reorder it but they'd rather sell their own store brand.  I've tried every other popcorn salt I can find in the local stores but they're no good.  I'm glad to finally find it here on Amazon. I've used Jolly Time for nearly 10 years, so you can imagine how I stick to products I enjoy.
