I've been buying Illy Medium Roast espresso and decided to try something new. Lavazza is the winner! I have been ordering it from Amazon for months now. The 4-pack is a great deal. Nice flavor, not too bold or bitter, even a little sweet? Perhaps I am not equipped to describe it as a coffee connoisseur, but I do know it makes my mornings a little better!
