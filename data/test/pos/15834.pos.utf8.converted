My neighbor had a blind tasting trial between Mc cain's and Country Choice, at one of our recent block parties, and no one could tell the difference. After that I bought some Country Choice at Trader Joes and can readily attest that Country Choice is every bit as delicious as my old brand (Mc Cain's). It's nice to eat organic and save money.
