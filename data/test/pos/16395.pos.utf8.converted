I've tried three brands of smoked salmon.<br />Chicken of the Sea smoked salmon in the 3oz package is by far my favorite.<br />I pour the liquid from the pouch onto dried cat food, the the cats love it.<br />Rinsing the smoked salmon in the pouch removes the salt taste in my experience.<br /><br />Good at room temperature, nibbled from the pouch and on sandwiches, but I also use it for omelette's and salads.<br />Am here because I got tired of asking store managers to please stock more & decided to buy online in bulk.<br /><br />It keeps fresh in the pouch a long time btw. I've found pouches misplaced for years and it still tasted just fine.
