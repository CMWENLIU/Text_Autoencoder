We used to be able to find this flavor in town-that all changed last year only sours, wintergreen and spearmint (frankly YUCK!!) are avail. I LOVE the cinnamon flavor, can't understand why I have to buy on line...but here I am. They arrived quickly and were all sealed up nice and tight. I will be back to buy more at a later date. If you love the cinnamons here they are!! Love these and Peppermint Tic Tacs.
