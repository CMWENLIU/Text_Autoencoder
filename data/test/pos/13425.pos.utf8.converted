I bought this item because of the healthy reputation of the product.  I like to make popcorn in oil and I do usually cook something in oil about once a week.  I can tell you that this is honestly the best oil I have ever used.  It smells terrific and makes the food taste great.  My popcorn is light and fluffy like hot air popcorn, but has a nice rich taste like oil cooked popcorn.  When you open the container you are greeted with a terrific coconut smell.  For those of you who do not like coconut, it does not stay with the food once you heat it up.  Amazon is the place to buy this, the price is outstanding and this size will last you a long time.
