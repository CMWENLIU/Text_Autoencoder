This is my 1st time to write a review only because I totally believe in this product. I give this to my 3yo and 1.5yo kids at the onset of their viral infection (colds, cough or fever). This is very effective if given within the 1st few hours of symptoms and taken every few hours for maintenance. They may still have the symptoms but it wont be as bad or you may experience shortened sick days.  This is a must-have in our home! I also take it at the first sign of symptoms and the virus wont push thru.<br /><br />Overall I think it's worth the cost compared to buying medicines and going to the doctor if symptoms persisted w/o <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK08OC">Wedderspoon Raw Organic Manuka Honey Active 16+, 17.6-Ounce Jar</a>.
