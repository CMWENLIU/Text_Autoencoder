I purchased this high quality Ass Basket recently and you can bet your bottom dollar that it lives up to all the expectations you would hope for in an ass basket. There was some confusion on my end prior to receiving this in the mail. I thought I had purchased a basket of donkey figurines. Knick knacks, if you will. One of my hobbies is collecting donkey statues, pictures and paraphenalia. I just can't get enough of these magnificent creatures. They have such personality, and their work ethic is something to admire. It's just amazing what can happen when a horse a pony come together in mutual affection. The title "work horse" really belongs to these proud creatures, and I have worked tirelessly to get recognition and state funding for these jackasses. When my package arrived at my rear door, I was originally furious, but threw some of this on a beef brisket and I tell ya, I got a swift ass kickin indeed! Even offered some to my neice Fanny. She went ahead and ordered her own Ass Basket and her whole family loves it! I have found this product to be a great gift to buy in lieu of flowers and hand lotion. I've started giving it to folks for all occasions, even weddings, as well as a friend's funeral. You'd think people would be offended, but the thing is, people like hot sauce whether they're happy, sad, married or dead. Think about it, who doesn't like a hot meal? That's what I'm sayin. Just be careful though. My dog ate half a bottle of this and it came outta both ends on my kitchen rug, which is wool. Can't get the stains out! Looks like it's a total loss but I'm gonna try Magic Eraser one more time.
