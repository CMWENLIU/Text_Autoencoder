Anyone who's read my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TXT5I8">Remembering Smell: A Memoir of Losing--and Discovering--the Primal Sense</a> knows that I acquired a taste disorder several years ago. Briefly stated, since mid-1997 I'm unable to taste "sweet", and all foods and most drinks (with the exception of water and milk) taste over-salted, even when they contain no salt whatsoever. However, I can still enjoy flavors, and I've always loved chocolate. So, what chocolate candy comes near to be as satisfying as it used to be?<br /><br />The dark variety probably comes as close as any chocolate ever will. Because it's not as sweet as milk chocolate, there's less sweetness for me to miss, and the slightly bitter taste of the confection somewhat counteracts the saltiness I now endure. (I've had to learn to like things as they now are, not as they once were.)<br /><br />The DARK CHOCOLATE WITH WHOLE HAZELNUTS bar by Ritter Sport is a wonderful treat that I habitually wash down with non-fat milk. The bar is a manly 3.5 oz chunk chock full of whole hazelnuts. If I was the hardy sort to climb Mt. Everest's North Face, I'd take along a supply of these bars to keep up my energy and morale. However, as the 3-serving sized bar contains 210 calories and 15 grams of fat per serving, an entire bar may not be a couch potato's prudent dessert to chase down the chips with nacho-cheese dip and Meat Lover's pizza while watching the football game. And it doesn't go very well with beer.<br /><br />The hazelnut content is exemplary; I can count at least fifteen whole nuts in half the bar in front of me now. (OK, ok. So I already ate 1.5 servings. Just don't tell my wife, an honorary member of the Food Police.)  According to the ingredients list, the nuts are coated with "food grade shellac wax." The result of an Internet search reveals:<br /><br />"Food grade shellac wax is made from 'lac', the red, hardened secretion of the insect by the same name ... simply scraped from the (insect's) host tree, dried to a powder, melted down and then treated with a neutralizing alkali, which is a nitrogenous vegetable substance, so it will dissolve."<br /><br />Hmm. Well, I don't think the source of the shellac will deter me from future consumption of the bar; it's just too good.
