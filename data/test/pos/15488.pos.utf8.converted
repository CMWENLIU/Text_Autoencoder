I have been on a crusade to lower my sodium intake and when I found this product I was pleased. I don't use Ketchup on anything but do use it in several recipes so the no salt was a real factor.<br /><br />I have never liked ketchup on anything, even fries, but I do like this product. It has a great tangyness and full flavor without any salt!!!<br /><br />I used it for a meatloaf recipe I have and it came out really good.<br /><br />One small drawback is that it seems to have a relitively short shelf life so I just keep the extra bottles in the fridge.<br /><br />This is a fantastic product.  More food product companies need to take this route.  We need healthier food and at the same time it tastes better when done right.  Kudos to Hinze for a great product.
