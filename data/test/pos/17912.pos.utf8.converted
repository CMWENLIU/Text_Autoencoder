My mother gave me this to try.  It is wonderful!  You only need three or four drops to sweeten a tall glass of iced tea. I have tried other Stevia products in the past and found it diffucult to regulate the amount. It is very easy to use too much stevia powder leading to an overpowering taste.  This product is perfect because the Stevia is already dispersed in liquid and ready to use.  The dropper makes it easy to dispense--one drop at a time.  I have known for years that you can make your own Stevia liquid sweetener by adding stevia powder to water, but that has been too much trouble to bother with.  SweetLeaf has done it for me and added some flavors to boot. Thank-you SweetLeaf.<br /><br />The flavoring seems mild to me, but I only use a few drops of this sweetener at one time.  If the lemon flavor was stronger I would probably buy the plain stevia.  A hint of flavor is just perfect. If I want lemon, I squeeze it fresh. In fact, I squeeze fresh lemons and/or limes daily for their health benefits. I sweeten my morning "lemonade" with organic grade B maple syrup (high in minerals) and I will continue to use the maple syrup in my morning beverage. I will use the Stevia to sweeten other things throughout the day.<br /><br />Off topic: The BEST citrus press I have found is by Kitchenaid (not the stand mixer attachment), the free standing juicer. No metal parts touch the fruit and the machine is FAST.  Easy to clean up too--goes right into the dishwasher. If you are interrested in learning more about the benefits of fresh squeezed lemon and/or lime juice, you may want to read the book EATING ALIVE. My vision has improved significanly as a result of drinking my fresh squeezed lemon/lime juice daily.<br /><br />I am looking forward to trying the Chocolate Raspberry and English Toffee liquid Stevia in my coffee.  I am a big Torani fan, so I will be delighted if the flavored Stevia offers the same or comparable flavor and sweetness to my lattes.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned using coconut oil in her coffee.  I much prefer organic coconut milk in my coffee. I use organic coconut oil from Tropical Traditions(the BEST)--the original hand processed (not green label or expeller pressed)--but didn't care for coconut oil straight up in my coffee--it floats on the top. Even the higher fat content coconut milk blends with the coffee without leaving an oil puddle on top. Coconut oil is very healthy.  You can read more about it at www.coconutoil.com  Also note that not all coconut oils are comparable.  I have tasted some that are NASTY!<br /><br />I store my opened bottles of SweetLeaf Stevia in the refrigerator.<br /><br />If you are an artificial sweetener fan, I encourage you to visit www.mercola.com and enter your artificial sweetener preference in his search field to gather some info on it. Then, consider trying this product.<br /><br />I also use agave (similar to honey, only better) and real maple syrup as sweeteners. They have more calories than the Stevia, but are both excellent choices for sweeteners.<br /><br />When using Stevia, I encourage you to start with less and add more if needed. It doesn't take much to add sweetness.  This is a great product if you don't add too much.
