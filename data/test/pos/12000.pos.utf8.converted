The Keurig system has brought me back to drinking coffee and tea. I went from having one cup of coffee a year to having a couple of cups each week.<br /><br />I have to stick to decaf, so I was very happy to see that there are flavored decaf coffees for the K-cup system. I especially enjoy Timothy's brand of Hazelnut decaf over Gloria Jean's version. Timothy's seems to have a richer, fuller and a bit smoother taste over Gloria Jean's. The Gloria Jean's tastes watered down to me. The hazelnut flavor almost disappears when I add milk. Timothy's holds it flavor even with half and half added.
