I've tried my entire life to replicate a good plate of diner-style hash browns, I've finally found the trick.  These are essentially shelf-stable dehydrated potatoes.  I followed the box directions to cover in boiling water for a few minutes, then fry them up in margarine.  It worked great!  No question the best hash browns I've ever made, and a great accompaniment to my marinated steak grilled over an open fire.  see story and photo at http://www.baribob.net/?p=816
