I love a bold, strong coffee without a bitter taste, and this has proven to be my favorite. Strong and flavorful, even the decaf version is excellent. My second favorites are Green Mountain's French Roast and Timothy's espresso blend, if that's any help. If you like strong coffee, definitely give this a try!
