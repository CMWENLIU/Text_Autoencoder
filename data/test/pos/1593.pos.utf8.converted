I use this organic tomato powder in my raw dehydrated seed crackers, and it's wonderful.  I use 8 cups of assorted seeds, and add in spices, along with 1/2 cup of this tomato powder.  These seed crackers are a delicious part of my vegan diet.  I had originally bought some raw seed crackers made by a company, and the price was outrageous.  3 ounces for $5.  I can make many pounds of seed crackers for about $10 - and that's what I do, and why I use this tomato powder.  One would think this powder could easily be bought at Whole Foods or other grocery stores, but I've never been able to find it, and Amazon is where it's at!  This is not the first time I've purchased it, and it won't be the last.
