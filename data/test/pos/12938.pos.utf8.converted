These tomatoes are so delicious - good price but miles above the flavor of other store brand tomatoes. I don't know if they are 'officially' certified or not but I thought they were really good, as did my Sicilian husband. I noticed other reviewers had problems with badly dented cans. I had about 4 of them somewhat dented, but not badly enough to worry me. I can see where they could've been much worse depending on the shipper/delivery person (gotta love it when "this side down" is the side that's upright and sideways on your porch).  I used them for a new "Sunday Gravy" Sicilian/Italian recipe I tried that simmered for about 16 hours, and it turned out very well. It wouldn't have been the same with regular canned tomatoes. One bit of advice, don't toss the puree!  If you don't need that much liquid either save it for later, or simmer your sauce down until thick enough so you don't lose it.
