When I saw this, I thought it would be three small silver bags of coriander seeds, with each bag being big enough to fill my now empty glass Coriander Seeds bottle from Citarella. However, when it came, I was shocked - each bag is about as big as a bag of chips - it is an INSANE amount of coriander. My husband couldn't stop laughing when I showed him. The product is good, I've used the seeds in several recipes already, but I had to give away 2 of  the bags to relatives because honestly no one person could ever use that much.
