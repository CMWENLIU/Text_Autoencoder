This is much higher quality and much less expensive than the Thai Kitchen fish sauce in my local supermarket.<br />  I use it in almost everything: it enhances the fish flavor of any fish preparation or sauce to go with fish. In dishes that don't have fish in them it acts as a great flavor enhancer. I'm hooked for life! The only thing I regret is not ordering two units (total of four bottles).<br />Haven't tried cooking Thai food yet-I just use it for all my cooking.
