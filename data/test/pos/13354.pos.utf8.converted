PURE, UNPASTEURIZED, UNFILTERED, ORGANIC, KOSHER, RAW HONEY<br />Love it, love it, love it.<br /><br />I rarely recommend buying something that's more expensive than any "regular" type, but organic is well worth it as far as I'm concerned. Any time you can afford organic I believe it's worth the extra money because it's all about your health, not just taste. Everything you eat affects your health. You either pay extra now for the good stuff, or you pay a lot more later in the way of doctor bills and possibly even an early death.<br /><br />I get raw (unheated, never heat treated) honey from a friend now and then, she has her own hives, and Y.S. Organic honey is just as good if not better. Don't tell her, but I think this may be better than hers because her raw honey is not certified organic and kosher. Who knows where her bees have been. ;)<br /><br />I know honey can taste different depending on what flowers the bees pollinate, and I'm not sure what kind of honey this is (what kind of flowers) but the flavor is just right. Not too mild, not too strong, not too sweet. I know I sound like Goldie Locks, but it's just right.<br /><br />With honey bees rapidly disappearing from the world (scientists don't know why) I like the idea of organic hives - making sure chemicals are not spread around that may harm the bees as well as the people who eat their honey.<br /><br />One word of caution though, when you shop for this honey. If you don't read the label carefully you might buy one that is not organic. Y.S. Bee Farms makes both organic and not organic, and they are both raw and unpasteurized. I uploaded photos to show you the two different bottles (see above). Organic is in glass jars, and more expensive. Non-organic is in plastic jars and a little less money. But if you don't look closely you may think the non-organic is organic because the name of the company is "Y.S. Organic Bee Farms", and that name is on all jars, organic or not. To make sure your honey, or any food item, is truly organic, make sure it has the certified organic seal, as this product does.<br /><br />~ ~ ~<br /><br />What you should know about raw honey vs. pasteurized honey:<br /><br />Raw honey is the concentrated nectar of flowers gathered by bees (naturally, that's what they do) that comes straight from the bee hive (through an extracting process in a controlled setting). Raw honey is unheated, pure, unpasteurized, and unprocessed. Raw honey is the healthiest choice amongst the various forms of honey as it has the most nutritional value and contains amylase, an enzyme concentrated in flower pollen which helps predigest starchy foods like breads. Raw honey often has a thick yellow look to it, almost like yellow wax, when at cooler room temperatures. If the room is warmer it may turn a more golden color and look like a very thick syrup.<br /><br />Honey is an alkaline-forming food, which means raw honey contains ingredients similar to those found in fruits, which become alkaline in the digestive system. It doesn't ferment in the stomach and it can be used to counteract acid indigestion. When mixed with ginger and lemon juices, it also relieves nausea and supplies energy.<br /><br />Most of the honey found in the supermarket is not raw. You can usually tell the difference by looking at it, when it's not raw it usually looks like a thick amber liquid you can almost see through, like a light colored thin syrup. This is because it has been processed and pasteurized (heated at 70 degrees Celsius or more, followed by rapid cooling) and filtered so that it looks cleaner and smoother, more appealing on the shelf, and easier to handle and package because it's not as thick as raw honey.<br /><br />Pasteurization kills any yeast cell in the honey and prevents fermentation. It also slows down the speed of crystallization in liquid honey and that's why it looks "cleaner" and smoother. But, when honey is heated and pasteurized its delicate aromas, yeast and enzymes (that are responsible for activating vitamins and minerals in the body system) are partially destroyed. For this reason raw honey is assumed to be more nutritious than honey that has undergone heat treatment.<br /><br />CAUTION:  Bee products may cause allergic reactions in some people. Honey is not recommended for children under two.
