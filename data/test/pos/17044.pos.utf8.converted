Full of Antioxidants, Minerals and Vitamins. 6-units</a><br /><br />Perfectly Petite is a stellar way to burn your muffin top to oblivion! As a working mom of three under six years old, and about to attend my 20 year high school reunion, it is important to aid my body in fat burning and appetite suppression. Not to mention helping boost my energy to get through my work day and into the 'Second Shift' at home. So I decided to try this little concoction out.<br /><br />I don't like the thought of consuming a cocktail of fake chemical crap, but I feel confident that it contains more natural ingredients as well as essential vitamins and amino acids. It's sugar free and zero calories. It has given me a steady level of energy and alertness throughout the day and it doesn't give me a headache or crash at the end of the day. Occasionally, I'll feel a slight level of general irritation like some energy drinks can make you feel, but that could just because of fatigue and the typical end-of-day woes.<br /><br />After taking one Perfectly Petite each day for the last month, I've noticed a change in how my clothes fit. My mid-section postpartum inner-tube and saddlebags are looking more slim and I can see some familiar muscle tone peeking through. Of course, working out more rigorously is key in helping this product do its job even better. I don't believe in any miracle weight loss pills, you have to do the hard work to get the weight off and keep it off, but Perfectly Petite is a great partner in the process. I'm down to 120 pounds and not looking to lose much more weight - just tone up the ab-flab.<br /><br />The passion fruit flavor is just okay, but a little too sweet for me. It tastes much better combined in another drink. I've mixed it with apple juice and I've also tried it with green tea. I like it the best with green tea. You can also store it in the fridge and drink it chilled for a better taste.
