These were purchased, not only for myself, but also for my son away in college. He absolutely loves it. After he got his friends hooked on it, they decided to call it 'god'. It is very spicy and very good. The price here is very reasonable. I also sent them to Iraq and Afghanistan for our soldiers, they wrote me said this is the gourmet ramen. If you prefer not so spicy, you could scale back what you put in from the spice pack. You could also get fancy by adding vegetables(fresh or frozen)/mushrooms, meat/shrimp.
