The previous reviewer did not read the description, nor pay attention to the picture on the tin.<br /><br />The tin clearly shows both green tea leaves, and matcha powder. The product description also clearly states that this product is "organic green tea powder known as matcha with fine, organic green leaf tea". In other words, the tea bag contains green tea leaves, along with a bit of matcha powder.<br /><br />It is an excellent tea if you are the casual tea drinker, or someone looking for a healthy, tasty and organic green tea (with a bit of added benefit of the matcha powder). If you are a true matcha drinker, then this is not the product for you.<br /><br />I find this to be an excellent organic green tea.
