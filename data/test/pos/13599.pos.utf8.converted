It's a rubber ball, and it's, uh, super.<br /><br />What kid doesn't enjoy a superball, right?  My son really digs this toy, especially in the elementary school gym after basketball practice when he can throw it as hard as he wants in any direction, and the ball literally just goes nuts.  This is a great environment for this toy...a racquetball court would be great, too...no, jai-alai would be the best!<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />Yes, Dad likes playing with it, too.  Go figure.  My only complaint is that it's not that big, rather disappointingly small.  It's only a little bit bigger than the cheapo superballs you get out of the grocery store coin machines.  It's a little bit smaller than a squash ball, definitely smaller than a racquetball.  My adult take on this toy is that one the size of a racquetball, or just slightly smaller than a baseball would be the best.  The downside of this is, and I can see the Wham-O liability lawyers toiling over the risk analysis, is that given this ball's density, a bigger ball would be a lot more massive, heavy, and could do some real damage to property and person if either were to be, ah, forcefully contacted.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a classic toy, as basic as you can get, and it does not disappoint.  Me, I'd like to see it offered in a larger size, but I understand why that's probably not going to happen.
