It is hard to find organic canola oil at a regular store.  The specialty stores have it but the prices are really high and the bottles small.  LaTourangelle has a nice line of oils from Europe but they are generally quite expensive.  Amazon once again comes through with a fantastic price.  I usually buy three or four packs or however many Amazon has "in stock" so I don't run out.  The cans are pretty enough to leave on my counter (one at a time) and while at 16.9 ounces they aren't large, the size is consistent with other brands of organic oils and getting three, or nine or twelve cans at once is very convenient for me. I've been using LaTourangelle exclusively for almost two years.  I periodically check locally for less expensive organic oil but I've never found any store who can beat Amazon's price.
