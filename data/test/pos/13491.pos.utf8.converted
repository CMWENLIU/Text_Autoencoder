I have to admit, I know next to nothing about baking, so there wasn't a chance I'd use these for baking. I was looking for a chocolate deal that would satisfy my sweet tooth and didn't have to be refrigerated. I love these squares, I eat one every few days and they taste great to me. Maybe someday I'll use them for baking but as an occasional snack they're exactly what I wanted.
