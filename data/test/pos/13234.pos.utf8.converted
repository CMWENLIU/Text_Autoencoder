This snack defies the rule of "if it tastes good, it must be bad for you."  I am into the low-carb diets and was thrilled to see that this only had 3% carbs in a serving.  I am also diabetic so I need to watch my carbs.  This is a fantastic and tasty solution.  Snacking on these helps me easily make it between meals without being too hungry and gorging on things that I should not be consuming like office donuts.  It also has 10% iron and 34% fiber.  The taste is a little like peanuts but the texture is crunchier - more like half-popped popcorn kernels.
