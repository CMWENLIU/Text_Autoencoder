This coffee has a nice, smooth flavor.  Even though it is an extra bold, but then again I like stronger coffees.  This is strong, smooth and not bitter.  I know some coffees that are strong can have a bitter flavor, but not the starbucks Sumatra.  The smell of course is wonderful!  I like the whole bean because grinding them at home, I can increase it's flavor and it keeps the flavor fresh.
