I have multiple food allergies, i need gluten free, egg free & soy free foods. I think these are great and have a good soft texture unlike most gluten free breads.  I am so happy that I can still eat  gluten free breads without soy & egg in it.  For me these are awesome.  Much better than even GF bakery stuff I've tried in the past.  But then again, for me it's hard to find gluten free, egg free, soy free things.  Ener-G & Enjoy Life goods are a god-send!!  Thank you!
