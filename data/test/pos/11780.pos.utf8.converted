Vegan. Natural. Excellent quality. Chana dal is one of my favorites from when I lived in India & Nepal. Dal is the primary protein source for vegetarians in South Asia and can also be a great part of any vegan diet. Here is "Greg's Flavorful Chana Dal" recipe: Pour safflower oil in bottom of crock pot or deep fryer (.25"/.5 cm) and heat; after hot add minced fresh ginger, minced fresh garlic, minced fresh onion, and minced fresh habenero or chilis (optional) to taste and cook/stir for 1-3 minutes; add 3 parts water for however much chana dal you intend to cook and boil; then add chana dal; cook and occasionally stir for about 1.5 hrs or until creamy consistency. If preparing small portion, then do first steps in small frypan and transfer to cooking pot so oil is not too much. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference.
