I couldn't disagree more with the previous review. No, they're not chocolate, they're soy. But they are delicious!! I find myself eating handfuls right out of the bag, but they are also great in cookies. They have a buttery, highly vanilla flavor, and a handful of them makes me think instantly of a Dairy Queen ice cream cone. If you love vanilla you should love these just as candy.
