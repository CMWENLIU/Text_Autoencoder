I first heard of Tiptree Little Scarlet when Bonnie S. Benwick raved about it in "The Washington Post" in 2004, claiming that the little jar of preserve "happens to be worth the $10 to $13 it now goes for". Really? A jam? I've never cared much for jams. I find them too sweet for my taste and of invariably poor texture. Gross texture, really. But my curiosity was piqued when I found out that James Bond had Little Scarlet  on whole wheat toast for breakfast in Ian Fleming's "From Russia with Love". The book, not the movie. Tiptree brand is owned by Wilkin & Sons, Ltd., a family business that has been farming in and around the town of Tiptree in Essex, England for 300 years. They started producing preserves in 1885, and the company considers Little Scarlet "the jewel in the crown of Wilkin & Sons delicious range of jams and marmalades."<br /><br />Wilkin & Sons make a large and diverse line of preserves, jellies, and marmalades, including 6 different strawberry preserves and one strawberry jelly. Little Scarlet is distinguished by the berry from which it takes its name. The Little Scarlet is a particular variety of strawberry that originated in the United States. It's a fickle crop, and Tiptree is believed to be the world's only commercial grower of the diminutive berries. They are described as "a tiny, intensely-flavoured strawberry", no more than 2 cm in length. They're the size of raspberries, and you can see whole berries in the Little Scarlet preserve. They're grown on the Tiptree estates, which makes their quantity limited, and the company awards "vintage status" to the years that produce particularly good crops. 2006 was a vintage year.<br /><br />Little Scarlet preserve has a stronger flavor than other strawberry jams and an excellent texture. It is very sweet. Even though I normally cringe at sweet stuff, I am attracted to Little Scarlet by the rich flavor. And the texture is incomparable to supermarket and most "gourmet" brands of jam, which tend to suffer an unappetizing gelatinous texture, the product of too much pectin. Tiptree adds pectin only when necessary, and they are careful to add no more than is needed. Little Scarlet has a smooth, substantial texture whether you're eating a berry or the stuff in between. It costs twice as much in the US as in the UK and is labeled "preserve" here and "conserve" there. But it's not Tiptree's most expensive jam. That distinction belongs to the Mulberry preserve, whose fruit is picked from fewer than 20 trees that grow behind the company's factory.
