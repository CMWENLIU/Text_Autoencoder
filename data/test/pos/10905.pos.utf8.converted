I discovered BetterOats oatmeal at a local store.  I have never eaten instant oatmeal as it never appealled to me.  I am having problems with my teeth and it is difficult for me to chew.  So I figured I would get some.  Wow it was so good and so easy to fix.  So I immediately popped onto Amazon (as I order many things from them) and was delighted they carried the product.  However, what a shock I had when I saw what they were charging.  It looks as though they come from other places but the cost per box is ridiculous.  I am paying 50 cents per box, or 2/$1.00. at Save-A-Lot.  Now this place doesn't carry a huge variety so I checked out Food Lion and Giant which carried each box (5 packets in each) for $1.49.<br /><br />I felt I should let customers know about this pricing on Amazon.  Perhaps Amazon will read this review and might consider selling them themselves and put in a price between 50 cents to $1.49 with Free Shipping and maybe the "subscribe and save" option. I checked around Amazon and found prices to really vary -------  for 3 boxes it varies from $4.13 to $7.49 a box, for 6 boxes $4.13.  And I am paying 50 cents to $1.49 a box.
