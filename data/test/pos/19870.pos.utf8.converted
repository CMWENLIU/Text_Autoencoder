This is a wonderful food and a staple for my diet bc it doesn't cause any allergic reactions, any heartburn, any gastric probs.  It is easy to prepare and quite bland in itself so that it absorbs flavor from anything you add it to..soup, stew, stir-fry. Also good cold.<br />I have tried a number of different companies selling SaiFun and Dynasty is the best in texture, size, and ease of preparation.<br />A favorite family dish is cooked/well-drained  SaiFun wok-fried with  small broccoli florets and sauteed mushrooms [garlic, garlicpepper,etc.]
