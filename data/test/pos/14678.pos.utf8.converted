I really love the texture and taste of Quinoa flour. The way I use it is half and half with Bob's red mill all-purpose flour, to replace the whole wheat I used before, and add Xanthum gum (for the all-purpose) and baking soda. I've made banana bread, pancakes, and biscuits this way, it's excellent! It is a little on the expensive side when compared to wheat flour but is more nutritious and for the gluten intolerant it is a good choice.
