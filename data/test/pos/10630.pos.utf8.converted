I have recurring mole problems, lost count how many years now. Tried many things, but only this "Out of Sight" worked. This is my story:<br />1) First encounter years ago, surprise, what's up with these bumps?<br />2) Just tidy up the surface. Never mind that.<br />3) Ran water down the tunnel until water came out the other end. Very satisfying, but just a waste of water. Made the whole place muddy and the creature liked it even more.<br />4) Invested in a plunger type trap. Expensive and reusable, sounded good. Not quite. I was excited the first time it triggered, got my gloves on and plastic bag ready. The spikes went down a couple inches, but no catch. Tried a few more times with the same result. Even tied bricks on the top half, but the trap became unbalanced and did not plunge well. Trashed it.<br />5) Poison "peanut". Do not like poisons, but maybe just for this one. Carefully dropped nuts into tunnels as directed. No noticable result, but creature was gone late fall. Used it again early next season, at which time I concluded that it did not work. The creature likes worms and bugs, not deadly smelling chemical.<br />6) Wire type trap (like a rat trap). It fits inside the tunnel. Hard to use - the trap is directional and the tunnel must be disturbed for the deployment. My creature ran over or around it, never triggering it. The creature probably hit trap's frame and changed course. Would have been better if the trap is narrower and fits into a 1.5" tunnel.<br />7) Saw it digging undergroud once (just once). Drove a pitch fork down mercilessly. Missed.<br />8) Lastly, the "Out of Sight". The size of the spring alone is impressive - WARNING: bone crushing spring force! Even my normally curious coworkers refused to play with it when my order arrived at the office. Set trap as directed the first night. At 3:30AM, a snap woke me up; continued to sleep, but with a smile on my face. The next morning, voila, face to face for the first time.<br /><br />I have a video of this last episode, may upload it later.<br /><br />Hints:<br />1) Creature likes wet area. It is most active right after watering. For the purpose of trapping, you can make a tunnel "flavorable" by keeing it moist between watering.<br />2) Creature works day and night, just not when you are looking.<br />3) Size your creature. Mine (I live in SoCal) turned out to be small like a fresh sausage. It explains why my pitch fork missed and the wire trap was too big.
