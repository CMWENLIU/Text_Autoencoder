Coconut oil is what they use at the movie theaters.  Accounts for that sweet almost floral fragrance.  Makes great movie theater style popcorn.  Kinda scary seeing this giant tub of orange oil.  Even scarier seeing the level of it going down.  But does make crispy, fragrant popcorn.  it solidifies at room temperature, so you have to scoop it out into a bowl, microwave it at 30 seconds and then it goes into the kettle.
