I used to get these in the smaller 7oz. boxes - but y'know, you can't *eat* as MANY of them that way, so I recommend these larger, more heavy boxes, with more Chocolate and more Brandy in them...<br /><br />Alright people, what does it take?  It's Chocolate + Brandy!!!!!  If you are dead to the world then perhaps it will need further review, but I think not...  After all, you are a highly literate person of good taste and strong moral character and did I mention that IT'S *CHOCOLATE* AND *BRANDY*?!?!
