If you are familiar with Lapsang Souchong tea and like it you should consider this one.  It is a little lighter and smoother than some other versions of this type of tea and I like it very much.  If you have never tried Lapsang you should try a cup at a local tea shop before buying.  Lapsang has a smokey rosin sort of favor and is something of an acquired taste.  For those of us who like it, however, there is no substitute.
