This is traditional 5 spice powder.  The right blend - I'm very pleased.<br /><br />The bottles are also nice - nicer than in the picture -  which may seem like a silly thing to care about, but I prefer a nice bottle on my spice rack to a plastic bottle with cheap labeling.  I know that sounds so so silly - but I enjoy cooking more when I feel like I'm using quality ingredients, and I do sometimes (perhaps mistakenly) associate good packaging with quality.<br /><br />The price here is less expensive than what I could find in a store.  The 3 pack was great because I gave 1 away as a gift in a basket along with a few other asian themed cooking items.<br /><br />Packaging was great - bubble wrapped for shipping, but not insanely difficult to unwrap.  I'd buy again, but I imagine the 2 bottles I kept for myself will last me a while.
