My Puget Consumers co-op used to sell this in bulk, but no longer... The tea bags are very expensive and besides, you have to simmer this for 20 minutes so what use is the tea bag? in addition the tea bags don't seem to compost, even in the worm bin.<br /><br />This tea is very high quality tastes great and makes me feel better when congested.
