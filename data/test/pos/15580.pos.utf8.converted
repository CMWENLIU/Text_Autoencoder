One of my two cats, Vladimir, recently got incredibly sick from Nutro food. It wasn't listed in the pet food recall, but several pet parents have had sick dogs and cats from this "premium" food. I spent $3,200 in vet's bills and had many anguished nights. The vet put him on a perscription food, but that one has also been recalled recently...arg! Fearful for their health, I fed them tuna (I know, not the best option), and though Vladi maintained his health, my house REEKED of fish. Praise the lord for Evolution! They love the taste of this, it smells good (and tastes good too...I tried a bit, and I'd totally eat it) and I'm not grossed out by touching it. I feel great that my cats are eating food that I like, both for it's nutrition and for its ethics. I'm going to be an Evolution costomer for life!
