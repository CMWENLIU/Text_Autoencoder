I think this is a fantastic coffee. Subtle chocolate flavor but not cloying. Just outstanding! Will definitely make this a part of my regular rotation!<br /><br />Edited:<br />Amazon won't let me edit the title and number of stars, but after drinking half the box, the flavor does not hold up. I can't really explain it -- while I loved it initially I guess I just got tired of it quickly -- I'd give it about 3 stars now. It's not bad, just -- nothing special. There are better flavors out there. I will NOT make this part of my regular rotation. Sorry! Next time I promise I will sample a flavor at least a half dozen times before writing a review!
