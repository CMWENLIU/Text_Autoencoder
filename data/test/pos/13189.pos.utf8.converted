Being a person with almost no patience, I had to open the Amazon package that arrived today within seconds of it's delivery. Inside was the box of cherries, that box was opened too as was the package of dried cherries inside. Plucked a cherry from the package just to have a quick taste before running off to work for the day. The taste stopped me dead in my tracks !! Really, it did. I just had to grab a sandwich bag and fill it with cherries to take with me.<br />These cherries are absolutely delicious, fresh, soft and chewy, sweet but not too sweet, a little firm and not at all hard and they are full flavored.<br />No kidding, I ate a herd of them today.<br /><br />  Can't wait to have a day off to try cooking with them... imagine the possibilities: Cherry Scones, biscuits, NY Cheesecake with dried cherries stirred in the recipe, on cereal in the morning, Oh! what about cherry pancakes or waffles? Maybe add a few crushed walnuts or pecans. In a salad with cherry vinaigrette dressing maybe add a few pine nuts and a few grates of cheddar cheese. Trail mix with dried cherries? Cherry cobbler, cherry oatmeal cookies, chicken in cherry sauce. Yep, I'm going to be doing some cooking.
