I sent these flowers to my mother for mothers day and she said they was beautiful and bold. She said they smelled so good. I have contacted customer service several times and they have always answered all my questions. If you are ordering dont wait till the day before you need them to be there. I ordered ahead of time and was sent the day I asked.
