We took in a starving little ferrel kitten almost 2 years ago that we eventually discovered has digestive problems and allergies to corn, wheat, soy and fillers.. We live in a rural area where we don't have a lot of choices in pet foods. We kept trying all kinds of natural foods available at Walmart, Kmart, etc., trying to find one that worked for him, but nothing worked. We finally found Diamond's natural's at our local Tractor Supply and decided to give it a try.. It's the one that worked! Our little "pew" kitty is now pretty much gas free, his cat box isn't full of it (if you get my drift) and he's doing beautifully. He's a huge cat with silky smooth long hair. On the plus side, Diamond Natural's are made in the USA! We also switched our dog to Diamond's natural because he also has allergies to corn, wheat, soy and fillers.. His fur is thicker and softer and he isn't chewing non stop like he was before.. Plus he loves the food! We use Diamond Naturals Lamb and Rice formula for him. Don't confuse the Diamond's Maintenance with the Diamond's Natural's, though.. The Maintenance formula's do include corn and fillers... If your pet has allergies, make sure you purchase the Naturals!
