I love bacon, and like hot sauce. This terrific sauce is truly a sauce and not a salsa. It is a very well-balanced sauce with lots of smokey/spicy flavors and an excellent, but not overwhelming flavor of bacon. While I don't believe that there's actually any bacon in the sauce (because it's listed as kosher) it is perfect for adding bacon flavor to omelettes, breakfast burritos, eggs of any kind, sandwiches, and well, everything. Also adds a great flavor to marinades.<br /><br />My first bottle I enjoyed using, but thought it was a little pricey vs. the $2 Trader Joe's Chili Sauce which it resembles. I got my first Bacon Hot Sauce from a friend who got a few sample bottles from somewhere. Once it was gone, I found myself missing it and here I am buying a 3-pack! There's no replacement for the rich flavor it brings.
