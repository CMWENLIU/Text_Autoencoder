The beans are good.  But it's very hard to get the packet open and when you're running if you DO tear it on the little notch (which is hard to see) the whole side of the packet tears away and you can lose all your beans.<br /><br />Come on!  How hard is it to improve the packaging?  It's probably easier to empty them in a ziplock and carry with you.<br /><br />Do you think the manufacturers ever read the product reviews????
