Ok these things are pretty amazing if you are on a low carb diet and want the pasta "experience."  They are quite versatile.  WE have used them in Italian dishes, asian, and indian/thai.  They absorb flavor well, I think just as well as regular pasta.  The package of 6 angel hair bags is great, but I have to admit the bags are quite small.  Really an individual portion for most appetites.  The price I think was a bit high--17 per package--when I bought.  At 14 bucks/6pack its a better deal...just as good as you'll find at your local asian grocery.<br /><br />For you paleo types out there, it went well with "italian sauce" (ie, ground turkey sauteed with onions in tomato sauce).  But frankly it goes even better with Asian dishes.  Open bag, drain, run hot water over them, and throw in wok with a bit of oil and tamari.  add chicken or whatever you eat and its delicious.  Added them to coconut curry last night=amazing.  But the all time best was adding them into our Pho that we got from local restaurant.  We asked them to hold the noodles and give extra basil/bamboo shoots, etc.  they thought I was crazy, but its pretty darn good.<br /><br />I dont miss pasta at all.  These come a lot closer than other options like spaghetti squash. Get them!
