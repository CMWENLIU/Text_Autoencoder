Always liked the taste of darjeeling tea. True to the form, the really good stuff is quite expensive, but then there is Twinnings - to me it's the best of affordable teas.<br /><br />Bonus for sloppy people: it's hard to oversteep. With many other teas if you steep it longer than indicated the tea taste becomes bitter and harsz. Not so with this one.
