These cookies should come with a warning:<br /><br />WARNING!! These cookies are extremely addictive. Their sheer deliciousness will rob you of any last shred of willpower. They will distort your perception of the world (for example, you may begin to think walking from your laptop to the kitchen is enough "exercise" to deserve a cookie). Taste these cookies at your own peril.<br /><br />I only wish I had known.
