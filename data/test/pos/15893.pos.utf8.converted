This product has been a lifesaver when it comes to mixes that call for eggs.  I'm not sure how the mixes would turn out with real eggs, but I have no complaints on how they turn out using the egg replacer.  I have used this extensively with the Namaste Foods mixes and even though the mixes call for multiple eggs, they turn out great using the egg replacer.  Now only if they could develop a way to make scrambled eggs..
