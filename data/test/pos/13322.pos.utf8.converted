Buy it from some store other than JVS as it will be cheaper. JVS does not respond to your email and has zero customer service, check their store feed back.<br /><br />You can find $1.6/can of these in some online stores like asianfoodgrocer dot com, $2.15/can at foodfightgrocery dot com  etc<br /><br />The gluten is very oily and in lot of soy oil/sauce. Also these are not chunks but they are thin like meat skin lumps. It is made by a company in Taiwan and hopefully is not melamine contaminated like China originated gluten you might have heard in news a year ago. I did not feel any problems and i feel the company is reliable. For any one curious, check out evercompanion dot com for parent company.
