I love sweet tea, but I wanted an alternative to your normal black tea that is used to make this and that was caffeine free not just decaffeinated. I found out about Rooibos tea which is naturally caffeine free. Initially I just bought the regular rooibos tea and added peach flavoring from a local coffee shop. Then one day when I went to purchase another box of tea a sales associate recommended that I try Bigelow's Organic Rooibos with Asian Pear Tea. The first thing I noticed about this tea when I started making it was how good it smelled, and the taste...Let's just say I haven't gone back to the regular tea and peach flavoring since. Plus I save alot of money not having to add the separate flavor. I love this tea, and everyone should try it. Also on Amazon this tea was less than if I had bought it in the store. Thanks Amazon.
