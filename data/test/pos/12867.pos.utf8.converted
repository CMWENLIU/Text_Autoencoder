I discovered this coffee 6 years ago while on a trip to Maryland where our hostess served it at breakfast. I thought it was brewed and was surprised to see the jar in her hand as she made more. I had stopped brewing coffee at home because a) finding good brew coffee is hit or miss, b) finding a good coffee maker is expensive and hit or miss, c) it's a waste of coffee when brewing for one, and d) it involves too much cleanup. Taster's Choice was just what I needed: a great tasting coffee that I could make just enough of for one and not have to clean up much of anything. A perfect storm of great taste and convenience.<br /><br />I began with the original roast (loved it but eventually needed a stronger aroma) and graduated to the Gourmet (dark) roast that they are now calling French roast. It tastes like and has the aroma of great brewed coffee. There's nothing else like it on the grocery shelves. I've tried the others and they're not even in the same class as this "instant" coffee. To call it instant is misleading. "Instant" is a pejorative in coffee world and Taster's Choice deserves better. This roast is strong, robust, and can be bitter if you use too much. If you like your coffee mild, try the Taster's Choice original blend. If you prefer robust flavor and aroma, try this blend. It's great.<br /><br />It's difficult to find this roast in my grocery stores.
