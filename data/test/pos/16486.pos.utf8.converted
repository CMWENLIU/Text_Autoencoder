This stuff is great! And since Nutella is claiming to be such a "healthy" breakfast choice  I'll compare nutritional info between the two products.<br /><br />DCD (Dark Chocolate Dreams) first ingredient is PEANUTS, Nutella's first ingredient is SUGAR!<br /><br />DCD Total fat 13g, only 2.5 is saturated (remember that peanut is a healthy fat - the lower the saturated ratio the better). Nutella has 11g fat, but 3.5g of that is saturated fat.<br /><br />DCD has 6g of protein per serving, and Nutella only has 3g.<br /><br />DCD has 12g of carbohydrates per serving, and Nutella has 22g (carbs = FAT ON OUR BODIES!, these are the sugars at work)<br /><br />Now to talk about the taste differences.<br /><br />I've had Nutella and right away you can tell that it is actually BAD for you, like if you think spreading chocolate frosting on your toast in the morning is going to be healthy you are sorely mistaken.  A good use for Nutella? Spread it on top of cake to make it more nutritious, use it instead of frosting. Now there is a good idea.<br /><br />The DCD is still peanut butter, but it is CHOCOLATY peanut butter and it is amazing on toast and bread.  Good good stuff!<br /><br />For these reasons I will be using this product from now on instead of Nutella.
