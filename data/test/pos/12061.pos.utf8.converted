If you truly enjoy eating then you will truly enjoy escargot; even though you may not know it if you have never tasted.  If you love and enjoy escargot, then I promise you that you will absolutely love this product.  These puppies are BIG!  Now I know that big does not always mean better, but I have to say I have never tasted better and I have eaten these things in many restaurants, in many homes and locations around the world. I come from several generations of snail lovers and we are all pretty picky!<br /><br />These snails are tender, not mushy as you often find and if prepared correctly can send you into a state of gastronomic nirvana.  A bit of EVOO, garlic and a touch of salt, a dash of wine and a hot oven and you have pure heaven at the table.<br /><br />I cannot believe the price here on Amazon.  I buy this same product at a local store and can assure you that I pay much, much more.<br /><br />As one reviewer has pointed out, it is very difficult to find these in many restaurants these days.  When I was a little girl, traveling with my parents all over the U.S. it was not much of a problem.  Times have changed though and if you want a `snail fix,' you are quite often forced to do it yourself.  Fortunately that is not difficult if you have a quality product to begin with.  It this case, you do.<br /><br />Whether you buy here on Amazon or buy locally, don't let these slip by you.
