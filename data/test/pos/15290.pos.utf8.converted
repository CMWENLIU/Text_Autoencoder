Nothing can beat making polenta the old-fashioned way. But, if you want to save time and a lot of stirring, this is the best instant I've come across. The texture is 90% as good as from scratch, and it cooks in just a couple of minutes. Perfect for when you want polenta, but are pressed for time. Nice price as well -- cheaper than what I've seen it in grocery stores. Each package is vacuumed packed, so if you don't open it, it will keep fresh for a very long time.  Good stuff!
