This Cocoa butter works wonders!! I was advised to use raw cocoa butter to prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy. I love this stuff!! I rub it over my stomach once in the morning and once in the evening and so far so good! I have not seen one stretch mark yet! I have also noticed that my skin looks fabulous, much  more clear and toned!! Raw cocoa butter is simply the best!! Much better than the watered down forms of cocoa butter that you can buy at the local drug stores. I will be making another purchase once I run out!!
