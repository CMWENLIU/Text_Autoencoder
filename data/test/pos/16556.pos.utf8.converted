The best EVOO under $40. We live in the Bay Area where there are tons of artisan producers of EVOO and this stuff is by far the best in its price range. There are better ones for 50+ for this size but this oil has a smooth taste, silky in texture and a wonderfully fruity and fresh bouquet and taste. Your mouth will definitely love this!
