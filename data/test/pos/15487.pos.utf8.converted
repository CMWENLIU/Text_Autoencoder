This is some of the best coffee I have ever had.  Short of sitting in a Costa Rican resturaunt and having each cup of coffee made right before your eyes, I would suggest buying a bag of these beans.  My family has brought this coffee back with us from Costa Rica when opportunity permits, and now I am very excited that it is available online.  Once you have tried this coffee you will understand how coffee was meant to be consumed.
