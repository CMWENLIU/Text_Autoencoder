This powdered caffeine free mocha coffee mix is delightful!  My Mom and I have been addicted to it for years now.  I prefer it mixed with ice, splenda, and water in a blender to make a refreshing shake, while my Mom enjoys them warm with splenda and milk heated in the microwave.<br /><br />We used to purchase the cans from Costco (they last for about a month in our house) but they recently removed them from inventory at the one closest to us :(  Now I live in Irvine, seeing as I am a college student and they stock them at my nearby Costco, however, I can't always find the time to make the trip (plus that is all I ever purchase there).  So, I have bought smaller cans online at the Caffe D'Vita website, but always hoped that Amazon would sell them eventually and guess what? They do!!!! I couldn't be more ecstatic! :D
