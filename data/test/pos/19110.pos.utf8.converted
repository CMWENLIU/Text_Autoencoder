This alternative trail mix is a uniquely delicious treat.  I bought it because I love cashews and thought it would make a great snack.  It did indeed!  I ate the entire bag in one sitting and had to run out for more.  It's a healthy snack and a great alternative to trail mix.  While I haven't tried the other flavors yet I'm sure they are just as tasty!  You won't be let down with this wonderful snack.  Enjoy!
