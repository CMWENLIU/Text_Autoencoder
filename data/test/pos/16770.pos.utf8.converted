I really love these seaweed snacks, although every one else that I have given them to try has disliked them.  I think they are a real "love it or hate it" sort of item.<br /><br />If you like the seaweed in sushi, then you would probably like these strips.  They are more like dry paper because they are very thin.  The strips are quite salty with a little bit of spice.  At first they are crispy, but they become soft when chewed.  I usually eat two packets (8 strips total) at a time.<br /><br />I do think the price is high, so I'm not sure when I will buy them again.  Right now, I'm eating them every day and they are a great little snack.  Love it!
