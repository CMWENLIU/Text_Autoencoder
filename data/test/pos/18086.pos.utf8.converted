I bought a canister of this sugar yesterday along with some of the coconut nectar. It is wonderful stuff. It has a caramelish butterscotchy flavor but it isn't at all bitter. There are two things against it--the higher price (which limits how much I use and that might be a good thing) and the fact that it is so yummy I want to eat it plain by the spoonful. I haven't mixed it with anything yet but I can't imagine it would change a flavor in an adverse way. It should only make it better.
