I grew up with Campbell's Green Pea soup.  Always loved it.  not even a big fan of peas, but . . . However, extremely difficult to find in stores.  I thought Campbell's stopped making it, and then lo and behold . . I found it on amazon.  My daughter loves it now too.  Perfect with Grilled cheese sandwiches on a rainy day!
