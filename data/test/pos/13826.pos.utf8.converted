This is a very fine salty salt - strong, toothsome, and delicious.  Don't use it for cooking - that's a waste - use it a a 'finishing' salt - sprinkle over your food just before eating (and remember to reduce the salt used in cooking) - I particularly love it on freshly cut tomatoes.  This is a luxury item for me, and I wouldn't be without it!
