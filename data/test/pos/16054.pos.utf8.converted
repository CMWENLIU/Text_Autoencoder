Our 9 year old was recently diagnosed as celiac and we suspect she may not be the only one in our family with the 'wheat issue'.  My 9 year old loves to eat bread and milk and, of course, now she can't have either.  I knew there were gluten-free flours and breads out there, but they're not easy to find in my local grocery store.  I went online to Amazon Grocery to see if they offered anything and to see what customers' reviews were.  I wanted to try something that others had enjoyed, not just buy whatever (few) items they happened to carry in town. This bread mix was very highly rated, so I bought a whole case to give it a try.<br /><br />I received a bread machine from my mother that wasn't a special 'gluten-free' type bread machine, so I gave this bread mix a try using the standard method.  It took some adjusting to get the best ingredient combination to yield the right taste and texture, but this formula is a winner!  The instructions on the box call for either milk or water, butter or oil, and several types of egg combinations.  The best tasting (and texture) combination was milk, olive oil and 2 large (whole) eggs.  The smell of the freshly baked bread brings the whole family out of hiding and into the kitchen, salivating as I slice into the warm loaf.<br /><br />Celiacs need not despair!!!  This gluten-free bread mix makes the most delicious bread that's so good it's hard to believe it's not traditional wheat bread.  It also takes the hassle out of trying to purchase and concoct a wheat-flour substitute that can be used to THEN make bread that anyone accustomed to wheat bread might actually want to eat.  Our whole family LOVES this bread.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!
