I first read about this oil in Cooks Illustrated magazine.  Here's what I love:<br />1) highest smoke point--I see cooking shows all the time heating up olive oil in a saute pan--DON"T!<br />2) VERY neutral flavor--whether baking, pan frying, marinating, etc. the oil flavor is in the background<br />3) doesn't solidify in the fridge (in salad dressings, marinades, etc.) like olive oil<br />4) best oil out there for good fat composition<br /><br />Everyone touts olive oil as so good for you, and it does have its place, as does grapeseed oil.  But if you only want to buy ONE healthy oil for many cooking uses, buy this--you won't be sorry.<br /><br />*Note:  when my bottles arrives they each had a little bit of oil leakage around the top.  Even though the bottles are sealed on top in plastic wrapper they are NOT sealed underneath the cap.  I contact the manufacturer and alerted them to this--maybe they'll make a change.<br /><br />I originally bought a gallon bottle directly from California Rice Bran Oil Company but decided I'd rather have smaller bottles opened (for freshness) since it takes me a while to use it up.  Amazon was cheaper for a 3-pack with free super saver shipping.
