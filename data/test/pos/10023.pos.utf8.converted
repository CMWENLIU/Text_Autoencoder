My blood pressure had been in the prehypertensive (140s/90s) for several weeks.... my diet was pretty decent (5-6 frutis/veggies, good oil, etc.) and I walked 3-4 miles/day, so I was surprised.<br />Before going to a doctor for meds, decided to do some resesarch on natural blood pressure and magnesium came up as a suggestion. I settled on this on on a friend's advice. Take it 2x/day. My blood pressure has been 105-120/70s for the past month. Maybe it's a coincidence, but I'm happy.
