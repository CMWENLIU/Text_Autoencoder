I just recently (this year) started getting serious with honey. I knew there was better honey out there than the store bought stuff, and even the stuff you get on the side of the road (which is still good, mind you), but after a little research, I came across Wedderspoon....and wow.<br /><br />What's really amazing about this stuff (I've purchased a few jars now), is that each batch does taste slightly different. It just goes to show the true natural and raw quality that is involved here. The taste is heavenly, to say the least.<br /><br />After my research, and personal experience, I'm convinced that good honey can cure just about anything that gets thrown your way. Make it a part of your daily routine (I sweeten green tea with it, and take a teaspoon before each meal), and you'll realize a plethora of benefits. It's hard to explain until you do it yourself.<br /><br />Buy this stuff, and don't look back - you'll never buy "regular" honey again. It's that damn good!
