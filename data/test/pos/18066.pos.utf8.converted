I am not sensitive to gluten and I'm thankful for that.  My granddaughter and my dear friend are so I wanted to experiment with gluten free foods.  I did NOT like any of the rice pastas one bit.  A few years back, I ordered Bob's Red Mill organic quinoa flour and made the muffins on the package - everyone raved and there was no other flours in them so my deduction is that it's a broader spectrum flour to use for many things rather than all the mixes you have to concoct to make something baked that's gluten free - and really not be able to tell the difference. I decided I'd order this pasta and see what it's like.  I absolutely love it to the point its the only pasta I buy. It's just healthier all around...period. I have a parrot who totally loves pasta and this is a much better food for him, too.  Whatever I'm eating he has to be eating, too - he even ate liver and onions!  When I give him this pasta, he doesn't come up for air and repeats 'goooood' the whole time he's pigging out.  He wouldn't eat the rice pastas. I buy the Bertolli pasta sauces in the little bags (amazing pasta sauces!) and one bag is perfect for one box of quinoa pasta.  It reheats very, very well, it's good cold, tho! It's easy to over-cook but once you get it down, you'll find it cooks a little quicker than wheat pasta. I do not add oil to the water but I use a cooking chopstick to keep it moving just until each strand of pasta is all separated and good and wet and I have no problem with it sticking together through the rest of the cooking process.  I use the water to moisten my dog's dry food - she loves it, too.<br /><br />It's so plainly bannered on the packaging and in the product description that it's corn and quinoa pasta.  I can't believe someone down-rated the product because they didn't read what they were buying!
