For those of us on gluten-free diets, finding acceptable bread substitutes can be a pain in the neck.  I've especially missed the great smell and taste of fresh-baked homemade bread.<br /><br />This mix mades a more than adequate bread.  I've been using it for years, and love it.  Friends who aren't on a gluten-free diet are consistently surprised at the texture and flavor of this bread.  It even toasts well!
