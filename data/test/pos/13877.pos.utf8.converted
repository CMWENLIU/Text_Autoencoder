Nice little black olive bonsai with developing nebari  It came wired into its glazed pot in fast-draining soil mix.  Since was early southwest US summer when it arrived, the tree went outside immediately, in a shady spot.  Later on it went into the sun, where is is producing flowers now.  So long as it is watered daily, it's a healthy, slow growing little tree.  Come fall, it will be brought inside with another black olive as these don't like temperatures below 50 degrees.  These trees are so easy to care for and do so well in this climate that I highly recommend them for anybody in the southern part of the USA.  Black olives, black pines and a couple of Chinese elms are the only bonsai I have that thrive in the full blast of mid-New Mexico sun.
