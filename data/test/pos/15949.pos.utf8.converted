I first experienced these at the school where I work; it's part of the kids' lunch menu some days.  They are crunchy and sooo delicious.  They are only 140 calories per 1.1 oz. bag.  I tried to find them at neighborhood stores such as Target and Walmart with no success.  Thrilled to find it here on amazon.com.
