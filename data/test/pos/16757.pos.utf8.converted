Best tasting coconut milk I have enjoyed so far (by my taste, you may prefer others), Aloe adds body without being intrusive. Have not experienced GERD or upset stomach since beginning to drink CocoAloe - it must provide balance to the digestive system - I have been plagued for years with GERD. It is expensive, especially at the price on Amazon. I can get it for half that at my local health food and country stores.Why is it not on "subscribe and save"?
