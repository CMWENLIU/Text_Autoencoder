Our cat was diagnosed with diabetes.  Our vet prescribed 5 units of insulin.  He was supposed to have his blood checked at the vet's once a month and we were to buy their expensive high protein, high fiber kibbles.  I went on the net and found a book here on Amazon written by Elizabeth M. Hodgkins (she is a vet and an attorney) called Your Cat: New Secrets to a Longer Stronger life.  She recommended home testing, which we did morning and night for about a month, and only fed him Wellness cat food because she said a diabetic cat needs a canned high protein food with no grains and absolutely no kibbles.  We are now testing him once a week and only feeding him Wellness Adult Chicken Canned Cat Food  He has been off insulin with normal blood sugar readings for a little over two months!
