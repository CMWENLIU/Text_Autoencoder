Of all the ketchups (organic and not) I have tasted, this has the best flavor.  Anyone who has eaten at our house and tried Muir Glen Ketchup has also commented the same.  It is a nice balance and just sweet enough.  To compare it with non-organic, I would say the flavor is much closer to Heinz than to Hunts.  Personally, I think Hunts is harsh and like eating tomato paste.<br /><br />I no longer buy non-organic ketchup considering tomatoes are one of the worst when it comes to pesticides.  Unfortunately, my local grocery store stopped carrying it.  Maybe I was the only one buying it?  Does anyone know if it is Gluten free?
