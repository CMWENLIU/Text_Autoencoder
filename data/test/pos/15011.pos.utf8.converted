I thought this product was no longer available. Then by chance I found it here. It is so good I cannot find the words to describe it. It just arrived and I had a can opened and a slice warmed up with butter on it within 5 min. I sat and savored it for 20 min, taking tiny bites. It is 100% the same as when I was a child. So moist. It is 130 calories for a 1/2 inch slice which is plenty as it is so rich in flavor. It is almost like cake. In the 1960's we ate slices of it with the B and M Boston Baked beans. My mother also sliced it thin and put creamcheese or marshmellow cream between 2 slices and sent it as a treat for my grade school lunches.<br /><br />It you want a healthy yummy taste of the past try this bread. The value is fantastic also. I checked a few other websites and it was sky high in price. Highly Recommend.
