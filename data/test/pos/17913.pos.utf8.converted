I almost didn't buy this flavor after reading a few reviews where people mentioned they could hardly taste the lemon.<br />I tried it and was pleasantly surprised at the delicious lemon flavor! It's now my favorite flavor.<br />I don't know whether the people posting that they can't taste the lemon used enough or if they didn't shake the bottle first or what.<br />It is the best one so far. :)
