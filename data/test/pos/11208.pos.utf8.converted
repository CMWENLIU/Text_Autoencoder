The whole grading thing in maple syrup is so misleading. I first bought Grade B maple syrup from a Wholefoods store, because it was cheaper, and I thought, how much worse can it be? Hah! The well-kept secret is that it is BETTER than Grade A. Thicker, darker, richer, and with more maple flavor than Grade A, this treat is hard to find in stores, but the Highland Surgarworks is a great product that fills all of my Grade B syrup requirements. And don't just put it on your pancakes! Make maple butter to spread on your cornbread or rub under the skin of a chicken or turkey before you roast it. Use it in pies and cakes. It is delicious.
