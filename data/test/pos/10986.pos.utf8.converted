An unusual blend of 7 grain flour.  Never thought of a couple of it's grain in 7-grain flour but this makes incredible homemade bread.  We have bought 7 grain bread from Montana, but this miller has out done the Westerners.  One of my wife's secrets in her bread making is using the correct baking pans.  She use the commercial Analon pans that bake to perfection.  They were an initial investment, but last a lifetime.
