I just received my carb-crunchers everything bread and popped a slice in the toaster and spread some margarine on to see if it was going to work for me and - WOW! this is delicious bread! At only 5 net carbs per 2 slices, this is something I will be relying on to keep me on my low-carb lifestyle.  Try it, you will not be sorry!
