I can't believe how good these are, especially for a store-bought cookie! Ginger snaps are one of my favorite cookies, but it's hard to find store-bought brands that are as good as the ones I make - not bragging, but my husband and I like our ginger snaps to be spicy with plenty of ginger. These delicious cookies fill the bill - I just got them this morning and I can't stop eating them! The good news is since they are organic and not loaded with a lot of preservatives and junk I can eat a handful with my coffee or tea and not feel guilty. I love how gingery they are, with actual bits of candied ginger baked into the cookies; if you're not a fan of REAL ginger and you don't like a bit of heat in your ginger snaps, you might want to give these a pass. I love the gingery bite, though, and will definitely buy these at the store.
