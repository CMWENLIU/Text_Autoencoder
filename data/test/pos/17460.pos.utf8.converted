This stuff is great.  The quality of the chocolate is excellent.  I have purchased this same chocolate from others on the net, but when you get the ones with German labels (e.g. not intended to be marketed in the US), there is no expiration date on the bars.  As a result I have received very old chocolate (with white haze) from others.  Not here!  These ones are in English and labeled with an expiry date.  When purchased directly from Amazon, I have always received chocolates in excellent condition and several months away from their expiry.
