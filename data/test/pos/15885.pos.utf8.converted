My dog Andy requires 3 pills 3 times a day. I started using Pillpockets almost two years ago. We have used the dreaded pill popper for many years. When the popper comes out, Andy beats a hasty retreat. We all hated it, as a lot of times the pills popped out, stayed in the popper, or he gagged on them. Since he had to have pills three times a day, it was a daily ordeal. It all changed when we tried Pill Pockets. He now looks forward to taking his pills. He loves the taste of the Pillpockets, I don't think we can now do without them. He likes them so much, we use them as treats for special occasions. They have made treating Andy a pleasant experience, rather than a ordeal. I wish I would have invented them.
