Theese buckwheat noodles are so good and my non-health food loving husband actually prefers them over regular spaghetti. He normally hates whole wheat spaghetti.  Just use with regular tomato sauce, you don't have to use them only for asian-style dishes.  Once again, another great product by Annie.  Yum-Yum Annie Chun!
