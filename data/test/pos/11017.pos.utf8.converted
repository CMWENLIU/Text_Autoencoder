I'm a fanatic for gummy candy, especially the sour kind. But most sour gummy worms look and taste like a chemistry experiment, and most apple and (especially) apricot fruit(ish) rings taste artificial too. Haribo does a much better job; their pink grapefuit was my favorite gummy until I discovered these apple ones. They taste natural, real healthy apple flavor, less stridently sour than grapefruit. Now it's a tie for top place: apple and grapefruit. When I can't decide, I eat 'em both together. My dentist taught me that trick, believe it or not. I sometimes wonder whose side she's on....
