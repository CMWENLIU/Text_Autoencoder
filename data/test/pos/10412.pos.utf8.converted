Super Links are terrific vegetarian weiners. Their flavor is a little like Morning Star Farms Breakfast links - but more weiner-ish. Their texture is firm and their size is plump like Big Franks. Veja Links are good, but Super Links taste much better than Veja Links. However, Big Franks have a savory flavor unlike real weiners that I like even better than Super Links. But, be warned that Big Franks are more tender in texture and not quite as firm for those who like a firm veggie dog.
