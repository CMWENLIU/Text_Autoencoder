I bought this at Bev Mo last month, really due to finding Qtonic months ago there and enjoying it so much.  QGinger doesn't disappoint at all, has a great ginger taste, and a kick from probably the real ginger and from the coriander and other spices.  Once again, like in the tonic one of the best things is the calories are only 60/serv which really is nice to have less calories per serving if you are drinking like a pop.<br /><br />The kids loved the taste as well, I don't think they even knew what a real ginger ale should taste like.  The agave works as a good sweetner as well for kids, the sweetness reminds me a little of tasting the Coke of old when using real sugar instead of the corn syrup.<br /><br />In the end, great taste, low calories, and makes a great Dark and Stormy or is great alone over ice.<br /><br />I'm glad to see Amazon carrying.
