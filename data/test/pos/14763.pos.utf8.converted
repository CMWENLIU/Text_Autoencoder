In her younger days, a friend of mine backpacked throughout Europe.  She mentioned that she always had a bottle of mushroom ketchup with her and used it to season almost everything.  In recent weeks, a group of us have been exploring umami--the 5th taste sensation.  I was told this product may be the ultimate example of umami.  I was expecting a thick sauce like the tomato ketchup I've always known and loved.  I was surprised to see the thin, liquid consistency.  The taste is pleasantly unique.  Savory.  A little like Worchestershire sauce, but not as harsh.  Are you up for a taste adventure?  I recommend trying this.  I found recipes for the traditional product of years gone by.  I'm strongly recommending this time and labor saving choice instead.  I bought 2 bottles--one for my friend, and one for me.
