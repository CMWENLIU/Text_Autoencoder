I'm a bit granola obsessed, always on the search for a great tasting and healthy blend of ingredients. With reasonable effort to avoid hyperbole, Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters might be the best granola I have tried. The diverse grains are sweet and crispy, the nutrients are plentiful, and the price is right. I generally eat the granola dry, straight from the package, but I have eaten it with almond milk, making for a delicious, nutritious breakfast.<br /><br />For those who are curious, here is a breakdown of the nutritional content, as well as ingredients:<br /><br />Serving Size: 1/3 cup (29g)<br />Servings Per Package: About 11<br /><br />Calories: 120<br />Calories from Fat: 30<br />Total Fat: 3g (5%)<br />Saturated: 0g<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 20mg (1%)<br />Total Carb.: 22g (7%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 5g (20%)<br />Sugars: 5g<br />Protein: 3g<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, gluten free oat flour, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), evaporated cane juice, flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, vanilla extract, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, glycerine, sea salt, Vitamin E (D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate), citrus fiber, citrus pectin.<br /><br />The blueberry flavor is, perhaps, a little too subtle, getting lost in the mix of the grains, but it does make its presence known. The variety of grains included is more robust than many other brand I have tried, especially the inclusion of quinoa. So there is a little something to please everyone.<br /><br />So, for those seeking a delicious, healthy granola blend, I highly recommend Kind Vanilla Blueberry Clusters. For my money, it may be the best grain blend on the market!
