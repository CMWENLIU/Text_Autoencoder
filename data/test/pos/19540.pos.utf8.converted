I lived in Germany for 6 years, the last 3 years was in Baumholder, I have not had a Ferrero Hanuta Chocolate Hazelnut Candy Wafer in 27 years and thought I would never ever be able to have them again unless I jumped on a plane and went back to Germany, thanks to Amazon, they brought a taste of Germany here to me in the states, I received mine today and I have to say it was like stepping back in time, exactly as I remembered them, these things are so good you will hurt your self on them, ABSOLUTLY!!!!! now for me its more than just how good they are, its the emotions that flooded me and all the memories of a very good time in my life long ago, if you have never been out of the states , you have no idea what you are missing in the world, give these a try, you wont go wrong,, they have a lot of other good things also,  PS,, Don't get me wrong I love America and would never trade her for anything
