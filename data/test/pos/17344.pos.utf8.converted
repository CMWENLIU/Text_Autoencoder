i'm always skeptical when I have to give my Border Collie "Daisy" medication. I was informed about this product from my sister and her Vet. She's worse than me, so if she trusts the product for her dog "Guinness" it must be natural & safe. Las Vegas has terrible thunderstorms & lightening so I put 3 drops on a treat and within 30min. Daisy began to become calmer and stopped being stressed out and breathing heavy. She wasn't lethargic just calm. This product did the trick<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Pam & Daisy
