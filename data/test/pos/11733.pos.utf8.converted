This is the most amazing rose petal jelly I have ever eaten.  I was first introduced to this Jelly at Harad's Tea Room in London and have been yearning for it ever since.  I made a batch of scones and put this amazing jelly on them.  They were delicious!!!!!  This jelly is so good it is almost magical.
