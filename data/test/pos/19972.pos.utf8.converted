Oh, sure.  It's terrific in cookies but, if you really want a treat, try using Ghirardelli's Semi-sweet Chocolate Chips to make a truly delicious hot chocolate!<br /><br />You can take 1/4 cup of chips and melt them in a microwave in 1/2 cup milk.  Stir.  Then add another 1/2 cup milk, although the truly decadent will use half-and-half.  Add a pinch of cinnamon, a pinch of red pepper (yeah, you heard me), and two pinches of instant coffee.  Wow!!<br /><br />Ghirardelli has been making exceptional chocolate in the USA for over 150 years.  They take it from the beans all the way to the finished product. Their chocolates are smooth (not grainy).  Very nice!<br /><br />Highly recommended!
