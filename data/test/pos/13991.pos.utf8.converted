I've tried many different pods available for my Senseo.  Every one had no flavor.  Aloha Island's coffee pods saved my Senseo machine from the trash.  Their pods should be the ones sold w/the machine as Senseo's coffee tastes like instant.  If you want the taste you expect w/your one cup machine, use Aloha Island Coffee.  I promise you, this is coffee !!!!
