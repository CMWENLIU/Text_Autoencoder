Starbucks' Sumatra is a kicky wake-up blend. It says "Extra Bold" on the bag, and it's truth in advertising. It's got a fiery, bold flavor, like the volcanoes of Indonesia. Starbucks' Komodo blend is equally kicky. The Sumatra Coffee is delicious, spicy, piquant... one of Starbucks best. It's stronger than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ546Y">Starbucks Breakfast Blend Coffee, Ground, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> It's a perfect accompaniment to spicy huevos rancheros, and it's great on its own. It's a wake-up coffee!
