I love, love, love this popcorn!!  Got a 6oz popcorn machine and began by using my own oil, popcorn and salt.  It came out ok, but I never could get it to taste quite the same as movie theater popcorn.  Read reviews that this tasted like movie popcorn and thought I'd give it a try - they were right!  It tastes just like what you'd get at a theater!<br /><br />Everything, of course, is pre-packaged, so you just pour it in and pop away.  Couldn't be easier.  I do end up pouring the oil into a measuring cup first and then into my kettle, because it's a little awkward pouring it directly from the pouch to the kettle.  Some other reviews mentioned taking out some of the flavored salt, but I found the ratios between the oil, popcorn and salt to be spot on for my taste.<br /><br />The only negative I can see to this popcorn is the amount of calories.  Because they use coconut oil, the calorie count goes way up.  And while the package lists it as having "7 servings", I found that a pouch only feeds 2 to 3 hungry grownups.  It's definitely not a low calorie snack and it's not going to be something you'd want to eat every night....but it's definitely just right when treating yourself and your friends to a movie night!
