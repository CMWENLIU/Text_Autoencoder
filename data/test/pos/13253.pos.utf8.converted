The freeze-dried peaches big (around 1/2 inch wide) and are not hard or crunchy.  Toddlers could eat these easily - they get soft in your mouth.  The flavor is delicious - sweet and slightly tangy.  The only problem we have is that we go through an entire can in a matter of minutes!  I like that they are totally natural - no added sugars or preservatives and the kids love them.  Honeyville strawberries are awesome as well.
