This is just a great coffee substitute! It made my 28-year caffeine habit withdrawl SO much easier.  I'm not sure if this product will taste as good to those customers who don't use Half & Half or some type of creamer in their coffee, but with it, it's delicious.<br /><br />It didn't lessen the symptoms of caffeine withdrawl, but after a few weeks of drinking Pero, I don't miss coffee at all.  I'm a Pero customer for life!
