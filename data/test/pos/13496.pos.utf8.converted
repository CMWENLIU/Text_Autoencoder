I grew up in Texas and live in Houston.  Texmati is *the* rice.  We have been buying it since the late 80s.  It is very hard to cook wrong, does well sitting out or refrigerated, and is sturdy enough to mix with most any combination of spices.  It is not overly starchy, so is poor for sticky rice uses, but is wonderful otherwise.  Very recommended.<br /><br />Also, I have never gotten a bad batch, or one with stones, sticks, or unidentified dark bits in it (which sometimes happens with bulk rice).  Quality control is excellent.
