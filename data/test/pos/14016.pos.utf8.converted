Wow! Finally, a company/brand that gets it.  Some of us don't feel like making espresso or coffee in the morning.  We get tired of driving to our nearest coffee shop. We don't want to buy Espresso Doubleshots from the grocery because, even the light version has calories and fat (plus disgusting Sucralose - Splenda). "illy issimo Caffe - No sugar" is exactly what is says it is. a 6.8 oz can of brewed Espresso with no artificial sweetners, no milk, no cream, nothing. It has 15 calories per can...thats because Coffee beans do have oil on them and contain some calories.  Each can has around 150mg Caffiene (I cannot recall). That is 150 mg in 6.8 oz of espresso. Basically, just over the caffiene amount of a dopio (double) espresso from a major coffee chain.  I can add my own non-fat milk and be set, add some cold water and ice if I want...even add some PureVia or Truvia (Stevia Type Zero Calorie Sweetener) which is all natural and much better for you (with no after taste). I can add whatever I want. I basically can put into my body, exactly what I want to; let's not forget the convenience factor of grabbing a can, as you run out the door, and downing it in the car. Best thing I've ever found on Amazon!!!  Life is now complete...I don't even have to leave the house to get good iced espresso.  By the way...the drink I normally get at "The Bux" is about $3.45. A 12-pack on here is $25.00 currently.  If I drink 1 a day, for 36 days - That would cost $75.00. If I go to my favorite coffee house for 36 days - It would cost around $125.00. I don't think there is a question as to cheaper, more convenient, and better.
