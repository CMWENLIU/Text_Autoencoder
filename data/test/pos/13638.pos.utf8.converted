When I added the contents of the sauce flavor packet after heating the noodles, I thought, "This looks like every other microwavable mac-&-cheese mixture."  But it doesn't taste like other microwavable mac-&-cheese.  It's delicious, and about the same price as other brands.  The noodles themselves are very nice, and the sauce is cheesy and creamy.  There is plenty of room in the container to add frozen broccoli before heating--same cooking time.  The package contains a *lot* of noodles & sauce, for a total of 560 calories.  I got them for a starving student, so this size is perfect for him, but it would be nice if they were also offered in a smaller size.
