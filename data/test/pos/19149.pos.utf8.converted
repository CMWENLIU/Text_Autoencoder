This is a great alternative to regular flour as a thickening agent. I used it often when I'm making fruit pies to keep the fillings from being "runny" and oozing out of the crust.  My pies not only look beautiful, but they don't have that "raw flour" taste you can sometimes get when using an all purpose flour.  It's also gluten free so for people who have gluten allergies, it's great for baking and making gravies! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDM6KU">Bob's Red Mill Arrowroot Starch Flour, 20-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>
