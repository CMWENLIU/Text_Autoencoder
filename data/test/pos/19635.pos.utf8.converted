I have been gluten free for 3+ years, and have tried many substitutions for regular wheat flour. None measure up to this mix. I have mixed my own using Bette Hagman's recipes, and I've used Bob's, Arrowhead Mills, and Pamela's multipurpose blends...this is the only one that produces the feel (aka, 'crumb') of 'normal' foods. I have found that I do not like the taste of bean flour, and this Authentic Foods blend is free of bean. I have a buttermilk pancake recipe that I use this in; they come out so delicious that even if I could eat wheat, I would keep making them with this flour. Love this stuff, and I love not having to keep 10 bags of individual flours in my fridge. I won't be without it!
