We all should know that oatmeal is good for you, it lowers your cholesterol, has plenty of fiber.  This is better than just oatmeal, this is oatmeal with flax seed, blueberries and cinnamon.  What I really like about it is I can have 2 packs for breakfast and not get hungry until lunch time.  Give it a try, it is definitely better than that pastry with your coffee..
