We've tried lots of protein drinks over the years, but this one is the best we've ever had. It tastes great and it's good for you (no fake sugars, no bad-for-you fats, lots of vitamins and minerals). In no other dimension would you catch me eating beets, but supposedly they're in this drink. I sure don't taste it if that's true! It would be nice if there were a bit more fiber, but 2g isn't horrible. The only true negative for this product is the price. They are very expensive; however, for a ready-to-drink meal, it's the easiest, most convenient and tastiest alternative we've found. The vanilla flavor is most popular in my family, but I like the chocolate one, too. Overall I don't think you can go wrong with this drink.
