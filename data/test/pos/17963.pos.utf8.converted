After weeks of "studying" the Keurig coffeemaker choices and being spooked by the mixed reviews, I happened upon the commercial model, the OfficePro.  Like the other reviewer, I found it at Staples for much less than listed here and less than the price of the other home models.  Out of the box it didn't seem to work. There was a terrible deafening vibration and noise, and no water would transfer to the heating chamber for the priming process (the first and only step before being able to make coffee).  I put it aside, annoyed, but decided to give it one more try before I packed it back up and returned it to Staples. For some reason it decided to work and it's been working flawlessly since.<br /><br />My particular OfficePro came with a coffee sampler which was nice because once you have it out of the box, it's great to be able to make a cup of test coffee.  The first cup of coffee I made smelled just like wonderful restaurant coffee and nothing like the stale bitter coffee I was making every day (and pouring out half of) in my gross coffee pot.  Since then I've been trying all sorts of coffee and experimenting with sizes and even using the K cups more than once.  If you brew a small cup, you can run one more small size cup through the K cup (a bold variety) without it being too watered down - yay, a money saver.  The husband and I like lots of cream so the smaller size yield suits us just fine. The 8 oz size is plenty for our mugs. I saw some complaints where the water chamber is too small and has to be refilled all the time, but as we're not using this in an office setting, it's been absolutely no problem for us.  Filling the water chamber is fast and easy. Initially I used tap water in the machine but have switched to bottled to ensure that it continues to work well.  Aesthetically it looks really nice and tidy tucked back into a corner on our kitchen counter and the bonus is that I can refill the water and open and close the coffee pod without having to pull it out from under the overhead cabinets; there's plenty of clearance.  It makes some vibration and noise when the water heats up but the noise is very temporary, maybe about 5 seconds.<br /><br />So far we've had this about a week and it's fantastic with great tasting coffee and tea.
