I got this as a gift for my father and he LOVED it.  It was a nostalgic trip down memory lane for him.  Most of the candy looked too sugary for me, but he was thrilled--- he looked like a little kid on Christmas morning.  He enjoyed the variety (and telling me how little this candy used to cost) ;)  I highly recommend this product as a gift for a 'child of the 60s.'
