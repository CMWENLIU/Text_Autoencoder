The secret to making any of these miracle noodle or no-oodle products edible and actually good is to DRY FRY them. They will smell VERY strongly of fish when you open them, but after a good rinse of cold water in a colander, the smell goes away. After they are rinsed, all you have to do is put them in a heated skillet and cook off the extra moisture,about 2-3 min. Then, add whatever sauce or ingredients you want. I have had the best success with mixing in some teriyaki marinade, grilled beef, and broccoli. It was truly delicious. I tried them plain and then with some beef broth and really did not enjoy them, so keep experimenting until you find what works best for you. But definitely dry fry them and it will improve the texture and be a nice treat if you are avoiding carbs and calories.
