I'm a huge fan of Colombian food, and I eat or cook it whenever I can, tapioca flour goes into one of my favorite items from this wonderful cuisine, I make Yucca Buns with a simple recipe that tastes better with this silky and organic flour than with the other tapioca flours I have found so far. Not to mention it's organic, something very important as this crusty old planet ages under our rule. This recipe that I now love, annoyed me to extreme lengths because I didn't understand the way the dough must feel and change into until I made it the second time, adding too much liquid made it too sticky once the cheese melted into the flour so I had to add even more flour to balance it out... not pretty in baking haha.  Tapioca starch can be used as a thickener or substitute for allergen causing flour, but I recommend checking the conversions for each online, also don't use it as a batter on a cutlet ( dip in flour then milk the bread crumbs then fry) it will come off in a gooey skin, even of a non stick pan. It's amazing for baking though and I love the boxes, I was quite surprised how tiny they looked, each box hold 2 cups of tapioca flour, and it takes me one box to make a double batch of Yucca Buns. I have adapted the below recipe from Ingrid Hoffman's Yucca Buns recipe from the FoodNetwork.com<br /><br />2 cups tapioca flour<br />4 egg yolks ( or 3 for less cakey bread)<br />2 teaspoons baking powder .... ( make sure its fresh and not expired<br />
