After receiving my order from Amazon I found all the items specified in the Mini Organic Pet Grass Kit. The instructions were very well written, easily comprehensible for even novice green thumbs and accurate. My wheat grass took a single week to grow approximately 6 inches high. I followed the directions completely! I was astounded at how quickly the grass grew and how healthy the end result was. My cat loves munching on this pet grass! So far he has been eating on it a couple times a day for a week. I've continued to water the grass once a day, so far my pet hasn't killed it! The grass is still approximately four inches in height. I couldn't be happy with this product! I highly recommend it to anyone who own an inside pet, cats especially. I live in an apartment on the third floor where my cat can't get to grass. I was picking him grass and giving it to him but that wasn't good enough. If you have the same problem this is the best bet for you! It truly works!
