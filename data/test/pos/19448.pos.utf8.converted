The ingredients of this chocolate bar are listed on the package as: sugar, chocolate, cocoa butter, cocoa processed with alkali, milk fat, lactose (from milk), soy lecithin, PGPR emulsifier, vanillin, artificial flavor, milk. It is 17% fat (a healthy fat from cocoa butter, with no trans fats), 7% carbohydrates and less than 1% protein.<br /><br />Dark chocolate is so named because it contains milk in relatively tiny amounts compared to milk chocolate and somewhat less sugar. As a result of having less milk and sugar, the taste of dark chocolate is more bitter compared to milk chocolate, but it still tastes sweet, especially when sugar is the first ingredient listed on the label as for this candy. Ingredients are listed in the order of quantity of each in the product. Since there is more sugar than any other ingredient in this candy (as in most all candy other than "sugar-free" candy), that's why it tastes sweet. In addition, the juxtaposition of chocolate that is more than usually bitter with the sweetness of sugar makes for a really delicious combination of flavors.<br /><br />Dark chocolate is one of several types of commonly sold chocolate. Unsweetened baking chocolate is quite bitter and consists of cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Milk chocolate is highly sweetened chocolate that contains milk powder or condensed milk. The amount of milk it contains smoothes out the bitterness of the chocolate substantially. White chocolate contains sugar, milk and cocoa butter, but no dark, cocoa solids, and it is not bitter at all.<br /><br />Research has indicated the darker the chocolate the more protective of the heart and cardiovascular system it is. (This brand of chocolate is 60% cocoa, but some brands go as high as 85-87%). In particular, consuming a small bar of dark chocolate, such as one of these, has been shown to reduce blood pressure in people suffering from high blood pressure and to reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol by as much as 10 percent.<br /><br />The reason chocolate is healthy is because it is derived from a plant, the seed of the tropical cacao tree, which contains substances called flavonoids. Flavonoids are antioxidants which protect the body from the damage caused by free radicals. Flavonoids also produce nitric oxide, which lowers blood pressure and balances important hormones in the body.<br /><br />These bars are a good size for a daily "dose" of dark chocolate. However, if you wish to buy a "giant economy size" of this chocolate, it is also sold in 6.8 oz. bars carried by most supermarkets for as little as $2.50. This large size is divided into 8 individual blocks. A serving size is three blocks at 170 calories.
