We have a 5 month German Shepherd female. This has been the third and best dry food for our dog. The first one Nature's Abundance recommended by the breeder. Although a good quality food, the dog would not eat it, hated the taste even if we added fresh chicken or canned food with gravy. I also think the breeder got some kickback from referring this product. We then tried Innova large breed puppy. The taste was better, but my pup had constant very soft non-formed BM's. After reading reviews about Orijen I thought we'd give it a try. From the very first bite my pup loved it. She will eat the dry food plain, a first for almost any dog I've owned. As recommended we gradually increased the portion of Orijen to the old dry food. When we were at about a 50/50 mix, my pup's BM's started to become formed and more normal. We are finally at 100% of Orijen, no problems noticed, feeding is a breeze, no more finicky eater and the BM's easy to pick up! I think this is a winner.
