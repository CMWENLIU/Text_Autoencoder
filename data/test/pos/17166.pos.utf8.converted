For several reasons, I've been using dry milk most of my life (over 40 years).  The stores in this area have either quit selling powdered milk or sell it in small, uneconomical sizes.  Being able to buy it on Amazon is a great relief, especially since it's a large amount that'll last me a long time.<br /><br />I think this milk is just as good as any other dry mixes I've tasted and I plan on buying it again in the future.
