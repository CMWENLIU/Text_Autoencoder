I bought this a few days ago and so far its working great! I've been counting calories to lose weight and this drink controls my appetite, makes me feel full and that way I don't eat all the time. The instructions for use say you have to drink one bottle before each major meal, but I drink half a bottle 1 hour before lunch and then the other half one hour before dinner and its working great. Some people might need a higher dosage. Its an expensive product but so worth it, at least while you're trying to lose weight.
