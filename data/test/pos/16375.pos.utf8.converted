I don't usually chew gum, but I found out it has xylitol in it, which is good for your teeth, because it kills the hamful bacteria. I bought it for when I go on vacation for those times I cannot brush my teeth. I expected it to taste minty, but even though it has a fresh taste, it has a flavor I cannot describe, I really like it, but only occasionally, so it will last a long time. I was really busy recently, painting the outside of the house. I didn't have time for breaks, so I put three of the small pieces in my mouth and enjoyed chewing them most of the day, the fresh taste lasted a long time.
