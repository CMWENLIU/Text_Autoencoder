These are very good tasting, with a Fig Newton like concept of cake/cookie outside and fruit filling inside.  The filling is firmer -less gooey- than Fig Newton filling, of course strawberry instead of fig, and a bit less sweet.  The outside is not as cakey as a Newton, more substantial but certainly not cookie-ish.  All in all a great snack or dessert.
