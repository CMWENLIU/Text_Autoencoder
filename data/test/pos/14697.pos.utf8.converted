My two cats (almost two years old) were raised on the Spot's Stew indoor formula salmon kibble (plus their canned food), and we've recently switched to this kibble due to possible grain allergies. They've just polished off their first 6lb bag of this, and it seems to be a hit! They took to the new flavor right away and chow down like nothing's changed. Just an FYI for humans, though: this variety seems to have a much more potent scent than the salmon flavor. (I can't speak to the scent of the others.) It's a normal, natural, chicken-y scent, just REALLY strong. Overall, though, it's a great product, and I'm really glad Halo came out with a grain-free variety so that I wouldn't have to switch my kitties to another (inferior!) brand of grain-free food. Thanks, Halo!
