I had read a few articles about Manuka honey, and it's supposed medicinal and therapeutic uses. I've had undiagnosed acid reflux for years now (perhaps it's something else?), and i've been battling it by drinking lots of water and trying to cut down on or eliminate the 'trigger foods' that bring it on. After about 2 days of use (3 teaspoons a day), I noticed my condition start to subside quite a bit! I would have never have believed it myself, but the Manuka honey was helping to quell my acid reflux events. This honey has a rather interesting taste, both sweet and a tiny bit 'medicinal' or bitter. The small hint of medicinal taste does not detract from the overall good taste though. The other great honey I discovered is Greek honey. To me, it is the best tasting honey in the world, and almost as effective for my acid reflux as the Manuka honey.
