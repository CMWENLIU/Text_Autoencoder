I am entirely pleased with this product.  Up till now, I have only gotten the dark flax seeds, purchased at my local health food store. The golden are so much nicer and grind up faster and more easily than the dark, plus they bake up into beautiful bread. I'm not a fan of buying already-milled flaxmeal, I just don't think it's as fresh or as good as grinding it myself, as needed.<br /><br />Being able to get a discount and free shipping for getting regular shipments makes it entirely affordable to buy online.  I appreciate the service from Amazon and the availability of this fine product.
