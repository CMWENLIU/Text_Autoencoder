A former vet tech of many years, we recommended CET chews to our clients. Back then, they didn't contain chlorhexiderm, but were quite effective as a dentrifice for dogs. With the added chlorhexiderm, they've only improved! My dogs find them just as palatable, but with the added benefit of anti-microbial properties most chews don't contain, it's something I can feel good about giving them.<br /><br />My dogs really enjoy these treats. I don't give them daily, just a few times a week. I strongly suggest pet owners be present when pets are using a chew. These should not be used a pacifier when you are away. Supervision is always a good idea as you never know if choking could occur.
