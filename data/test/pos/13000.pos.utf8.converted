These Pill Pockets are a total god-send. I have two cats, one of which has to be 'pilled' twice daily. This has meant a horrible process starting with her being wrapped up in a blanket. Now, thank heavens, we no longer have to go through that procedure. I simply pop her tablet into a Pill Pocket and she eats it up. My other cat is beyond fussy: she won't even touch fresh chicken, salmon, cream ... none of the normal cat 'treats' we humans offer. However, she actually BEGS for the Pill Pockets, which I now give her minus any medication as a treat. I recommend that anyone with a cat or dog keeps a packet of these handy. And if your pet is super fussy, they just might like these as treats. In fact, I'm so happy with them, I have already placed another, larger order. The only 'complaint' I have is that they only come in two flavors.
