These bunnies are my favorite cracker snack.  They taste like Goldfish but are less salty and not quite so cheesy in flavor, nor do they crumble as easily into orange crumbs.<br /><br />All ingredients seem to be organic, even the annatto extract used for natural color.  However, this product is made on equipment that also processes egg and soy products.<br /><br />A serving is 50 crackers (30g) and yields 150 calories, of which 60 are from fat.  Total fat is 11%; saturated fat is 5%.  Sodium yiels 250mg or 10% and total carbohydrate is 19g or 6%.<br /><br />This is made in the USA.
