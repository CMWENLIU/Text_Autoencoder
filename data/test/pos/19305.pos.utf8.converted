So I switched to Organix after feeding my dog Wellness since she was a pup.  Her stools had been inconsistent, one day runny and the next day firm.  She also had farts that were like WOAH (especially when on the Wellness fish formula).  Once I switched to Organix, her stools firmed up and were consistent (and less frequent).  She still farts occasionally (who doesn't), but not nearly as often and not nearly as bad.  Since this is a premium concentrated dog food without all those nasty fillers such as corn, I don't have to feed my dog as much as I would with, say, Purina.  She loves the kibble and gobbles it up every time.<br /><br />She is a 12 pound very active doggie, and the 15 lb bag usually lasts me 3 months.<br /><br />I have found Organix at Whole Foods and Petco as well, but Amazon is the cheapest.
