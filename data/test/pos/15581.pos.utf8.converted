:: Stash White Christmas White Tea ::<br /><br />Having read that white tea is even more healthful than green, more antioxidants, and also that its flavor tends towards the light and mellow, which would be good for my ice tea mixes ... I went on a hunt in AMZN's aisle for white teas. This type seemed to be generally a bump up in price compared to the general pop, like mostlly in the $18+ range. Then found this Stash blend at only $13, so for the savings, I figured that I could overlook the part about Christmas on the packaging.<br /><br />I was also happy about the choice of blend on this. White tea, ginger root, peppermint. Ginger is absolutely my favorite flavor for ice tea already. And a little peppermint in there sounded good, too.  Now that I have it, comment on the taste of the blend. The ginger in there is only very subtle. Which is fine, as I can add extra ginger tea bags to my ice tea batches -- and probably better as is for drinking just a cup of hot, straight tea.  The peppermint is distinctive. Overall, the taste of the blend is quite crisp and light, with an easy-going flavorful tinge from the peppermint and ginger.<br /><br />When I tried this tea, I was instantly pleased, and made a note to buy Stash brand again. (AMZN is running a promo on the brand this month, so that works well...)<br /><br />I am glad to have discovered Stash, and am eager to try a few more varieties. My previous experience in brands of teas what limited by what has been available at my grocery stores. Lipton, Celestial Seasonings, Yogi, Triple Leaf. Recently via AMZN shopping I've bought and tried three brands new to me.<br /><br />  o Bentley's. High quality green tea.<br /><br />  o Stash. White tea blend - very nice!<br /><br />  o Clipper. Blend of white tea + ginger. Tastes dry and messy and old.<br /><br />Glad that Clipper wasn't my only intro to white tea, since it was such a loser. The Stash got here the same week, and it, in contrast, was a very satisfying acquisition. I'm hoping for equally good results when this month I try out Stash in another variety, like probably a Green + ginseng. Or possibly a black, or even one of the chais ...
