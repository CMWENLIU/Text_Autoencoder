Okay,...they must put crack in this because I absolutely can't stop eating it.  Sometimes, I have it three meals a day.  It's only 140 calories a package and has lots of healthy reasons to eat it.  I get it delivered through subscribe and save to save money and make sure I always have it on hand. YUM
