All I had read about this product seemed too good to be true. I tried it and was extremely impressed. I did not use it for cooking though, since Omega 3 is obliterated by heat. So I sprinkled it on my cereal. From the very first day, I seemed to have more energy at work and didn't tire as quickly. I plan to contiue using it for a long time.
