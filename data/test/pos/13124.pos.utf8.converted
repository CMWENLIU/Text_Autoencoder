the Starbucks kcups are the best kcup available, perfect brew with smooth taste, great product, simply the best<br /><br />unfortunately the Amazon price is way too high, it's much cheaper in the local grocery or Target<br /><br />I'd be fine buying these at .75 a cup or better... until then..... I'm sure these will be getting old on the shelf....
