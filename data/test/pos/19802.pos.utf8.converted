I have a 12 year old lab/retriever mix and he absolutely loves v-dog. His weight is very good for his age and he is still able to run like a younger dog. I would recommend v-dog to other dog owners with no reservations. The dog food is high quality and the service is great.He just had an A+ evaluation from my vet.<br />Thanks for the opportunity to praise v-dog and the retailer who sold me my v-dog .<br />King Smith
