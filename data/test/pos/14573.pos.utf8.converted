I've been taking Maca root daily for about 4 years now and it has literally changed my life.  All brands are not of the same quality and I can tell very quickly if a product is not going to work for me.  Overall, I've tried about 4 different brands.  I ordered and have been using the Navitas Naturals Gelatinized Maca Extract for about 2 weeks now and it is every bit as potent as my previous favourite brand at about half the price.  I will definitely buy it again.
