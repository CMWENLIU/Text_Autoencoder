I wasn't too sure just what the Steel Cut Oats were but I have always<br />enjoyed Oatmeal especially for the health benefits.  (you know fiber, etc.)  This Oatmeal is just great.  The unflattened cereal ( a texture something like rice) is so satisfying for a wonderful breakfast (or any other meal).  I cook it in a double boiler with half milk and water.  A handfull of Bob's Red Mill Organic Raisens and a tablespoon or two of maple syrup.  What a great meal.  I start it first thing in the morning while I take care of my dogs and other morning tasks and when I am ready for breakfast it is ready for me.  A real treat.
