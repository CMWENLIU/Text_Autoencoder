I have trouble finding this particular tea in non-health-food stores. This tea is caffeine-free, so it's ideal for unwinding at the end of the day or for a quiet escape during a stressful work day. The tea has a strong aroma and flavor, a little bit spicy so not for everyone, but I find the scent irresistable and calming on its own. The flavor is a touch of sweet, a touch of tingle on the tongue. And as a bonus, each tea bag label has an inspirational saying on it. Even if you find the quotations silly, they're at least good for a giggle.
