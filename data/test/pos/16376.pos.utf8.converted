Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Beautiful fire-roasted tomato flavor. Well-balanced and mild. Not sweet or with too much tang. Medium thick puree base with nicely-sized crushed pieces. Great with organic pasta or mixed with your favorite organic veggies over rice. Also available in smaller size cans <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKVH9W">Muir Glen Organic Crushed Tomatoes, Fire Roasted, 14.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.
