This is by far one of the best coffee blends, I have tried. The beans chosen are a perfect meld, with what seems to be a lower acidity, a by product of the medium roast I presume. Douwe Egberts did their job right in selecting beans for their taste. A typical pattern in many coffee house brands is to throw together a low grade more plentiful bean with a few mid to high range beans and then pawn it off as a quality brew at a higher price. This often results in a coffee blend without taste. Douwe Egberts however, did their taste test on this blend and came out with a true winner.<br />The beans are roasted much lighter than your typical Euro roasts  think  french roast, again this also helps in creating a coffee that is less acidic. Yet while lightly roasted the beans have been roasted enough so that the oils will be released when put through a drip maker or coffee press, a problem usually encountered with  some of the lighter roasts. Their is a defint natural sweetness in the blend that I feel is  enhanced with the use of fat free milk, the lactose sugar of the milk becoming the only additional sweetener need. A full fat milk or cream would mask the complexity of the sutler flavors here and leave you with coffee that is creamer on the taste, but be on par with any store brand stale canned bean type where you taste the cream rather than the coffee.<br />This coffee's blend and flavor would make it great choice for finishing a hearty breakfast of bacon and eggs or with a lighter meal where the flavor of the foods are enhanced by a milder coffee that would leaves the food as a co-star with this blend rather than an attention grabbing bitter coffee. Happily five stars and recommended.
