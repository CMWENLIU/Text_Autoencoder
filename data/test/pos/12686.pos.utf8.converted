The Switch has come out with a wide variety of flavors for their refreshing all natural fruit drink, but the Watermelon Strawberry has to be by far the best. While the Switch juice drinks are good, some of the flavors can be a bit too sweet, despite the complete lack of artificial sweeteners in their product. The combination of Watermelon and Strawberry, however, manages to cut the sweetness with the fresh watermelon flavor. I would recommend most of the Switch juice flavors, but the Watermelon Strawberry would be my first choice every time.
