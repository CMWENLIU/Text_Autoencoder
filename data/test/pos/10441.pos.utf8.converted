Tastes nearly identical to the former Callard & Bowser licorice toffee.  Unlike what one reviewer said it is not hard and needs to be nuked.  They must have had stale candy or kept it in a cold place.  This is typical toffee in texture, soft and chewy.  It is delicious!!  Everyone I share it with LOVES it!  I can't stop eating it.
