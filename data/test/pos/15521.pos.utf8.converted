This are lovely, tiny, perfect little sardines, and probably of the most select size and quality available these days.  That being said, I have discovered that I actually prefer sardines with a slightly more pronounced flavor.  So, I will try some other varieties in order to find something more exactly to my taste, but these were very fine and deserving of five stars.
