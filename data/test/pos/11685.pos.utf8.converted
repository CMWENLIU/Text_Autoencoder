A friend recommended these Brothers Crisps and I am very pleased that we took her advice! Being a type 2 diabetic and trying to watch my carbs and calories, these are good snacks that satisfy my sweet-tooth cravings without overly spiking up my blood sugar levels. The real test with any "good for you" snacks is if my teens will eat them, and they also love them!<br /><br />These are made from real fruit (and nothing else) that has been sliced and freeze dried, making them crispy (exactly like "Astronaut Ice Cream") but they will reconstitute in your mouth if you leave them in long enough. This process also makes them very flavorful.<br /><br />This variety pack has an assortment of 3 different types, Fuji Apple, Strawberry Banana, and Asian Pear.<br /><br />Fuji Apple:<br />About 1 1/2 Apples per pack<br />39 Calories<br />7 NET Carbs (6 from sugar)<br /><br />Strawberry Banana:<br />About 1 Banana and 4 Strawberries per pack<br />45 Calories<br />8 NET Carbs (6 from sugar)<br /><br />Asian Pear:<br />About 1 1/2 Pears per pack<br />40 Calories<br />8 NET Carbs (7 from sugar)<br /><br />I like the Asian Pears the best, but all of the flavors are really good. The Strawberries can be a little tart which is different and not displeasing to me.<br /><br />These are a good tasting healthy snack alternative that, if it wasn't for the fairly high cost, I would keep on hand all of the time!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />Note: These are made in China<br /><br />CFH
