From the R. Torre Company in South San Francisco comes this "flavoring syrup in its familiar castle-decorated bottle."  I add it to sweeten and add a twist of flavor to coffee, but there are many other uses.  The label suggests adding it to "sparkling water, steamed milk, hot chocolate, iced coffe, or expresso drinks." Torani comes in many flavors; my favorite simple recipe is adding hazelnut flavoring to steamed, frothy milk.  Yum!<br /><br />Ingredients.<br /><br />Pure cane sugar, vanilla extract with other natural flavors, potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate (preservatives), and citric acid.<br /><br />That cane sugar is pretty strong. I suggest adding Torani Vanilla with some restraint, or you may mix up a cloyingly sweet beverage.<br /><br />Nutritional Value.<br /><br />You don't add this for nutrition, bue here are the facts, anyway: In each two tablespoon serving there are 70 calories, no fat, no sodium, no protein, and 18 grams of carbohydrates (16 grams of which are from sugar).<br /><br />There are lots of other flavors.
