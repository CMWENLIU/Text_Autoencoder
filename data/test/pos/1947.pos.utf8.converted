This stuff is great, adds a special touch to my 2-layer chocolate cakes that supermarket canned frosting just can't give, even though I still use doctored cake mixes.  And since I'm too lazy to make chocolate filling/frosting from scratch, this Schmear stuff is great.  In case you're wondering what it's like, it's kind of a bittersweet chocolate taste, at least when used as a frosting (you can bake this stuff in a pastry, but I haven't done that).  Some family members & friends love it because they don't like super-sweet frostings, while others have a sweet tooth, and have a hearty scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of the cake to help balance out the bittersweet.  One can filling per 9x13 sheet or 9-inch 2-layer cake is plenty, and adding chocolate shavings on top of the cake "pretties" it up a bit.<br /><br />The Amazon six pack is nice, because I'll keep a couple cans in my cupboard, and I'll pass a couple cans to my mom, because Dad LOVES this as a frosting.  He swears it contains chocolate liqueur, even though I've read the ingredients label to him.  :)  Another nice thing, the Schmear Chocolate has natural ingredients, and no trans fats (supermarket canned frostings contain trans fats, but this Schmear doesn't).
