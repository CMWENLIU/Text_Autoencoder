It's so hard to find a quality, grade one, single origin coffee. I got the product and immediately tried it. The flavor was incredible and the stick packs were nice, but I hope they will come out with a bulk (not in stick packs), pre-ground coffee option in the near future. Other than that, I could not be more impressed or pleased with the product.
