This is an awesome deal, but don't purchase these thinking you'll just snack on them because they're so healthy for you...you should make sure you like cacao nibs first. The flavor is intense and something of an acquired taste.<br /><br />I purchased these to use with the cookbook "Bitter Sweet" by Alice Medrich, which contains a chapter of recipes for cacao nibs and the author talks about ways she tried to use nibs that were a big failure and why...how they are good in cookies,  but awful in cream caramel. It even includes some savory recipes, green beans, eggplant, mushroom ragout, pasta sauce. Definitely worth a look if you've got two pounds of these things and don't know what to do with them.<br /><br />I should note for raw foodies: all those recipes are for cooked foods except one for a salad that is just baby greens, olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, pepper and cacao nibs, with a suggestion to optionally add a few more items like dried currants, shaved fennel or nicoise olives and/or goat cheese.
