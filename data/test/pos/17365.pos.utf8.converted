I use stevia extract every day instead of sugar. This product is dependable. By the pound, it is far cheaper than the 1 ounce bottles sold in stores. I cook for diabetic people and this eliminates the sugar problem. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. I will buy again.<br />For those unfamiliar with the amount to use - use 1/2 teaspoon of extract instead of 1 cup of granulated sugar.
