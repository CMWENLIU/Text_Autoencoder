Read the ingredients, this is not a HFCS/processed chocolate bar!  However if you like "REAL" food and are looking to have a slightly sweet snack that is completely good for you then this is it!  I gave up sugar a few months ago, and these bars have been wonderful, a way to satisfy my sweet tooth will all natural fruit-sugar sweetness...the main ingredient in ALL of them (Larabar & Jocalat) is dates, this one also has almonds and cocoa powder, do note that just because it has cocoa powder it does not mean it's sweet, this is unsweetened cocoa powder, the sweetness comes from the dates.  It's a snack you can feel good about eating.  Just make sure you are not expecting a sugary chocolate taste, or you will be disappointed! If you want a real, raw, good for your body, mind and soul snack then I highly recommend.  I also love the Apple Pie Larabar!
