I typically don't like much that comes from a box.  I would prefer to make everything from scratch if I could.  But I have to admit that this waffle mix is better than any that I've ever made from scratch.  They come out light and cripy, just like a Belgian waffle should.  I just can't seem to get the same crispness from my homemade waffles.  And I've tried several different recipes.  So until I perfect them from scratch, I'm going to continue to buy this mix.
