I bought this without a review which is rare for me.  I did it because I love castlevetrano olives and I can't get them locally.  I was worried because it's just a big can and I had read poor reviews on Roland other olives.<br /><br />I must say, this was one of my favorite purchases recently.  The olives are very good and the brine lets the olives speak for themselves.  Additionally, the price was pretty dang awesome.<br /><br />Directly after I bought them they sold out, so these may not be available anymore.  I'm on the waiting list if they do, however and will buy again.
