I bought this on sale and it was a fantastic deal. I've been trying to work more flax seed into our diet, mostly it's been the brown flax seed. I liked this because it doesn't make the food darker looking. Usually the brown seeds are cheaper, but with the sale these seeds were a bargain. I understand there isn't a difference with the health benefits. We bought a cheap coffee grinder and will grind seeds to then add to oatmeal, bread products, and even cookies. When I make pancakes with Bisquick I toss in a little ground flax. Really, if it has flour in it we add ground flax. I know some people leave the seeds whole, but I read that your body gets more nutrients from the seed when they're ground, and freshly ground is the best.
