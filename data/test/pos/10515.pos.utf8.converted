Evah since Grampa kicked the bucket my Gramma has been real sad and such. I remembah when Grampa would go out huntin and fishin and bring back all kinds of yummy dead things. Sos I come on this here internet thing and I see a fresh whole rabbit for sale! I thinks to myself, Gramma would love to get that as a gift and fry it up Southern Style for da whole family. My sister/aunt says, You oughta buy that fer her. Sos I do. And she was so happy ter get it. Said it reminded her of old days with Grampa. So I highly reccomend this here product for anyone who loves old style home cookin.
