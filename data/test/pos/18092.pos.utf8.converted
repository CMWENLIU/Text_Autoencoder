Just received our 5-lb. bag and my husband and I both love this soft and chewy product from Angelina's Gourmet Foods. We keep crystallized ginger in a sugar bowl on our table for "dessert" and/or to aid digestion. Although not labeled as such, I'm guessing this ginger is from Thailand, as most of the Australian ginger we've tried is very mild and often flavorless; not so with this one. It is spicy and hot and is what I expect from ginger; I don't have to eat a bunch to know what I'm tasting! I also chop it fine and add it to several recipes, including biscotti. We'll definitely order this again.
