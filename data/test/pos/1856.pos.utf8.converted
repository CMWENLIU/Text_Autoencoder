I bought a cannister last month at Fresh Market, tried it, and was blown away. What a bold and wonderfully-flavored black tea. It's become my afternoon treat: one or two cups, with or without cream, always some sweetening. So good. Starbucks has seen way less of me. :)<br /><br />I ordered this 4-pack cause I am going through it rather fast. These are leaves (not bags), so have a strainer/infuser handy.<br /><br />A new staple for me. It's so rich tasting, I can cut back on sweeter treats with NO problem. This baby satisfies. If you want to, you can replace your morning java with this (strong and rich enough). I still have my coffee in the am, but this is what I drink in the PM now, rather than coffee.<br /><br />Organic. Delicious. Perfect!
