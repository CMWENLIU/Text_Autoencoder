If you like pretzels and you like hot wings. Do yourself a favor and try these. You will not believe how much like a true hotwing they made these pretzels taste.<br />Oh and to the 3 star reviewer who didn't like that they are hot. Umm they don't call them cool wings. They are not hot, but do have a spice to them. If you are someone that eats hotwings you will love them.
