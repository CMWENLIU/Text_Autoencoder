I must say that for me these noodles are perfect. To be clear I am a guy(lazy, messy, tired after work etc who does not like to cook much and also was diagnosed with a gluten allergy).  I would highly recommend these noodles to anyone who trying to avoid gluten and at the same time those trying to lose some weight. They are an excellent source of fiber. I am not however a huge pasta guy so the taste or lack thereof is not a huge factor. I usually order from Amazon or asian food grocer online (Both are fine). FYI I eat these noodles nearly every day since they make good leftovers.<br /><br />How I prepare them:<br />Rinse them in a stainer under HOT water for two minutes(kills the smell)<br />Pasta sauce out of a jar brought to boil<br />Dump in the noodles.<br />I also add a few spices and grill up some chicken a few times a week.<br /><br />These noodles can be made in under 5 minutes as I just mix it with pasta sauce that I get from a jar. It is quick and lets face it 0 calories. Add some sauce and a piece of chicken and we are talking about a 200-250 calorie meal. There are some better ways to make these I am sure but I really just want something quick and low calorie. I hope this helps.
