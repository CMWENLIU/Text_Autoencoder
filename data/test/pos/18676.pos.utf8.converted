not really sure how i can review a product i can't taste, so i'll go by my cats reaction to this. i have 2 good eaters and one fusspot!. well, now miss fusspot jumps on the counter while i'm opening the cans and i have to feed her first! she has turned into a total pig!. i'm hooked on the stuff. I order several different flavors to give them some variety. I will also say that when I adopted my fatty 21 pounder, i tried for years to get him to lose weight. Recently the vet told me he lost 5 pounds! (that's like 50 pounds in humans) and I will honestly say the pounds didn't come off until I started feeding him this stuff. I gave him high quality dry food, pure tuna (pet food) from TJs and nothing worked. until this.<br />And the price is right! I'm hooked.
