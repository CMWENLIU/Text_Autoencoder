My local supermarket used to carry it -- I would practically empty their shelf each time I needed to buy it -- so what did they do? They STOPPED carrying it -- they still kept carrying the other Campbell's Low Sodium soups, but not this...<br /><br />But as a die-hard fan of this wonderful elixir for the stomach and soul, I now order it by the case.<br /><br />For those of you who eschew Chicken Fat (heresy!!!), once you carefully zip open the pop top, there is usually a clump of shicken fat floating on the top, so you can skim it off-- I have no problem with it, so I use one of those old fashioned beer can openers to make two holes in the top and then I just pour everything out.<br /><br />I know the label says not to add water, but I add a little water to the can,  swish it around and pour out the rest of the chicken-goodness into the pot in which I have already poured the broth.<br /><br />Try using this as stock to cook rice -- it is YUMMISH.<br /><br />And I have also given this in a small bowl to an ailing cat who would not eat -- she slurped it up and it helped in her recovery.
