We have a 15 yr old cat who was refusing to eat and the vet gave more icky food which she would not eat...we went to a local store UNLEASHED which sells cat and dog food and toys, etc..Keats was only 7 lbs just wasting away..and she is WOLFING IT DOWN and in a week has gained a pound!!!!!!!!! She is her old self and we are DELIGHTED! When you open a can it smells good...like healthy food should...not like most cat food does...I am recommending it to all friends with cats..we feel it has saved Keat's life...she has interest in everything and SO MUCH BETTER!!!!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND this food!
