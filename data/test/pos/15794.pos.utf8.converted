We have heard that so much. But have found it to be true with this low carb and low sugar product.<br />My wife and I are Type 2 diabetic and this product suits our needs emotionally and physically. It<br />tastes good too. We give chocolate to delivery people, friends at church, senior bus drivers, poor<br />children, homeless people, barbers, bakers, dentists, and candle stick makers. Spread the joy!! You<br />won't be disappointed. Hope this goes on prime soon.
