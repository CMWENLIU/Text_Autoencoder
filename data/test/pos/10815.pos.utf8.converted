I first tasted Q Tonic on a visit to California.  When ordering a drink, it cost $2.00 extra to have Q Tonic instead of regular tonic, and it was $2.00 well spent.  Hoping to find it here, where I live, I googled Q Tonic and it is not sold here but it was available on Amazon.  I placed my order and will be buying more, lots more!  It also tastes good alone.  I am very pleased with my purchase.
