Let me start off by saying that I seldom write reviews for products, even if I think they're terrific. This has more to do with the fact that I generally wait to see which way the wind is blowing before I jump in. Not so with Quinn Popcorn. I was one of the lucky group that happened upon their Kickstarter campaign and I couldn't be happier about it. We received our mixed case about two weeks ago and every time we want a snack we have to weigh the desire for an amazingly tasty treat with our limited supply. Is it really a "popcorn worthy" movie/episode/? Now that it will be available through amazon we will no longer be forced to resort to less tasty or more processed options. I think you probably get the idea by now that we are fans. Let me finish with some actual critique of the product. The flavors are excellent and the preparation is simple. Truly a great product well worth your snack money.
