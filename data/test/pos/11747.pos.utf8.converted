If you've turned your up nose at store brands before, don't do it for this one. Despite its humble Costco labeling, this is a very good and tasty Japanese green tea. That's because it is made by Ito En, Japan's leading tea distributor and one of the country's largest beverage manufacturers. I was surprised to hear of staff members at the Japanese Embassy in DC drinking this tea. It comes highly recommended from a Japanese friend working there.<br /><br />Made from 100% Japan-grown tea, this product also contains "matcha", a finely powdered high grade green tea. It's responsible for the lively green color. The pyramidal nylon bag lets water pass through better, so you get more flavor out of each serving than with traditional flat tea bags.<br /><br />Brewing temperatures for different kinds of tea vary, but to make green tea, the water should be between 70-80
