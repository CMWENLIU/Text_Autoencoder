After seeing a great segment on making your own tortillas on THE VICTORY GARDEN, I got incredibly inspired and went on a search for Masa Harina (Corn Flower) at the grocery store. I found a reasonably priced bag at my local health food store. The only three ingredients you need for excellent tortillas or arepas (South American version of a thicker tortilla) is masa harina, water and salt. You knead the water and salt into the dough, allow it to "rest" for one hour, then make small 2 inch balls of the dough, flatten them either between sheets of wax paper or your hands, and place them on a pre-heated skillet. No oil or butter is required to cook them up. They come out tasting fresh and delicious, and you can also rest assured that the flour is not made with GMOs (or genetically modified corn). The tortillas go excellently with either a smidgen of salsa, a dollop of sour cream or fresh veggies. They are also a great side for soups.
