Here is a common recipe that shows the possibilities of fish sauce, Chicken and Holy Basil.  This is my favorite version, there are many others.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />The proportions of ingredients are strictly to your taste.  My wife and I will use one large chicken breast, a whole bell pepper and a medium onion.  Too much chicken makes the dish too meaty for my taste, but as long as it cooks uniformly there's no right or wrong.<br /><br />1-2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into about 1" strips pieces.  I prefer all natural or organic, never frozen.  It costs more but tastes much better.  You can also add another chicken breast or two to scale up the recipe.  If you prefer, you can also cut the chicken into julienne pieces or even 1-2" cubes.  It tastes great however you do it!<br />1 bell pepper, seeded and cut into thin strips. I prefer yellow, as it's sweeter than green.  If you want more vegetables, add another pepper or more onion.  Just increase the sauce a little bit.<br />3-4 cloves of garlic sliced thin<br />1 small to medium onion cut into thin slices<br />1-2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and sliced thin.  You can use Thai peppers or even serrano peppers if you like it more fiercely hot.  The amount of pepper controls the heat.  You can omit these if you don't have the palate for spicy.<br />1 cup fresh basil leaves.  If you can actually get Thai basil this is best, but any will do, the fresher the better.  Feel free to add extra, particularly if you are increasing the amount of chicken and vegetables.<br />Sauce (this can be doubled or tripled quite easily, to increase the amount of sauce with your dish):<br />1 tbsp black soy (in Asian specialty shops)<br />1 tbsp sugar<br />1 tbsp white vinegar<br />1/2 to 2 tbs Tiparos fish sauce - The amount you use really controls the flavor of the dish.  If you want it more authentic, use the higher amount; if you want it more tame, the smaller amount.<br /><br />Directions:<br />1.  On medium high heat, heat about 2 tbsp cooking oil in your wok until hot<br />2.  Add peppers, garlic and onion.  Saute a few minutes until they soften<br />3.  Add chicen.  Saute until almost cooked through.  If you use previously frozen chicken, or over cook at this point, the chicken will be tough.<br />4.  Add sauce and saute until chicken it is just cooked through.<br />5.  Turn off heat.  Add basil leaves, and stir until they wilt.<br />6.  Serve imediately with freshly cooked jasmine rice.
