I am always on the lookout for a good strong cup of coffee and this product serves up just that!  I brew it on the "large cup" setting and it easily stands up to the addition of cream.  My mug is rather large, so 2 k-cups fill it to the brim.  At this price, it only comes to 80 cents a mug -- much less than what I would spend at my local coffee shop!  I will purchase this product again (and again)...
