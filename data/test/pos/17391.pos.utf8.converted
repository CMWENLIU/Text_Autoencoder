After having a beloved pet choke to death on a Greenie, the breeder recommended Bully bones for my dog's teeth. Unlike the greenies, this product will not break off and lodge in your dog's throat. I initially bought this product at Petsmart and while very expensive there, my dogs loved them and were actually chewing more. About two months ago I found these at Amazon. What a price difference. These are the same product I had been buying at the petstore but MUCH cheaper. I give these bones to my dogs after dinner and give them about a half hour to chew. After that I put them away until the next day. From the way the dogs react when I bring them out, they stay fresh.
