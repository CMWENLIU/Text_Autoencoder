This is really good maple syrup.  We've taken to using maple syrup in place of sugar in a lot of our cooking so we go through a lot of it.  I've had a chance to try a lot of brands and this is one of my favorites.  It's a medium amber so it's got a mild flavor that doesn't overwhelm whatever your using it in or on (if you like yours strong go with a Grade B from Highland Sugarworks).  When I can't get this I usually buy the "Shady Maple Farms" brand which is as good but usually more expensive.  Plus many years ago I was in the Army with a Sergeant Coombs who was from New England and I thought, who knows?  Maybe it's his family?  Okay probably not, but it's an entertaining thought.
