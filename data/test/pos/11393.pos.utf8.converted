Once I had one bag, I could not stop. I should have DOUBLED my order! These pork rinds were by far the most fresh, delicious, flavorful set I have had in a long long time. I am glad I took a chance with the variety pack. For those of us who like it hot and tangy, the spicy bbq will be right up your alley. The taste is a little bold. Hot sauce goes great but is optional. The salt and vinegar pork rinds have a very bold, distinctive scent. They may make you say "whew!!" when you first open them. Nevertheless, they have a powerful tang and are as crisp and wonderful as over. The plain pork rinds should be eaten with hot sauce, but can stand on their own just the same. The sweet and mind flavor is very quiet, very subtle. I suggest hot sauce on these as the flavoring is a tad quiet. It reminds me of the bbq flavor. Finally, the regular bbq flavor is the only one I really had a hard time tasting. Again, bring the hot sauce for this bag.<br /><br />All in all, It was a speedy, safe delivery I will be buying again and again. If you want pork rinds, do 'em right. Southern Things Inc. Has it down pat for this city gal.
