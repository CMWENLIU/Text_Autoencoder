I waited until I made this bread mix a few times before I would review it. This has by far been my favorite bread mix. I have completely given up on trying to make my own and will now ONLY buy this.<br /><br />A couple things to note is 1.) I let the dough rise accidently for 2.5 hours and I must say this was the best accident. The bread rose above the pan and rolled over some but it was almost like it completely changed the texture of the bread. It was way more fluffy like real bread. I will from here on out be letting this dough rise for at least 2 hours. 2.) I like to place foil on it half way through so that the crust doesn't become too dark, and 3.) when I pull it out of the oven I  like to baste it with milk and it softens the texture of the crust.
