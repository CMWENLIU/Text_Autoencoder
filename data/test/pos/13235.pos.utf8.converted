These green soy nuts are a delicious alternative to the smaller soy nuts that you usually find in grocery stores.  They are great by themselves and also make a great addition to a trail mix with other nuts and dried fruits.  Buying them by the dozen is great because the packages are small.  A good value too, as the only other place I've seen them charges over 1.50 per bag.
