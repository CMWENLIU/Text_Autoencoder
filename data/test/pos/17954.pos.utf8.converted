I just down this 100% cacao 4 oz. unsweetened dark chocolate baking bar as if it's something I bought at the candy store around the corner.  The fact that it's unsweetened and meant for baking doesn't deter me.  It might taste a little bit like chalk, but it's really how dark chocolate is supposed to be in its raw form.<br /><br />I highly recommend this dark chocolate bar to bakers.  I also highly recommend it to non-bakers who can literally stomach unsweetened dark chocolate, like me.
