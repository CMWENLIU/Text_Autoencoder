This applies to my situation only. I followed the directions of mixing this powder with water in a blender. I put the finished product in a container and put it in the refrigerator. The next day I drank a tall glass of this milk and it was very very good. To me so far this seems the most economical and the most satisfying powder milk product and I will keep buying this product.
