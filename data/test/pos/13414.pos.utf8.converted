Virgin coconut oil is great for your health and taste buds.<br /><br />I tried several different brands. I like this one a lot.<br /><br />I am not a big fan of coconut flavor, but this one smells different. It's preasant.<br /><br />Just 54-ounce jar was too big. I didn't have a sense of US unit. I recommend smaller jars if you don't bake often.<br /><br />You'll enjoy this oil as a substitution of butter and also you can use as your natural skin cream.
