This is the best I've tried.  one bag makes me two LARGE rectangular cookie sheet pizzas.  You don't even have to wait for it to rise, it is just as good.  I use my breadmaker to mix it and start the rise usually.  I grease up two LARGE rectangular cookie sheets, the ones with a side that comes up almost an inch high, with olive oil;  I then have a bowl of cold water to keep dipping my hands in, so they don't stick.  pick up half the batch for one pizza with wet hands, add more water, roughly roll into a log, put in pan and take your time pressing down and pushing it to the sides and corners, keep adding water to keep non-stick.  The trick for me is to make it as thin as possible.  Follow directions for pre-cook, and then add ingredients and finish cooking.  Comes out very good.  I've only had better at a restaurant in Worcester MA, Boynton's - awesome.<br /><br />This pizza, I"ll eat 3 or 4 pieces and then freeze the rest.  It heats up fine in the microwave, wrapped in paper towels, 3 or 4 pieces at a time for the next few weeks.  YUM!<br /><br />I use "subscribe and save" with my amazon PRIME account, for free second day shipping, PLUS an additional 15% off.  Can't beat it.  I just set the frequency to 6 months and manually renew it whenever i run out.
