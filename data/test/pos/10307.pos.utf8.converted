I am not sure what the other reviewer is referring to but the Organic Gluten Free Tamari travel packs are gluten free. I almost didn't order this because of the reviewer. I rushed to my pantry and pulled out the bottle of Tamari that I have to cook with and could find nothing that the reviewer referred to as having wheat in it. I have a gluten allergy. I am bummed when I go out for sushi & the establishment does not carry Tamari (wheat free soy sauce) so I usually fill a little container from home when I go out for sushi (often). When I saw the travel packs I was thrilled and ordered it. On the packaging, it states that it is certified gluten free. The ingredients are: Water, Organic Soybeans, Salt, Organic Alcohol. I give this 5 solid stars.
