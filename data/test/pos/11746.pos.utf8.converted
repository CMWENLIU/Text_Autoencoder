I've been ordering this tea from Amazon and think it tastes fantastic - and I hope it is doing good things for my insides.  If you have a Costco membership, you can get it for just under $13 in the store. I was there yesterday and decided to check - and couldn't believe the price difference! I thought maybe it wasn't the identical item but I confirmed it when I got home.  Now I feel like a fool for paying so much on Amazon. Oh well, live and learn.
