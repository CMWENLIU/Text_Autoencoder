I was told to eat tart cherries for gout and Trader Joe's used to have an organic tart cherry juice but it was discontinued long ago and I hadn't been able to find it anywhere. I couldn't find any kind of tart cherries without sugar nor any kind of tart cherry juice without sugar. True, this isn't organic but it's fabulous, delicious, and sugar free. I add it to water with fresh lemon juice and to my tea. If I had soda stream I'd use it with that. In fact now I'm thinking of buying Soda Stream just for this juice. I just received it yesterday. Last Sat I developed an acute attack of gout arthritis and this juice is already helping. I'm going get a bottle every month on auto delivery. I love it!
