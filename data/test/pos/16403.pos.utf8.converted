I wanted to order something from the gourmet food section besides chocolate, so I picked this package of 1lb of jumbo shrimp. <p>The packaging was very nice, they came in a large styrofoam box with icepacks keeping them cold.  I immediately froze them when I got them, as I wasn't cooking them within the next 24-48 hours.  <p>They dethawed well and I made them as a shrimp cocktail.  They were just as good as any shrimp I've bought in a grocery store, though far from the best I've tasted.  <p>While they were good, I will probably just buy my shrimp from the grocery store as the taste is comparable and then I don't have to pay for shipping.  They were decent shrimp though, so I recommend them to people who live in areas where shrimp is not readily available.
