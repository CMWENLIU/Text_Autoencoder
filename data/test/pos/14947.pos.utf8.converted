Having been a life-long allergy sufferer, I am happy to report this honey has helped the problem. I have also been recently bothered with heartburn, acid reflux, the like and had been prescribed Zantac twice daily.  A spoonful of Manuka honey before meals has stopped this problem completely.  I have stopped taking the Zantac. The honey is delicious as well. I appreciate the recommendation from Amazon.
