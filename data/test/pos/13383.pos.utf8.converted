I love these mints, especially the Wint-O-Green flavor. I always keep them around the house and often enjoy a mint after a meal; it seems like the perfect way to wrap up a nice meal. They're also great for mid-afternoon snacks when one has a case of the hungries and wants to minimize the calories.<br /><br />The nutrition facts on the package give the serving size as four mints although I usually eat one at a time after a meal. Four pieces have 60 calories so one would only have 15 calories, not bad for a snack substitute. As is usual with many candies there is no fat and no sodium. Also of interest to me was the fact they're made in Canada, not China.<br /><br />My wife and our guests seem to like them too and I'm always pleased when guests help themselves to a mint when they're over for a visit. We keep a bowl of them out on the kitchen counter.<br /><br />I've noticed that not all stores carry the Wint-O-Green flavor and some stores that do seem to be out when I drop by to re-stock; they must be popular because the Wint-O-Green display will be empty and the Pep-O-Mint display will be full. I suppose I can understand that because they do taste better to me too.<br /><br />I like the idea of the large bag since that requires fewer trips to the store, and I particularly like the idea that I can order them now from Amazon on my computer and save the gas money. The price also is better than the sale price at most stores.
