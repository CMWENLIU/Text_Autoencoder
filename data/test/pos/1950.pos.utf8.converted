When I adopted my cat they were feeding her science diet cat food. I kept her on that for only about 2 more weeks after before she was starting to refuse to eat the food and would go for my other cat's food that wasn't science diet. So I switched her to that and she ate that for awhile before getting fussy again and not wanting to eat that either. After trying out a few other foods I saw this food at our local animal store and decided to try it out. That was about a year ago now and so far I haven't had a single problem with this food. Both my cats love it and seem to like this food a lot better than the canned food even. The Royal Canin food overall might be a bit more pricey than others, but I'd say it is worth it if you have a picky cat like me.
