Lentils would win the Miss Congeniality title in any legume pageant.  Even the lowly brown grocery store variety is tasty in soups, salads and on their own, but Lentils du Puy are the Holy Grail of lentils, grown in rocky French soil and very expensive in the US.  Bob's Red Mill French Green Lentils are the closest things to Lentils du Puy we can get.  Even these are not cheap, but SO worth the price!<br /><br />How fortunate are we that Bob's Red Mill has these tiny green jewels available. Described on the package as 'exquisite', this is not hyperbole.  They are beautiful to look at and to eat.  The flavor is more sharply defined and 'beanier' than the brown kind, and makes a superb soup.  Simply saute some chopped up carrots, onions and garlic in some olive oil, add a cup of these green lentils in three cups of water or stock, a cup of dry wine, and a can of stewed tomatoes with juice, a healthy pinch of Herbes de Provence or Italian Seasoning, a couple of bay leaves and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes to an hour.  Meat eaters can add some ham cubes, cut up cooked Italian sausages or smoked turkey cubes, but it's wonderful meat free and even better the next day. For an elegant soup, use a stick blender to puree, and add a little cream or lemon, but none of these is necessary. A sprinkling of Parmesan cheese to serve is the perfect touch.<br /><br />I'm thrilled with these lentils and they've become a staple in my kitchen.  They do take a little longer to cook than the package directs, and do not expect them to become mushy.  No matter how done they are, they will retain their shape along with a lovely chewiness.  Main dish, soup, side dish or salad, you can't go wrong.
