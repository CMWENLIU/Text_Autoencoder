If you love dark, oily coffee beans that create a rich, robust cup of coffee, you will love Kicking Horse. I was introduced to it by Canadian friends of mine when they gave it to me as a gift.<br />Well, it took the first pot that we made to know that this was a keeper. The flavor is wonderful - dark and intense but not so much that it has no taste. Some of the dark roast coffees that we have tried have very little taste.<br />I am ordering this on a regular basis now from Amazon, of course.
