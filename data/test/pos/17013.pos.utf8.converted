I tried to demonstrate this in the video. If it's still available, clip the coupon.<br /><br />Update 09/21/12: As of 09/21/12, my local grocery store sells the Real Medleys for $1.79 a piece. I just tried Apple Walnut. Apple Walnut tastes like a hot apple pie from McDonalds. Peach Almond tastes VERY delicious as well. I'd still rather have them shipped to my door with free shipping (Amazon Prime) paying no tax and getting a free sample snack bar. Please always check to see if a coupon is available. Recently, there was a $4.00 clip this coupon. It's a shame you can't use the coupon multiple times for one big shipment. Finally, the expiration dates from Amazon are better than the grocery store. I have a month old shipment with an expiration of 01/13 from Amazon, while a local grocery store has the expiration dates mostly in late 2012.
