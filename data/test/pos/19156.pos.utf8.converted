I know most people don't like fruitcake, it's a huge joke. And that's fine, I'm cool with that. Nobody said you _have_ to eat fruitcake. I wasn't a fruitcake lover myself until I was an adult.<br />My grandmother always made fruitcake and I wouldn't touch it. My brother had told me that the candied fruit was plastic. Of course, he still ate it. So eventually I tried my grandmother's fruitcake and it was delicious. And I married a man who likes fruitcake, so that began my fruitcake experimentation.<br />Homemade fruitcake is completely different from store bought fruitcake. Store bought fruitcake is dry and has only a smattering of fruit. Obviously, the commercial bakeries do _not_ use the Pennant Fruitcake Mix.<br />This is a great fruitcake mix because it actually has a variety of candied fruit, not just a few pieces of citron or "mystery fruit" the "other" in the ingredients. The package it is sold in (16 ounces) makes it easy to use with your fruitcake recipe because of what most recipes require. The fruit is tasty, chopped well and believe it or not, inexpensive for this type of thing. Go check the grocery stores if you don't believe me, you'll see what I mean.<br />So if you're planning on making a fruitcake for somebody who deserves it and will appreciate it, I strongly recommend you use the Pennant Fruitcake Mix. Or for that matter, any other recipe that requires candied fruit. This mix will make your baked items delicious and easy to put together.<br />See how much better a fruitcake can be when you make it yourself.
