I could not figure out why my Asian food did not taste the same.<br />I would walk into an Asian restaurant and see signs indicating "We do not use MSG".<br />I did not even know what MSG was.<br />Well, I did a little research and found out that MSG was the essence of Asian flavor.<br />All the Doom and Gloom types have given it a bad rap. It's just like anything else, consumed to extremes... Bad,  consumed once in a while... Very Good!<br />Sure, some people might be sensitive to this particular spice and they should not use it.  As for the rest of us.... MSG gives food a unique taste that can not be duplicated. Soooo, Keep your paws off of my MSG so I can experience Asian food as it was meant to be.
