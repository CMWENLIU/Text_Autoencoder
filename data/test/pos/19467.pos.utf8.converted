I love this maple sugar! It is great sprinkled on top of cookies, or other baked goods, before baking. I really like to mix it with some cinnamon to put on my buttered toast....Mmmmmmm good! You can use it for so many things. And the price here on Amazon makes it hard to pass up...especially if you do the subscription option!
