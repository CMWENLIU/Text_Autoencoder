I've had the Euro Cuisine Yogurt Maker for well over a year now, but I'm just now trying out the starter the Euro Cuisine company offers.  While a little more expensive to use than six ounces of plain yogurt, it is easier to use.  As a bonus, this starter requires no refrigeration, so can sit around for awhile before use.  This is especially handy if you plan to use this starter as your back up starter, rather than as your primary starter.  The product comes with enough starter to make two batches.<br /><br />Use of this starter involves the boil method of yogurt preparation.  I've been using the boil method already, so this was an easy transition for me.  I discovered that the boiling point is lower with this starter than with  a plain yogurt starter and you don't have to cool the boiled milk down as far.  As a result, the prep time is shorter than when using plain yogurt.  The incubation period seems to be about the same.<br /><br />My first batch was perfect.  The yogurt is just a bit tarter than when made with a plain yogurt starter, but still quite good.  If you mix your finished yogurt with a little fresh fruit or a touch of fruit spread, the tartness isn't as noticable, but it depends on your preference.<br /><br />I love making and eating homemade yogurt.  The Euro Cuisine starter is a welcomed addition to my process.
