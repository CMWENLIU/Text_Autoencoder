This is my favorite granola.  Crunchy and sweet, very healthy, and taste is awesome.  I eat this, Kashi Go-Lean Crunch and Kashi Honey Sunshine.  I like them all, and enjoy the variety, but find I always come back to this granola.  I especially like the apple blueberry over the plain granola.  The pieces of dried fruit are a perfect mix in the granola.
