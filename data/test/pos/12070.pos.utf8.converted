This is a thick, creamy and exotically flavorful honey, but it is not inexpensive.  I love Tasmanian Leatherwood Honey, but purchase it only as a special treat, for the cost otherwise is prohibitive.  I recommend it because it's the most delicious honey I've ever tasted, as well as being antibacterial and calming to the digestive system.<br /><br />Once washed, the attractive containter can be used for other purposes.
