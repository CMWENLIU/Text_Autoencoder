I add flax seeds to foods regularly and have been enjoying oat bran for years.  Bob's Red Mill Organic Oat Bran Hot Cereal is my preferred brand, so it's great to find it offered at Amazon.  Known to add fiber and help reduce cholesterol levels, having this every day in one form or another is beneficial and can be very tasty, too.  The package contains a great muffin recipe and the Bob's Red Mill website offers additional recipes.  I'm currently reading the Dukan Diet book and see that one of the requirements for that program is to consume a tablespoon and a half of oat bran on a daily basis which sounds good to me.  He provides a little recipe for an oat bran pancake which I'll try.  I imagine that with the publication of this book in the USA, the interest in this product will skyrocket and that's a good thing.  Oat bran makes a great addition to bread doughs as well and you might even consider it in your next home made pizza.  This is much more than a hot cereal.
