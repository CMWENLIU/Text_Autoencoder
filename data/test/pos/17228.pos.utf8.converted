This Genmaicha is great quality and the price is unbeatable, especially with an Amazon subscription.<br /><br />My local grocery sells the same quality of organic tea for $60/lb which is more than 6 times the price.<br /><br />While the bag of tea I received did have a few stems it wasn't the bulk of the tea and I found I could easily steep between 3-5 minutes to get a range of flavours.
