I have recently gone organic and become  a "no refined sugar" eater as well as allergic to gluten. I've found it very hard to find a granola bar of sorts that doesn't have processed sugars, gluten (wheat, flour etc), is organic, quick to eat and tastes good! Thank you so much! :)  The brownie granola bar is just so flippin good! I'm glad it was recommended to me and I will continue to get them. I can't wait to taste the other flavors!
