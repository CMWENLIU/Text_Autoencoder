My body and I have a love-hate relationship since I wish I was tall and slim and it has been determined to be short and chubby since birth. This powder gives me protein and fiber to help me stay full (and not snack) which is a good thing. I prefer this flavor to the pink lemonade since the latter is a bit too tart. I buy it by the case on the subscribe-and-save program and keep cases of it at home and at work and order a lot during the summer since it seems to go out-of-stock during the winter.
