I wanted to wait to see how the product worked before writing a review.  I am the caregiver for my 88 year old grandfather.  He is pretty much bed bound.  He suffers from dementia so explaining to him that he needs to turn and to keep sleeping/laying in different positions is hard.  He would forget or keep lying on his back.  So of course he developed a sore on his bum.  My neighbor who is a PT assistant told me about Manuka Honey.  Well, I logged onto Amazon and read the other reviewers who purchased the Wedderspoon brand. I decided to give it a shot and bough it that evening, it was delivered the next day.<br />Before using the honey I was using many other types of products, creams, lotions, special bandages and nothing seemed to work. My Hospice nurse stated that bed sores are hard to treat and some won't go away.  Well I was not having that.  I told him about the honey and stated that I was only going to apply that and nothing else.  What's the worst that could happen? Him having honey on his bum?  I applied twice a day with loose gauze pads.  Sometimes 3 times but only when I changed his diapers.  I used a teaspoon or so at a time.<br />Within a few days I could see a difference!  Each day it got smaller and smaller and less deep.  The Hospice nurses and C.N.A's were amazed. They now recommend the Manuka honey.  I used the whole bottle but it HEALED the sore and I have pictures to prove it!<br />If anyone else is dealing with pressure sores or bed sores do not hesitate to buy it.  It's a great all natural product that works! You do not have to worry about harsh chemicals on delicate skin. I cannot say enough.  I also used the wonder gel extreme cushion to prevent any more sores from forming. :)
