This is a delicious tea that is not easily found in stores, even in upscale gourmet food item stores. The strawberry flavor come through clearly in clean and fresh notes and tastes fresh and natural.  The tea bags are foil-sealed and so the tea maintains its fresh taste.  I like that the manufacturer has opted not to use a metal staple so there are no metallic tastes to interfere with the tea and strawberry flavors.  Everyone to whom I have served this tea has raved over the taste.  I waited some time for Amazon to re-stock this item and have now taken to providing a box as an occasional gift.  This is one of the teas I always want to have available in my home.
