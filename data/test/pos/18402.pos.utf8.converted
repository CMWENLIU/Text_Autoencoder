I don't know why I can't get this at the supermarket anymore :(  I used to get it at Food Town and Stop & Shop and neither of them carry it anymore.  They have the Near East brand couscous and rice mixes, but not Taboule.  This makes a great salad.  You can mix in whatever you want, celery, tomatoes, beans, it is terrific and healthy.
