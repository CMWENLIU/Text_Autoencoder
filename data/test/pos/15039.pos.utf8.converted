I had some of this spiced chai at a friend's house a few weeks ago, It was so delicious I found myself buying a 12oz bag from the local boutique she bought it from.  Now I'm sipping my last cup from the bag so I came here to find more!  I'm thrilled to find it's sold on amazon in a larger size and is significantly cheaper than the boutique's prices.<br /><br />Yum Yum Yum.
