If you are a fan of artisinal honey, you will love this Autumn Forest Honeydew Honey.  It is not overly sweet, but has wonderful pear and melon flavors with a little mineral tingle, and a delicious aroma. It has layers of flavor like a sweet, light wine! It is not at all like Manuka (Wedderspoon's famous honey) - this is an eating honey.  I like it drizzled on walnuts and crumbled gorganzola. Tasty! New Zealand beekeepers are doing something right because their honey is the absolute best!
