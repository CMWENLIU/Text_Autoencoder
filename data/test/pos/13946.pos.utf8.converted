I have tried most of the K-Cups on the market.  This is the only one I've found that you can make (2) medium sized cups of coffee with one K-Cup and it is not weak.  I make a traveler cup every morning and it takes (2) mediums on the B-60 brewer to fill it just right.  If you plan to make just one medium or large cup it will be just as advertised, "Extra Bold".  Great coffee.
