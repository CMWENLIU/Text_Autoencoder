I love this tea, very pleasant and delicate flavor.  We drink it between meals, after meals, and sometime at night before bed.  Originally I ordered it for myself to support my dieting.  But now my husband, who cannot drink caffeine due to issues with his stomack, fall in love with this tea also.<br /><br />Amazon has great price on it if buy in 6 pack box.
