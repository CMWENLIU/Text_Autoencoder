I heard about these cakes first from the ever popular YogsCast. Being a fan, and after hearing the hosts scatter compliments about the cakes time after time, I decided to give them a go. Unfortunately, they are not sold in the US, so I came to Amazon to get them shipped from abroad. I was told to expect the cakes between March 2nd and March 15th.<br /><br />They arrived a few days ago, three weeks early.<br /><br />The cakes were perfectly fresh when they arrived, still in possession of their famous soft, spongy texture that makes them so fun to eat. The orange jelly is probably my favorite part of it all. First you nibble at the cake around the edges, enjoying the texture, then you get to the real deal, where the chocolate, jelly, and cake break off into layers in your mouth, letting you enjoy all the textures at once. Love these things. Even if they didn't taste good (which they definitely do, they taste really good) they'd still be really fun to eat. Perfect cakes from the perfect seller. Would definitely buy from them again.
