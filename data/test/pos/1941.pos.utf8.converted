I am Russian from Central Asia, and I grew up eating this kind of treat.I ordered this pack of 4 different flavors, so I could eat one, and share other 3 with people I care about.  It makes a unique gift.  I ate my box in two days.  However, it sticks to teeth, so it is not good for people with teeth problems.  My American kids did not like it, but it is their problem.
