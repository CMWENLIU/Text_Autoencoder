Quinoa is a relatively new grain to the North American market, but it's an ancient staple in South America.  And I'm really glad it's finally gotten popular, because it is an INCREDIBLE source of vegetable protein -- there are six grams of protein in each of these meal-size servings.  It has a mild taste, just as rice does.  It's a natural grain, and can be the equivalent of rice or potatoes in a traditional meal.  But, there's so much more you can do with it!  I've scrambled it into eggs, to provide more protein and volume.  I've added it to soups, I've just heated it, thrown in blueberries, and had it with a little hazelnut milk as a breakfast cereal.  I've had it warmed for lunch with a little salsa and avocado on it.  I've added it to recipes for breads, muffins, health bars.  I've used it to thicken casseroles, it's just a great, all-purpose pantry item.  And, it's organic, and fully prepared.  I like to mix a pack of this quinoa, with a pack of the McDougall's Lentil Curry that Amazon also carries -- and then I spoon that mix into romaine lettuce leaves, with a dollop of salsa, to make great tasting lettuce wraps for a fun frisky lunch.  This ready-to-serve organic quinoa gets five stars and two thumbs up from me.
