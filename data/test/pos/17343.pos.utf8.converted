All of a sudden my 11 1/2 yr old beagle started acting strange at night, pacing around, not sleeping, not wanting affection when she always wanted to be by us and snuggle before. Based on what I could find online I thought she was getting doggie Alzheimer's and I was scared. My boyfriend got this at a healthfood store and we started giving her 4 drops 2x a day (once with dinner and once at bedtime; she is approx 22 lbs). Right away there was a difference. She started sleeping through the night and seemed much more relaxed and herself. After only a few days she was snuggling again! I find it's easiest to mix in with food rather than in the water bowl so I can control how much she takes, plus we have 2 dogs and the other one doesn't need it. At bedtime I give them some unsweetened applesauce which they love and I just put her drops in that. This is a great price compared to the smaller size we got at the healthfood store, and I received my order earlier than expected. I definitely recommend this!
