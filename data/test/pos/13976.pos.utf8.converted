I love tofu, but I can't always find it at the store. Imagine my delight to find it on Amazon by the case and deliverable to my door! Now I can make cookies and supper without delay or a trip to the store (or another store). For sweets, I substitue tofu for eggs and applesauce for butter. I use tofu in Hamburger Helper dishes, it blends well with the sauce and spice. Firm tofu is excellent in stir fry especially with a flavored marinade, which doesn't have to be high sodium soy sauce.
