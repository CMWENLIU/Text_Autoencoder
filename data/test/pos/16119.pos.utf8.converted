I had been feeding my cats a so-called "quality" food for years, until I found out about all the by-products and other junk it had in it. I have since been experimenting with various premium brands to find one that my cats liked and that they didn't barf up every other day. I've finally found the winning formula with this food. They love it and their hairballs have been greatly reduced. But there have been some other effects I hadn't counted on. My oldest cat (12 years) is suddenly acting like a kitten again. My younger cat (10 years) has always had a difficult coat which is now silky and rarely mats. And through Amazon, this brand is less expensive than many other premium brands. Bonus!
