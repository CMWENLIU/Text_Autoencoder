This cereal is not only delicious, but it creates the most amazing gas! I walk around for hours literally farting with every step I take! At work, my chair really takes a pounding and the warm odor of high-fiber farts lingers most of the morning, making my irksome coworkers more reluctant to bother me.<br /><br />The only down side is that unless you let it soak a long time, it's like trying to eat a bowl of rocks. Warming it in the microwave improves the soaking time and is great for the cold winter months!
