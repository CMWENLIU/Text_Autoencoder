I keep several of these McDougall's meals in my office at work.  They are high quality and taste great.  I like the convenience when I forget to pack my lunch.  I'm vegan and find it difficult to eat out in the area where I work, so having these stashed in my office is great.  My daughter is in college, so we send her a care package of McDougall's once in a while and she loves them too.  It's so easy to do with Amazon and these are perfect for college students.<br /><br />The preparation is easy if you follow the directions.  Although you microwave them, there are a couple extra steps with adding water, stirring, heating, stirring again, etc.  But the preparation is very manageable and worth the small extra effort to get such a nutritious, vegan meal.<br /><br />As a full grown male, the serving size is a little small, so I need to either fix two of these or have something with it, like a hand full of nuts, some fruit, or a small salad.<br /><br />Definitely worth trying!
