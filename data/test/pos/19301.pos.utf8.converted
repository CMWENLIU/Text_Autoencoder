I used to give my dogs chicken tenders from a major food chain.  They boasted high amounts of protein.  But this product is softer, no sharp edges and adds supplements of flaxseed and vitamins for the health of your dog.  I would much rather pay a little extra and diminish or delete any additives, dyes, fats and other unhealthy additives.  My dogs can't get enough and I feel better knowing they are receiving a healthy treat. I highly recommend them.
