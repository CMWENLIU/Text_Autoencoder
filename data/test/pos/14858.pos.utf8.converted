Taibi's Nocellara EVOO is amazing.  It has a very pure, clean taste with a spicy finish.  Best if used on its own with a great bread for dipping, although it can obviously be used in salads or marinades (excellent for fish).  It is great to have the ease of finding an oil this good on Amazon....Great gift idea if you are tired of bringing wine.
