Wellness has taken an already great product and improved it even further. I initially tried introducing Wellness to my black lab in 2003 and found her to be intollerant of the Lamb formula. So i put her on another food all the while hoping the Wellness formula would change a tad so i could try her on it again. I transitioned her onto the new Wellness about two weeks ago and she is doing fantastic!! She has a lot of food allergies and sensativities, but we have found the new and improved Wellness to work wonderfully for her. The high quality ingredients really do make a world of a difference - especially for a working dog!
