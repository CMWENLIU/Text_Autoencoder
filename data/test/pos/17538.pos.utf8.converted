I have been a fan of Lipton's tea for more than 40 years.  As other teas have gained in popularity, I have managed to stay with my favorite.  I also admit that I prefer the unsweetened without lemon flavor, but presweetened with lemon is my second favorite choice.  I also prefer the fully caffeinated ice tea mix.  There are decaffeinated versions available for those who are unable to handle caffeine.<br /><br />Thomas Lipton, a native of Glasgow, entered the tea business in 1890, with the goal of making tea affordable.  In 1893 he established the Thomas J. Lipton Co. in New Jersey.  In 1915 Lipton was incorporated with Thomas Lipton as its first president.<br /><br />While it is uncertain as to when ice tea was first invented, it was offered at the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904, and became an instant hit.  When I was a child growing up in Kansas City, there was nothing like a cold glass of Lipton Ice Tea after being outside in the hot Missouri summer.  Green tea may offer qualities that black tea does not, brewed tea may offer a truer flavor, but I still like good old instant Lipton Ice Tea.  I must go now as I am getting thirsty for a glass of Lipton Ice Tea.
