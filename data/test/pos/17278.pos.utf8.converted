I think that some people have complained that this popcorn is bland, but that's what it's supposed to be.... It's a product that is as healthy as you want it to be- you decide. :)  Although I do like to add salt, I have found that I don't really care to add a lot of other flavors to it.  This is probably because my mom used to air-pop popcorn when we were kids (and add her own flavors) and it kind of reminds me of that.  I guess she didn't add very much. :)  It seems to "pop" better than other varieties I've tried and it doesn't leave you with greasy fingers.  Good job, Newman.
