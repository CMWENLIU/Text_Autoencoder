Actually my whole family was impressed. Not that my kids drink margarita's for real, but they loved the taste of this. I was blown away when mixing it up how much the mix smelled like an actual margarita. Now, while you can never capture the taste of the missing tequila in any non-alcoholic drink, this one came as close as possible to doing so I think. Really good and really refreshing :)I've seen it in stores, and will now buy it!
