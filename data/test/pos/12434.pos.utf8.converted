The ingredients are not included in the packaging, so I have no idea what I have been putting in my soups, fish, and vegetables for the past 2 months. The flavors are not real strong. There isn't a strong pepper flavor, which I prefer, so I usually add ground pepper too. But this mix does give some flavor and, best of all, without salt.
