I'm a huge fan of iced coffee, but I don't own a coffee pot.  I recall trying Starbucks VIA in stores a few months ago, and the barista telling me that it could dissolve in cold water or milk (unlike normal instant coffees), and tucked it away in the back of my head to try it this summer.  I was pleasantly surprised when Starbucks came out with the VIA Iced Coffee packages, mostly because it was designed for a 16 oz serving and lightly sweetened with sugar (100 calories in the entire packet, 50 calories for an 8 oz serving).  I add it directly to 16 oz of skim milk, add a little extra sweetener, and shake it all up in a water bottle.  It's delicious!  It has the classic Starbucks coffee flavor, without being overly bitter, because the coffee hasn't been brewed.  It dissolves almost instantly, sugar and coffee and all, in COLD liquid, with no residue or sediment at the bottom.<br /><br />At $1.00 a packet, it's not cheap - but it is cheaper than getting an iced coffee at Starbucks, and just as delicious - plus, you don't need to leave your house.  I used to make cold brewed coffee to drink iced, but that has to be done the night before to extract the full flavor, and then you need to strain it, and to make larger quantities was just cumbersome without the right equipment.  I love that I can just pour a packet into a water bottle, add water or milk and sweeteners, and instantly have delicious iced coffee!
