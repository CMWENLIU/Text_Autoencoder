I love the dried kale and this is just as delicious! Oftentimes I'll take a slice of this "bread" and a 100-calorie pack of plain almonds and this 200 calorie combo is enough to get me through the work day! Crunchy and savory, like a big cracker, and a great bread substitute for any raw vegan, or anyone aspiring to add healthier snacks to their diet. I don't eat any grains, short of the brown rice protein powder I occasionally add to smoothies, and every once in awhile a craving for toast sneaks up in me...this does an excellent job of satisfying that craving! I also found a recipe for olive "butter": a few tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and a dash of salt in the freezer until it reaches a buttery consistency; a little of this spread on the bread tastes great! Highly recommend this and anything else from Lydia's Organics.
