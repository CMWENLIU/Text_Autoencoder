First off I'd like to say, I just tried this tea for the first time, and I loved it. The tea has a subtle flavor, that is hard to describe. It has a pleasant taste that is not to overwhelming, but refreshing. It gives you a boost after drinking it, and leaves you feeling more alert and peaceful. The goji berries have a slightly sweet and bitter flavor, and taste like they were just picked. I have always been impressed with yogi teas. Not only do they  taste good, but they are all very healthy and promote healing. I would also like to add, that the goji berry is one of the most healing fruits in traditional chinese medicine. After I drink up my boxes of tea, I will definitely order more. This tea is 100% percent organic, made from a proprietary blend of green tea, green matcha tea leaf, and goji berries.
