Coconut cream has got to be one of my favorite foods. It is wonderful for cooking, making candies, desserts, or eating just plain. I also like to mix it, half and half, with peanut butter for my toast, pancakes, etc. It's not quite as creamy as other brands I have tried, but for the price I will definitely be buying it again.<br /> If you live in a cooler climate than, say, north Florida where my coconut cream is consistently soft, it will take quite a while to soften it.
