My 5 year-old son has multiple, severe food allergies...peanuts and treenuts are biggies.  He's NEVER had peanut butter or anything with peanuts/tree nuts for that matter as he's been so allergic to things since he was about 12 months old.<br /><br />I found this product doing a Google search on "soy nuts".  He loves steamed edamame so I had to give this stuff a try.  I went to Shoprite last night to buy the soynut butter, gave it to my son for snack when I got home and he absolutely LOVES it!!  He's eating little SB & J sandwiches on rice crackers as I type.  (He also can't have gluten.)<br /><br />I bought the original creamy type.  It "sounds" like peanut butter when you break the seal, it smells just like peanut butter (honest to God!), has the same consistency of creamy peanut butter and tastes like it, too.  It has an ever so slightly different taste to it. I can't even tell you how excited I am about this stuff! I LOVE peanut butter but haven't had it in 3 years as a result of my son's allergies.  I would not hesitate for one second to put this on an english muffin with some jelly for my own breakfast.  It's delicious and a must have for little one's with peanut/tree nut allergies.
