I use these when I go on long runs to help calm my stomach. They work well, but I used to have to unwrap them beforehand; otherwise, I had to stop my run to concentrate on the impossibly sticky wrapper. They recently changed the packaging to include a powdered inner wrap. Now, I can unwrap the outer layer and have the chews ready to go on a run.<br /><br />Good ginger flavor, very chewy, does not melt much so needs to be chewed.
