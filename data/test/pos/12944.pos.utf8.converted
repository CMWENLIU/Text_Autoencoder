I use it on steak mostly.  It is THE BEST seasoning I have ever tried.  I discovered it also while on vacation in Chautauqua, New York.  I have found you get the most bang for your buck just by sprinkling it on sparingly AFTER the meat is cooked.  Adds the perfect enhancing flavor to your meat.  One little jar has lasted me a very long time!
