I love this tea, Triple Leaf Ginger. It is so good, and so relaxing. I drink about 2 pots a day, sometimes doubling up on the bags to make it a little stronger. I used to have trouble with my stomach, mild upset and such, but since drinking the tea I haven't had any complaints. Ginger tea is known for it's healing qualities, and this one won't disappoint.
