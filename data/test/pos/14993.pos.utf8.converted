I originally didn't buy this for the taste.  I bought it for first aid.  Just kinda to have, "just in case".  Well, the day I got it, I was feeling rather poorly.  My stomach was so upset.  I read the directions and put 1 tsp. in a glass of cool tea.  Anyway, in about 15 minutes, I didn't feel as sick to my stomach.  However, the truly amazing thing was the taste!  If medicine would all taste this way, I know quite a few children that would be less inclined to fight taking it.
