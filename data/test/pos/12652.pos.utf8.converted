Order was processed and fulfilled in a timely manner.<br />Product arrived in factory packaged box of 4.<br />I just eat a few handfuls of these a day.  You should chew them up completely in order to access all the nutritiion.  Whole seeds are not broken down in your digestion system.  Others may think otherwise but once chewed I liken them to the taste of pecans.  They feel like they would be good for you when you eat them too.
