I have only purchased the Haribo Gold Bears in the past, but I decided to give the Frogs a try. Boy was I delighted. The Bears are filled with flavor, and these Frogs also have the same fruitful flavor, only with a layer of the white, marshmallow-like gummi on the belly side of the Frogs. If you have only bought the Bears because you know you can't go wrong with them, you may like something different but not too different like these Mini Frogs by Haribo.
