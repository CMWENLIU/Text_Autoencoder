I have bought these retriever rolls several times and they always arrived promptly and consistantly good product.  My dogs are getting older and they like these rolls better than the rawhide bones with the knots on the ends.  The rolls last long enough for a good chewing without that annoying knot left laying around.  Good stuff!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CMMJFY">Retriever Rolls Rawhide 10" Pack of 20</a>
