Buy this peanut butter.<br />Ok ok.. sometimes the crunchy kind, one batch will be a little dryer than the other, I don't know why. The honey type here, was freakin' AMAZING. Perfectly sweet, smooth and versatile- baking, off the spoon, foreplay...<br />Gluten free, natural, inexpensive and delicious, I would marry this company if their standards were lower.
