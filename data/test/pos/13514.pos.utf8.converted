i think this is an excellent and healthy alternative to sugar for sweetening anything. i made some ginger cookies using this and molasses as my only sweeteners. the batter is runnier than if using sugar, so i added a pinch more baking soda and a little more flour. their website has recipes. i disagree that this is like pancake syrup. it is much healthier than maple or imitation corn syrup-based syrups, but it is watery. also, in cold drinks it thickens up like honey does, so it takes longer to dissolve. sweeten your iced tea when you first make it before adding ice and hot drinks or hot cereals or baking is no problem. it has no after taste or unique taste (like honey does) whatsoever, so is equal to sugar in its uses without the spikes in blood sugar. i think this will become the new sweetener of the future due to its lower glycemic index and that it's much healthier than the lab-created high fructose corn syrups or artificial sweeteners. i hope the price comes down as well. this sells regular price for $5.99/each at whole foods market here, so it is not a huge savings to order online considering you have to buy a case, but convenient especially with free shipping. i am going to order the dark next time to use in place of brown sugar in recipes and maybe for pancake syrup. i highly recommend this syrup for all your sweetening!
