It's hard to explain what this Bonito del Norte tuna is like to people that can only relate to the canned tuna commonly found in grocery stores in America. It really is a completely different type of food. Delicate, tasteful, and healthy!<br /><br />You are probably used to mixing your tuna with mayonnaise or some other thing to make it palatable, but it would be a shame to do that with this tuna, because it is truly a pleasure to eat on its own on crispy french bread.<br /><br />I will keep ordering this product and make it a regular part of my diet.
