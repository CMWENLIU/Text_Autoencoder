I am VERY sensitive to Caffeine. It can send me into a full blown anxiety attack.  This product, for some reason had NO adverse effects for me.  If this is usually an issue for you, I would suggest trying 1/2 a bottle and seeing how you tolerate it.  I had energy.  Since it has B12 vitamins in it, my mood was also enhanced. I felt excited and energetic.  The berry flavor tastes like Crystal Light Pink Lemonade.  Almost exactly like that.  There was no crash AND I was able to sleep well that night.  Sound too good to be true!? It was for me. I am SERIOUSLY trying to resist the urge to stock up and buy a whole case.  This stuff is great.  I was in a show with someone who had trouble focusing, was moody and forgetful.  We were on stage and he was often a mess... One night he did an amazing job, and I asked him what was different... He said... I took a 5 Hour Energy drink.  I was stunned and still not convinced... but saw the drink in a store and had to try it.  WOW!  That is all I can say! WOW! It's great!!!
