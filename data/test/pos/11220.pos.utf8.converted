The Godiva kiosk closed in our local mall.  I was very disappointed, because my family expects a selection of Godiva chocolates for Christmas, Easter and birthdays.  However, they have their favorites, and unfortunately when ordering Godiva off-line, you have no choice but to purchase assortments over which the consumer has no input.  They are selected and pre-packaged for you.  So I was looking for other candy companies which might sell chocolates which approximated my family's favorite items, without having to buy extra candies they might not like.  Enter this wonderful collection by Leonidas of Hazelnut and Almond praline-filled milk chocolate confections.<br /><br />These are fantastically excellent chocolates -- just as good as, or better, than the Godiva signature oysters which my family loves. They arrived protected in styrofoam by overnight shipping. I will definitely be dealing with this seller again. I am very impressed and pleased by the chocolate and the high quality of the product.  And the taste?  Just heavenly.
