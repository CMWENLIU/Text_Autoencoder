I love this stuff! Wild Ride Kickin' Teriyaki (Hormone & Antibiotic Free) has NO nitrites and NO MSG. It is made with natural ingredients, which is about as healthy as you can get while still eating beef. It is also low in calories. An entire 4-ounce bag is only 200 calories, or 50 calories per serving, high in protein and low in fat. I'm watching my weight, and Wild Ride is a welcome addition to my balanced diet.<br /><br />Essentially, it is sliced steak in a bag. An average piece is bite-size, about one inch square and about 1/8 inch thick. Keep in mind that Wild Ride is definitely NOT shoe-leather-tough like most jerky products, thus traditional beef jerky lovers may be put off by the tender quality of the meat. If you're looking for tough meat with the consistency of a radial tire, then buy something else. But if you want beef jerky that is chewy, tender, and flavorful, get this product.<br /><br />I have only one complaint; about 1 in 5 bags have a few pieces containing gristle or sinew (the pieces don't break down completely when you chew them). While this is an inconvenience, the problem is still minor enough for me to give the product five stars based on overall taste and quality.<br /><br />Kickin' Teriyaki is slightly sweet (like Teriyaki sauce) and not too salty. It is one of my favorite flavors. MMmmmm! Yummy!
