I didn't realize that this was 'the' brand to use for making arepas, but it doesn't surprise me at all to find out. My friends and I used to use Maseca when we made arepas on the weekends, or the morning after a party at our house to fuel the clean-up effort and for whomever was still hanging around. After more than half a decade of doing this we stumbled upon PAN and realized just how much better it is at making a beautiful smooth almost creamy masa. The results are not even comparable. Luckily we can get it quite easily in any grocery store in or around DC, I'm sorry to here that you have a hard time finding it in CA-- that's surprising. So this review is really for comparison of brands. So as far as that's concerned, this is it. If you are thinking of ordering corn flour/corn meal on the internet for making tamales, arepas, tortillas, etc. this is the brand.<br /><br />And since I'm writing a review anyhow, I might as well share, this is how we make arepas:<br /><br />Mix PAN white corn meal with water and a bit of salt to make a masa (dough) which should be wet enough to easily form into thick smallish pancake like forms in your hands, but shouldn't come off in little globs sticking to your fingers. However you will get sticky hands eventually. Cook these on a medium heat using a cast iron skillet lightly greased with olive oil until the arepas are nicely browned on both sides, then transfer them to the oven to keep warm while you finish the rest. I like to make my arepas fairly thick, about 3/4" and 5-6" in diameter. Made that way not many people can eat more than 2, because then of course there are the fillings....<br /><br />Grate some fresh mozzarella cheese, put 2-3 cans of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005YL6TA">Goya Black Beans - 24 Pack</a> in a pot with chopped green onion and a little salt. Simmer on a medium low heat like that until they look and taste done. They should be served hot so if they finish before everything else is ready just re-heat them before serving.<br /><br />Guacamole and salsa are also a must, and you can have a little extra chopped cilantro on the table for people to add if they like.<br /><br />For the salsa, chop about one small red onion very finely. If you find raw red onion too sharp a taste you can soak it, once it's chopped, briefly in a bowl with salt water to draw out some of that intensity. Finely dice 3-4 large ripe tomatoes removing most of the watery bits. Mix with the red onion, juice of half a lime, add some chopped cilantro and salt and pepper to taste. Only add the salt just before serving as it will draw out the juices in the tomatoes. Or instead add half - 1 pack of Goya Saz&oacute;n <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SW1GSU">Goya Sazon Goya Clntro/achte, 1.41-Ounce Units (Pack of 36)</a>.<br /><br />For the guacamole, use 5 ripe avocados chopped and then continue to mash with your hands. I usually give this job to some poor helplessly polite and obliging guest, but trust me it tastes better that way. Not when a guest does it but when it's done by hand. You still get some nice chunks because hands just can't squeeze it all out before even the most obliging guest will ask to be excused, but it's still nice and smooth. Come on, don't be so fastidious! They'll wash their hands! Season with finely chopped cilantro, fresh lime juice (the importance can not be stressed enough of only ever using freshly squeezed lime juice, whether you're making a gin and tonic or guacamole-- no exceptions. And the same goes for lemon juice.), continue seasoning with salt and cumin powder. Add to all of this some finely diced tomatoes and even more finely chopped red onion as well as some completely pulverized jalepano and you'll have a killer guac.<br /><br />All of these things can be put out in bowls for guests to add to their arepas in whatever combination or ratios they prefer. But if you're taking beans and cheese I don't know why you would put them next to each other so that the warm delicious re-fried beans can slightly melt the cheese. Like I said before, you can also have a small bowl of chopped cilantro and or chopped green onion and or sour cream for people to add as well.<br /><br />&iexcl;Buen provecho!
