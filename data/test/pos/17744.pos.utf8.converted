Steel cut oatmeal has a grainy, hearty texture that's more like al dente pasta than mush.  American grown varieties often have a gelatinous texture between the grains.  The Irish grown oatmeal is firm and nutty through and through.<br /><br />My electric range cooks the oatmeal in about 25 minutes.  I use a straight-edged spatula to keep the oatmeal from sticking to the bottom of the pan.  Avoid over-stirring to keep that nice, firm texture.<br /><br />More good news: Steel-cut oatmeal, like chili or stew, is better on the second day.  Pour your leftovers into a bowl, lay plastic film directly on the surface of the oatmeal, and store in the 'fridge.  Reheat in the microwave with a spoonful of water for a minute or two.<br /><br />Genuine maple syrup is the best sweetener for oatmeal, in my opinion.  Add diced apples or raisins or bananas, with a little milk, and you've got yourself a bowlful of breakfast!
