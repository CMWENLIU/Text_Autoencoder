I originally got this for my 2 cats for basic function as a cat scratcher.  The moment I introduced it to them they had a blast with it. Climbing on it, hiding behind it, trying desperately to get that toy out if it.  They stick their paws in it and then their heads, when that doesn't work they try on the other side, then go back again. They chase each other around it and fight over it. It lasted nearly a year until when they were playing tag, one cat was perched on top of it in wait, the other came pounding toward her, took a flying leap on top of it and completely crushed it, scaring both cats enough to jump 10 feet. I laughed for hours.  This item is not only functional but I found it provides hours of entertainment for cat and human alike.
