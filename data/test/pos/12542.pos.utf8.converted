Typically I don't like green tea, but this tea doesn't taste anything like the typical green tea!  The lemongrass, spearmint, and passion fruit flavor keep it from being bitter, and make it very tasty.  I also find that when I drink this, it soothes minor heartburn and stomaches.  I don't drink any other tea!
