Recently, I wanted to "up the ante" on my Omega fatty acids so I added Coconut oil to go along with my doses of flaxseed oil and fish oil. Yes, Coconut Oil is a saturated fat, but because it's a medium chain tryclyceride (MCT), it's more easily absorbed by the body and converted into energy, not stored on the body as fat. This product has a nice flavor--I use it in cooking and it doesn't depart any heavy "coconut" flavor. Sometimes I just eat a tablespoon. The benefits are tremendous: microbial properties, helps thyroid, liver, pancreas, bones, skin, soothes the digestive tract. The list goes on.<br /><br />I bought one jar for the kitchen and one jar for my bathroom. This product is great to put on right after a bath or shower. Yes it's a bit greasy at first, but rub it in well and let it absorb, then wipe off the excess with a damp towel or wash cloth. Your skin will be satiny smooth.<br /><br />Bonus tip: I give a teaspoon to my dog every day. Studies show dogs' prefrontal brains benefit from this wonder fat.
