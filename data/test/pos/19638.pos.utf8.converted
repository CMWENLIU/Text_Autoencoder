My daughter has been living with Celiac's disease for 3 years now, and we have wasted more money on all the different kinds of flour's available.  Some were so so in taste, but the Multi Blend Gluten Free flour by Authentic Foods, stands far and above ALL the others out there!  It looks, smells, and tastes just like regular flour! It might cost a little more, but for all those of you out with a gluten intolerance of some kind, you won't disappointed in this purchase.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00112CND8">Multi Blend Gluten-Free Flour</a>
