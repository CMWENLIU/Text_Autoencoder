This kit includes a great selection of popular agents in molecular gastronomy that are sure to please the trendy chef looking to take his/her cooking or pastry skills to the next level. As the enclosed phamplet states, this kit is for the "art of molecular cuisine" and it is most definitely an art worthy of exploration. It's kind of an science kit that lets you create incredibly creative food for artistic presentation. Very cool.<br /><br />Each agent comes in a nice 50 gram size so you have plenty of opportunity to try different techniques before deciding which agents you want to buy in larger sizes. The agents allow you to experiment with transformation (transforming high-fat liquids into powders), spherification (such as making fruit caviar), thickening, emulsification (dispursing liquids into fats, mostly) and gelification (creation of both soft and hard gels). It also comes with a small kit for storing the samples.<br /><br />I am impressed with the quality of the agents in this kit as well as quantity provided for experimenting. I'm even more impressed with the incredibly quick shipping by Artistre. I'm looking forward to further experimentation with the included agents, as well as trying a few items not in the kit - like the carbonating and foaming/aerating agents.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this kit for anyone looking to try the art of molecular gastronomy. It's definitely worth it.
