Loving everything Italian, I started cooking with farro when I first saw it, but my local, reasonably-priced imported supply was undependable or way too expensive when they got in a different brand.  When I went on-line to find a good, well-priced source, this product was the answer to my search.  The price to buy two 3-lb bags of Roland Farro plus the shipping was very much in line with the reasonable price I had been paying locally.  The grain is absolutely delightful and of the highest quality.  I just made one of my favorite Italian recipes,a soup,using this brand of farro and it is delizioso!  I'm so happy to be able to count on getting this regularly, delivered speedily to my door and am looking forward to summer farro salads and exploring other recipes using this beautiful, healthful product.
