I'm new to the coconut oil hype, but so far I can say the excitement is totally founded.  I haven't tried it internally yet, but the external use has been amazing.  I have keratosis pilaris (chicken skin) on my arms (upper and lower), legs, and butt (yay, me!).  I've only ever found one cream by Lush that made any difference, and it was very expensive.  Enter, coconut oil! First, you will notice that it comes as a solid (unless the temperature is above 72 degrees, then it melts, which is ok, don't panic).  You take a bit and rub it between your hands and it melts instantly.  You're going to think first: oh yuck, I'm not putting this on my body! But please do: rub it anywhere and everywhere.  You'll notice how at firstit doesn't seem to be sinking in, but if you wait about ten minutes, it will do just that.<br /><br />I should also mention I have a sensitive skin on my face, which despite proper exfoliating, sheds skin often.  I get dry patches that, when at their worst, act like burns that open and are painful.  I know, pretty gross.  I'm usually cautious about trying new products on my face because it's so sensitive.  For years I've been using Eucerin, but it's not always enough.<br /><br />I through caution to the wind and slatered my face with the coconut oil.  It felt pretty gross at first, but within ten minutes it started to sink it.  I was nervous that I would wake up in the morning with oil-induced acne, but that didn't happen.  What did happens was that it had sunk in completely and my face was the smoothest and softest I'd ever seen.  Honestly, I couldn't stop touching my face!  Of course this meant my makeup went on better, and I looked...I don't know...I guess the word is well-rested.<br /><br />Another HUGE bonus is that while the dots on my arms still look like they're there, my keratosis pilaris is all but gone!  My arms, legs, (and yes, butt) are the softest and smoothest I've ever seen them.  I can't believe this worked! As you're working the oil into your skin, don't forget to rub it into your nails and eyelashes too.  I swear my eyelashes look longer andI know my nails are definitely stronger.<br /><br />Lastly, this product is CHEAP, you really can't go wrong with it.  I have two tubs of it, one for my body and the other for my diet (the thought of using one for both grossed me out). I'll let you know how that goes.<br /><br />Anyway, consider this a five-star, two thumbs way up review!
