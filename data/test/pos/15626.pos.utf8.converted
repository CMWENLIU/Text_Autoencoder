Marmite is an aquired taste.  It's a slightly salty yeasty spread you can use on toast or as a sandwich.  It's supposed to be good for you, but most people eat it just because they like how it tastes.<br /><br />Marmite isn't easy to find in the U.S, but you can get it in larger "health food" type chains like Sun Harvest Farms and Whole Foods Market where they charge about $5.00 for a 125g jar.  One would consider what is charged for shipping as well as product price when deciding whether or not ordering Marmite online is a value.
