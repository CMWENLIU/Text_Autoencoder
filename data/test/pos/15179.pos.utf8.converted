This tea works really great if you allow it to. By that I mean make sure you're also following a cleaner diet so that it can take effect.  I first drank this tea while following a regular diet and noticed my complexion brightening and clearing up.<br />I also tried this tea while on the master cleanse  1-2 bags per day) and I didn't recognize my own skin. It was very clear moist and supple like high school days. Much clearer complexion unnoticeable pores. Perfect.<br />I think clearing my diet and food intake really allowed the tea to do it's work. I also increased my water intake. I normally have dry skin but this tea made my skin look and feel much more moisturized without applying products. I lost the dry dehydrated dark circles around my eyes.<br />Hope to do it again !!!
