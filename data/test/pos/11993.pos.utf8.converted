This is good stuff. It is basically just the Matcha powder only. There is no sweetner in it so if you make a frappe you can add your own honey, agave or other sweetner. This tea has a nice flavorful delicate taste. It is great Hot or Iced. I put a tablespoon of powder, 1 cup skim milk, 1/4 c frozen raspberries with a couple of ice cubes in my magic bullet blender... pulse it a couple of times and have a nice antioxidant rich treat!
