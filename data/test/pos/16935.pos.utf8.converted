These are wonderful Amarena cherries- especially for the price.  The downside is that the quantity is for restaurants/patisseries.  I've found that you can store these in the freezer- but they won't freeze.  The sugar level must be something like 80 Brix, so I don't think they would go bad for a long time, anyway!
