First let me say, to counter the other review on this page saying that the mixture is mostly "corn and rice", that the grain mixture per the label on the bag is as follows:<br /><br />Organic corn, rice, wheat, rye, millet, oats and barley<br /><br />Yes, you can taste the corn but you can also taste the wheat over tones along with the other grains.  This is not a bland mush with no flavor.  If a person has never cooked whole wheat grains or cooked cracked wheat they might not recognize the flavorful taste and smell of wheat plus the other grains.  If you are still unsure about buying then check to see if you can buy a smaller bag of this combination before springing for a 25 pound bag - a lot of cereal grain to wind up unhappy with.<br /><br />Great change of pace from hot oatmeal and cream of wheat.  A couple of recommendations:  Use a teflon coated sauce pan, keep fire as low as you can get it and stir frequently.  If you use a regular pan, cover and walk away fixing other things for breakfast you're libel to come back to a stuck mess in the bottom of your pan. Just don't forget or ignore. The flavor is very much like a "punched up" Cream of Wheat.  A hearty breakfast with a variety of flavors.  This grain is also ideal for sprinkling over bread dough before popping into the oven - gives a great crust to peasant style breads.  I make a nice "no knead" bread dough that is oily and somewhat wet when turned out of the dough pan and the grains stick nicely.  This bread is plopped into an already heating (500-515 degree oven) cast iron casserole, lid replaced and baked 30 minutes with lid on and 10 minutes w/o lid to brown.  Terrific bread - see video for this recipe on Mark Bittman's site at the New York Times for "No Knead Bread."  Great cereal and will buy again!
