Be careful!  After trying this wonderful blend of spices, with great complexity of flavor, that they say is made with 35 ingredients, I found ras el hanout in my local grocery store.  When I tried it alongside this one, there was no comparison.  Then I checked the label--the local one had only 8 ingredients!  It went into the trash and another order was placed to Zamouri.<br /><br />Ras el hanout can be used in a number of Moroccan dishes that are fabulous, although they tend to be complex to prepare--although if you're in the mood they are worth the effort.  But I also use it in tomato soup to give an amazing richness of flavor to it, transforming an everyday dish to a company dish.  Today I'm braising short ribs, and when I've cooked down the braising liquid I'll add ras el hanout to provide a symphony of flavor to it.  I haven't tried it with tomatoes and cheese on an omelet, but it's the sort of thing that's likely to be fabulous.  With a little experimentation, you'll find your own favorite uses for it.
