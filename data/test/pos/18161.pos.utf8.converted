This is a very good dragonwell tea. One company, Company A, used to sell their dragonwell for $32 per pound. Now, they have added $20 to that price with no explanation, bringing it to $52 lb. I have purchased more than 20 pounds of it over the years. Another company, Company S, also offers a dragonwell that is close to the same price, though, in my opinion, not as good as Company A's offering. The Numi dragonwell is a great price and made me extremely skeptical. My skepticism was unfounded. This is a superior tea. The leaf is full and the liquor is light, smooth, and slightly sweet and smoky. The only difference I recognize is that Numi does not pack this in a hermetically sealed bag. This means that you should pack it on your own when it arrives. I typically vacuum seal about eight ounces immediately. Aside from that, this is a great introduction to green tea. It is not a typically cheap green tea. Many people are turned off to green because they only tried the low-quality greens. Try this and you will see green in a different way. The price of this allows you to enjoy it often for pleasure and health!
