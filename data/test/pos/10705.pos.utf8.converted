My family and I have enjoyed Nutella the past few years. Amazon has a good price, about $2.81 a jar. It ranges here in Kansas around $3-4 a jar. It's basically ground up hazelnuts (also known as filberts), mixed with a chocolate frosting type deal... spreads on toast, very sweet. We also like natural peanut butter (meaning without hydrogenated oils etc. just peanut, salt) and we typically swirl on two thin layers. My son LOVES this in his school lunches or for breakfast ("brekky") on toast.<br /><br />Some lady asked about this at the grocery store, wondering what it tasted like, as she'd heard it was an alternative to peanut butter for those who were allergic to peanut butter. The jar I currently have does not give any of the warning disclaimers about "...produced in factory that has exposure to peanuts or whatever other allergic product... " thing (sorry I don't remember how they usually read but I am not seeing it here on this one, so presumably it's okay. For questions go to www.NutellaUSA.com or 1-800-NUTELLA ).<br /><br />Tt is sometimes hard to find at our various grocery stores - usually clear up at the top shelf almost out of my reach - especially at places like Wal-mart supercenters or the Target Superstores (I forget what they call them), and it tends to be more expensive at places like World Market.<br /><br />This one also says it was made in USA by Ferrero USA, Inc.<br /><br />Seems like 8 or 9 years ago when we first started seeing it on the shelves and buying it, it was actually imported from Italy. But apparently not now. But would be interesting to see the nutritional breakdown for the product still made in Italy. Typically I've noticed other products (like Malted Milk products etc.) produced for the Asian or European markets use less sugars than the one produced for us (unfortunately mostly overweight) Americans. So would be interesting to see what has happnened to Nutella.<br /><br />Otherwise... hey... it's pretty good!!
