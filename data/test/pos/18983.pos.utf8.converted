I got this particular oil to combat the damage from a H Pylori stomach infection, as well as get some good fats in me. First of all - this is an incredibly fresh GREAT TASTING product. I can eat spoonfuls of it right out of the jar. (with some chocolate ovaltine - it taste just like 'Almond Joy').  The wide mouth of the jar makes it easy to get to the product without melting it first.  The jar is made of plastic, but you can easily transfer the product to a glass mason jar - if you  want to.
