This is hands down the BEST pure grape juice on the market. Not only is it organic but it is FRESH SQUEEZED. Imagine how many grapes go into making this 32 ounce bottle, and keep in mind how expensive organic grapes are; that should make it clear that the price is actually a bargain! I don't work for the company and have no interest in promoting this product except to do whatever I can to ensure that this company keeps making it. Please support Lakewood. They are one of the few companies around with integrity.
