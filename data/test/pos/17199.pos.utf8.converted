This applewood smoked bacon is the best I have ever had, and I have tried a lot.  This is a thick, meaty bacon with an awesome smoked flavor.  At the same time, it is naturally low in sodium so you don't have that funny aftertaste in your mouth after eating the bacon.  It is truly the best bacon you will ever eat and is worth every penny.
