We recently moved from Seattle - the coffee capital of the world - to Winthrop.  We did not anticipate being able to buy a locally roasted coffee of the excellent quality of Backcountry Cowboy Mud or any of Backcountry's other roasts.  Mud is a full-bodied, rich and never bitter French roast.  It is the best French roast coffee that I have had.
