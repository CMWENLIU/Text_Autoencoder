I had never had the organic version of Bob's Red Mill Flaxseed Meal, but my husband ordered it online because it was a great price.  When I got it, I tried it and loved it.  It is even better than the non-organic version.  Everything I've tried with it has come out delicious.  And it's got a lot of Omega 3, more than my fish oil.  I tried the muffin recipe in the back and it's sooo good.  Even my daughter, who is very picky, loved it.  Now my husband and my daughter want me to make the muffins as soon as we're getting close to running out.<br /><br />I will definitely order this product again!
