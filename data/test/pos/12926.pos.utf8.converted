I was looking for a way to avoid the HFCS in soda without giving it up entirely.  Instead of using the home brew method, I make soda using cans of seltzer.  For regular root beer I use 3 TBS of sugar.  For diet I use 1 tsp of Stevita Stevia. I mention the brand only because different stevias vary in sweetness.  I mix a small amount of hot water with the sweetener in a glass until it is dissolved, then add 1/4 tsp of McCormick Root Beer Concentrate.  To that I add a 12 oz can of seltzer and ice.  Tastes great and only takes a few minutes to mix it up. Fast and convenient!  Another favorite of mine is to use 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract instead of the Root Beer Concentrate to make cream soda.
