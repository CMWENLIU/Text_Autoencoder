We were the grind your own beans, french press coffee people.  Till I decided to try this from a local Co-op.  I'm not sure why since I wouldn't even think about buy pre-ground coffee such as Folgers, let alone drink instant coffee.  But boy am I ever glad I tried this product.  It's super easy, quick, tastes amazing, rich and bold without the acidic after taste.  Okay it's instant coffee, so keep that in mind but if you looking for a quick coffee fix, you won't be disappointed.
