I've always gone back and forth between a good strong black tea and a very subtle green tea.  Tetley's falls firmly in the black tea area.  As a previous reviewer mentioned, these are little tea nuggets, the description from Amazon initially made me think these were going to be the tiny leaves I expected from a "loose leaf" tea, be forewarned, these won't unfurl into tea leaves in the pot or the bottom of your cup, they'll remain little nuggets, which doesn't detract from the tea, I assure you.<br /><br />This is a great, basic black tea.  At this price it is great, and for the amount you get, you can easily make this an everyday tea, not something you save for "occasions" whether special or routine.  I like it because it is just that, simple and straightforward.  I don't need to think about whether a book is good enough to warrant me brewing up a cup to enjoy with it, I'll make this tea anytime I want a decent cup of tea.<br /><br />I'm not an expert of tea by far, but I do think this one brews a bit strong for the amount.  The 3-5 minute steeping time is great for me, but I enjoy strong, dark coffee and tea, and if you're expecting the color of the cup on the box, aim a little lower in your measuring.<br /><br />On a side note, consider buying a smaller container to get your daily portion and keeping the Tetley box sealed up, it is really a huge amount of tea, a bit unwieldy to get a couple spoons from it daily and the less tea is exposed to air, the better.
