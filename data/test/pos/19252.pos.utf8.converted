Got this for my daughter who was using an old fashioned blender to make her baby's food which was a messy ordeal. I gave her this newfangled thing and she LOVES it! It is small and tidy and easy to operate and has a powerful little motor which steams food quickly with just a little water and then promptly turns the steamed food into perfectly pureed baby food.<br />Easy to clean too.<br />Probably not the machine for you if you like to whip up and freeze large batches at a time.
