I had to write a review because to my amazement someone actually gave this tea a 1 star review. I love this blend. It's one of my favorite herbal blends ever. And yes, it has lavender in it, which is often used in soap. Don't let that dissuade you -- there are tons of delicious teas with lavender in them. This is perfect, sweet, minty, delicious. It is really incredible. I really am not an herbal tea drinker and I just think this is the absolute best.
