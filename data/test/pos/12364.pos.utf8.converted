The Atkins Bake Mix is the best.  By using your imagination you can use the batter to make different things. By thinning the batter and cooking two pancakes the size of bread is a great way to make your favorite sandwich. Great for snacks by taking leftover pancakes, cut them like chips, deep fry, drain and sprinkle with ranch dressing mix. Use the batter to make hot dogs on a stick. The best thing is that you can still loose weight and not feel like you are depriving yourself.
