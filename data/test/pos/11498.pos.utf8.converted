My son is allergic to many foods, including life threatening allergies to peanuts, tree nuts and sesame.  Which eliminates many snacks that are run on the same line as nuts and seeds.  This line is completely allergen free.  The taste is great; they are very crispy and melt in your mouth.  And the single serve packaging makes it great to have a fun snack treat that is safe and healthy for him.  So far the banana/strawberry, pear and apple are all a hit!  These are cheaper than I can find in the store, and the free shipping option is a bonus.
