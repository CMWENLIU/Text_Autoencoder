This product is from Nutiva. Like other products from this company, it is of high quality. The seeds taste fresh. You have to put them in refrigerator after opening since they are moist and have oil contents. For unopened pouches, I suggest you put them in freezer to keep them fresh. The package is sturdy and seals the seeds very well and is re-sealable. The price on this listing is especially good (pack of 3 13-ounce pouches). You can compare the price per ounce with other listings. With the free shipping, it is the best price anywhere.
