These bars are fantastic tasting.  They do have 7g sugar per bar (for a 36g bar that's nearly 20% sugar).  For people with a sweet tooth like me, these are a great alternative to other chocolate, candy, and less healthy snack bars.  Sure, there are plenty of things out there that are better for you, but I've yet to find any that taste like this.<br /><br />These bars are great, but the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ONVOC0">Kellogg's FiberPlus Bars, Dark Chocolate Almond, 5 Bars, 6.3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> are even better!<br /><br />Here is the full nutritional information per 1.2oz bar:<br />120 Calories (40 fat calories), 4g Total Fat (2g saturated fat), 0mg Cholesterol, 55mg Sodium, 26g Total Carbohydrates (9g dietary fiber, 7g sugars), 2g Protein.<br />10% Calcium, 4% Iron, 20% Vitamin E, 20% Zinc.
