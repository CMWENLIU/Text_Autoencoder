For those on a low glycemic or low carb diet, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better non-sucralose or non-maltitol syrup.  No, it's not going to fool you into thinking you're eating Log Cabin or Aunt Jemima.  But if you're looking at this review, I'll bet you already gave up those like I did, and would be happy to find a good substitute that allows you to enjoy normal breakfasts with your family again.<br /><br />The taste is fine with normal pancakes and waffles, I haven't tried it with protein or special recipe pancakes.<br /><br />Yes, the syrup is more liquid than most syrups, but this is how I deal with it . . . serve it on the side in a condiment cup rather than pouring it directly over the pancakes or waffles.  I dip each bite into the cup with my fork.  Served this way, the syrup is not soaked up and 1 tablespoon of syrup lasts me a whole waffle or 2 medium size pancakes.  That makes the syrup more economical, too, because a bottle goes farther.
