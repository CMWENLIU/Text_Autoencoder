We lived four years in Japan and love Japanese food.  Was so happy to find this on Amazon as it's the only mayo we use.  It makes yummy potato salad.  We boil potatoes in a large pot, drain water, pour on some Japanese rice wine vinegar, add some finely sliced onion, cover and let this sit for a while.  When it's cooled a bit, we add chopped hard boiled eggs, some salt and pepper, a bit of Frenches mustard, and Kewpie mayo.  We prefer the potatoes in our potato salad to be more creamy than chunky, so tend to cook the potatoes a bit longer and stir everything together adding more mayo til it's the consistency we like.  This way is similar to what one buys in Japan.  Kewpie mayo also makes great deviled eggs!
