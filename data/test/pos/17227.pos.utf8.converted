I have been using orange oil for several years now.  A small amount mixed in a recipe gives the after-taste of orange, much the same as grated orange peel.  Too much will leave a bitter after-taste, but about a scant cap full will add great flavor.  The orange oil keeps indefinitely in the refrigerator.  I've used it with fish, sweet potatoes, cakes and pies, orange flavored beef.  The sky's the limit
