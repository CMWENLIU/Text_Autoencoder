Regular salt is (at best) very plain.  I think of it like distilled water.  If it has nothing else in it, it just tastes kind of "flat". That is why allot of filtered water in bottles have minerals added back in, so it has some flavor and "tastes right."<br /><br />That is part of why sea salts and finishing salts tend to taste so much better on the pallet.  They have trace minerals that are appealing to the tongue.  They also lack the iodide that most table salt has added which (to me) gives it an off-taste.<br /><br />The Himalayan pink salt has been my favorite for a while, and the salt provided by "The spice lab" or "Old Himalayan Salt Co." via this listing is a particularly good example of this salt.  A great blend with a really good flavor profile.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this product, and this seller.  It's particularly good on milder items like fresh cut avocado with a little lime or fresh tomatoes.
