I love this food for my kitties!  Mr poof devours this stuff as if it were his last meal.  He loves a bunch of the flavors (not all of them, what cat eats all of anything).  I even called the company last week to inquire about some sodium levels (Mr poof needs to watch his intake, ty) and I got the founder, then his wife - they love cats and dogs (and their crying baby) so much.  It was great to see that there are real people behind this food that my cat thinks is the bee's knees.
