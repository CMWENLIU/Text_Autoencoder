First, I like it.  I read the reviews and it seems me that some people didn't know what they were ordering.  It's not a soup based noodle food, but a noodle mixed with sauce dish.  Also, vegetarians can use only black paste which is simply made from beans and not the dried spice which contains some meat.  I hope this helps!  I sprinkle some pepper powder, and it boosts the flavor.  :)
