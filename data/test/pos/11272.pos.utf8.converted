I have multiple food allergies, which makes a grab-and-go breakfast...well...not possible. I wanted a meal replacement shake because I tend not to eat during the day (way too complicated) and not eating actually helps me gain weight. I also have some other health issues--like Hashimoto's--directly related to my allergies. Food is an issue for me, and so is energy and feeling well.<br /><br />I'm not vegan, but I prefer vegan foods for their cleanliness. I can't have soy, but many vegan products are soy-free anyway. I also like whole, organic, Non-GMO foods, and while I prefer Raw, I don't mind non-raw foods, either.<br /><br />I tried several vegan, gluten-free, soy-free, dairy-free shake mixes: Garden of Life, Vega, Inca Meal, RAW, etc. This is, by far, the best tasting, best "feeling" shake I've tried.<br /><br />I've tried all the flavors--Chocolate is my fave, then Pomegranate (sp?) Mango and Vanilla Chai, in that order. I mix mine is a shaker cup with a little mixing ball. I use Vanilla almond milk and a little agave syrup (I hate Stevia, it tastes like saccharine to me) and sometimes I throw a little extra hemp protein in, chia seeds, and flaxseed oil. I haven't bothered with a blender yet. One day, I'll put it into a blender with some fruit.<br /><br />Let's be real: this is a whole food shake with fruits, veggies, grasses, and hemp protein. This is not a mass-market, full-of-stuff-I-can't-pronounce homogenized drink. This is real food, synthesized down to a mixable level. Dunkin Donuts it's not. So?<br /><br />Truthfully, the pure, clean, feel-good energy I get from this, plus the cleansing, tonifying, and gut-health benefits are worth chugging down a slightly earthy drink every morning. Mixed with vanilla almond milk & a little agave, I actually savor the flavor--not too sweet (sweet in the morning makes me gag) chocolatey and, well, nutritious-y.<br /><br />Try a sample packet (you can get them at your local HFS, usually) and see which flavor suits you. I don't ever like this mixed in water--its just too thin. I DO use it on oatmeal, or stirred into yogurt. This is an awesome product. I just saved $12 over what I pay at WF, plus Amazon will deliver it to me every 15 days so I'll never run out...heaven!
