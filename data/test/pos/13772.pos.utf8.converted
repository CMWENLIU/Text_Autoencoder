I agree with the other reviewers who noted that there was some misinformation about this being compressed yeast by someone who hadn't opened the bag yet. (grin)  Just like some coffee bags have all the air sucked out which makes the bags feel brick hard until you open them at which time the grains flow smoothly...this is no different. It's done that way to make this yeast MORE fresh than those bagged with air still trapped inside which, of course, breaks down the yeast. This packaging is a good thing.<br /><br />I have a friend with a bread machine who noticed that I am into handmade homemade bread now...I'm whipping through bread recipes from two cookbooks a couple times a week and enjoying the freshness of homemade bread.  Because one of the authors of my bread cookbook won the highest award given for his breads and he wrote an entire foreward on using instant yeast and why you should and I was discussing this...she recommended this particular brand for both it's results, value, and taste from her own bread.<br /><br />I am an apt person to be able to compare because I've been using Fleishman's for a good while now and maybe it's my imagination, but I swear the LaSaffre gives me far better results. Because of freshness? Maybe. But it does.<br /><br />I have also found it at restaurant supply stores and I look at that as a good thing if bakeries buy it in bulk...<br /><br />Negatives: None as far as quality. Just know this is quite a large bag and you don't want air to break down your yeast so you either need to go through it quickly or store it in the freezer to maintain freshness if you aren't whipping out bread as fast as I am.  :-)<br /><br />Conclusion: Seems to work better, last longer, and is bagged for freshness while being cheaper. Worth it.
