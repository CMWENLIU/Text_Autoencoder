This was my first order from Hirt's Gardens...I'm a believer!!<br />I'll be back.<br />You see folks, "what you see IS what you get" in the case of this beautiful bonsai. It is exactly as pictured; arrived safely packaged, no damage, and also a very healthy, robust bonsai. I'm having fun w/this.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EBJSKC">Japanese Juniper Bonsai Starter Tree - 4" pot</a><br /><br />Thanks Hirts!!
