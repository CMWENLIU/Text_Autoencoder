I've been using this egg replacer for over a decade. First as a vegan and now just because I have a few friends allergic to eggs and it is easy to keep on hand. I prefer to use it in muffin, pancake and cake recipes that call for egg. I've used it both as instructed (combine with water first) and I've just sifted it with my dry ingredients and obtained excellent results. If you have a recipe for vegan cupcakes for example that tend to crumble, just add 1.5 teaspoons to the dry ingredients in your recipe and this just might fix the problem! Recently I found out that I have Celiacs and so I've also been using the egg replacer in gluten free recipes, also with excellent results!
