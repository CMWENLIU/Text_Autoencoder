I purchase this all the time although it is not organic. Every week I take what I need and keep the rest in the freezer, double bagged in zip-locks since nuts go rancid due to the oil content. Almonds are high in vitamin E which is great for my skin. I place twenty almonds in a cup of water every night to consume it in the morning since it becomes softer and tastier without damaging my teeth. This is one nut that I take with me in prescription containers with some water when I go mountain biking and surfing since that is when I need healthy calories and vitamin E, exposed to the sun without sunscreen so I can get my vitamin D from the sun. Bravo.
