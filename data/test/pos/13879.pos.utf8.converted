I read the reviews, considered the source and complaints, then ordered. Was I happy, you bet. Added 1/2 cup dried milk to 2 cups water in the blender, mixed, added the rest of the water and was done. Strained it to be sure all was mixed, no lumps. Taste was the same as I remembered of fresh skimmed milk from the dairy case(after drinking UHT processed milk). Cheaper, better taste, and a lot more convenient than buying UHT. Most people don't realize that powdered milk and instant powdered milk are two different products, one being a low temperature process and the other a high temperature process, and the instant is like over-cooked, changed taste, but easy to mix.<br />Thats the trouble with UHT (ultra high temp) milk. Just don't taste like fresh milk.
