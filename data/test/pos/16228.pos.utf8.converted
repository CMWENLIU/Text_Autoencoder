Dave's Gourmet is known for its punchy hot sauces, but its pasta sauces are underrated... especially this one. Made in San Francisco from butternut squash harvested in Oregon's Willamette Valley, it's at once savory and sweet. It has such a filling flavor that even Parmesan cheese is beside the point. It's a great topping for gnocchi,pasta,etc. It's a wonderfully autumnal sauce. Bon appetit!
