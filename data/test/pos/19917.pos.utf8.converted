This was a great value and a high quality almond flour.  Fine texture, perfect for baking these tremendous muffins I make from the Paleo Comfort Foods cookbook (also available on Amazon).  I love Bob's Red Mill almond meal flour, but needed something with a lighter texture.  Will experiment with other recipes, but you can't really go wrong with this fine flour.
