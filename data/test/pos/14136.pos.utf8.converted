We have enjoyed this grain in very limited quantities for years finding it only in one Italian specialty store where it is quite expensive.  This larger quantity is more reasonably priced and it stores well in a glass jar.  I prepare it occasionally using the recipe on the back of the original bag but increasing the ground meat to one pound to serve more people.  Farro has a wonderful flavor prepared this way or just simmered in chicken broth.  It is good served along side a meat or grilled Italian sausages or as an accompaniment to grilled veggies for a vegetarian meal.
