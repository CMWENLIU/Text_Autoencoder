I was in Istanbul last year and discovered the wonders of smooth, full-bodied Turkish coffee.  In my haste, I brought only one package back that I found at the Spice Market.  Once we tasted the coffee; we loved it.  Better than anything in the US.  As you can expect, we finished the small package very quickly so I decided to research the product and found it on the Internet.  It's the exact coffee from Istanbul!  Bought 3 canisters and have been so enjoying it.  The benefits -- I am allergic to caffein but have no problems with this coffee (though it is caffinated).  I have served it to many people including others who stay away from caffein and they have all enjoyed it as well.<br />This coffee is so smooth and flavorful and I am very picky about coffee especially when it's bitter (ugh).  It's a great product and I am glad there is a US importer for it.
