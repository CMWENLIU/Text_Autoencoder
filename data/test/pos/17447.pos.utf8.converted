Not sure about the other review below. Oh well. Each cat is different but I had to switch my 3 and half year old cats dry food because he started to lose significant weight. He looked super boney. And he was doing unusual sleep habits. He typically wakes me up in the morning. For a month he was sleeping when I would rise but then after much research I realized he was dehydrated and I had to move him to wet food or raw food. And since I don't have time to do the raw food (which is timely and costly upfront) I opted to try this stuff out. I am an organic person myself so (duh) it didn't occur to me that the more processed cat food is, obviously the more nutrients my cat will lack.<br /><br />I gave him the salmon flavor, followed the standard directions and he took an instant loving to it. He put on a pound within two days. And he became his old frisky self, pawing my head in the morning to wake me up.<br /><br />The reviews on petco's site are well accurate if you need more reviews. My cat's fur looks good but the convincer was him zipping around like he was a kitten again. The price I pay for the food is relative to how important you think your cat's health is.<br /><br />(Also I forgot to mention that I was feeding my cat a brand that was organic dry food. I guess his body just didn't want it anymore and his becoming thin was obvious that he wasn't getting the nutrition he needed)<br /><br />When I do the math it's only a couple dollars more a month and my cat gets more nutrients than if I kept the dry food and have to add supplements (which is an alternative).<br /><br />This stuff is great! My cat is happy and I'm happy! Just do me a favor and try it out for a week. I hope you will be a satisfied customer like me and my cat.<br /><br />Hope this review helped.
