At first I was a bit surprised that it came in large chunks and wasn't quite sure how to apply it.  Don't try to break it down.  Just grab a chunk and start rubbing into your skin. That is the best way to apply this product.  It is great in the summer because it is a bit thinner in application and absorbs quicker into the skin then the shea butter.  This is really good stuff!  Love it!  The smell of cocoa is great too!  I will never buy over the counter skin lotions again.
