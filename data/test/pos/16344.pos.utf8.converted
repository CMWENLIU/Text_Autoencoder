Its the real thing. If you can't grow a crop with this product, seek medical help...Really though, its too simple and straight forward to screw up. I am on my second crop of peppers and it looks like the first crop wasn't a fluke. The only drawback is the fact that the veggie leafs get too tall so fast, even with the recommended pruning, that the light hood needs to be removed and you have to allow mother nature light to finish it off. I understand Aero has a new unit that is a bit larger and addresses this problem. Growing veggies this way is a reward you wouldnt believe. The peppers I have are so flipin' hot that your skin burns if you dont wash your hands after cutting them up. Not kidding. The unit takes up only a minimal amount of room and tending. Indicator lights go off when its time to add water and nutrients. True Gardening for Dummies. There have been other counter-top gardening kits offered in the past but most are clunky and messy to use, producing sickly looking plants. Not this one. Give it a try. Its kind of fun and you'll enjoy the results.
