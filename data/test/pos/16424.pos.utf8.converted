These anchovies are something else. The fillets are fleshy, not dried up in salt like most of the anchovies I have eaten before. The consistency of the meat is preserved very well. While most anchovies are salty with the characteristic, wonderful ... stink, these anchovies are also flavorful in addition to being only stinky. I am not sure how this is done - perhaps by shortening the time the fish is cured in salt?<br />The price is unjustifiably high though - one can get 2 lbs of Moroccan anchovies for the same price.<br />Nevertheless, these are (from far) the best anchovies I tried.
