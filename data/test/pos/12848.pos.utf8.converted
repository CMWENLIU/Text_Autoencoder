These jelly beans are great...the taste is better than most stuff on the market and they have electrolytes in them as well as carbs.  Same carb as a GU but i like the fact that you eat them as you go along. Highly recommended..haven't tried any other flavors but i bet they are all GREAT.  PS. check out Cliff Shot Blocks for a good steady carb delevery too.
