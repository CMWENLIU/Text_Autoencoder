I discovered this at Whole Foods, while looking for a better-tasting natural sweetener than stevia.  After using this for one day, I threw out my box of bitter stevia.  It's delicious!  I've had it in my dark chocolate cocoa, and in tea.  I haven't baked with it yet, but I intend to.  $10 for 12 ounces seems expensive, but I've been using less than half a teaspoon to sweeten my drinks.  Very happy to have found this raw, organic, low GI, gluten-free, vegan product!
