So far So good, I am in the clearing process with this kit. Instructions are good and the kit was easy to make. Did seem to take a while in the De-gassing Process, I plan to give it extra time in the carboy, before bottling.<br /><br />update: This kit turned out better than I had thought it would, very drinkable, I made half the batch as a dry Merlot by the directions and backsweetened half with wine conditioner to taste to make a semi-sweet red. I will definately purchase  the Vino Italiano kits again.
