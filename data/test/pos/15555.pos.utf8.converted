For those who cannot go to sleep without a glass of chocolate milk before going to bed(chocolate milk was my drug of choice), this is the answer!<br />Years of drinking chocolate milk before going to bed will do nothing but increase your cholesterol and make you obese.<br />Carob has no sugar. Mix several teaspoons in a glass of Vanilla Soymilk, then add chocolate flavor Stevia sweetener.  You will have a chocolate drink which tastes even better than the real thing, with no sugar, and no cholesterol! Try it!
