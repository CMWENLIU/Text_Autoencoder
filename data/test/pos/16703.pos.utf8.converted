As a dietitian, I am always looking for healthy snacks to recommend to my clients. These definitely fit the bill. Not only are they low in sodium, but they also contain some whole wheat and have no unpronounceable ingredients or additives. The best part...they taste delicious! I've let my family and friends try them when I buy bags, and everyone that's tried them really loves them.
