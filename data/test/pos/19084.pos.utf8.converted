Bought this on a whim, thought to use in desserts however, added a spoonful to a Coke in a glass with ice, stirred & remembered what a real cherry coke tasted like. Have used most of it in Coke's, Dr. Pepper & citrus sodas. Makes lemonade special. Add to brownies or anything chocolate for a treat. Add to plain cheesecake with chocolate crust & top with cherry pie filling. Thought the price was high, but it goes a long way.
