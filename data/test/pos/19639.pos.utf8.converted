I have spent an unbelievable amount of time and money experimenting with gluten free flours and mixes...this flour is by far the best!  I use it cup for cup replacement for chocolate chip cookies, pancakes, banana bread, etc.  Thank you for making my gluten free child's life better! I just wish Amazon would start offering it with the free super saver option, or in bulk.
