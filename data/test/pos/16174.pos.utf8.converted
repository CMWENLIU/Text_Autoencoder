Way better than Vitacoco, and Zico. Has a distinctly different flavor from Amy and Brian's. I would say I prefer Nirvana a bit more because it has a richer, full body flavor and tastes more like a coconut with a natural sweet taste. And the price point is better. After an online coupon and subscribe n save, I paid $18/12 cans.<br />It's so good for you and tastes good too.
