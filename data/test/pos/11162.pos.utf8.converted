I've been buying this product for at least 10 years, and if they haven't changed it, it's simply fantastic. I add shrimps and baby corns and broccoli (sometimes a little cooked rice) and it's a super fast cold (or hot) weather meal in minutes.  If you like Thai food, don't hesitate to try it.<br /><br />When I find it, I always buy lots. I've just used my last packet since we moved to Canada, and I'm so glad to find it at Amazon.
