I have to admit I haven't actually seen or tasted this fruit. I bought a "3-month club" for my daughter who is in graduate school on the other side of the country. She's on a limited budget and rarely has enough money (or time to shop) for fresh fruits and vegetables. While I would assume this is pricier than buying fruit at the grocery store, she has loved getting this special treat once a month and has said the fruit is delicious. She has asked us to continue sending this to her for another 3 months!
