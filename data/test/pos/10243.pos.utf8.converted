I found this product in a grocery store approximately 3 years ago.  It is the best mix that I have found and everyone that trys my margarita says it is the best one they have ever tasted and wants the 'recipe'. I like the fact that even though it is a powder mix, it is all-natural. I travel to the beach quite a bit and have found that is easy to cart in a cooler (no glass) and just pour over ice.  It is also good blended with strawberries or mango puree.  When I make mine, I follow the instructions including using Triple Sec but I usually mix 2 or 3 tequilas (white and gold)and add a little Gran Marnier or Cuantro.  It is great to have it mixed up, ready to go in the refrigerator.  You can also freeze it in the bag and 'squeeze' out for a fast slushy drink.
