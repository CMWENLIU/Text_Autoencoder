If you've never tasted quinoa, you might want to go get a bag of actual quinoa before you venture into quinoa flour--it smells like bitter squash, and tastes like filberts.<br /><br />However, if you know what kind of flour you are getting, this stuff is great.  I made quinoa arepas with it this morning, and I'm here to tell you this is actually gluten-free.<br /><br />Why that is such a big deal:  in 2007, Bob's Red Mill got a much bigger facility;  before that, they had only a wall separating the gluten-free from the gluten side, and a lot of flour in the air.  (There can be 10 ppm gluten in the air in a tortilla factory that makes wheat tortillas, for example.)<br /><br />A lot of celiacs used to complain about Bob.  No more.  Apparently, if their flour was made in the newer, post-2006 facility, it's a lot more gluten-free.<br /><br />Good stuff guys.  Congratulations.
