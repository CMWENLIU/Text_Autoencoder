I like this as much as my favorite Haribo. Just like the later, Black Forest started from Germany and got it here in the US when Haribo cannot meet the demand when gummy bears became such a big hit. It is not as rubbery and more fruity in flavor. It is not sticking to your teeth. Not too sweet neither. If you like Haribo, you should try this brand too as individual tastes is very subjective.
