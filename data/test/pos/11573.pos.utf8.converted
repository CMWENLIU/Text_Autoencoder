Lazy Kettle Liquid Smoke calls itself "the standard in All Natural Liquid Smokes." I wouldn't dispute that.<br /><br />Being on a restricted diet and unable to eat commercial barbecue sauces, I wanted to make my own and still have it have some "smoke" flavor. I was looking for a liquid smoke that's not loaded with artificial junk and chemicals. I found it.<br /><br />I use Lazy Kettle Liquid Smoke not only in my own barbecue sauce but in stews, on hamburgers and steaks cooked indoors, and I've tried it in some Mexican dishes and marinades (as suggested). It imparts the flavor I was looking for, without the junk.<br /><br />Like with all such concentrated flavorings, you do need to be careful not to overdue it. (If four drops are very good, 10 drops are not necessarily better!) Because you use a small amount at a time, one bottle lasts a long time, thus it's quite cost-effective.<br /><br />If I have any real criticism it might be a wish for some kind of bottle -- possibly even with a dropper -- that allows for controlling exactly how many drops you use at a time. The current bottle isn't bad, but -- like with hot sauce bottles -- sometimes you get a few more drops than you intended.
