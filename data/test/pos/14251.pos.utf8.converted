I study herbal medicine in my spare time.  I'm no herbal doctor, but I can recognize a good product when I see one.  The herbs in this product without getting into specifics are good for 1. Lowering Blood Pressure 2. Warding Off Infections Such as Colds, Flus, Etc... 3. Settling An Upset Stomach.<br /><br />There are doubtless more applications, but these would be the top among usefulness.  Be careful not to eat too many in one sitting, they can give you one of the other effects 4. Clearing The Bowels.  If you moderate and eat a few a day, you have earned yourself some of the best and cheapest herbal medicine out there, not to mention one of the TASTIEST!!! Yum Yum.<br /><br />Anyway, as an eastern medicine practitioner would say, most people are led by their tongues not their brains.  Do not feel guilty buying this treat, it's good for your tongue and your body.<br /><br />&lt;EDIT: I brought these to a meeting to give to a sick friend, he loves them. At these meetings, we have a couple Dutch men, Licorice is popular with the Dutch. My Dutch friend was chasing around my sick friend asking for licorice, he loved it. That speaks volumes for a product.>
