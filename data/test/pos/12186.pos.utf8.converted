Got this in fine and course ground. Best price out there! This is the ONLY salt any of us should use. It's natural and contains over 80 trace minerals. Don't ever but iodized table salt again, that's bad stuff! And Himalayan salt is even better for you than sea salts. Do some research on Himlayan salt and you will be surprised at it's benefits. It's great for cooking as well. When you see recipes calling for pink salt...this is it!
