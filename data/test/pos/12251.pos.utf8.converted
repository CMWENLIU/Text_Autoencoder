This product is like what is sold under other brand names as coconut butter or coconut manna. As mentioned by others, it comes in a plastic packet inside of the little box. If your kitchen is 76 degrees or warmer, then it will be soft. If your kitchen is cooler, it will be more firm. If you place this product in the refrigerator, it becomes very hard. That is because the coconut oil that is in it becomes solid at lower room temperatures.<br /><br />What is it good for? Personally, I could use this almost daily! You can use it in any way that you might use almond butter or peanut better (just remember it is unsalted). If you are adding it to a smoothy, you may want to add it with some ingredients that are not chilled and get it mixed in before adding frozen fruit or refrigerated items. If it is added to a very cold smoothy then it will likely not mix in. Instead it will be in little chips or chunks. These chips do melt in your mouth, so it is not a bad way to do it, just different than what you might have had before.<br /><br />My favorite way to use it is in cooking. It is a wonderful way to thicken a sauce or stew. Add a couple of tablespoons to the simmering broth and let it continue to simmer. After a minute or two you will see how it has thickened. Others here have said they used this for creamy curry dishes. I also make a cheesy sauce by adding cheddar cheese after the sauce has started to thicken. This is really wonderful with beef or chicken. I find it adds to the depth of flavor.<br /><br />As for how to handle and store this product: In the original packaging it is shelf stable. It is a good idea to soften the packet before opening. Depending on the temperature it has been stored at, the coconut oil may have separated from the rest of the product. Simply place the sealed packet in a bowl of warm tap water for a few minutes then kneed it with your fingers to mix it all together. Once the product is opened, it is still shelf stable. That is because the coconut oil in it is not prone to going rancid. I usually squeeze the product out of the plastic packet into a glass jar with a tight fitting lid and keep it in the cupboard. I have never had this go bad, even if it got lost in the cupboard and I found it months later. It has always stayed fresh.<br /><br />As for the heath benefits of coconut and coconut oil, it is easy to find this information with a search on the internet. Coconut oil is wonderful for you and your heart and your weight control. Coconut fiber is also highly beneficial. This is great stuff! And Let's Do Organic has kept the cost and waste down by offering it in this convenient packaging. I agree with the reviewer who said it would be nice if it were available in a larger size. I would buy 1-2 lbs at a time!
