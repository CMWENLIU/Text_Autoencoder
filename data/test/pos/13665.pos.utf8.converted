I approached the Airport Security Gate and fed my bags into the x-ray machine.<br />"Sir," said the TSA agent, "is this your bag?"<br />"You know it is," I replied.<br />"There's no need to get testy sir," he said.<br />The agent escorted me over to a side table.<br />"Do you mind if I search your bag?"  he asked.<br />"What will you do if I say no?" I asked.<br />"I'll take you in the back room and we'll strip search you," he replied.<br />"Then by all means, go ahead and search," I said.<br />The agent opened my bag and peered inside.<br />"What do you call this sir?" the agent asked holding up a pair of nail clippers.<br />"Those are nail clippers," I said.<br />"I'm going to have to confiscate these," he said.<br />"That's alright," I replied, "they sell them for a dollar in the store next to my departure gate."<br />The agent looked at me with hate in his eyes.  He looked back into my bag and pulled out my gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk.<br />"Sir, you can't take this on the plane," he said.<br />"Why not?" I asked.<br />"Because, if you have more than three ounces of a liquid you could use it to blow up the plane," he said.<br />I was astonished. I had no idea that Tuscan Whole Milk was so powerful.<br />"May I drink it now?" I asked.<br />"Yes," he said, "liquids are harmless once they are inside of you."<br />I drank the entire gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk that I had purchased on Amazon.com while the people behind me grew increasingly inpatient.<br />It was delicious.<br />I did not blow up.
