Love this powder.  The whole family drinks it.  The first time I made it with my young son I told him it would make us healthy and strong...strong enough to fight monsters so now we call it monster juice.  It's the first thing he asks to make each morning.  It can be a little gritty however if mixed with juice or other thin liquid.  We make a shake with bananas, orange juice and yogurt or kefir...so good!
