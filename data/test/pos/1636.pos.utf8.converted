First of all, these are COOKIES people. You aren't supposed to eat them with no abandon. Like everything, moderation is key, and then it's fine to eat these. Obviously if you sit there and eat a whole package every day for a week, that isn't very healthy.<br /><br />Secondly, if you are expecting American style cookies, then you will be disappointed. These are not the same in the least. These are made with what they call Biscuits in Europe. They are *slightly* sweetened, almost cracker like in texture. The frosting is not made out of crisco and sugar like American cookies are, so it's not all oily and disgusting. But it also tastes VERY different. The cocoa is not super strong, but it's a nice compliment to the biscuit portion.<br /><br />If you're used to sickening sweet cookies, then you'll probably think these taste weird.<br /><br />Personally I love these because they are more subtle in flavor and not so sweet it makes my teeth hurt. They're really good with tea.
