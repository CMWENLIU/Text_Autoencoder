As a few other people have stated, the majority of the poor reviews for this item are the result of incorrect expectations. Raw almonds are a completely different nut from what many people expect when they think "almonds". I prefer them because they are softer, chewier, sweeter, richer, milder, etc. than the roasted almonds most folks are used to. These are fantastic. If you know what to expect from RAW almonds and that's what you're looking for, these definitely fit the bill!
