I purchased a small package of these treats at Wegman's a few weeks ago. I never expected the reaction I got from my dogs. They LOVED them. Thinking it was the chicken jerky they were doing back flips over, I bought a large package of Milo's Kitchen chicken jerky. They, of course, are excited about those treats, but it's not even close to the excitement they show over these. Glad to find them in a larger package, and free shipping is always a plus. Thanks again, Amazon!
