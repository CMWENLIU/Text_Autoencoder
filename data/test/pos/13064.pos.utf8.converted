I've been using microwave popcorn for years, but finally got a hot air popper recently.  Up until tonight I've been using Orville R's popcorn and just haven't been impressed.  Too chewy.  One batch of Wabash Valley, though, has made me a convert!  Wow.<br /><br />First off, I've found that you need to use less of this in a batch because it pops up very light and fluffy.  About 20% less seems to yield 20% more volume.<br /><br />Second, the popcorn is a bright, pure white in color.  It just plain looks delicious.<br /><br />Third, it isn't chewy at all.  I don't think I've ever eaten more perfect popcorn.  Just exactly the right texture and flavor.<br /><br />Finally, there were almost no unpopped kernels.  Only four, to be exact.<br /><br />One serving of this stuff has turned me into a loyal customer.  I'll never go back to anything else.
