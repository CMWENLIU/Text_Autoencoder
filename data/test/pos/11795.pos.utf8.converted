cherry - got this as a gift for my fiance while im in afghanistan and she says its awesome and tastes great! i had to tell her to stop eating it because she was like 1/4 done with it in 10 min or so!<br /><br />apple - got this one for my dad at the same time as the one for my fiance, and while he isnt a big candy eater, he loved it too. and he said it would last him over a year lol.
