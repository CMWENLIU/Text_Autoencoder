I have been drinking Celestial Seasonings herbal teas for as long as I can remember, and I have always found them to be pleasantly flavored.  A few years ago, my supermarket had the Gingerbread Spice flavor on the shelf in November - I had never heard of it, but it looked good (who can resist a tea with cookies on the box?), so I tried it.  I LOVED it.  Pleasantly flavored would have been a vast understatement - this tea is DELICIOUS.  And it smells wonderful.<br /><br />It takes me quite a while to consume 20 tea bags, so some time passed before I was ready to restock.  Much to my dismay, the supermarket only carries this flavor during November and December!  I had to wait until the holiday season to get it again.<br /><br />Imagine my joy at discovering that Amazon now offers Gingerbread Spice all year round!  What a happy surprise!  Now I can drink my favorite tea whenever I want it.<br /><br />I enjoy Gingerbread Spice with milk, but find that it is quite sweet enough without adding any additional sugar.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys herbal tea.
