My Husband used to work at Starb**** and wanted to recreate his favorite drink (iced white mocha americano) at home with our Barista machine.  This is the exact same stuff as they use in the store and his drink turns out perfect every morning.  It lasts us about a month with a drink every day and it looks like this will be a regular buy for us from now on.
