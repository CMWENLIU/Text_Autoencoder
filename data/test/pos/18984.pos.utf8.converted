I am a total coconut oil convert.  I may even be a zealot.  My daughter has very dry type 3C-4A hair, and since I started using the coconut oil on her hair, it has become much more supple and shiny.  Less frizz in the mornings, easier to braid and comb, etc. I have thrown out all the traditional mainstream haircare products in favor of this.  They don't even compare.<br /><br />Moreover, I use it as a body/facial moisturizer and it is magnificent. A little goes a long way and my skin stays smooth all day.  Love it.
