I have bought pig ears for my dogs for over 12 years and these were the perfect size. Very big but not huge. They are smoked perfect and Bubby loves them. Everyone who buys these for their dogs knows you can get stuck with very small ones and be very disappointed, not these. Bought from this company before and have never been sorry. Very fast ship, very reliable company.
