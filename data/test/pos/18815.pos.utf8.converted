I ordered these to make sachets for baby shower favors. I added my own sage and lavender colored ribbon after filing them with lavender (from the same supplier). They look like I spent a fortune on them but I didn't! I have left-overs which I plan on using for gifts, tea bags, and also to make oil infusions with. I'm quite pleased with them!
