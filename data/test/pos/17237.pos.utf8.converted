This is surprisingly good, especially considering it is sugar-free. The peppermint flavor is very palatable and is not overly sweet or strong. If you love peppermint mochas, then you will love using this with your favorite chocolate syrup. Zero calories, zero fat, zero carbs and zero sugar... and it's delicious! I think the pumps are overpriced, so I use a cocktail jigger to ensure I put the same amount of syrup each time. I was worried this product would taste "fake", but it doesn't... RECOMMENDED.
