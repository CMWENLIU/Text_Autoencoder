This is the first time I've tried these organic plums and they are the perfect healthy snack to keep by my computer at work. They're moist and flavorful, and we don't have to worry about chemicals or sulfur because they're organic. My 6 year old daughter loves them too and I'm happy to see her getting more fiber in her diet. We like to cut them into pieces and top salads and cereals with them or eat them alone. I highly recommend them.
