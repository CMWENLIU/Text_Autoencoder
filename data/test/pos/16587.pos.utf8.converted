I purchased this product because my muscles were very tight. It does a great job relaxing my muscles. The strange thing is, I can't take very much or I have the wildest dreams imaginable. It also makes me tired if I take even so much as a level teaspoon each day.<br /><br />I started taking much less so that I wouldn't have those hyper-realistic dreams. I take 1/8 teaspoon twice a day. Here's the amazing thing. I get these spells of "skipped" heartbeats -- PVCs and PACs. A mere 1/8 teaspoon of this stuff nips it in the bud in minutes! I quit taking the betablockers I have on standby for this problem because this product is so effective.<br /><br />This morning, my husband accidentally made me 16 oz. of caffeinated coffee. Since I have significant issues with anxiety, I *never* drink caffeine. I gulped it down and started feeling incredibly jittery and anxious. When I realized what had happened (and that I wasn't merely going crazy), I took 1/8 teaspoon of Natural Calm. While I still felt hyper-alert, the jitteriness went away entirely.<br /><br />LOVE this stuff, and am so thankful that it is available!
