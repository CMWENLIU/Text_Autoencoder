A NEW PRODUCT FROM JUICY JUICE IS ANOTHER WINNER FROM JUICY JUICE<br /><br />Simply stated, this is concentrate that need NOT be refrigerated until after you open it. You can make 48 oz. from each can, just like evaporated milk. According to 'Juicy Juice's' Website, this new concentrated form is available in Apple, Berry, Cherry, Grape, Kiwi Strawberry, Punch, and White Grape.<br /><br />TASTES LIKE THIS CAN'T POSSIBLY BE 100% JUICE!,<br /><br />JUICY JUICE'S MISSION: STOP BUYING SODA FOR YOUR KIDS: BUY JUICY JUICE, is a simultaneously self-serving and altruistic mission.<br /><br />"Juicy Juice Berry"- A MOST PALATABLE VARIETY OF JUICY JUICY:<br /><br />This is one of my favorite varieties of Juicy Juicy. Why is it? It is very palatable and obviously very sweet. However, there is none of the high fructose syrup in it that is added to other punches. Afterall, this is 100% juice.<br /><br />So what's in this stuff?: NO ARTIFICIAL COLORS - FLAVORS OR SUGAR ADDED!<br /><br />Apple Juice, Grape Juice, Raspberry Juice (Water, Juice Concentrates) Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Citric Acid. It is the combination of juices in this blend that makes this taste like a treat. For children and adults too, who like the sweet taste of soda pop or sweetened punches, this product represents a much healthier and palatable alternative.<br /><br />For providing this excellent, anti-oxidant rich alternative, as a compromise between healthy beverages and sugar sweetened drinks, I feel that "Juicy Juice Fruit Berry" has easily earned a five star rating.<br /><br />Now if only there were a way to decrease the amounts of natural sugars without affecting the taste?!<br /><br />WHAT IS THE "JUICY JUICE" BRAND?:<br /><br />Libby's "Juicy Juice Fruit Berry, 46 fl oz" is part of a larger family of 100% juice products that has taken aim at the huge market share that Coke and Pepsi have carved out for themselves. Their target market is the youth of America. That, more than anything else, makes this and other Libby's products important. I first became aware of this targeting when I was watching the PBS program "Arthur" with my youngest child (who is named Arthur). At the end of the show there was a message from Libby's that said, "Juicy Juice Is Proud To Support Arthur". Since then I have regularly supported their 100% juice products, although I drink more of them than our Arthur does. Surprisingly, most "Juicy Juice" products are significantly less expensive than "Ocean Spray" and "Northland" juices, though I still buy some of those varieties as well.<br /><br />THE INEVITABLE COMPROMISE:<br /><br />Though many critics and health advocates have pointed out that fruit juices are naturally high in sugar and after processing, including pasteurization, lose many of their healthful properties, they still represent a healthful alternative to soda for children. Surprisingly this seems to be a controversial statement, but 100% juice [with a little Vitamin C added] does help to engender healthful eating habits which begin with the choice of beverage. It is also a good source of potassium and is an excellent thirst quencher.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that all of these juices taste very palatable to kids, probably because they are blended to taste sweet without any added sugar. Of course, it would be better to make your own juice, avoid pasteurization [made in a very clean environment], and include the natural vitamins, minerals and pulp, but who really has time. What's more, do you really think a child would drink such a homemade healthy brew? In the meantime, there is "Juicy Juice" and our children will most probably drink that thereby avoiding soda.<br /><br />LOOKING FOR MORE INFO?:<br /><br />To find out more about this product, see their website at "juicyjuice" on the world wide web.
