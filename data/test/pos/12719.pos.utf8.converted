These are great!  My 10 month old LOVES these, eats them all the time and even seems to like them better than Gerber puffs.  I like that they melt so easily and don't have junk in them.  When I first found these here, I wasn't so keen on having to get a pack of 6 because, well, what if my kid did not like them?  But my son likes them a ton so very worth it.  The container is bigger than I had expected, but almost completely full so good deal.  I just transfer a handful into a small travel container for taking some on the go.  What a great find!
