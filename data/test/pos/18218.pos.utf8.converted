I was SO EXCITED to discover a way to decrease the sugar content in icing/frosting...I have a wholesome baking company and now feel a bit better about offering products I do with glaze or frosting - this isn't as low calorie as the regular or brown ideal, but still way lower (344 cals per cup vs. about 768 cals per cup of regular powdered sugar)...I would recommend half and half for icing - a different taste slightly than reg., but NOT bitter at all...Even at half and half you'd be at 550 cals per cup... if using a drizzle of glaze, could go with just this product...mixed it with milk, vanilla, and dark unsweetened cocoa powder - YUM!
