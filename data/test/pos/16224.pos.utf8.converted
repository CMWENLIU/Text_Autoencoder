Our "puppy" (90lb Rhodesian Ridgeback) has been on Blue Buffalo since she came home with us from the breeder almost a year ago.  The Blue Buffalo brand is synonymous for quality in my opinion.  We will continue her on Blue Buffalo for her adult and senior years.  I have price compared buying from Amazon and the "big-name" pet store and more times than not Amazon has been less expensive.  I do have a young child so getting the 30lb bags delivered to my door (FREE with Amazon Prime) has been a real blessing.  I highly recommend this product.
