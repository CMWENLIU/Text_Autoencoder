I have made this cake by Ina before from scratch!  It turned out wonderful but was a lot of work!  When I saw you could order everything done for you I thought I would give it a try.  This cake turned out perfect and no one knew it was from a box!  Everything I have ever made or tried by Barefoot Contessa is always been top notch!
