I've never had Phad Thai in any form other than from my favorite Pacific Northwest restaurants that make it. This was absolutely delicious. It had a bit of a sweeter taste than what I'm used too, but that in no way was a bad thing. This costs about 20% of what I pay for the same dish and it's about half the portion size. When I get it from a restaurant it feeds me twice, so it's basically the perfect serving size for a grown man and it comes at a fraction of the price. I'll be ordering much more of this. You should too.<br /><br />P.S - I've ordered dozens of items off of Amazon. This is the first one I've ever bothered reviewing. It's that damn good.
