Unlike earlier reviewers, I received the correct product -- and what a great product it is.  Quinoa flour is the best weapon in the gluten-free baker's arsenal, and I have been extremely pleased with the quality of this particular product.  It is evenly milled and seems quite fresh.  Amazon's price is the best I've found, too.
