When I first had this lemonade I loved it, so I found it on amazon and ordered it.<br />My first shipment wasn't good. Some of the packs were open and some of the packs had hard powder in them. I emailed amazon right away and told them the situation. They replied less than 20 mins later and said they would send me a  new shipment, free of charge, and with free 2-day shipping.<br /><br />The 2nd shipment was perfect.<br />Amazon has awesome customer service. I've never had an issue with shipment until now and I don't care because I know amazon will handle it.
