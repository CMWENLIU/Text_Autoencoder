UPDATE:<br />It's been quite a qhile since I ordered my first box of Skin Detox tea, and have ordered it periodically since. I have the awful habit of using skin detox tea until my skin looks great, then not buying the tea for a while until I notice my skin becoming worse.<br />I have to say, that this tea has helped my skin quality in general mroe than any product that I have used. I have at times applied the tea topically as well for stronger effects, but it isn't neccessary for the tea to work. I've decided that i am going to actualyl keep myself in a constant supply of the tea, and drink it each day, as opposed to only after bad breakouts, to take a more proactive rather than reactive approach.<br /><br />Ad for the taste, I actually like it now. it took getting used to, but I find the taste calming and comforting now, as opposed to tolerable before.<br /><br />Anyway, if you have any hesitation whatsoever about tryig this tea for your skin, buy a box at the grocery store to try it out. I can almost guarantee that with regular use, though, your skin will improve.<br /><br />PRIOR REVIEW:<br />My first review, couldnt help myself!<br /><br />I heard some good things about this tea from a friend and decided that it couldnt hurt to order, as i am an avid tea-drinker anyway.<br /><br />Right before the tea arrived I began a horrendous breakout, the worst that I had had in years even. The entire left side of my face was covered in acne, perhaps a reaction from a new face-wash, that i since have been scared to touch!<br />Well a few days following the breakout the tea arrived. I figured there was no better situation really than this to try the tea so over the course of two weeks, besides general rinsing in the shower i have used no face wash, no creams or ointments, nothing. And my acne is almost gone!<br /><br />nothing new has popped up and everything that had been there is almost completely gone, i even notice acne scars fading if possible. my ance is literally drying up, as if i was using some sort of heavy cleanser or astringent, it is quite ridiculous. I am already looking at my budget to see if i have enough to order another batch.<br /><br />I used about 3 bags a day, one cup about midday with two tea bags, and one before bed with a single bag.<br /><br />The tea has a flavor that takes getting used to, both strong and weak at the same time, hard to explain. i don't use sugar so i don't know how it tastes with anything added.<br /><br />either way, it cant hurt so try it, i say!
