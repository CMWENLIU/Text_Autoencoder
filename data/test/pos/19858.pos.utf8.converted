This bread mix is by far my favorite. I have found that to get a true "french bread" experience, you have to use a baguette pan, which cooks it to the right consistency. Where it doesn't duplicate a crusty loaf tucked under your arm in paris, this is as good as it gets for us gluten-free folk, as far as I'm concerned.
