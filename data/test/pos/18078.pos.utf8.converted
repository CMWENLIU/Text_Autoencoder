So often the sugar-free version of a favorite candy classic is disappointing. Not these sugar-free peach rings! They're tangy but sweet and refreshing -- and, I'm sorry to say (in my case, at least), addictive. One of the nice surprises is finding that instead of being coated with flecks of too-acidic sugar or sugar substitute, they're coated with flecks of something that doesn't sting the tongue or distress the palate with too sour a sensation. The gummi texture's just right and the flavor's irresistable. Try some. If you like traditional peach rings, I think you'll be pleased.
