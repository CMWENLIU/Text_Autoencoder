I cook my oats in a crockpot overnight.  I throw in cinnamon, diced apples and a little organic raw apple juice in place of 50% of the water.  Between the apples and apple juice the oatmeal needs no additional sugar and my house smells amazing in the morning when we all wake up!<br />Love Scottish Oats!
