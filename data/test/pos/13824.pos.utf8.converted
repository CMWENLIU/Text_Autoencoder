I found this salt at local high-end grocery stores and loved it.  It is the best finishing salt I have found, and I've tried many.<br /><br />Then the local stores stopped carrying it - so I found it on Amazon, ordered five containers.  It was cheaper on Amazon than the local stores.<br /><br />I gave it to foodie friends as a holiday gift - and they loved me for it!!<br /><br />The order was delivered when specified, in great condition - everything I expected.
