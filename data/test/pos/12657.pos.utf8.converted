Yes it is the replacement for the original General Foods International Cappuccino Coolers and I am addicted to it I think. It is little bit different, I think they lower the sugar content in this new one and it has little bit more coffee taste to it vs. the original but I still love it. But what's with the price? I use to by this for around $15 pr box of 8 and now it's like $50? wtf when did this happen, I am still buying it locally at the original price and now I found out that even Wall Mart is selling it for about $1.80 a box! I guess I won't be buying it from here any more!
