I really thought good NY style pizza was a thing of my pre gluten free past...like Life cereal and licorice. This pizza crust changed that.<br /><br /> The first attempt, near perfect. The second, some changes were made. I let the dough rise overnight in the 'fridge. This gave it an even more elastic texture. I used probably 2-3 tablespoons of water to spread the crust out evenly in the pan but due to par baking...this works well. Don't be afraid to use the water or you may have an unspreadable glob, and not a pizza crust. The resulting pizza is amazing. You can fold the slice without any crumbling, even 2-3 day old leftovers retain their "real" pizza qualities. The topped crust has all the texture and chew I've come to expect in pizza. The un-topped "lip" of crust that forms the pizza has a slight "beany" taste from the bean flour in the mix. I solved that by making a rectangular, southern CT style pizza...totally topped, no crust lip. I will also try adding seasoning and garlic to a crust sometime and see what that does. I'd rather pizza, than no pizza...and this is the best GF pizza mix I have tried to date.
