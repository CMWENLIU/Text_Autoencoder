I'm writing as the owner of two Chocolate Labrador Retrievers.  My dogs both eat Orijen food, although my 3 year old eats the adult formula (we alternate between 15 lb bags of the regular adult and the fish adult varieties.)  This brand of dog food is worth the high price and difficulty in finding it to buy!<br /><br />My 13 month old lab is a powerhouse of energy!  She looks like a wet otter when dry, her coat is so shiny and sleek!  We went through several varieties of food trying to combat her terrible gas after eating and thankfully found this food, which our puppy loves; so much so that we changed our older lab to the adult version about 3 months ago.  Both dogs are thriving, and LOVE meal time (although to be fair, they are labs and would likely chow down average grocery store dog food, too).  I can use the dry puppy food as treat rewards when working with my younger dog.  She never tires of it!<br /><br />I'm writing my review mainly because I read another reviewer who INCORRECTLY claimed this food is not appropriate for large breed pups.  Although the reviewer seem well-intentioned, they are not fully informed.  Read the summary below from Orijen regarding their large breed puppy food and the hip dysplasia issue the other reviewer is concerned with.  Of more concern is a high ASH CONTENT in puppy food, NOT simply a high protein content, which puppies actually need for optimal growth.<br /><br />"Orijen Puppy Food: Grain Free Large Breed was formulated because in nature, puppies are facultative carnivores - they thrive on a varied diet of meats with smaller amounts of fruits, vegetables and grasses. Puppies are biologically adapted to process proteins as an energy source, and need animal protein for healthy growth and building strong organs, skin and coat.<br />High in protein and low in carbohydrate, ORIJEN PUPPY FOOD is a grain-free formula that replicates the same rich and diverse balance of meats, fruits, vegetables and grasses that puppies and young dogs would encounter in a wilderness setting.<br />By utilizing special low-ash chicken and fish ingredients, ORIJEN PUPPY LARGE avoids the high ash levels--and subsequently elevated calcium and phosphorus--that are a common concern for large breed puppy owners on high-protein diets. Low-ash ORIJEN features perfectly balanced natural-source minerals, fortified with ocean source glucosamine and chondroitin to nutritionally support healthy bones and joints. Orijen Dog Food is our top-of-the-line dry dog food!"
