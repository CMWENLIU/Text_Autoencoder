Mayonnaise is something I usually associate with salads, (read boring rubbish here, in my opinion). However, I have been surprised just how much it is used in Japanese food.<br /><br />Although you can use it with normal salads, I have also enjoyed it very much with takoyaki, (octopus dumplings in a ball shape). It also mixes well with other sauces, such as with Japanese barbeque and so on. Even dipping things like chips, (health food, really!), for a snack works.<br /><br />It is a bit different to other types, but it is very nice with a pleasant and creamy taste to it. Recommended!
