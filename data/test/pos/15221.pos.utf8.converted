Hands down, Nong Shim produces a quick snack/meal. After working aboard vessels on the Bering for 12 years I've come to the conclusion that this little bowl has become the epitome for a meal if you don't have time, want to pass on the food offered in the Galley or trying to survive during the down time when the catch has run dry and boredom sets in causing the munchies.<br /><br />I've seen lots of combos with this one-Vienna sausages, Spam, Albacore tuna, Sardines, Chilies, Three crabs & Maggi, Peanut butter, cumin and beans...<br /><br />Sodium-yes, it's packed with a wallop of the stuff, but when you're grinding 12 to 16 a day you burn it off pretty fast. For those worrying about MSG then just set the spice pack aside and work the noodles with the condiment of choice to your liking.<br />The noodles hold up to a hot broth and don't get soft like a lot of the other brands. Prep time is + 2 minutes. Inexpensive, and a good quick meal if you treat it right.
