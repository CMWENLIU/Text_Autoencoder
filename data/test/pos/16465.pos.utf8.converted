In my opinion this is the best dog food on the market for all breeds. Our 7 year old miniature poodle "mix" had problems with seizures. The vet recommended "medication" to control the seizures which was expensive.<br />A friend recommended trying Natural Balance dog food. I am happy to report that our "Scooter" has been seizure free now for over three years.<br />We now have both of our dogs dining on this mix and they are both very healthy. Our other pooch is a 13 year old Bi-shon, we wouldn't feed them anything else.<br />Thanks to my purchases of this product on Amazon.com, I save the fuel I would normally use going to several pet stores to find this product, also Amazon delivers it right to my door for the same price I would pay for it in the local store.<br />I wouldn't buy it from any other source.<br />You should consider buying this product and I would highly recommend this particular blend.<br />Mike Crabbs<br />BelAir, Maryland
