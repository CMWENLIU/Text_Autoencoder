I don't know when I first tried this powdered iced tea mix.  I have never liked iced tea, and I never expected AriZona brand to change my opinion.  I was pleasantly surprised and happy to be wrong!  This tea really wowed me, and I have been drinking it for years now.  It hasn't been available locally for several years, and I have been buying it directly from the AriZona web site until I saw it on Amazon.  Amazon has a much better price, and with PRIME shipping I have it in two days, so I'll never run out!  If you love iced tea (and even if you don't) I highly recommend giving this a try.
