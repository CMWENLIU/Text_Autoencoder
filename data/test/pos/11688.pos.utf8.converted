I really love the Brothers Crisps simply because they are preservative free, and I have preservative allergies! To be specific, these are sulfite-free, not to mention: gluten-free, vegan, nut/tree-nut safe, dairy free, Non GMO, and even Kosher.<br /><br />This particular variety contains three of my faves, so instead of ending up with 72 bags to get the entire assortment - I ordered the variety and got 24, a much more manageable number!<br /><br />Here's the rundown on what's in the package<br /><br />Strawberry/Banana - contains 1 banana and about 4 strawberries. These are an interesting combination of tart and sweet, and are my personal favorites. I've occasionally even used these on my oatmeal, although I enjoy them straight out of the pack. (45 Calories)<br /><br />Fuji Apple - most kid friendly. Strong and sweet apple taste, nice large pieces that look like apple slices. The package contains 1 1/2 apples and really would make a good substitute for potato chips in a lunch. In fact, most kids would consider it a treat. My sister's grand-kids raid her cupboard for these. (39 Calories)<br /><br />Asian Pear - about the same sweetness of the Fuji apple but without the apple (or strong pear) taste. Once again, this contains 1 1/2 pears, so it really gets you going on your fruit requirements. (40 Calories)<br /><br />The highest nutritional level is the Strawberry/Banana Combo since the strawberries are such a great source of vitamin C, but all of the packs are great choices.<br /><br />Because these are freeze-dried instead of dehydrated, there is no sticky residue to worry about. They are perfect for carrying in the car, sitting at a desk, hiking, backpacking, wherever you want an easy-to-grab healthy fruit snack.
