I love irish oats.  This style of oats is simply the best bowl of cereal period.  I eat at least one bowl everyday.  That said, all steel cut oats are NOT the same.  As many people know, there is no comparison to the taste of Mccann's Irish oats.  Why are they better? Honestly, I don't know.  Maybe because they're Irish.  Anyway, I have previously tried other types of steel cut oats and quite honestly, they were no comparison.  Well one day recently, when I was shopping and realized that I was out of Mccann's, I found that my grocery store was out.  Right next to the spot was this brand of oats.  I had tried the Country Choice Rolled Oat and Multigrain cereals, and they are both great.  So I figured I'd give it a try.  They are very, very good.  These are as close to Mccann's as you can get.  Since they are about half the price of Mccann's, I figure i will switch between these two.  In summary, these are a great choice if you can't get Mccann's or if you prefer a cheaper breakfast.
