So, this tastes nothing like durum semolina wheat pasta.  BUT, it's a delicious, healthy alternative for people who are watching their carbs or gluten intake OR for people who want a high-protein low-carb option that fills you up.  This pasta *is* the noodle equivalent of a bran muffin.  I find it goes well with heavy meat-based sauces - think the hearty "just like Grandma used to make" variety.  Once you get used to this taste, it's delicious, but it is NOT a wheat pasta substitute... that would be like saying bran muffins are a substitute for Wonderbread.
