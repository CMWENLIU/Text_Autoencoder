These have gone in price (by 50% of the original price) since I originally wrote this review but its still a bargain compared to what you pay at other retailers.<br /><br />November 2006<br />When I first ordered the retriever rolls I was worried I had sacrificed quality for quantity but I was absolutely wrong.  Each retriever was about 11" long and about 1.25" thick.  They were identical in quality to the rawhide rolls I buy at the pet store for $2.99 each!!  I have a VERY active 18 month (100 lbs) yellow lab but when I give him a retriever roll he will lay down to chew and play for hours at a time.  They are thick and durable enough to last about week which is a miracle since he is a chewing machine.  I highly recommend them to anyone with a puppy or dog who chews.
