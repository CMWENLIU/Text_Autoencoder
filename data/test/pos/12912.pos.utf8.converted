Myojo Ippeichan Yakisoba is a tasty instant noodle meal that leaves me wistful for Japan's summer festivals where vendors cook mountains of noodles on flattop grills.<br /><br />Yakisoba traditionally is prepared with a sweeter, thicker condiment than Worcestershire sauce. Stir-fried with small pieces of pork and vegetables (cabbage, onion and carrot are the most common), yakisoba is flavored with many different seasonings, depending on which Japanese region the dish is prepared.<br /><br />The Myojo Ippeichan Yakisoba package comes with four packets -- dehydrated vegetables, spices, yakisoba sauce and a mayonnaise-mustard blend -- that require more preparation than the typical ramen noodle meals. Don't let that dissuade you from buying Myojo Ippeichan Yakisoba though, meal preparation only takes a few minutes; the extra steps are explained clearly on the side of the package (step-by-step illustrations are on the lid).<br /><br />The key to preparation is to drain as much of the hot water as possible. Again, unlike instant ramen, you don't want a broth. These are dry-style noodles. Add the sauce, spice and mayonnaise-mustard packets together and stir thoroughly. The noodles should be covered completely and slightly sticky with no pools of sauce in the foam tray.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.<br /><br />BTW: If you have not yet enjoyed Japan's festival food, I highly recommend tomorokoshi (grilled corn on the cob), okonomiyaki (savory, vegetable pancakes), takoyaki (octopus dumplings cooked in iron molds), yakitori (grilled skewered chicken), jaga bataa (steamed potatoes with butter) and, for dessert, either anzu ame (candied apricots) or kakigori (shaved ice).
