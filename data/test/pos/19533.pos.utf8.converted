If there is a weakness with the Keurig coffee system, it's that most of the K-Cups--even the Extra Bold varieties--tend to brew a weaker cup of coffee, lacking the full flavor of a regularly brewed cup of Joe. I've therefore learned to order sampler packs if available, so I don't get stuck with a bunch of K-Cups I don't like. So I got the Coffee People's Extra Bold sampler pack which included, Black Tiger, Wake Up Call, Organic, and Jet Fuel. And I found them all purdy good.<br /><br />But with the Jet Fuel, I found myself thinking, "Wow, I've finally found a satisfyingly full-flavored bold coffee!" I even had to put two creamers in my cup instead of my customary one, and I found myself savoring every sip. If you're looking for a full-flavored bold cuppa Joe, this one is for you!
