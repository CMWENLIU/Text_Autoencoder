Despite giving Emeril's Big Easy Bold five stars, I think it only fair to open with a couple of negative points. First, if you're looking for authentic New Orleans style coffee, you'll likely be disappointed by the lack of chicory root. Frankly, I doubt that most coffee drinkers will mourn the lost chicory. Second, this coffee is a concentrated dark roast; if you're fan of light roasts and mild coffees, this variety will probably taste ashy and too strong.<br /><br />We just started using our Keurig B40 last week, and the first few k-cups I tried were disappointingly watery. The Emeril's Big Easy Bold is one of the few blends I've found that provides a full-bodied cup of coffee without any harsh overtones and without any nasty, bitter after-taste. Made with a single varietal (Colombian-grown arabica), Emeril's Big Easy Bold brews up with a rich cocoa aroma and a thin trace of crema. The flavor includes caramel, chocolate, and fruity notes with a hint of pepperiness, but the chocolate note lingers in the finish.<br /><br />I don't add sugar or cream to my coffee, but I doubt that either addition would detract from the overall experience. Excellent with scones.
