Please see update at the end of this review. For fairness sake, I'm leaving original review I did when I tried the 17.5 oz cans intact. But the smaller cans do not contain the same quality product. Whether bad batch (one time) or just bad distributor/supplier for small cans (ongoing), I'd beware. Now, the original review, then the updates:<br /><br />This is far and away my fave coconut water now that I'm self-exiled from the horror that is new Zico (they ruined a terrific product by making it from concentrate).<br /><br />Note that this comes in cans, not tetra paks, and the cans are BPA-free. These are recyclable (well, as long as your area accepts cans.) Note as well that Amy & Brian's coconut waters are flash-pasteurized (like ONE and Zico and others). Unless you wanna risk crazy bacteria, coconut water must have some sort of pasteurization.<br /><br />I've been sampling various amazon-available coconut waters looking for my new staple. History:  I was a loyal Zico subscriber/drinker for a couple years. They changed. It's awful. I canceled my subscription. I've had and enjoyed O.N.E. in the tetra pak and Nature Factor's organic in a can. I've had and not liked as much VitaCoco and Harvest Bay. But all those are fine depending on your own taste preferences. Previously, I had also tried supermarket brands like Goya and Conchita. I'm always willing to try coconut water, looking for good price and great taste. I decided to try Amy & Brian's cause I learned about them from googling "coconut water taste tests" due to wanting to see what others thought of the brands out there. One taste test comparison mentioned this one tasted most like the actual coconut that was used in the taste test for comparison. Another taste test gave A&B props, too. So, yeah, got my attention.<br /><br />This one is now my new fave. I have subscribed to the A&B pulp free in both can sizes.<br /><br />Second fave based on flavor alone (not processing, container, etc) is Nature Factor's organic one. After that O.N.E. VitaCoco is good for those who prefer less sweetness, more of a slightly sourness. Something out there for everyone, right?<br /><br />I can say this to coconut water lovers: those above are definitely worth trying to see if you enjoy them, too, before you decide on a permanent subscription. But do try this one if you enjoy a bit more sweetness. So good. But if you hate any sort of higher sense of sweetness in your beverages, this isn't for you. I'd recommend ONE or Vitacoco for you, or maybe Harvest Bay.<br /><br />What makes this one a bit different than the good brands I've named:<br /><br />Big can option or small can option: 17.5 ounces vs this one that's 10 ouncnes. I buy both now, cause some days I want the bigger can to take with me to Pilates.<br /><br />Sweeter: Maybe it's where they get their coconuts from, but this brand has a delicious sweetness that is lacking on ONE, VitaCoco, Zico (old and new), and Harvest Bay. Nature Factor's is a bit sweeter than the previous, but Amy and Brian beats them all. I like sweet. :D Because another reviewer called it "unnaturally sweet", I emailed Amy & Brian via their website to ask if this is from concentrate or has sugar added or manipulated. I was told it's juice as it came from the coconuts, not from concentrate, no sugar added. So, I'm content.<br /><br />Some facts:<br /><br />8 oz = 76 calories<br />This is more than ounce per ounce for other brands, but this is probably explained by the sweetness (meaning more natural carbs). Worth noting for those who are on low-carb/carb-conscious diets. For the rest, it just means MORE FLAVOR.<br /><br />I wish Amy & Brian would put the potassium count on the label, though. This matters to a lot of us, including those who need to watch K intake due to drugs that spare potassium or folks who have high blood pressure and want to see how much K in their diet controls it. To the manufacturer: PLEASE add potassium to labeling under the sodium. Thanks.<br /><br />I love, love that amazon offers this on subcribe and save. Makes life easier. Thank you, Amazon, for this wonderful addition to your S&S coconut water offerings.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!<br /><br />Update: I emailed Amy & Brian after I posted this review, and lo and behold, they will be adding Potassium and Magnesium to their labels. FYI, here are the counts:<br /><br />Potassium: whole can: 780, 8 oz serving: 360<br />Magnesium: whole can: 31.2, 8 oz servinng: 14.4<br /><br />I confirmed that A&B is "flash pasteurized", and got email from them to prove it,  which is the same pasteurization used for the tetra paks, as I understand it, so the nutrients should be comparable. They heat their at a lower temp than, say, Zico's, but for a bit longer. If you google "Crossfit Adventure" and this coconut water brand name, you'll see the article about the specifics: A&B heats their juice to 160-165 degrees for 15-20 seconds so that the nutrient content is undiminished. Also, the can is not BPA - it is Aqualure 900~19%. The other brand I liked the taste of, Nature Factor, does heat up their CW to a very high degree, so that one may be of concern nutrients-wise. Not A&B.<br /><br />They use Thai coconuts. :)<br /><br />Addendum: For carb watchers--  The carb count for A&B is roughly twice that of others. I used the brands I had at hand at home (and a calculator) to save you time making comparisons. The number stands for carbs per ounce:<br /><br />Amy & Brian:  2.375<br />Nature Factor Organic: 1.6<br />O.N.E.: 1.33<br />New Zico (from concentrate): 1.07<br /><br />I think Old Zico was more like ONE in terms of carbs per ounce.<br /><br />I wonder if the selection of coconuts can give higher sodium (see new Zico's much higher sodium count), then can the selection also be chosen to have higher carbs/more sweetness?<br /><br />HTH<br /><br />UPDATE: WHOA! Talk about variety. I have to say that my second order of Amy & Brian's is not as nice-tasting as the first. My first batch was really delicious and natural tasting. The second order tastes like candy-water. Seriously, it has an unnaturally sweet, unusual flavor. It's still not as offputting as the sour/cereal taste of the bottled Zico, but it's not something I'd recommend. So, a warning--you might get a great batch or a not so great one. But I thought you needed to know that flavor is not consistent (and it wasn't with original Zico, the one I used to drink the most, as coconuts will differ, coconut from coconut, therefore coconut water will have certain inconsistencies unless it's "jiggered" for consistency.)  I hope, if you ordered, your batch is wonderful. But I am reconsidering my subscription, cause this variation is just a bit too disparate (a little change is fine, but from amazing to odd-sugary-candy-water will not do.) I have to amend my rating to three stars. HTH.<br /><br />Update July 12, 2010: Okay, I couldn't resist the sale this month that gives me A&B for half off, so I ordered the large/tall can in the pulp version. FANTASTIC. It seems that every case I've gotten in the Tall cans is great. All the cases in the small cans are horrible. So, take my advice: skip these 10 oz cans and get the tall version of A&B, either with or without pulp. Delicious. A&B needs to research why those small cans are so bad versus the tasty and coconutty tall ones.
