Yes, you can make your own.  Recipies abound.  Simply buy an armload of cheese, open a bottle of wine, chop some garlic, pour in your kirsch. . . .what - you're tired of this project already? You say you just wanted some cheese? there's no-one to impress tonight? the state liquor store is closed? you can't find your grater? what the heck is kirsch? You'd rather keep your $27 and not have to drink the rest of that white wine?<br /><br />OH, then pay $10 and buy this box.  Zero to bubbly cheese in 5 minutes.  Cut bread.  Dip.  Still drink the wine because that is totally awesome.
