I use these chili beans with a can of Eden's pinto beans and a can of organic corn, tomatoes and finally a couple of small cans of jalpeno peppers to give the whole meal a lift ( fo course all purchased through Amazon.com subscribe and save).  I saute onions, celery, carrots and then add ground turkey before I add the canned goods but the end result is successful.  I have tried this dish on my neighbor (who so kindly blows my snow) and on my two grandsons.  They all requested more so that is how I determine that success.  To make it even better you can add a layer of cornbread on top as well as insert a piece of cheese in the middle and bake until the cornbread is done.  Its a real winner.
