This stuff works!  Why?  For all the skeptics - it is not because of the placebo effect.  It is because valerian root contains an active compound that has almost identical chemical properties to valium.  That is not to say that it IS valium.  The relationship between valerian and valium is analogous to the relationship between coca leaves and cocaine.  One *contains* traces of the compound in amounts that are no more harmful than caffeine in coffee, and the other *is* the compound - highly potent, pure, and either synthetically produced or isolated and concentrated - very dangerous, indeed.  Both valerian root and coca leaves also contain many other wonderful things that the pure active compound does not, such as vitamins, minerals, antioxidents, etc.  Valerian root is an herb that happens to contain a substance that is a gentle, natural sleep aid.  That is not to say one cannot take too much - after all, just because it is natural, does not mean it cannot be harmful if consumed in excess.  Let's face it, all secondary metabolites produced by plants and fungi are produced to protect the plant from being consumed.  In small doses, however, large animals, not only, are able to tolerate these toxins, but they often benefit from them.  The amount used in get some zzz's, however is the perfect amount.  I would go for this before I go for valerian root pills.<br /><br />Now, back to my review:  I am someone that has a hard time falling asleep and, once I do fall asleep, I do not stay asleep for more than 4-5 hours.  Once I wake up, I cannot fall back asleep.  This tea has been the answer I have been looking for.  I have been drinking one cup of this tea (one bag per cup) most nights for the past year.  When I do drink it, I do not toss and turn for an hour and a half before falling asleep, and, the best part is, I am able to sleep through the night - I don't wake up until the sun comes up.  If, for some reason I do wake up, I am able to fall asleep again quickly.  Also, unlike some other sleep aids I have tried (including cold medication when I am stuffed up), I do not wake up drowsy and "foggy" the next day.  So that's my review and a little extra...  Great product!!<br /><br />[...]
