Vegan. Natural. Kosher Pareve. This rajma masala can be compared to a typical spicy bean chili, India-cuisine style. Was very pleased to try one of my favorite Indian dishes as a vegan product from Kitchens of India. Beautiful & amazing over organic brown rice. Rajma means kidney bean. Masala mean spice. Very flavorful. Indian foodies will find this recipe medium or typical, but others may find it on their spicier side. Highly recommended. Made with tomatoes, onions, red kidney beans, sunflower oil, garlic, spices, salt, & ginger. 300 calories and 12g protein per package. Product of India.
