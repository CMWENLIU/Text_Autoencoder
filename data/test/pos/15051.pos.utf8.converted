I heard great things about this cat food by word-of-mouth from several people we know, so we decided to try it out.  Our cats, without exception, LOVE EVO cat food.  We even purchased a small bag of their dry food locally and they loved that too.<br /><br />I must say that we'll be buying this again and with the price of gas these days, Amazon is a great way to order this cat food and other items.  Everything shows up on your porch and no need to search anywhere.<br /><br />I did notice a negative review for this product.  With cats things can be a big hit or a big miss.  If you can buy one can locally to test things out with your feline friends to see how they'll take to it first, it may be best.  Or you can buy a small case and if it doesn't work please donate it to a local shelter as I'm sure they'll welcome the assistance.<br /><br />So far, feeding them EVO 95 percent meat, they still love it and ALWAYS show up at dinnertime two months down the road.  We've noticed that our cats' fur is softer too, possible a result of the higher protein content of this food.
