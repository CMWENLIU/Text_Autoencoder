I bought this product with trepidation because in the past I'd tried other fig preserves that were extremely disappointing - too much sugar, or bad figs, or somebody held their pinky the wrong way. Just bad.<br /><br />I held my breath when I opened up the Harvest Song Gourmet jar and took a spoonful out to taste. Then the heavens opened! Choirs of Angels sang! Tiny bluebirds rested on my shoulders! Okay, not really, but this stuff was the real thing - it tastes *exactly* like Grandma's homemade. Exactly. That she made in her kitchen in New Orleans 40 years ago with figs that Grandpa grew in the backyard.<br /><br />So if you are a fig lover, I highly recommend these preserves - they are to die for. If you've never tried figs or especially fig preserves, you don't know what you're missing!
