There are several things I like about this product, including that these are naturally shed antlers that are collected, cleaned, packaged and then sold without involving killing to get them.  Somebody goes out and collects these and that is probably part of why they are fairly expensive, even on-line...I first found these in our local pet store...but forget about the retail price, (IF you can even find them,) the price at the pet store was twice what I found on-line, and the antlers were not nearly as large.  None of the big chain pet stores carry these, at least not in my area so far. I ordered these through Amazon and was amazed and delighted that they arrived literally the next day.<br /><br />That said, my dogs simply ADORE these things.<br />They keep my new, and very young 100# rescue lab busy literally for hours, but do not "slime" my floors or carpet, (or our bed or couch.)  He loves to set one on my desk as an "offering," which I actually don't mind since they are VERY clean compared to all the more traditional bones, hoofs and chews.<br /><br />Additionally, they double as a great "fetch" toy in the yard.<br /><br />Essentially my guys just chew them down to the nubbin's, but without any damage to my stuff. Highly recommend if you want a clean chew/toy that will keep your dog busy for hours without wrecking the party, and helps with tarter build-up on their teeth in the process.<br /><br />Really a great idea, and a great product.
