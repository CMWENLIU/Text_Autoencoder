Have bought a LOT of Spry gum in the past (1000'S of pieces), but with all the health scares from Chinese made products, I decided that it wasn't worth taking a chance with my health and the health of my family.  Spry gum is made in China (which is why it's cheaper), along with most every other cheaper Xylitol gum on the market today.  On the other hand, XYLICHEW IS MADE IN FINLAND.  That's why it costs more.  Isn't your health worth it?  Why take chances?  With all the scares of people that died from tainted Chinese toothpaste, improper Chinese pharmaceuticals that led to sickness and death, the tainted pet food scare that killed many animals, lead paint on Chinese toys... on and on... to me Xylichew is worth the extra money.  The peppermint flavor is long lasting and tastes good.
