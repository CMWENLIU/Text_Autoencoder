I happened to be shopping at Costco yesterday and picked up their "Kirkland" Brand of Tellicherry peppercorns. The price?...$3.59 for a 14.1 oz. bottle. My wife and I performed a taste test between Costco's brand and India Tree's brand and neither of us could tell the two apart. Given that the Costco brand offers a far greater value for, essentially, the same taste sensation as India Tree, my wife and I will not be purchasing India Tree peppercorns again. FYI, I have no association with Costco other than as a consumer. I hope this helps!
