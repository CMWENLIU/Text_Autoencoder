Bob's Red Mill Organic Oat Bran Cereal can be described in both flavor and texture as somewhat akin to cream of wheat. It is also darker than and tastes richer than Quaker Oat Bran Cereal which, I believe, contains some of the whole oat making it pastier and clumpier. Quaker's oat bran cereal cooks very much the same way that steel cut oats cook which have been ground in a coffee grinder; i.e. very clumpy. Bob's Red Mill Oat Bran cereal clumps a lot less and does not taste pasty. It is a very good cereal and very high in fiber. Furthermore, I eat it twice per day without any unwanted digestive fireworks, whereas the equivalent of oatmeal or steel cut oats would, to say the least, overwhelm. I highly recommend this cereal.
