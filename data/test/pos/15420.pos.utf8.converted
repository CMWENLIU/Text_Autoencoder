<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CDEPD">Rodelle Organic Pure Vanilla Extract, 4-Ounce</a><br /><br />This is the best Organic vanilla I have found. It has a rich taste that really comes through in my baking. After trying Rodelle, I realized how watery-tasting other vanilla extracts can be. And the price is not far off from conventional store brands. I bake on a regular basis and Rodelle is the only vanilla I buy. They also make a killer vanilla sugar that is my favorite thing to put in coffee.
