I use this instead of traditional brown sugar. The flavor is rich and natural. You really need a side-by-side taste comparison and you will never go back to the grocery store for brown sugar.<br /><br />This is one of the main ingredients in my rib rub and barbecue sauce. The most common response to my ribs is, "These are the best ribs I ever tasted!"<br /><br />Use it in other cooking as a direct replacement in recipes.
