Peppermint Altoid mints REALLY do a fine job of making your breath fresh with their extra strong peppermint flavor. For some people these may taste a little too strong, perhaps; but I enjoy them very much.<br /><br />Altoid mints are very low in calories, fat, sodium and more. The main effect, therefore, is simply to make your breath its very freshest. They come in that famous little tin that keeps them fresh until their expiration date.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend Altoids as THE ultimate in breath mints. People who also simply love that strong peppermint taste will delight in these, too.<br /><br />Great job, Altoids!
