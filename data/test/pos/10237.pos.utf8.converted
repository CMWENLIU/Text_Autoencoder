I've been growing 'grass' for our indoor cats for several years. I have tried the other brand that is mostly oat seeds. They like that one well enough. Renee's contains several other grains in addition to the oats. Our cats go NUTS for it; even more than than they do for tuna fish!<br /><br />If your cats are indoors all the time, don't let them eat too much at once when you first give it to them, unless you enjoy cleaning regurgitated cat grass from your sofa and carpet.
