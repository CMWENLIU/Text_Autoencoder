Organic Raw Agave is usually way over priced. Since I use it almost exclusivity as a sweetener in my raw food prep, I found it price-challenging when buying it at my local markets. Then I found this offering on Amazon.com. I get it auto-shipped each month, so I don't have to worry about running out. Now I pay a fraction of the price I used to pay. I did a taste comparison and it tastes exactly the sames as the pricier ones.
