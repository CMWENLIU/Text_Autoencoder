I tried this soup because I am on a very strict diet that does not allow me to eat any food containing gluten, corn, or potatoes. It is very hard to find things that I can have because even most soups contain some kind of starch or flour made from corn, wheat, etc.<br /><br />Other split pea soups I have tried have too much of one flavor, but this one has a perfect blend of vegetables and spices. It has a very thick consistency so you get more of the actual soup instead of mostly water.<br /><br />The ingredients in this split pea soup are:<br /><br />Water, Organic Split Peas, Organic Carrots, Organic Onions, Organic Celery, Organic Peas, Organic Rice Flour, Sea Salt, Organic Spices.<br /><br />It is a good source of protein, Vitamin A, and a VERY good source of fiber. Another good thing is that it's fat free.<br /><br />I am so glad I found this soup because it is healthy, filling, and tastes wonderful. It tastes so good that I would buy it even if I were not on a special diet.
