Brown rice can be, well, heavy. But Texmati has all the fragrance of basmati rice, the fiber of brown rice and it comes in a wonderful clear square plastic jar that is great for filling with beans or popcorn when it is empty. This rice smells like pecans when cooking and tastes great. You can cook it up as pilaf with raisins, almonds and chicken or vegetable broth for a delicious side dish. Try it also by browning it in olive oil with a half cup of orzo per cup of rice and then make pilaf with broth. It is delicious.
