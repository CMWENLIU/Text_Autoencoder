This is a really fun gift to give, and better to get!<br /><br />You get a bunch of childhood favorites that you will enjoy eating as much as you did when you we were a kid. I bought a box to share with my kids the kind of candy I used to eat, they were as excited as I was to eat it!<br /><br />I'd recommend choosing your box more by content since I found the 50's box closest to my childhood fav's, even though I grew up in the 70's!
