I originally saw truffle salt on a menu in a restaurant.  I wanted to try it for myself and - WOW!<br /><br />This product is a wonderful "finishing salt" for eggs, salads even french fried potatoes.<br /><br />It gives a wonderful dimension to a dish and provides that "What did you add that made it so good" aura.  Try this truffle salt and you will be delighted, too!
