I tend not to get too caught up in the hype around celebrity deaths.  Tim Russert's death was big news.  That's a special perk of being part of the machinery that decides for the rest of us what is and what isn't news.  But it was also a story because he really does seem genuinely well liked.<br /><br />I liked the guy.  I didn't know him but I saw him once riding the T in Brookline.  He was talking on the cell phone and had that big friendly smile that people found so disarming.  Seemed like a good guy.  This idea that he asked the tough questions bothers me though.  Maybe he did ask tougher questions than your average news man, but nobody has been tough enough on these brazen gonifs that currently run the country.  They couldn't get away with half of what they do if the news media wasn't at least passively complicit.<br /><br />But I like Tim Russert.  He went from Buffalo to the East Coast, a trajectory I know, and I recognize that temperament he portrayed.  East Coast keenness softened by that charming Midwest salt-of-the-Earth spirit.  And, though I sometimes resent the narcissism of baby-boomers working out their father issues in the public, Tim Russert's devotion to his working class dad appears to come from a place of such wholesomeness and decency that it is hard to be critical.<br /><br />Buffalo is an underrated city, by the way.  Like many an unsung medium-sized city, you have to know where to look, but it has its own kind of hipness.  Buffalo wings really do come from Buffalo, in much the same way that french-fries really don't come from France.  Frank's hot sauce is the real deal, the original formula, and you can get it anywhere.  I can stake my entire fictional on-line reputation on this because I have high level informants in Buffalo who tell me this is true.  Frank and Teresa's hot sauce, in 1964, at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, New York, was the secret ingredient for the first wings.  Yep.  The same one, right there on North and Main by the General Hospital.  They also make a jambalaya with Frank's hot sauce and kielbasa.<br /><br />Good sauce.  Hot enough to spice things up but not to the point where the heat masks the flavor.  You can use it for wings or you can splash it on your eggs in the morning.  Know what I did the other day?  I was at the bottom of the bag of chips, where you get just those tiny fragments and the greasy pulverized chip residue.  I poured everything into a bowl, covered it in blue cheese particles and threw in some Frank's hot sauce.  Microwaved it and ate it with a spoon.  Really uncouth, I'm glad nobody saw it.  But, seriously, not bad.
