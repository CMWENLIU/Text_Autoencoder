I've looked around for soup bowls and similar products that are satisfying, reasonably priced, and not full of preservatives or excess salt.  This seems a good alternative.  It is not as tasty as some products I have had but the ingredients seem more healthy than other alternatives.  I typically use some Parmesan cheese with it, which makes it yummy enough.<br /><br />I gave it five stars for the amalgem of taste, health, and price -- there are better tasting alternatives if you don't care about the heathy aspect.
