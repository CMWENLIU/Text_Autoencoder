This is by far one of the best breakfast blends, I have tried.  The beans chosen are a perfect meld, with a low acidity.  Starbuck's did their job right in selecting beans for their taste rather than supply.  A typical pattern in many coffee house brands is to throw together a low grade more plentiful bean with a few mid to high range beans and then pawn it off as a quality brew at a higher price.  This often results in a coffee blend without taste.  Starbucks, however, did their taste test on this blend and came out with a true winner.<br />The beans are roasted much lighter than your typical Starbucks type beyond french roast, this also helps in creating a coffee that is less acidic.  Yet while lightly roasted the beans have been roasted enough so that the oils will be released when put through a drip maker or coffee press, a problem usually encountered with lighter roast.  Their is a defint natural sweetness in the beans that are enhanced with the use of fat free milk, the lactose sugar of the milk bean the only additional sweetener need.  A full fat milk or cream would mask the complexity of the sutler flavors here and leave you with coffee that is on the taste par with any store brand stale canned bean type.<br />This coffee's blend and flavor would make it great choice for a hearty comforting breakfast of bacon and eggs where the flavor of the foods are enhanced by a milder coffee that leaves the food as the star and not an attention grabbing bitter coffee.
