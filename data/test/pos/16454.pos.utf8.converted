Chiclets were a childhood favorite of mine! We usually only buy sugarless gum but made the mistake of telling my son how much I liked Chiclets while standing next to them in a checkout line. Being a Type 2 diabetic and with each piece having 1g of sugar, I can't really enjoy popping four of them into my mouth all at once anymore but one at a time sure did remind me of how good these are.<br /><br />My son really enjoyed them and he also enjoyed eating them in front of me.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
