This is an excellent product. I had to play with the sensitivity of the trigger a bit before I used it. Once set, it worked very well. Trapped a couple of moles in 24 hours and problem has gone away now.<br /><br />I did not like the manufacturer's instructions. I had to find out how to set it myself. Here is what I did:<br /><br />1. Armed the trapped with the safety clip on.<br />2. Found a straight area on the mole's runway<br />3. Flattened a straight part of the runway a couple of inches wider that trap by stepping on it<br />4. Used a putty knife as wide as the trap jaws and cut two lines perpendicular to the run. I widened the cuts a bit for the jaws to push trough the cut easily<br />5. I pushed the trap jaws in the cuts until the trigger tip just touched the top part of the grass.<br />6. Removed the safety clip<br /><br />You can protect the trap if you are like me and have neighbors with kids and/or dog by covering the trap with a large bucket and a heavy weight on top of it.
