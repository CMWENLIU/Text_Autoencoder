Postum is a wheat/grain coffee substitute.  When I was a child, my parents used to let me drink Postum while they had their coffee.  I still love the taste of it--similar to coffee but unique. I enjoy it in the evening when it's too late for "real" coffee.  I can purchase Postum in my local grocery store.  I purchased the Postum from Amazon for my sister, who has moved to Tennessee where Postum is not available in the grocery store.  She was ecstatic when she received the Postum I purchaed through Amazon.com.
