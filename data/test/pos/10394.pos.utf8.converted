This is an excellent price on a must have item.  This is my third time ordering in the last six months. You get 4 bags of flour at five pounds each.  They recommend refrigerating after opening so I like that it is small bags and I just refrigerate one at at time (in an airtight container).  I've checked around for lower prices on organic flour (bread or otherwise) and it can't be found.  I use this every week to make bread. I do add extra gluten.  Theoretically you don't need to with whole wheat bread flour but I find it rises better if I do.  I bought gluten here on Amazon as well.  I think it was 6 or 8 boxes.  I'm still using it a year later so it was definitely worth the money.<br /><br />I really like Great River.  I recently bought their oraganic all purpose whole wheat flour.  I also love their seven grain bread flour.  I add about a cup of that to every bread and roll and hamburger bun recipe. Gives a nice little texture and taste.  Great River is the only flour I've used in the last year and I make everything from scratch so I've really had the opportunity to test it out.
