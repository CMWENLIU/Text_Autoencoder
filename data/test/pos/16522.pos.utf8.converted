This dog food is absolutely amazing! My two dogs, 40lb. mix and 7lb. papillon, both LOVE it! They've been on this food for nearly 2 years. I get compliments ALL THE TIME on how soft they are, and how shiny their coats are, etc. You feed less, because it's such a high quality food, and therefore have less waste. Who doesn't want that?! I've worked at two different pet stores and I am very familiar with natural/organic/hollistic pet foods, and I've had the best results with this food! It is SO worth the price, because the benefits are SO worth it. For you and your dog! Try it, you won't be sorry!
