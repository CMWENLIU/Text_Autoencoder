I love sesame seeds and I'm always looking for a satisfying afternoon snack. I tried the Sezme Sesame Snaps and they're fine, but they taste sugary. I prefer the nice honey flavor of these. I keep them at work and in the car for any time I get hungry or need to boost my energy before a workout. I've had the same experience as some others where sometimes they stick together, but other than that they've  been perfect for me.
