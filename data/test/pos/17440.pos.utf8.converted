Frontier Five Spice Powder is a value, also, convenient with a satisfying taste. Quite complimentary too many dishes, although it has a distinct taste, it is not over powering. A few ways to use five spice powder is, simply, sprinkle it on jasmine rice or Thai rice noodles, put in a favorite sweet potatoe dish and/or add to stir frys. It adds tasty, balancing flavors to any dish. I rely on Frontier for quality fresh spices and they did well with their Chinese Five Spice Powder.
