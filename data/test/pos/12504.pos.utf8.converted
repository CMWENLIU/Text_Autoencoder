These teas are so beautiful when they flower!  I eas so impressed!  They would make a great gift!  I like the fact that you can Re-steep these teas up to 3 times!  the second steep was almost as fragrant and flavorful as the first time and the third time I let it steep over nite and it was just as refreshing but a little weaker.  I really liked these teas and they impress all my guests!  I would suggest using a glass tea pot made for flowering teas to brew the balls in though cause they could get bitter using a glass tea mug. i give this product an A+++++
