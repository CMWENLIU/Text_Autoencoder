There are two types of folks in this world - those who love licorice and those who hate it. I have never met anyone who is indifferent toward licorice. When you ask someone, do you like licorice, the response is almost always "I hate..." or "I love..." and never a "eh - I don't care."<br /><br />Amazing detail in these tiny Scotties - almost looks like the Monopoly playing piece in edible form. These nice bite-size bits are a bit easier on the jaw, since you're not ripping a bite from a thick licorice twist or whip.  Not only are they convenient, they are adorable and a fun item to have in a covered candy dish for company!
