I make trays and trays of cupcakes and after a while you become an expert on packet mixes.  I know the kids only eat the frosting but you still need to have a base! Some mixes are so light and fluffy that they have no texture. But these have more substance to them.  People genuinely think they are home made.  They are not too sweet,  you can sink your teeth into them,  chewier than the Duncan Hines or Betty Crocker and I love them. Also,  they always rise as they should,  they are consistently good.  If you are scared of baking,  try them, they have clear instructions and never fail.  So now the adults love the cupcakes too!
