I no longer have a baby, but I do have a preschooler who avoids eating fruits and veggies. Therefore, I look for ways to "hide" them in other foods. That's where purees come in very handy. It's hard for me to find a variety of organic produce locally, so I was glad to see this Baby Gourmet online.<br /><br />Here's what I made this morning (good for the whole family!):<br /><br />Pear and Garden Greens Protein Pancakes<br /><br />1 1/2 cups of Aunt Jemima whole wheat pancake mix<br />1 1/2 cups milk<br />1 Baby Gourmet pouch<br />1 scoop vanilla protein powder<br />1 tbsp vegetable oil<br />1 egg<br /><br />Mix 'em up, and make your pancakes (or waffles). I made the same recipe with canned pumpkin the other day and it came out great.<br /><br />The puree makes the pancakes thicker (which is why I added a little extra milk, too), and in this case, offers just a very light, nice pear flavor. Next time, I think I'll try adding two pouches-- I think it could take it.<br /><br />I think it's very handy to have small portions of purees around for just this purpose-- you can sneak them into lots of meals so your kids don't even realize they've just eaten fruits and veggies.
