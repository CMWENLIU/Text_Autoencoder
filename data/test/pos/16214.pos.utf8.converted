Firstly, this product doesn't taste bad at all.  The berry flavor actually just comes from the dried, powdered berries that are in it, so don't expect to get punched in the face with Kool-Aid flavoring.<br /><br />Honestly, who cares about the taste of something should take you less than 15 seconds to drink?  If you'd rather choke down ten servings of vegetables each day, be my guest.  The negative reviews here remind me of the ones you see on the pages for quality liquid fish oil.  People give it negative reviews because of the taste when I get no fishy taste at all and IT TAKES LESS THAN A SECOND TO SWALLOW.  Come on!<br /><br />This stuff tastes just fine, seems to be rather good quality, has a GREAT price tag and I get a nice energy boost from it.  I also have yet to get sick this winter, so I think I'll be ordering this product for quite awhile.
