Love this stuff, very easy to work with and reasonably priced. The Wilton stuff is like rubber and hard to roll out thin enough. I had no trouble with this. It also was not too sticky which was the problem I ran into when I used the Duff stuff. So far this is the best fondant I have used. It really doesn't dry out so if you want your pieces to stiffen up quickly or become completely hard you will need to mix in gumtex or gumpaste to accomplish that. I love this stuff. The black color was truely jet black too.
