At about 3 years of age, our cat would have bladder infections several times a year (straining at the litter, staying there for 5 min+ at a time, only a little urine and it was blood-tinged).  We had been feeding her only on indoor cat dry food.  After many trips to the vet and rounds of antibiotics, I read that some cats with this problem do better on wet food - something to do with not drinking enough water or just not getting enough fluids in general.  For the past 4 years, she has not had one bladder infection!  Friskies Chicken Dinner in Gravy Special Diet is the only one she likes the taste of.
