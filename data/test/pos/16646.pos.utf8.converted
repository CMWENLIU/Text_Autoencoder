I am addicted to this tea. Maybe because as an ex Starbucks employee I use to make, serve and drink it so much. I have tried many other teas which are suppose to be better then Tazo Zen.( Numi, Trader Joe's etc. ) and I still go back to Tazo Zen. If you go to Starbucks on a regular basis to purchase their iced green tea and want to save some money...Starbucks uses this exact tea. A box of 20 bags cost around $4.00. The instructions state to use two bags for every 8 oz. of iced tea. At Starbucks they do not follow this. To cut costs they use one tea bag for every 8 oz. of water then they double the steeping time indicated on the box. I make well over a gallon of tea out of each box that I buy. And yes...it tastes exactly like the Starbucks ones. If you like it sweet DONT add honey or powdered sugar because it will have a totally different taste then Starbucks...instead just buy a bottle of the Starbucks classic syrup available at all Starbucks. They go for about $7.00. They are usually out of pumps but Ebay has plenty of Starbucks pumps. Enjoy!
