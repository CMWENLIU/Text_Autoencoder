I decided to try this dog food because of many positive reviews I read, and it is a good price for such high-quality ingredients.  This is a better value than many other top-tier dog foods.<br /><br />My dog (a 9-month-old German Shepherd) loves this food.  I transitioned her from the more expensive Blue Buffalo Wilderness formula, and she's doing very well on TOTW after a month.  Her poops are small and easy to clean up.  Her coat is shiny and she has no doggie odor.  She also doesn't scratch much at all.  TOTW is good for allergy-prone dogs because it is grain-free.<br /><br />One benefit of TOTW is that your dog eats less of it per day than other dog foods, thus saving money, because the food is high in protein.  However, it's also rather rich, so be careful when changing to this food to prevent diarrhea.<br /><br />I highly recommend TOTW because it's for all life stages, has proper ingredients for a dog's diet, and is a good value for the price!
