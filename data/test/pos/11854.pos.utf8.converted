The DeBeukelaer family has been making Belgium biscuits in The United States since 1860.<br /><br />Pirouline is the only national brand of rolled wafers actually made in America. One bite and you'll understand why these delicious and light snacks can be very addicting.<br /><br />The biscuit layer is light and flaky and the hazelnut chocolate inside makes for delicious snacking.<br /><br />They come in a tall, slender, 3.25 ounce tin and the tins are great for storing pasta or writing instruments afterwords.Highly recommended.
