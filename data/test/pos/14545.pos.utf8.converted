It's great in everything but coffee, & now I know why. If you use it in relatively bland food, you need to use VERY little, so all you get is the sweetness. If you use it in something with a stronger flavor (like coffee), it takes more of the product to overcome any bitterness & you start getting into the area where the stevia starts contributing a bitterness of its own.  So I use Ideal in coffee only. But this liquid fine in everything else I've tried it in, and it lasts FOREVER. So I think I'll probably keep getting both. I still give it 5 stars.
