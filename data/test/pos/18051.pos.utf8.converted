Besides tasting delicious when mixed with cold milk (and it mixes better now than it did a few decades ago), it is important to remember that the body resists disease better when it has a slightly alkaline pH than an acid pH. Eating meats, sweets, and junk food will get you an acid pH. A couple of glasses of this daily will help, but not guarantee, you keep a healthy body acid/alkaline balance. Greatly reduces the chance you will get or suffer long from canker sores in the mouth resulting from over-acidity. This drink is the only substance I have ever found which speeds their healing. And it's just plain enjoyable to drink.
