I have not tried all of the Tassimo T-Discs but the ones I have used are awesome. The Tassimo machine could not be easier to operate. I got it right on the first try and no one has ever accused me of being a technical genie. Great tasting coffee in a minute or so. I have not found its equal ~ and I have tried most everything.  The hot chocolate is superb; cappuccino is excellent; caffe latte is a winner; and the tea refreshing. Do not hesitate to buy.
