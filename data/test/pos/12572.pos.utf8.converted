Ginger chews are such an amazing thing. Ginger helps nausea of all sorts (including those caused by chemo and motion sickness), heartburn and I have heard even menstrual cramps and other ailments. While fresh ginger can be very strong, these are slightly calmer, with a bit of sweetness. They are portable and come individually wrapped which are great for travelling. I love ginger chews and The Ginger People!!!
