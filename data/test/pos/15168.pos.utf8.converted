After my first drink I was hooked on Orgain creamy chocolate fudge.<br />I had been looking for an organic protein shake and came upon this brand by accident. The 10 servings of fruits and vegetables is bonus. I wish it was lactose free. Though I handle it better that pure milk.<br />It taste like regular chocolate milk and is heavenly when chilled. I find it an excellent meal replacement but I think one a day is sufficient due to it being very rich.<br />It comes in a tetra pak and it feels different than drinking from a soda can so I prefer to pour the drink into a glass.<br />Orgain is pricey $3.49 Bartells, $3.30 Amazon and $2.99 Whole foods. It is cheaper than a sandwich for lunch.<br />For a chocolate lover like me Orgain gives me my daily chocolate fix.
