Growing up, my mom always made oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, but at some point, the recipe was lost, and I was never able to replicate them with other recipes I found.  Betty Crocker's oatmeal cookie mix replicates them perfectly, and the secret ingredient in this mix is CINNAMON.  BC's Oatmeal Chocolate Chip mix doesn't have cinnamon in it, so I use this Oatmeal cookie mix instead and add 3/4 cup chocolate chips to it.  They are so good!  My husband, siblings, and parents all devour these cookies.  Amazon's price is the best, better than my local grocery store.<br /><br />** UPDATE **  I thought I'd try making these cookies as bar cookies, rather than scooping and dropping onto a cookie sheet.  I used an 8x8 square Pyrex pan, kept the temperature the same, but baked for 23-25 minutes.  I personally didn't think they were done, too much still like cookie dough in the middle, but my husband liked them and ate the entire pan, without getting sick, I might add.  This is something I just thought those of you might want to know, in case you were thinking of making these as bar cookies.  I'll use a 9x13 pan next time, I think they'd come out great.
