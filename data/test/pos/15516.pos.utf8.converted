My fiance pointed out to me the many downsides to regular canned tuna, from high mercury to one lb of by-catch of other fish and sea turtles for every lb of tuna caught the typical, "sea chicken" commercial way (note, 1:1 !). Even though dolphins have been pretty much eliminated as by-catch in US sold tuna, much other sea life has not. The only alternative to get much lower mercury and very low by-catch is by troll or pole catching. American Tuna and Wild Planet apply these techniques (see American's www site for interesting videos of the work intensive catching process by pole). I tried both and even though I liked Wild Planet Tuna over "regular" canned tuna, American Tuna is even better and especially fresher tasting! Its so good it was hard to believe it came out of a can when we first tried. Other benefits of American over Wild Planet is the even lower, ~ 1/2 mercury level compared to Wild Planet, and that it is not just caught in the US but also canned here, whereas Wild Planet apparently ships their US caught tuna to Vietnam for canning and then ships it back!? There is a significant price difference but we have decided to eat a bit less tuna but when we do to get the best. BTW, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Sustainable Seafood Guide is an excellent resource if you are interested in the healthiest and most sustainable seafood. It also exists as smartphone app.
