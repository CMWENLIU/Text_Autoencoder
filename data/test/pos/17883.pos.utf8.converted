I don't often like "chocolate coffee", because I usually don't think the flavor or aroma really tastes or smells anything like chocolate.  This is the best I've tried, because it really does.  It is significantly better than other expensive brands I've tried in the past.  As the previous reviewer noted the kitchen smells great while it's brewing and it is very smooth.  Even my husband, who doesn't normally drink coffee, has some when I brew this.
