In my search for a healthful food my cats really love and will thrive on, I've tried giving them many different premium brands of cat foods...grain free, and using only animal proteins (no plant proteins like soy products). My cats have sampled brands that include vegetables and sometimes rice, but no other grains in the recipe. I've done taste test trials on them comparing other brands with Fussy Cat.  My cats (adults as well as weaned kittens) absolutely prefer the Fussy Cat Chicken & Tuna recipe. In comparison to the other Fussy Cat flavors, the Chicken & Tuna takes top honors with my cats.<br /><br />After doing research on cat (and dog) diets, I agree with the results of recent studies that conclude that cats (and dogs) are biologically evolved dedicated carnivores who require animal based proteins.  Therefore I avoid, as much as possible, cat (and dog) foods that use plant based proteins, grains, and plant based fillers.  Plant proteins do not contain all the essential amino acids that carnivores like cats (and dogs) require. Additionally, plant proteins are difficult for cats (and dogs) to digest. Over time the difficulty and stress on the animal's digestive system can result in health issues and a shorter life span.<br /><br />Bearing in mind that animal protein quality is diminished with high temperature cooking (used in preparing dry kibble and most canned pet foods), I supplement my cats' Fussy Cat meals with some cooked organic egg yolk, and sometimes with an added tablespoon of raw organic beef hamburger (sold at Costco in Novato, CA).  To ensure their fur remains soft and shiny, I always add to their food the contents of a 1000mg capsule of Pure Alaska Omega brand 100% Natural Omega-3 Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil.  Just puncture the capsule and squeeze the contents onto their food and stir thoroughly.<br /><br />I take my animals to a holisitic veterinarian (Pamela Bouchard, DVM of Tender Care Veterinary Hospital, San Rafael, CA), who strongly believes that diet is an essential foundation for maintaining optimum health and longevity in animals. With each bi-annual check-up, we review the diet of each of my pets. Depending on the results of the always thorough exam (including blood work, etc.), my veterinarian may recommend certain supplements and holistic remedies tailored to meet each pet's requirements.<br /><br />Now if I could find a human medical doctor who would do the same for me with as much care and compassion, I'd be a happy cat.
