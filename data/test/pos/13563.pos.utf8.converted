This is, quite simply, the best hot cocoa I've ever tasted.  Being a self-admitted chocoholic, I've tasted a LOT of hot cocoa.  I even prefer Nestle's Double Chocolate Meltdown to pricier choices like Godiva or Ghirardelli.  This cocoa is smoother and more chocolaty than anything else I've found out there.  I highly recommend it.
