I bought Nutiva Protein Powder after reading up on the benefits of hemp.  I usually put this in green smoothies and have found that it has a very smooth texture and virtually no taste.  I like the fact that it has over 50% of your daily fiber and contains the full range of amino acids.  I highly recommend buying this, however, wait until Amazon has the 2 packs of this back in stock as it's a much better value.
