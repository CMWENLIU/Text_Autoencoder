i am addicted to this marinade - to the point of ordering in bulk. perfect blend of spices and allows you to determine how hot you want it to be based on how long you marinate and the amount of marinade left on the meat. it's made my nose run but in a good way. i go out of my way to get this particular brand. grocery store brands are poor representations. the only alternative is homemade or busha browns. fantastic with mango salsa, fresh tomatoes and rice and peas.
