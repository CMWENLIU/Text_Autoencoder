If you have a Keurig brewer you need to try this coffee.  I just received the Martinson "Dark Roast" and I ordered a box of the "Brown Gold" (single origin coffee) as well.  I don't know if it's just the RealCup (new K-Cup filter) technology, or the Martinson coffee, but I love this stuff.  This is the first "K-Cup" I've used that doesn't taste watery.  Don't get me wrong, I love my Keurig, but the coffee always seemed to be missing something.  According to Martinson, the RealCup uses a new filter that allows essential oils to come through (like a french press) and it provides better mouthfeel and taste.  I can't wait for my next shipment.  As a bonus, some of them are available on subscribe and save.
