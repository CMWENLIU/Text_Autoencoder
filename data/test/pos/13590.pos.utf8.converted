MTG has the best concentrates in my opinion.  The Demi-glace gold is a combination of veal and beef.  I wouldn't use this on chicken but it's great for any red meat or pork.<br /><br />To my fellow reviewer who prefers W&S stock; I just went to the kithen and tasted W&S Veal Stock concentrate and than MTG Demi-glace gold.  In my side-by-side comparison, the MTG concentrate tasted much better and is less expensive.  The W&S stock has much more sodium.  I can always add salt but I can't take it out.<br /><br />Refrigerated, this concentrate lasts at least 6 months.  It is not necessary to freeze it unless you won't use it that quickly.  If you have any doubts about the quality, get the 1.5 ounce size which can be found at better grocery stores for a few dollars.
