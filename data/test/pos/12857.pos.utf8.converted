PROS:<br />- As of 12/28/10 the price is $[...] for 25 lbs, which is $[...] per lb, and a very good deal compared to other products here on Amazon (specifically, Bob's Red Mill Quinoa)<br />- Item was shipped promptly and there were no holes in the bag.<br />- The quinoa was pre-washed: there was no bitterness to speak of.<br />- The quinoa was free of debris, particles, etc.<br />- Directions for cooking were spot on (I didn't add the salt, but that's just my preference)<br /><br />CONS:<br />- This is not a knock on the product, but more of an observation on quinoa itself: The quinoa texture is something I am not used to, and I would compare it to that of tapioca. If you are someone who has trouble with certain textures of foods, I would recommend buying a smaller-sized bag of quinoa to make sure the texture is bothersome.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /> - A fantastic product! As someone who is a very involved with weight training, this is going to fit my dietary needs perfectly.
