I had researched my purchase before deciding to order from this vendor.  I ordered 20 stalks of "Lucky Bamboo" and plant food on Sunday evening.  When I checked my email on Monday morning, I had a message giving me the shipping status of my order as well as a very well written series of suggestions on how to plant and care for the plants.  The information matched every source I had previously read.<br /><br />The plants arrived on time.  They were packaged very well.  The plants are amazing.  They have great color, healthy leaves and very abundant roots.  Smelling of the stalks at the roots, there is a very earthy "green" smell, that I'd read is one of the best indicators of health.  The stalks are firm, and are all as long or longer than the inches promised in the ad.<br /><br />I WILL buy any other "Lucky Bamboo" from Kun in the future.
