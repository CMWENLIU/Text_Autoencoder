I religiously ordered my caramel macchiato every day around 3:52p. But now that I'm a mother and work from home the Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Flavored Coffee are my practical substitution because: 1) I don't have the extra time to go to Starbucks and 2) a line item for espresso drinks is not in my budget -along with my heels and fun outfits have been replaced by diapers and more diapers.  BUT what gets me through that sorrow is my new love for Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Flavored Coffee. These ready brew sticks conveniently fit my bill - just as delicious as my caramel macchiato (especially when I add my own steam milk and caramel syrup to the vanilla or caramel flavored coffee).  If it weren't for these beverage sticks, I'd be dragging my poor child to Starbucks at 3:52p every day regardless if it's her nap time or not.  They are just THAT delicious!
