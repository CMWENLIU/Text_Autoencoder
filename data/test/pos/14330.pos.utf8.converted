I will admit that I am an avid white chocolate fan.  I cannot get anough of the stuff, although I love chocolate in general, sometimes white chocolate just taste better to me.  I will admit however that most white chocolate (even gourmet white chocolate like Godiva) is usually plasticy in texture.  The next best white chocolate I would say that is not organic are the Lindor white chocolate truffles.  Other than that, it is just tough to find a good high quality white choclate.<br /><br />  Even if you hate white chocolate, you may just like "Green and Black's" white choclate.  It has actual texture to it, but is still smooth and creamy in your mouth.  It is just too good to describe, you have to try it for yourself!<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy
