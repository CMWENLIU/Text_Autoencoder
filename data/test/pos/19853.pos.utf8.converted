I am not Inidan, so this is not a "professional" opinion. I am away from home for most meals. I was looking for something easy to make at the work site and a change to the "usual". Just open the pouch, squeeze into a microwavable dish and a minute later you have a hot vegetarian meal with plenty of flavor. I like all of the Kitchen of Inida products I have tried so far. And if you are storing up some food for emergencies like a hurricane, these store easily for later use.
