This stuff is GREAT and a big hit in our recording studio. All the musicians ooh and ahh over the Yogi teas, and this is the favorite. Our recording engineer sips Kava tea to melt away the stress of any session. I use it to help keep my stress from running two companies at bay (combined with a daily walk, it helps eliminate my stress induced back problems). It's so tasty, we drink it several times a day.<br /><br />Someone mentioned that boiling water destroys the active ingredient - we use hot water spigots that are not nearly that hot, and I've never noticed a lowered potency.
