We have used this product for several years and it is most effective for reducing the adult flea population.  If you cannot use sprays or are concerned about using sprays, this product is the next best items to use.  The pack comes with three sticky pads, but I would order two packs, the first time it's used the sticky pad will fill up fast.  You will need the flea trap holder with a small light; also available from Victor.
