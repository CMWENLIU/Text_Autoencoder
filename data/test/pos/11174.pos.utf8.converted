I first purchased this food because I really try to avoid buying cat food products that have a lot of carbohydrate filler or use low grade animal byproducts and it seems the ingredients of the food are really healthy.  I was pleasantly surprised by the extent to which my cats LOVE this food. If I leave an unopened bag around, they will even try to eat through the bag to get at it. They are indoor cats, but this food really seems to agree with them. My cats don't really get hairballs anymore, their coats are shiny, and they seem to have more energy (are more playful) since I switched to this food. For whatever reason, they like this duck flavor (green bag) of food better than the blue bag formula, when given the choice.
