I've been a fan of Swiss Knight fondue for years, but have only been able to find it at home in Vermont, not where I live now.  It is so delightful to be able to order this treat anytime!  BTW, I agree with the suggestion to heat the fondue before putting in fondue pot--microwave works fine, so does melting in the top half of a double boiler.
