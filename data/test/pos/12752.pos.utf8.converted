Maybe these tablets work better for some people than for others. I've read some opinions online from people who said they didn't work for them, but they work just fine for me.  Only on foods that are sour or tart, though; these tablets really do make them sweet!  After coating my tongue with the pill the first time, I ate a lemon and it tasted like lemon candy.<br /><br />So far, I've found they work very well with whole lemons, lemon juice mixed with water, granny smith apples, yellow grapefruit, and salad with a simple vinegar and oil dressing (makes the dressing sweet without adding sugar).  They're okay with limes - makes them palatable but not quite as delicious as the lemons.  Red grapefruit just becomes too sweet, though; I didn't like the effect with that fruit at all.  With bland foods the tablets didn't make a difference.  They only seem to work on sour or tart foods.  But hey, if you're on a low-carb diet and want to minimize or avoid artificial sweeteners, this is one way to do it.<br /><br />Also, you really can cut these big tablets in half and just use half at a time.  That's what I've been doing and it's been working just well.  Oh, and as for the "cardboard" taste, yeah, the tablets aren't tasty.  Though I didn't get nauseous or anything from it, either.  It's just a bland taste, somewhat like cardboard, but what really matters is how it makes sour food taste afterward.  I personally have no problem taking them.
