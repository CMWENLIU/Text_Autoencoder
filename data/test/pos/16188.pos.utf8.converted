This is a great product. The golden flax is slightly better tasting than the brown. Its good enough to put in muffins and (for us) toppings such as apple bake where you can taste it. We actually do consume enough to justify buying it buy the box. We also consume it in shakes but its best when baked- works great in cornbread too. We also get stone ground flours and cornmeals, and these three make up a lot of value in this department. Flax oil of course is very high in short chain Omega 3's. Fish oils are better, but if you have the other nutrients and enzymes in your body you can make the long ones from the ones in flax- hence this product fulfills this need very well (flax is very concentrated in short chain 3's). Did I mention it actually tastes great in baked goods? Bob's Red mill is a quality product.
