We have this Pancake and Waffle mix and we prepare it with Rice milk as my daughter is allergic to dairy AND Soy. It is DELICIOUS. We make Mickey Mouse shaped waffles together, She eats an entire waffle herself. I eat them too because they are SO Delicious and it is easier than making seperate waffle mixes. Plus I think they taste BETTER than regular waffles. Very light and fluffy. We are just finishing our first box (which makes 9 waffles) and I am going to order a case from Amazon because the price is excellent. I paid almost $7 for one box at a local health foods store. I haven't made them into pancakes yet, because we have a waffle iron and it's just simple. Each 1 cup of mix makes 3 waffles. We each eat one and then I put the remaining prepared mix in the fridge and it keeps until the next day or two days later to make another waffle for her. Wonderful product and I can't thank them enough. Check out their website and save the bottom of your boxes. We have Chocolate Cake Mix and frosting to try next!
