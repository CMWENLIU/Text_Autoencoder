I first purchased this candy at a truck stop-rest area in Italy and loved it. I bought a package called Capri and it had lemon and orange flavored hard candies. They are similar to jolly rancher but more sophisticated in flavor and texture.<br />This version - Sorrento - was exactly the same as I purchased in Italy and with an additional flavor: tangerine.<br />I love them and so do my daughters.
