I bought a whole ham because the good review by an Amazon reviewer on some other brand and because the Amazon's descrition that it is an award winning ham.<br /><br />The ham has excellent color, aroma and taste (on the salty side, as expected for dry cured southern ham).  My wife and I are very pleased with it.
