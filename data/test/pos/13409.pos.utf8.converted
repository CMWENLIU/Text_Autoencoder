I have just recently begun using VCO for nearly all of my cooking.  After purchasing two books on the benefits of coconut oil, I have purchased several different brands of oil.  The Nutiva Organic EVCO is by far a superior oil with a delightful flavor.  The price from Amazon if you are a Prime member is the best I have found for this quality of oil.<br /><br />I began eating the oil mixed in about 1/2 cup of cottage cheese because I read on a forum that cottage cheese has properties which help the body assimilate the oil.  Since then I have expanded to many other uses.  I use the oil to sautee garlic, onions, peppers, etc for all of my soups and stir frys.  I spread it on toast and add it to my corn bread.<br /><br />In just the first week of eating coconut oil regularly I noticed that my chronic aches in my joints and muscles subsided.  My skin is smoother and blemishes began to disappear.  I began using it as a topical ointment on my hands, feet and face along with knees and elbows.  It is a much better skin conditioner than almost anything else I have used.<br /><br />I found that it also works great as a conditioner for all of my wooden cooking utensils and I rub it into my cutting boards to condition them.  It is far superior to mineral oil!<br /><br />I have introduced the oil into my husband's diet also.  He has been a Type II diabetic for about 15 years and just turned 77.  He is beginning to notice positive benefits also.  He particularly has noticed more mental acuity.  He adds the oil to his morning cereal and spreads it on his toast and really enjoys the flavor.<br /><br />I am so happy to have found this wonderful Nutiva oil and appreciate its many benefits.  I find it kind of addictive.  I now look forward to adding the oil to more and more foods and it seems to make nearly everything, including eggs, soups, stews, casseroles, muffins and breads more delicious.  I highly recommend the Nutiva brand of Organic EVCO for a huge variety of uses.  To those who think it has too much coconut flavor - well, I guess you can't please everyone.  Try it and decide for yourself.  The health benefits are worth it!  This oil has given me a new energy and improved my health so positively that I would recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />The only downside I can mention is the plastic container.  It would be better if it were packaged in glass, but hopefully all those anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral properties of the oil will negate the use of a plastic container ;-)
