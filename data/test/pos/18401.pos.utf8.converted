Really makes a classic easy.  I always keep a couple of boxes in the pantry.  Much better than the Fantastic Foods version, which my family won't touch.  Cheaper at the store when you factor in the shipping, (though I can see some of you have trouble finding it).  Add lots of tomato, cucumber, slivered red onion, flat-leaf parsley.  Yum.  Sometimes I add grilled chicken and it's a one dish meal!  The box, with additions, can easily feed a family of 4, so it's a really cheap meal, to boot.<br /><br />Oh, and if you're a fiber freak, like I am, take note that it has 5 grams per serving.  That's before you add all those veggies.
