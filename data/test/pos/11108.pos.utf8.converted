Oh my gosh, seeds arrived in just a couple days after ordering!  I teach agriculture in the school system and these are absolutely perfect for my needs.  We grow and sell these pots of herbs each year and it's always a success.  For the price you can't beat it.  Easy to grow and you always have fresh gourmet spices to add to your dishes.  Highly recommended.
