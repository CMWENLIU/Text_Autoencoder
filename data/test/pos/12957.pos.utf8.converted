I have been searching for a reasonably priced arborio rice. Locally my choices were only imported Italian versions. They are terrific but pricey at over $3.00 a pound (US).<br /><br />I took a chance on ordering this product for a few reasons. One, the price delivered to my home was approx. $1.44 per pound, a significant savings. Second, I knew buying through Amazon was fairly risk-free. Finally, the idea of domestic rice was not one that bothered me, as long as it behaved the same in the skillet.<br /><br />The product arrived in a timely manner, before the estimated arrival date. It was packed well and was clean. I would use this vendor again and buy this product again as well.
