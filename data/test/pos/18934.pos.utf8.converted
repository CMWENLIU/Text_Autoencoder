This is the cookie I always wanted: oreo flavor without that weird "creme" filling, crispy on the outside, moist and slightly chewy on the inside. Perfect.<br /><br />They're so decadent, even my cookieholic self is sated with only two.<br /><br />I bought my bag at a store, so maybe I got a fresher batch than some of the other reviewers. I found nothing to complain about here texturally. This is not "pretty good for gluten-free", this is fan-freakin-tastic.  Finding these delights has made my life just a little bit better. Seriously.
