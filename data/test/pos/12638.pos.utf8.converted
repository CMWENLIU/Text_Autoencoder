These thin breadsticks are uniquely packaged. When you open the box there is a sealed cellophane bag inside. Inside the cellophane bag are six or seven sealed individual serving sized bags of breadsticks (there are 7 or 8 thin breadsticks in each serving). These are fresh and crispy. They go great with cheese, dips, soup or whatever you like. I highly recommend them!
