My husband was told that he had h-pylori last year. I have to mention he also suffers from acid reflux and ibs. After a antibiotic treatment that consisted of 4500 mgs a day for 2 weeks the stubborn h-pylori was not affected and the burning from his throat to his bowels was still very present. I researched herbal remedies and found that this honey was a cure for most of what he suffered from. I said what do we have to lose. The antibiotics made him so sick he was not willing to go another round to hope they would get rid of it. So we ordered this honey and started the slow process of healing. I also have to mention that he did have a severe case of infection that had been prolonged over several years. The honey started to work after the first couple jars or about 2 tbls a day. Needless to say today after 3 months he is h-pylori free and he continues to take it for his acid reflux. It does everything it says. He takes it regularly and I would not be without it ever. It has made the difference in his and my life to be able to be pain free for the first time in years. Make sure you get 16 plus to get the full benefits. You wont be sorry.<br />Carol from Kentucky
