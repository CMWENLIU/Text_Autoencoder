What a great product. A friend got me hooked on this about 14 years ago. She used it to make the gravy in her shepards pie. I have been using it ever since. What a wonder flavor this gives to the pie. My family just loves it. They will make up a small batch themselves with mashed potatoes. This can be found at specialty shops around the US in British shoppes as well. Or you can order it online. Directions are on the cannister. Try it in sheppards pie!!
