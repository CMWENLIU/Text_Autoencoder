Ok, so I bought these on a whim, not wanting to pay nearly the same price for a 5lb bag of Haribo. Imagine my surprise when they turned out to be worth the switch. I've been a long-time Haribo fanatic. These gummies, however, while not as hard in texture as Haribo, more than make up for that in flavor.<br /><br />I normally space my gummy snacking, but could not keep my hands off these. My kids literally inhaled them by the handful. Even  my husband was hooked. After reading the label, I felt even better about eating them. They're made with mostly fruit and veggie additives. No HFCS!! Only caveat was the light yellow bears. They're banana flavored, but a little weird at first. The more you eat the more you taste the flavor.<br /><br />Overall, these gummies have made this Haribo eater a surefire convert. As a matter of fact, I'm on my way to buy more. A warning to the wise: One shipment will not last more than a couple days to one week max. Not saying there's not enough, but these are very addictive. Happy snacking!<br /><br />Addendum as of 9/5/09: The banana gummies are even better than before and even a little chewier. I also love the new packaging which actually lists the flavors. I've since tried to go back to Haribo and other brands, but to no avail. These gummies are still my fave! Cheers!
