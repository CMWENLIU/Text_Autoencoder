Just to clear up any confusion, contrary to the previous comment posted at the end of July 2009, there is simply a total of 288 sticks of gum (i.e., equivilant to 144 "cups of coffee") contained in this two-box pack of Jolt Gum.<br /><br />Put another way, there are 12 pieces of gum per blister pack, twelve blister packs per box, and with 2 boxes provided . . . you will end up with a total of 288 pieces of gum. Once again, it takes two (2) pieces of gum to equal one (1) "cup of coffee"; thus, this purchase is equivalent to 144 cups of coffee.<br /><br />Amazon's price is very good considering you may purchase it directly from joltgum . com for seventeen dollars per SINGLE box.<br /><br />The only thing I'd like to point out is that the precise content of caffeine in each stick of gum is 40mg.  Thus, each two-stick serving which they call the equivalent of "one cup of coffee" is really equal to only 80mg of caffeine.  Yes, I do realize that the reason they don't fully disclose the caffeine content, unless you really dig that is, is because they also have Ginseng & Guarana in the gum which they claim is makes up the "energy equivalent" between the caffeine contained in the gum and the typical caffeine-only value of a typical coffee.<br /><br />Just to put it in comparison, a typical shot of espresso (44-60 mL [1.5-2 U.S. fl oz]) contains 100mg of caffeine.<br /><br />Regardless of my slight issue with the somewhat lack of transparency on the product's labeling regarding caffeine content, I still would HIGHLY recommend this gum!!
