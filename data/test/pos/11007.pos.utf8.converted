I purchased this La Piana Balsamic Vinegar for a fabulous French foodie-friend with a fiendish obsession for balsamic vinegar.  Now, I should tell you that, having grown up in Provence, my friend has impeccable taste and an extremely refined palette.  Since I have never tasted this brand of balsamic vinegar, I was a little nervous to order it.<br /><br />No worries.<br /><br />My friend is crazy about La Piana.  She tells me she is using it on everything - even ice cream.  She has declared this the best vinegar she has ever tasted.<br /><br />Note, The Balsamic Vinegar Cookbook by Meesha Halm is a great cookbook that offers tons of recipes.  I purchased this for my friend as well and she raves about it.  Here's a link:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0002251337
