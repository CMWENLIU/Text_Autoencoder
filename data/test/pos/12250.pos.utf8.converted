Have often been exhorted to use organic coconut oil to help my digestive disorder, but have found it a bit difficult to tolerate. However, this organic creamed coconut mixed with the organic coconut oil makes for a much more palatable supplement. It is only a tiny bit "gritty", if one can call it that, but not at all off-putting. I haven't tried it in other ways, but was thinking of making a frozen yogurt, mixing this product with plain or vanilla yogurt, and using an ice cream/frozen yogurt maker.
