It mystifies me as to why grocery store managers in much of the US won't order this product. A local Safeway stocked them one year, and it was practically a floor fight to get them. People drove from store to store just to buy Mallomars. Given all the junk they stock that never sells, why the prejudice against making money? I'm grateful that we can buy them on-line, but BEWARE THE POSTAGE CHARGE (in fine print in the upper right). Even with it, it works out to about 65 cents/cookie, an okay price for one of the greatest taste treats of all time. BTW, mine have always arrived within a week or so, and very fresh. In fact, I think I'll go have one right now.<br />  ((one ....who am I kidding))
