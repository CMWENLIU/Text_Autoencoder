I am a frequent purchaser of the Plato Salmon Treats which my dogs (as well as neighbors' dogs) love, but the salmon treats are very fishy on the fingers and can't be put in my pocket.  The Duck Strips are chewy and not smelly, so I don't have to wash my hands each time I handle them and I can keep a few in my pocket for an unexpected reward.  Of course, all the dogs love them, too. I highly recommend both of these treats for their quality.  If you love your dogs, these are the treats for them, not wheat-based biscuits.
