My wife and I have relied on Meyenberg for goat milk for many years, and though we normally buy it refrigerated, when in the US, we also purchase it in powdered form when traveling abroad, usually for several months out of the year. I was recently unable to purchase it in its powdered form from the Meyenberg supplier on Amazon, as it was out of stock, so I opted for the evaporated milk cans.  It's still very good, though for easy transportation powdered milk is hard to beat, as I find the evaporated milk a bit bulky and thus more expensive to ship abroad.  On the other hand, the drawback with powdered milk is, once it is opened, the milk powder becomes harder to dissolve the longer it is kept . . . that's the compromise.  Still, my wife and I are happy to have the option.
