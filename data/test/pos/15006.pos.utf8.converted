I haven't been able to have caffeine for years, so I've been a decaf drinker. Recently, in an effort to reduce unhealthy things from my diet, I've been looking for a coffee replacement. I ordered teeccino, and it is absolutely delicious! I was worried it wouldn't be as good as coffee, but it's BETTER!
