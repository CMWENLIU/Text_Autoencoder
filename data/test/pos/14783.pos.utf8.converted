My son loves it.  He said it tastes better than the original one.  He likes whole grain bread & stuff like that but he usually stays away from the whole grain pasta products.  However, he really likes this canned whole grain pasta a lot.  He's 12 and hard to please when it comes to food, so that's saying a (whole grain) lot.  :)
