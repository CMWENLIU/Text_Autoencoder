Great assortment of K-cups. I thought there was going to be 2-3 of the same kind of coffee, nope! EVERY k-cup is different. This was my first order of k-cups and it gives me a good sample of what flavors are my favorite and what to order in the future. This assortment would also be ideal for parties because it has plenty of decafs, teas, and even hot chocolate! This coffee is great tasting and fresh. Other reviews mentioned that some K-cups were expired and broken upon delivery. All my K-cups were sealed, none were broken or smashed during shipping. K-cups did come in a brown plastic bag that was just stapled shut, but the bag was placed in a box and therefore package was not damaged. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase!
