I have been eating this every morning for breakfast and I haven't gotten tired of it yet.  I make it in my rice cooker.  I put 1/2 cup of this in my rice cooker at night along with 1 cup of water.  The next day I plug in my rice cooker when I wake up and then I do my thing.  But the time I'm ready for breakfast my rice cooker has just clicked to "keep warm".  It works out great.  I love that this is a crunchy oat meal.  I don't like mushy oatmeal at all.  It is worth a try.
