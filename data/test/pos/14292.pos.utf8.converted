My husband and I are coffee drinkers from way back. We pride ourselves on having good taste, as well as an eye for price for the pocketbook, We have found a coffee that is wonderful to drink, especially in the evening, and easy on the pocketbook. That coffee is Folgers Chocolate Silk and we purchase it 6 cans at a time, or more if they have it available.<br />I never want to run out of this flavor. It is hearty, bold and sensuous. I have never tasted a coffee so smooth as this one and once you try it you'll be hooked. If you love flavored coffee, and chocolate, this is your coffee, you'll be thrilled.
