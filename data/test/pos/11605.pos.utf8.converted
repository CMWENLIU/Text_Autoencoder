Simply put, this coffee is the nectar of the gods as far as I am concerned. I like it better than any other coffee I have ever made at home. It tastes very similar to McDonald's Coffee, which is my favorite coffee to purchase pre-made outside of the home. As of this writing, it is out of stock and I sincerely hope it becomes available again. The closest Tim Horton's is about 1,200 miles from my house. That would be almost worth the trip to me, but not quite. I ordered the ground version and hope it comes out the same.
