I've tried EVERY BRAND of coconut water on Amazon and in stores that I could find. I've had fresh coconut water from all over... Brazil, Thailand, you name it. Just got back from a trip to Vietnam/Thailand in fact. Love coconut water.<br /><br />This is BY FAR the best brand on Amazon in my opinion. Not all coconuts are created equal, nor are the different packaged varieties.<br /><br />I think the closest any other brands came to this were VitaCoco and Amy&Brian brands, but they are not quite at the quality of C2O.<br /><br />Everything else is pretty much junk as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />Just for the sake of saving others time, I'll throw out the WORST brand: Naked. Don't EVER buy Naked brand coconut water. It's an abomination.<br /><br />Oh, there was one more brand I can't remember - I got it from a local Chinese grocery and you can't even find the brand name on Google. It was also at the quality of C2O, but I really need a brand I can buy in bulk online so this is it for me!
