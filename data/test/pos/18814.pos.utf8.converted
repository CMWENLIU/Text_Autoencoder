One issue of drinking home brewed spiced tea is many of the products out there do not work well with simmering finer spices.  These bags once tied tight do the job better than anything else I've tried.  I've also used the bags to stuff herbs and spices in poultry for the rotisserie and I have use them in pots of soup/sauces (where I want the flavor but not the herb texture).  They worked wonderfully and held up well for all of these purposes.  I am sure they work equally well for scent sachets or a number of other purposes.  The strings on my bags pull shut very easy and the product is well made and holds up.  For many purposes the bags could be washed and reused.
