Oats is oats, right? Well, apparently not. These steel cut oats have a toasty, nutty, wonderful flavor that is distinct from steel cut oats grown elsewhere. The tin is of course wonderful; it keeps this slightly oily grain fresh and it can be used when empty for holding coins, treasures buried in the backyard or any other number of things.<br /><br />The oats take longer to cook than standard rolled oatmeal, but that's not a problem if you soak the oats, use a pressure cooker, rice cooker or plan ahead. We love these oats in winter with a dab of butter and a teaspoon or two of local wildflower honey. Good with salt and cream also.
