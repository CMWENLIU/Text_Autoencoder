These are great light, easy to clean bottles. The reason I purchased them to begin with was because I thought they would fit in my Lansinoh double electric pump, which they did not :). If you want bottles that fit into the holders on the Lansinoh pump, you need to buy the Ameda bottles. However, they do work with the Lansinoh pump and you don't really use the bottle holders on the pump anyway. So overall a great purchase. Great for freezing milk or water in them and they have a great look.
