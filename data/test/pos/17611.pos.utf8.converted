If you are having difficulty breathing due to a viral infection or chronic asthma, this tea is for you.  I keep it on hand all the time in case someone in our family develops a cough.<br /><br />In addition to various Western herbs that support clear breathing, such as Eucalyptus and Pleurisy Root, the tea has the traditional Chinese herbal mixture Bi Yan Pan in it.  This is the magic ingredient that helps clear mucous out of the lungs.<br /><br />I am grateful that Amazon carries the entire Traditional Medicinals line because sometimes it is hard to find Breathe Easy tea in stores.  There are a variety of competitors on the market with other teas that claim to provide relief for breathing difficulties, but Breathe Easy outclasses all others I have tried.  Plus, it has a pleasant flavor from Licorice and Peppermint, especially compared to other herbal teas that have perceptible medical effects.  I highly recommend Breathe Easy tea.
