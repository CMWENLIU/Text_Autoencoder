It is a damp, rainy night in Baltimore.  At 43 degrees, there is a definite chill in the air.  Great time to get into my jammies and curl up with a cup of Stash Tea, put on my favorite singer (BM) and write Amazon reviews for you fine folks out there!<br /><br />I have been a tea drinker all my life, and Stash is great tea.  This flavor is wonderful and one of my old favorites.  Now they have plenty new and creative flavors but this still remains wonderful, simple, and basic, with a nice smooth peach flavoring.  Stash is stronger than your basic tea bags (Lipton, etc.) so depending on how strong you like your tea, you might only need one bag for a 24 oz cup like I do.  I drink it black with natural unbleached sugar or agave nectar (sweetener made from cactus juice and available in many food stores in the organic section.)<br /><br />Great flavor and worth the price difference.
