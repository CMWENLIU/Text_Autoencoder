I own 2 burmese cats and have always had problems with there teeth. So much that both cats have had to have teeth taken out. I recently went to a new vets and they put me on to CET Oral Hygiene Chews. I thought I would give them a try.<br /><br />First up my cats went crazy over these chews. My cats normally don't like chews or treats. They pritty much just eat cat food. However they love these chews and they would eat them all if given to them or they could open the container I have them in.<br /><br />After using them for 4 months, my cats went back to the vets for a checkup. The vets were taken back how effective these chews were. Strange given the vets recommended them to me. No more red gums and only a little build up of plaque.
