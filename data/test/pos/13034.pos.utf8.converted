---<br />Bonito del Norte is the very best-tasting tuna in the world! Better than fresh tuna I think. This is coming from me, someone who doesn't like fish at all. When I was little, and my father cooked fish, I started to gag and had to run out of the house, I hated that smell. I still hate that fishy taste. In a pinch, I will eat Albacore (white) tuna, but even that sometimes makes me gag (because I just am not able to stomach fish), and most of the can goes to waste, because I never want to touch it for weeks afterwards.<br /><br />BUT! Bonito del Norte (not necessarily this particular brand, which I do enjoy) is the champagne of tuna - it tastes so mild, and buttery, it has its own distinct flavor, in between fish and meat. Best of all is the texture, very firm and dense.<br /><br />When I was little, my family got to stay in my aunt's house in Spain, off season, when she couldn't rent it out to anyone else, and this was my favorite food: fresh baguette, and Bonito del Norte on top. A little bit goes a long way. You can spread a little mayo on the bread, and then put just a few pieces of this tuna on top, very sparingly (not like in American tuna sandwiches). It's the best. The taste is so exquisite, you can just open the can and eat it out of the can with a fork, without mayo. If you do use mayo, use very litte, as not to overpower the delicate taste.<br /><br />Wikipedia states that Spaniards call Albacore tuna (white tuna)  Bonito del Norte  That may be so, but the Bonito del Norte that is canned in Spain tastes totally different from the Albacore tuna normally available in the supermarket in the US, even the most expensive brands. Starkist sells a White Tuna in olive oil, which should theoretically taste the same as the Bonito del Norte in olive oil, according to Wikipedia, but that's not the case. The American Albacore white tuna has a much stronger, coarser taste. The Bonito del Norte has  buttery taste, which manages to be delicate and at the same time concentrated. Therefore a litte goes a long way.<br /><br />Yes, Bonito del Norte is always expensive, even in Spain, but I hope that you try to taste it just once in you life, which is why I'm writing this review.<br /><br />PS I have had fresh (very expensive) Ahi tuna in Hawaii, grilled. It was good, but still too fishy. I've made tuna salad out the leftover cold Ahi, with mayo the next day. That tasted better, nice and firm meat, less fishy than eaten hot. But for me, nothing in the world can touch the sublime taste of this canned Bonito del Norte.
