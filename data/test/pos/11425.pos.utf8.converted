If one is looking for shelled RAW pistachio nuts look no further.  While these are not cheap they are a good value for what they are.  I was paying this price locally for raw in shell nuts.  Now just considering the volume that is taken up by the shells not to mention the removal process and I think you'll agree this is a very good deal.  The flavor is great too.  Thank You and I'll be back!
