It's impossible to find this cheese in our dinky little town and it's fabulous!  This is original string cheese - the stuff people bought before Kraft and the like mass-produced a version.  This is *nothing* like the plastic, flavorless sticks that pass as string cheese now.  This is light, flavorful and oh so yummy!  You will not disappointed!
