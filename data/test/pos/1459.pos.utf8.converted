Things I love about this product:<br />-Only 1 gram of sugar per serving<br />-Tastes great<br />-Made with decaffeinated chocolate<br />-Only 21 calories<br /><br />It's great for both kids and adults who love chocolate milk but want something healthier. It tastes like ovaltine to me and that just makes it even better!
