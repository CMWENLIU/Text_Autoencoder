I was looking for coconut to make coconut milk, but all I could find was either completely desiccated or loaded with sugar.  This flaked coconut is so good, not dried, not sugared,  and easy to use.  It makes wonderfully flavored coconut milk in the blender, and it toasts up beautifully for a snack.  I now have it on subscription.
