We have tried other mixes and have found this to be the best on the market. We make it in a bread machine and it turns out great ever time. It is best toasted. It makes great garlic bread by toasting in the oven with garlic powder and butter. Toasted in the toaster with peanut butter or jam. My husband didn't like it as a sandwich bread until I started toasting it first.<br /><br />Great for grill cheese and etc.
