My favorite coffee in the world is coconut flavored coffee from Dunkin Donuts! I have never been able to find anything that even comes close...until now!!! This is just the perfect blend of sweet coconut and mild coffee flavor. I think I may have even convinced my best friend to buy a Keurig Coffee Maker just because of this flavor! I am in love for sure!
