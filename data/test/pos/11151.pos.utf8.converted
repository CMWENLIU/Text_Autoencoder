Oh my, as the mother of the world's crankiest teether, I should have been on the lookout for something like this. Honestly, I'm smacking myself in the forehead for not trying mum-mums earlier. Because my son? He loves him some mum-mum. They let him happily gnaw away before dissolving into non-choking hazard goo, and this kid has been pretty unimpressed with all those other teething products out there. I know because I own them all. Seriously, all of them. Sophie? Berry teether? Water ring teether? Bead teether? Mesh feeder-teether thing? Ice cube in a washcloth? They're all garbage in my sons eyes. Some asian rice rusks with a funny name=LOVE.<br /><br />Pros: I can find them at my local Walmart. They're perfectly portioned with two to a package (like poptarts), and they're easily tossed into a diaper bag. I break them in half before handing them off to my son, but that's just because he has a tendency to randomly chuck things out his stroller, and this keeps him from wasting an entire precious mum-mum. I personally think they taste pretty good (I haven't tried the other flavors). Also, they're cheap, much cheaper than all those teething products I just listed up there.<br /><br />Cons: While somewhat sturdy, they are not crush proof, as evidenced by the large amount of mum-mum dust in my purse. They hold up much better if given their own diaper bag compartment, rather than tossed in with all the rest of your stuff. Also, while they dissolve into goo, that goo is gross, and it is super sticky as it dries. Nothing a couple of baby wipes can't fix, and fortunately, the goo doesn't stain.
