I gave the '50s basket to my brother for Christmas and I wish you could have seen the look on his face when he opened the present! Sheer delight! What do you give the person who has everything?? This is it! The kids were even excited. They had not seen or heard of so many of the candies included in the box. Of course, my brother removed some of his favorites and put them in his own secret stash but there was plenty for everyone to have a free-for-all. It was a lot of fun for everyone!
