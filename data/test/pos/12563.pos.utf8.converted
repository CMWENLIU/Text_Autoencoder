I drank at least fifty gallons of Crystal Light Sunrise Tangerine Strawberry in its previous packaging, before it disappeared from Amazon (and everywhere else, including the Kraft Foods website) last winter. Now, a few months after Kraft announced its return, it is finally back at Amazon.<br />Or, it was, for about five minutes. I managed to get one package of it before it vanished again.<br /><br />It's a wonderful drink that doesn't taste "diet" at all. It has much more flavor and body than most Crystal Light varieties. All in all, it's everything a low-calorie drink mix should be.<br /><br />If only Amazon can keep sufficient quantities in stock, we'll be in heaven...
