These crackers are truly awesome! Two slices (13g) are only 40 calories, and provide 3 grams of fiber, 1g of protein and absolutely no fat.<br />They are tasty enough to enjoy alone, but are an excellent base for cheese (especially Jarlsberg) or spreads.<br />Finn Crisps keep well for long periods of time (like a year), so don't be concerned about ordering 9 boxes.<br />There are no longer any stores in my area that carry this product, so I'm grateful to Amazon for making them available.<br />PS: The box shown under the title, "Finn Crisp Original" rye mistakenly shows the multi-grain version, but you do get the original plain rye.
