I use this mainly for sweetning my tea.<br />Was concerned about sugar, afraid of saccharine, stevia could get bitter and had its own set of warnings.<br />Raw honey was certainly more natural, but still high glycemic.<br /><br />I was so relieved when I discovered organic Agave Nectar.<br />Very low glycemic, and sweeter than sugar or honey, so used less.<br />How deceived I felt when I started reading about *why* it was low glycemic.<br />It is really just light high fructose corn syrup! (HFCS also is low glysemic).<br />The problem with AN and HFCS is it rushes right to your liver and gets processed there!  Intakes "may indirectly harm the liver by increasing the risk of obesity, diabetes, and elevated blood levels of triglyceride fat, all of which in turn increase the risk of liver disease." [...]<br />So the search was on to once again find something that could sweeten up my tea and not harm me!<br />This Palm Sugar is perfect! One tsp has only 10 calories and 2.5 gm carbs, yet has a glycemic index of only 35- about the same as the now-dreaded AN, and much lower than regular sugar or honey. Also, palm sugar has a good amount of nutrients and minerals in it. While I certainly do not consider it a health food I am pleased to know that instead of impacting harm it could be doing a little good!<br /><br />Be careful of what brand you buy.<br />I heard that some american companies are mixing it with cane sugar; other brands have more calories than this organic one from Navitas.<br /><br />The taste? Perfect! Has a slight light-brown sugar flavor. Definitely does not over-power but rather enhances the drink.<br />I have not cooked with it mainly because I have not yet cooked any sweets since this arrived. Would I? Hard to say. I would love to, but I think of it as special, and not sure if I would want to waste it by having it lost in a cookie. But then that subtle flavor...I'm thinking it would be awesome in biscotti!
