I'm really impressed by these corn thins.....when the huge box of them arrived, I was dismayed at first thinking, what have I done here?! How will I ever eat these?!  But now that I've started munching them, I don't think that's going to be a problem!  These are delicious.  Unlike rice cakes, which they resemble, they are much denser so they don't crumble apart when you eat them.  You can actually use them as you would a piece of bread.  In a sort of sandwich capacity. Terrific with cheese or nut butters.  But there is something addicting about them, it's very easy to start chomping away at them as it they are potato chips. IF you can control yourself, they are relatively low in calories.  I'm really pleased with this purchase, I was looking for something to rotate my grains,,,and this was a good choice.
