Like so many things in Italy, the Italians have elevated this vinegar-making to high art.<br /><br />This product, "Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia", is made from cooked grape "must" that is aged over many years while it is transfered into ever smaller barrels of different woods. Through this aging and evaporation process, this product matures into a very unique "condimento".<br />After a minimum of 12 years, a sample of this product is given to a consortium where it is evaluated against the standard for "Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia". If approved, this product can be given a "silver label" = 12 years old, a "red label" = 25 years old and then there is this current product, a "gold label" 50 to 75 to 100 years old. The consortium places the product in their unique bottle and then, and only then, can the product carry the name "Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale."<br /><br />There is not a simple way to describe the taste other that to say "if you have ever tasted vinegar, it is NOTHING like that." This is a product that used in drops on fine cheese or over perfectly ripe strawberries or just drizzled over a perfectly cooked porterhouse steak.<br />You do not make salad dressing from this product!<br />The Italians categorize this product as a "digestivo" (after dinner drink to aid digestion) or a "condimento", used as I described above.<br /><br />All you have to do is have a nice person put 2 drops on your tongue, then you will understand everything I've written above.
