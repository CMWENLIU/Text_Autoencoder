These English muffins were on sale at my local grocery, so I tried them and OH MY GOD, they were so very delicious. Once you have tried these, there is no way you could go back to Thomas's or , heaven forbid, store brand English muffins. They simply don't stack up to the flavor and texture of Bay's English muffins.<br /><br />I am now ruined for regular English muffins, which is terrible because they are more expensive, but awesome because they are so delicious.
