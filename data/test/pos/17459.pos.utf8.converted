This pest trap is working pretty well for me.  I've had moths for a few years now.  They seem to come out mostly on summer nights.  I threw out almost all my food last year, yet they continue to show up.  I finally got sick of spending every evening swatting 5-7 moths.  Now with the trap, I only have to chase down 1-2 moths each night, if any.  I've found that location really does matter though.  One trap I placed on a bookshelf and caught nothing after several weeks.  I moved it just 5 feet away to another shelf, and now it's catching plenty of bugs.  So if you aren't getting as many bugs caught as you would expect, try moving the trap.  Anyway, this product isn't solving my pest issue, as I still have some floating around, but it's certainly helping a great deal.
