I'm very pleased with this tea.<br /><br />I boil a pot of water and then take the lid off and let it cool to the right temperature, which is around 200 degrees Fahrenheit.  I let it steep for about five minutes and then remove my infuser and pour myself a cuppa nice, light oolong.  It's good and relaxing.<br /><br />Arrived in the container seen in the picture, with the tea sealed up in a little plastic bag inside of it.  I'd recommend it.
