I have just ordered another package of this wonderful tea. I drink it for breakfast, lunch, dinner and in between! The flavor is really good and I drink this tea without sugar. I am 8 months pregnant at the moment and the tea really helps me to relax and feel better especially after a long crazy day chasing my 1 year old around! I sit down turn on a nice movie and have a big cup of this wonderful rejuvenating tea... I like that it is made of blend of very healthy herbs for your body and mind. Our lactation consultant, OB and midwife all recommend Yogi tea for pregnant women and there is also one for nursing women to help with with milk production.
