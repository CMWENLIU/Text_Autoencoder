Even though I write reviews mostly on my favorite types of escape novels, I was sparked by Amazon's enthusiasm, to take part in the grocery store and gourmet food expansions here.  My first purchase (of products beyond books) included a grain called QUINOA (Keenwa).<br /><br />The product arrived in very good order and within perfect timing.<br /><br />In that maiden purchase I also added Lavender Oil - 4 oz. - EssOil and NOW Foods, Clove Oil - 4 oz to my shopping cart, along with powdered cloves, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YV7ZAI">McCormick Cloves, Ground, 16-Ounce Unit</a>, and lavender teaThe Tao Of Tea Herbal Tea Lavender, 100% Organic, 2.0-Ounce Tin (Pack of 3).  See my Listmania on Essential Oils (which indicates which items I've reviewed) for info on the values and uses of lavender and cloves, available from various vendors here.<br /><br />I consider Quinoa to be the most valuable food available on the planet, a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor (and culinary versatility), in addition to being baseline healthy with full-spectrum nourishment.<br /><br />If I had to be limited to only 4 items or food groups (in addition to water, of course) to eat or drink, those would be Quinoa, Coffee, Dairy Products, and a variety of greens, spices, & nuts.  Yeah, okay, dairy products; and greens, spices, & nuts may be considered more than 2 items, but, for me they're two categories.<br /><br />I'm not a vegetarian because I love meat, chicken, and fish, but if I'm working with limitations, I'm making do with the most basic of basics, while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor (yeah, yeah, and nutrition, too, though according to my beliefs, "nutrition" dims and deteriorates, unless it's in the living presence of "yummy.").<br /><br />Quinoa, I believe, would take care of all (or at least many) basic nutritional needs.<br /><br />The way I simplify my use and preparation of Quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal, and then to "gourmet it" accordingly.<br /><br />-- As "rice" I add savory herbs like parsley, basil, marjoram, garlic, onions, etc.  Actually, most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with Quinoa.  Think of what Lidia's Italian Table does with "noodle heaven"; then substitute Quinoa for pasta (I like pasta too, of course).<br /><br />-- As "oatmeal" I add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit (including raisin and date types), brown sugar, molasses, maple, creme, that type of thing.<br /><br />As far as cooking instructions, to me they're basically the same as rice:<br /><br />- Add water or liquid in a 2 to 1 ratio.  2 cups liquid ( water, broth, vegetable, or fruit juices) to 1 cup Quinoa.<br /><br />-- Instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the Quinoa, covering the pot, and simmering for 12-15 minutes.<br /><br />-- I've also successfully prepared Quinoa in the microwave.  You can heat the water to boil in a bowl (use a large one to avoid the mess of boiling over) then add Quinoa, cover, and cook.  Depending on power levels and volume of food, a microwave sometimes cooks 4 times faster than "outside-the-waves" cooking.  As an example of time variance with larger amounts of food: 1 potato cooks (on average) in 4 - 8 minutes, 2 potatoes require double that, or 8 -16 minutes.<br /><br />-- For a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave, I might use 1/4 cup Quinoa with 2/4 (
