This seaweed is quite delicious, each packet contains about 12 super thin little squares.  The sodium content is surprisingly low considering the relatively salty taste.<br />But I wouldn't consider buying it via Amazon, it is available at Costco at about 1/3 of the price as a box of 27 packets (9 packages of three).
