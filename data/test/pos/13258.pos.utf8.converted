Always convenient in the kitchen,Peter Pan is a great way to soothe the appetite and sweet and flavorful enough to satisfy the palette.<br />As far as I know this is one of the good cholesterol foods and contains just about as much protein as a steak.<br />The texture and consistensy is just right.<br />I love it on crackers and at times just off the spoon.<br />It's just the right food to keep handy for when one just doesn't want fast food or to cook.<br />The best part is that it keeps fresh all year and also, it is so delicious.
