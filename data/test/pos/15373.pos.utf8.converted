I believe that those who bash the flavor of this product are generally used to eating processed products and have yet to acquire the taste of natural grains.  Once you learn how to eat healthier, it's amazing how most people learn how naturally sweet dry toast can be if its made with a really great bread or how wonderful this cereal is.<br /><br />For my taste, I love this stuff andd I think it's worth every dime.  The boxes are always stuffed to capacity without the three or four inches of dead space chalked up as "settling due to shipping and handling".  I normally add it on top of a bowl of fresh fruit and yogurt and then listen to my co-workers tell me how great my breakfast or lunch looks.<br /><br />Anyway, I highly recommend Food For Life Ezekiel cereal - its very difficult to find more nutrition in a single meal anywhere else!
