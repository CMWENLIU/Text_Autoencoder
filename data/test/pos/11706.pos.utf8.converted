I am very happy with the quality of this cocoa butter. As it is raw, it is in chunks, some bigger, some smaller. It does not melt or soften at room temperature. To apply it on my skin, I melt it in my hands or briefly over the gas burner in a spoon. The butter has a strong and pleasant cocoa powder aroma which disappears after application on the skin. The texture of the butter is thick and smooth. This is great for skin, especially thin facial skin. I usually apply it after shower on warm and wet skin and rub it in energetically so that moisture is sealed in. The butter gets absorbed by the skin very well and does not leave greasy residue at all. My mom and I both have very sensitive skins and cannot use any artificial products. I'm glad to say that the cocoa butter does not irritate even if it gets in the eyes. So all in all, this seems to be an all natural product of great quality. And the price is very affordable as well. Where I live, cocoa butter costs over 3 times more.
