Wow!  My dog has jaws of steel and can crack deer antlers, so I decided to go with this antler (and my dog is the size of a border collie).  I got the Amazon Prime delivery to my work... I work in an elementary school.  This antler is so big and heavy that I couldn't help laughing a little when I unwrapped it and showed it to my students.  They suggested perhaps I use it to smack them when they are naughty (I wouldn't...this was their suggestion).<br /><br />Anyway, it's about a foot long, an inch and a half in diameter, and must weigh about a pound and a half.<br /><br />The only thing one might worry about is that the thing feels like a piece of concrete.  A dog with a strong chew might break a tooth on it if he bit down the wrong way.<br /><br />My dog really chews on this, although he tends to lose interest in it unless I occasionally slap some peanut butter on the cut ends.  He'll chew on it when he gets bored, too, but he's mostly a chewer who likes to chew for a purpose, and he can't do too much damage to this.  Fortunately, he knows to not bite too hard, so no tooth damage has occurred.<br /><br />Keep an eye on your dog when he chews it, and avoid giving it to dogs who bite down too hard on things, especially if they have a history of chipping teeth.  Great for dogs with strong jaws.<br /><br />Oh, and don't throw this thing.
