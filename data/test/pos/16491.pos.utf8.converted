I'm not sure whether I appreciate the organic peanut butter or the vegan chocolate more, but it is a great combination.  After buying Dark Chocolate Dreams I'm starting to realize that almost anything that I use peanut butter for tastes better with chocolate too.  Great for dipping pretzels, or on a PB&J, or bananas, or just about anything I've tried so far!
