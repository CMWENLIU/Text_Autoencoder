My boxer-mix has suffered terribly with allergies.  Constant yeast infections in his ears, skin problems, general stinky dog problems.  After taking him to the vet for like the 100th time for steroids and a super-duper ear washing at the cost of $278, I finally decided to research a better solution.  I found that my dog could be allergic to corn or chicken and it would be best to cut that out of his food all together.  I found this brand at Petco and ever since we went to this vegetarian formula he has been *basically* allergy free!!  He's like a whole different dog!!!  Clear eyes, clear skin, lost a bunch of weight, runs around with his brother like they were puppies all over again, doesn't smell and hasn't needed to go back to the vet for his ears!!!  My doggy loves this food and I love that he's finally healthy.
