For those cats that think they are pigs, this mat works great.  No longer can they succeed with getting their food and water all over the floor within minutes of me getting their mess cleaned up.  I know it spoils their fun to no longer be able to watch the water run across the floor after the joy of seeing it bubble out of the container and then push food into it just to watch it swell up, but my time is more valuable than theirs...at least to me.  Also, the mat does not scoot easily so they cannot drag it...oops, spoiled another one of their games!
