Heard about this on Dr. Oz and decided to give it a try.  Wow is this stuff filling as well as delicious. Sure wished it was a bit cheaper. I normally do not like crunchy "peanut butter", but this is an exception. Its a great way to get extra Omega-3 in your diet.  I bought 1 jar to try, but will be getting more for sure :)
