I kept reading recommendations for Valrhona Cocoa Powder and what a difference it makes in baking.  Frankly, I thought the recommenders were embellishing a bit....until I tried it.  I have only found it online and at gourmet food stores and since using it in baking recipes, I will NEVER use any other cocoa powder.  It is truly the difference between a good product and an outstanding one. I ran out of Valrhona in the middle of making cupcakes for a wedding shower and rushed back to the gourmet shop for some more, they were out of it and sold me a "comparable Dutch processed" cocoa. It was NOT even close to being a good substitute for the Valrhona.  I will not run out of it again.  If you haven't tried it, do yourself a favor and get some!
