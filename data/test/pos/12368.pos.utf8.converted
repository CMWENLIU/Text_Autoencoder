Wow! My husband and I did the Atkins diet about 8-10 years ago and still try to limit our carbs. I used this product when we first went low-carb - it was lousy! I tried it a couple of weeks ago after hearing that it had improved - and it HAS! I even tried the pancakes which I didn't expect to taste good, and they did! Using it to bread fish and chicken fried steak - awesome! I think it was much better than just flour! If you tried it years ago, try it again. I WILL be ordering it again!
