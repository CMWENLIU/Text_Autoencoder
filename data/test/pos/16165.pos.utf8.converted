I love every ARCTIC ZERO chocolate-based flavor.  These are amazing and guilt-less confections.  Guilt-free for calories; not guilt-free for cost.  To minimize expenses, I try to eat one pint every two days, and, sometimes, I can eat a half-pint per day. Usually, though, I can't stop once I start. I was on the CHOCOLATE wagon for several years. Now, with ARCTIC ZERO, I'm definitely off the wagon.  Today's my off-day, and I'm sweating it (just kidding).  Here's my warning: Don't start down the ARCTIC ZERO road unless you're ready to embrace the addiction.
