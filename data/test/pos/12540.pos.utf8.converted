Well, I'm hooked. I mean, I can't stop drinking this stuff. Like the other reviewers have mentioned, this tea is not bitter at all, and the kombucha rounds it out in such a way that, well, you start to crave it. Maybe a lot of it. Maybe that's OK...<br /><br />I just broke down and bought a 6-pack of this from Amazon, as I've been spending waaay too much on it at my local grocer's.<br /><br />I drink this two cups at a time. I'll be on my 3rd and 4th cups for the day in just a moment. I'm boiling water right now. Pathetic, ain't it?
