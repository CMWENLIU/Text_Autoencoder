This is a perfect, on the go, refreshing beverage. I love the chocolate flavor. It is nice and rich/smooth without being too rich. This is low fat and has only 100 calories. This is easy to chill and throw in a lunch box or work bag. It is enough for a quick burst of energy without a crash mid-morning or mid-afternoon. I feel good about giving this to my kids since they do not ever get soda or any other junky drinks.
