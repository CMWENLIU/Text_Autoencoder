I love this stuff!  I drink premium Vodka tonics, so for Christmas in 2009 my husband got me the tonic sample kit sold here.  I tried every one.  My favorite by far is the Q tonic.  It is clean, a little citrusy, and I love the fact that it uses organic Agave sweetener for a healthier, lower-calorie drink.
