I'm buying another 12 bags of this soup after ordering it for the first time just two weeks ago.  It's delicious and easy to prepare in the microwave.  More importantly, it really is only 160 calories for a huge bowl of tasty noodles.  I know, because I gain weight if I eat more than 1000 calories a day.  I don't gain any weight on this soup.  It's a great hot satisfying meal for a cold morning, or an evening late night snack to help me sleep.  Even better is the real reason I happened upon this soup on Amazon and decided to try ordering it -- the soup noodles are made of Moroheiya, a vegetable that is supposed to keep skin young and supple.  It's a staple in the diet of long lived Japanese.  I found that eating this soup on a regular basis does seem to help make my skin look young and healthy.
