Just how many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll pop?  While the world may never know, you will have 100 chances with assorted flavors to try for yourself.<br /><br />It has been a while since I last saw Kojak with a Tootsie Roll Pop in his mouth, but I am unable to recall if he ever got to the point where he bit through to the center.  I can only suck on one of these for so long and then...CRUNCH!  Also, Tootsie Roll Pops are alternatively called Tootsie Pops, as noted on the Tootsie Roll web site.<br /><br />Tootsie Roll Pops, invented in 1931, have been one of my favorites since my childhood.  Of course, some of us never quite grow up, and the pleasure of sucking on a Tootsie Pop remains.
