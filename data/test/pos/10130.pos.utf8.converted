I've been a fan of Jelly Belly for a long time and just recently noticed Gimbal's Jelly Beans on Amazon recently. I'm glad that I did because Gimbal's Jelly Beans closely, very closely, rival Jelly Belly as far as taste goes. On a scale of 1 to 10 I rate Jelly Belly as a 9.5 and I rate Gimbal's Jelly Beans as a 9.1. But as far as the price goes, Gimbal's Jelly Beans blow the always overpriced Jelly Belly's out of the water.<br /><br />The next time that I buy jelly beans I will be considering both taste and cost. I think that with the taste of Gimbal's Jelly Beans being rated so closely to Jelly Belly and the cost being far lower for the former, I will choose Gimbal's Jelly Beans--how about you?
