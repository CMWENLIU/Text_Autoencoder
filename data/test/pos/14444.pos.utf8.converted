An Angel must've had a hand in creating this confection. I like peeps but they get old after a while, and I was iffy about trying this product at first. I wish I had purchased more at the time.<br /><br />They just melt in your mouth. There is not so much as a marshmallow in the center as it's more of a heavenly cream mixture. Just the right amount with the mouthwatering silky smooth chocolate on the outside. I ate one whole bag of the 3 I originally purchased. Then my children discovered that by dropping one or two in their hot chocolate or even my coffee became an experience almost as close to paradise we'll ever get in this world.<br /><br />I can't wait till they become available again! The chocolate is exquisite and tastes like or better than some of world's finest.
