I enjoy Redi Burger. It comes in a loaf; so, you have to open both ends of the can, loosen the edges with a knife and push it out. It has a softer texture than it did some years ago. You have to slice it and then pan fry it in some oil. It is very delicious and tastes a little like spam to me. It also has the absolutely delicious smell of Morningstar Farms vegetarian bacon - but you have to really think about it to detect it. It's great on burgers or sliced and topped with gravy. I grew up on meat analogues and enjoy most of Worthington's products.
