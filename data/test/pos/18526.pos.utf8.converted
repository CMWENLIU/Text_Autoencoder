Thank you ZICO! i love the new bottles. I was a huge fan of the tetra packs but i couldnt take em anywhere. I've been taking the new bottle to gym, in my bike and just walking around. The pomberry is my fave. The natural in a bottle tastes more like coconut water straight from a coconut. Love 'em! come out with some more flavors soon!
