Flax USA's pre-ground flax uses a cold milled process which protects the flavor & extends the shelf life of flax. Does not need to be stored in refrigerator or a freezer to last.

I will have to check with the manufacturer.<br /><br />The flax seed is pre-ground and no grinding is necessary which makes it easy, convenient & ready to eat.

I am not much into storing foods in plastic containers. Since the flax has oil in it, it might be better to transfer to glass storage jars to prevent plastic contamination of the flax seeds. better be safe than sorry. It's my thing.
