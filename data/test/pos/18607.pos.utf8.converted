These Wild Hibiscus Flowers make an impressive statement in cocktails, especially champagne.  In addition, the flowers are edible and yummy!!!!  You can even float them in sparkling apple cider or bubbling water for those non-alcoholic drinkers, as well as the kids.  Great way to spark conversation among your guests.  They make a wonderful hostess gift as well.
