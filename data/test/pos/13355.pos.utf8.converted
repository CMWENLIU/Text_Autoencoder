I have over the past few months started to eat most if not all organic foods. I start my morning with a cup of organic Green Tea. I usually used regular honey, but after reading up on the benefits of raw honey I decided to try this brand. I must say, this is truly the best honey that I have ever had. I almost want to sit on the couch with the jar and eat it like a snack, its THAT good! I recently ran out of the honey and ordered more online. The jar arrived to my house shattered. I called the customer service on my order form. They were 100% helpful and very kind. They promptly shipped me a new jar. I must say, during my wait for the new honey to arrive I had to use the old (liquidy) honey that i had, and I hated it!!! I truly love this organic raw honey. Trust me, try it once and you'll never use anything else!!
