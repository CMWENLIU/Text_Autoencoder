I normally buy the light version of this product but last time I ordered Amazon was out of the light so I got this.  For some reason this regular version mixes instantly whereas with the light you have to work at getting it mixed.  Still though I like the light version better, it just tastes better to me and I prefer the texture of the light too.  Good tasty stuff in strong hot tea.
