I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  Not just because I am allergic to egg yolks and this magic mix has me baking again, but because I cannot tell the difference between the egg-full and egg-free versions in baked goods.  My hubby, who is not allergic to yolks, was my judge can and attest to that by gobbling up everything I make -- and he is a picky eater.<br /><br />I have used this in muffins, quick breads, pancakes, waffles, sponge cakes, boxed mixes, pound cake, cookies, scones, etc.  All have turned out great!<br /><br />-- I just mix the required dry amount into my dry ingredients and add the water to the wet mixture before I combine them and it is very easy to use<br />-- I feel good using it around my tiny daughter because if she licks the beater or bowl, there is no threat of Semonilla poisoning<br />-- You get 113 servings in one box for $4.41, that is just .47 cents for a DOZEN egg-equivalent - this makes baking much more economical<br />-- It is a painless way to bake vegan for the family members we have who follow that lifestyle<br /><br />The one thing it doesn't do is add protein.  If I am making breakfast muffins and want protein in them I will blend a scoop or two of unflavored whey protein powder ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MAK59O">100% Pure Whey Protein Isolate (Natural) Unflavored (Mega Pack) 10 lbs</a> ) with the wet ingredients with no extra water, it works perfectly.  I do not do that when baking vegan or if there are milk allergies.<br /><br />I am so glad amazon sells this in bulk, it is half the price of what the grocery store charges and it is brought to my door -- can't beat that!
