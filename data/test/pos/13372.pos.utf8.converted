The sprouts available at the market are old and slimey by day 2. With these sprouts you can have them at your convenience and they are 100 times crunchier and healthier. Where I work we have a salad bar and I just take my own container of sprouts that I am so proud of. Truthfully, my 16 yr old grows them, I just pay for them and enjoy.
