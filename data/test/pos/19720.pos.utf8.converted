I love this kind of soup!  Had it this afternoon for lunch.  Progresso is an excellent brand and their soups are very good.  The broth has alot of body and the flavor is very good, not mainly salty like so many canned soups.<br /><br />This flavor has little chicken meatballs with little round  macaroni shapes.  The combo is delicious and its nice an chunky!<br /><br />Try this!  Its very filling and a great warming, lunch!
