It is the 11th of May, 2011. My doctor has just informed me that my Jimmies are terminally rustled.<br /><br />I had no idea how to react. Would any reaction I had be legitimate? Or would it be tainted by the state of my Jimmies?<br /><br />I've been living with RJS (Rustled Jimmy Syndrome) for almost a year now. I've tried more "cures" than would intimidate even a cancer patient. At first I tried wearing a three-wolf shirt. It helped with my self-esteem, but it didn't do anything about my Jimmies. I even tried buying a $2,000 HDMI cable, hoping the multidimensional X-Rays that would be exuding from my television would be enough to unrustle my Jimmies on a molecular level. That was $2,000 wasted.<br /><br />I had no hope. That is, until I found Gorilla Munch. The primary ingredient in Gorilla Munch, Love(tm), provided high enough levels of necessary nutrients to unrustle even my Jimmies! After consulting my doctor, I've received the news that the rustling in my Jimmies is in regression, and I should expect to have completely unrustled Jimmies by August 2012.<br /><br />I cannot thank this cereal enough for what it's done for me.
