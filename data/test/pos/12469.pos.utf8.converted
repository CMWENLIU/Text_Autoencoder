OK, so I've been coughing up $5 a box for these crackers and they were even worth it at that price. The box is small, you don't get a lot, and the texture is really going to be a change from any other regular cracker you've ever tried. Don't expect consistent sizes or thicknesses either. These are super crisp crackers that snap when you bite them. They have a very strong sesame flavor with an awesome black pepper bite; definately savory! These aren't water crackers or Ritz for that matter. Once you adjust to the strong flavor you won't be able to stop. Serve with a bold cheese for best results.
