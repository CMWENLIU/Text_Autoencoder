I love this curry powder mix. It's good for a variety of meats, I make lamb and chicken curry with it. It tastes like the good curry you get in an authentic Indian restaurant. And, it's easy to make, the directions are on the back. Just add meat, onions and plain yougert and you're all set. I also add a can of pigeon peas, but you can use any veg you want (although that's not in the recipe on box). You can adjust the "spicy hot" level by adding more or less of the curry powder. Try it if you're a curry lover, and even if you aren't --with this curry powder you may become one.
