How HEAVENLY are these?  I can honestly say that Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are my VERY favorite candy!  I've loved them since I was a child and they always bring back fond memories.  I love them in their regular size so you can imagine that I just about FLIPPED LIKE A GYMNAST when I saw these! They're HUGE!  In my mind, candy wise, NOTHING could be better than your very favorite just bigger (and MORE of it)!<br /><br />They are HUGE, FRESH and ABSOLUTELY YUMMY!  They really do make a great snack.  Besides, who doesn't love a Reese's?  They make so many Delicious candies!<br /><br />These will remain at the top of my list for that "anytime snack". And for an extra special treat, I either freeze them or I break them up over vanilla or choclate ice cream! SO GOOD!<br /><br />This Seller is spectacular. They always send their items quickly.  They are pleasant and professional.  So, if you are thinking of ordering these, or any other candy from this company, do not hesitate.  I would uses them again and again.  I wish more sellers on Amazon were this reliable.<br /><br />Enjoy!
