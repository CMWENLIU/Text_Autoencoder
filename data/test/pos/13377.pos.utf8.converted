It's sad when someone who buys this thinks that it smells bad and tastes horrible. 90% of the time it's because they didn't follow the directions and washed the lime off of the noodles before using them and par-boiled them to improved the texture.<br />It's a shame too since these noodles (made of konjac) are almost 0 calories.<br />These noodles are fantastic! It's so great to have found this a year ago.<br />I've used it to make spaghetti, sukiyaki, pesto, alfredo, it's a good ramen substitute and substituted it for yakisoba dishes as well.<br />I like these so much more than the Tofu Shirataki noodles that I actually find more often.<br />JFC texture is more like pasta than the other.<br />I'm planning to try the brown shirataki as well.<br /><br />Great Product<br />Priced Well<br />Amazingly Low Calorie<br />Completely Versatile<br /><br />FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS AND WASH THE NOODLES FIRST TO GET RID OF THE LIME SMELL AND PAR-BOIL THEM.
