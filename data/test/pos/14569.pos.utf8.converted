I love the ease of preparation, the creaminess and the freshness of this product. It is also easy to store in the pantry.<br /><br />I do add my own spices to add a bit more flavor to my liking.<br /><br />Canned beans do not come close to the taste of these and I love that Amazon ships them to my door!
