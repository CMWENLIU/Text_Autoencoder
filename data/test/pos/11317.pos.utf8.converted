After years of trying different granola/energy bars, I was ready to give up. Everything I tried was either too dry, too tough to eat, or too disgusting to contemplate. I had pretty much given up.<br /><br />I was given a sample of Granola Gourmet at my local Whole Foods, and I was instantly hooked. These are simply THE BEST granola bars I have ever had.<br /><br />Moist, flavorful, and remarkably filling, I'm totally hooked on them! The Spiced Orange Cranberry and [[ASIN:B002AJ1S1E Granola Gourmet Very Berry Granola Bars, 10-Count Bars<br />(Pack of 2)]] are my favorites, and my wife loves the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AJ1RME">Granola Gourmet Chocolate Espresso Granola Bars, 10-Count Bars (Pack of 2)</a>.<br /><br />The fact that they are diabetic-friendly makes them even better! A friend of ours gave up wheat, dairy, and refined sugar for Lent, and was having a hard time of it. I gave him a couple of my Granola Gourmet bars, and he was hooked! Lent is long since over, and he's still eating them every week.<br /><br />THANK YOU Granola Gourmet team for bringing such a great product to the masses!
