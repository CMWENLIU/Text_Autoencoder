I use these individual creamers at work since the office only supplies the dry powder with its coffee set up.  Some folks buy the bottles of flavored cream that require refrigeration but that has its own complexities (expiration, unauthorized "sharing" by others, etc.)  Since these little cups need no refrigeration, I keep a box in my desk drawer and use on demand.  It was always a challenge to remember to buy another box at the grocery story when I ran low at the office, and now I don't have to remember.  Instead, I have several months worth and with the subscribe and save option, it came right to my door.
