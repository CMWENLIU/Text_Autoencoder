My favorite Thai dish to order out is Pad Thai.  When I get a craving, but can't get to a restaurant I will make Taste of Thai Pad Thai for Two.  Usually I do share it with a family member, but if not, the leftovers make a tasty lunch.  The flavor of the sauce is very authentic.  Not too heavy or light-just right.  The amount of rice noodles is substantial.  The package makes a good size meal for two.  I add my own chicken pieces or shrimp along with some green onions, and if I have some broccoli, I'll throw that in as well.  This is a great item to keep in your pantry for when you want something different and exotically tasty.
