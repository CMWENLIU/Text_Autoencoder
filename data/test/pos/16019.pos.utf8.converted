We only just discovered that Amazon sells this oil - we've been buying it direct from Bariani.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers: this is remarkably different from most oils on the market - my last purchase was received 14 days after initial bottling and it does indeed taste like fresh green olives: deep and with a bitter aftertaste. Bought two bottles last time to see the effect of age and were pleased to find that it matures exceptionally well - the taste becomes increasingly mellow and buttery but retains the taste of olives. Wonderful drizzled over antipasti, or simply with crusty bread (and a glass of red (hem, hem). A little bit of Italy in a bottle.<br /><br />Both bottles due to run out soon more is being ordered.<br /><br />Anyone know the case price?
