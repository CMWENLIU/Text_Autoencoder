This rice milk surpassed my expectations.  It tastes so good and it's real creamy!  The powder does not dissolve well in cold water so I mix large batches in hot water (a drinkable temperature, not boiling) once a week then store in the fridge to drink later.  I do not even need to shake it prior to use because the powder dissolves so well when mixed in hot water.
