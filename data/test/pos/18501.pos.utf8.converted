I find the best way to rate hot sauces on heat is to compare them to other sauces. This is just slightly hotter than Dave's Insanity Sauce, but slightly less heat than Mad Dog Inferno. It is way hotter than any tobaso product. If tobaso is the only hot sauce you have eaten, I would suggest eating something more mild than Blair's. Sudden Death will give a good burn to just about anyone but the most serious chili heads. <p>What I like about this sauce the most is the flavor. It is very good. Unlike some of the extract sauces which lack flavor, I found this one to taste very good. And it has the heat kick that many of the better tasting sauces do not have.
