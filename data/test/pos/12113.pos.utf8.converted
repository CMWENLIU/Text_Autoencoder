I was surprised when this meal actually had a taste, and a good one! I had tried several different varieties of "Yakisoba", and they all ended up tasting the same. This one was distinct with added dried cabbage, etc.; dried chicken (I think), and a thick, dark mystery sauce that is added at the end, and while it is not gourmet, it does its job. Cover is pulled almost halfway back, veggies are added on side, and lukewarm water is added to fill line. Nuke it for five minutes, let sit for one, add sauce, release mandible, add noodles and saliva, and purr.
