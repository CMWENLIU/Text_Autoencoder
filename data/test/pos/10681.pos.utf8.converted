My two goldens approve of this product. Blue Buffalo uses top of the line ingredients, human food grade-- there's a chicken version and a fish version. No yucky meat "by-products", meat and meat meals are the top ingredients, no indigestible corn or wheat, a wide variety of wholesome and varied vegetable ingredients and several probiotics to promote healthy digestion and absorption of nutrients. On top of that, this is a very palatable food.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo also uses a unique process to manufacture "lifebits" which are added to the basic "kibble" food. These smaller, darker pieces are cold formed in order to better maintain nutrients. I don't believe any other company incorporates this kind of element into dog food.<br /><br />I respect what they are doing, and I've changed to Blue Buffalo food for my cat, too.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional information:<br /><br />-One cup contains 462.8 calories<br />-NO animal by-products<br />-NO artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors<br />-NO corn, wheat, or soy AND gluten-free (great to know after last years' pet food scandals and deaths with other brands, in which added glutens were contaminated with melamine)<br />-Crude protein 25% minimum<br />-Crude fat 14% minimum<br />-Omega 3 fatty acids 0.25% min<br />-Omega 6 fatty acides 3.5% min<br />-Glucosamine 400 mg/kg max<br />-Major ngredients, in order:<br />Deboned chicken, chicken meal, whole ground brown rice (very digestible grain source vs. the usual corn), whole ground barley, oatmeal, rye, whole potatoes, tomato pomace (natural source of lycopene), chicken fat (preserved wtih natural mixed tocopherols), natural chicken flavor, whole carrots, whole sweet potatoes, blueberries, cranberries, flaxseed, barley grass, dried parsley, alfalfa meal, kelp meal, taurine, l-carnitine, l-lysine, glucosamine hydrochloride, yucca schidigera extract, green tea extract, turmeric, garllic, sunflower oil (natural source of Omega 6 fatty acids), oil of rosemary, the whole bunch of expected vitamins and minerals, and several probiotics (lactobacillus acidolphilus, bacillus subtilis, bifidobacgterium longum, enterococcus faecium).<br /><br />I hope this helps you evaluate whether or not this food would be a good match for your best pal.
