The 1st day I received this I sprinkled some of the inluded catnip around and it was on ever since.  One cat likes the toy in the middle more than the others, but they all scratch on it constantly instead of my furniture!!  That was the goal, so I give it 5 stars for sure!  My little shy cat seems to come out more often and is always laying on it or by it.  She loves it and I get a laugh at her rolling down it as she plays!  And for $10, I would definitaly recommend this toy!!
