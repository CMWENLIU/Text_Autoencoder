The conventional wisdom is that Lapsang Souchong is an acquired taste. It's probably more the case that you are going to either love or hate this tea after the first couple of cups (give yourself a couple of cups' worth before passing judgement, so that you don't confuse surprise with dislike). You have as much chance of liking or disliking this tea as you do any other. I personally think Earl Grey has a "funkier" smell and taste to it than Lapsang, though that doesn't stop me from drinking it.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and start with fresh water in a clean kettle, and a fresh tea-bag in a cup or mug. Even with a mug, my experience has been that the brew time suggested is a little long. Go with 4 rather than 5, and that might help if you are nervous that the tea is going to be especially bitter. Really, this tea, if properly made, is not bitter at all. In fact, I never add sugar or sweeteners to any tea, and Lapsang tastes slightly sweet to me on its own.<br /><br />For a supermarket tea, this is a bargain. I got a 20-count in the grocery store on a 2 for 5-buck sale, and it's hard to beat roughly 12 cents for a pour, for this quality. To give you a comparison, I'm currently curing a Yixing teapot with a premium green tea that ran 40-some dollars for the quarter-pound. Consider that this Lapsang is costing you malt-liquor prices and you may be a bit more charitable with your expectations.<br /><br />And by the way, premium lapsang souchong is out there, but based on reviews I've read on other sites, many drinkers don't find that the taste is significantly enhanced, unlike other teas, which really do tend to get progressively better as the price increases.
