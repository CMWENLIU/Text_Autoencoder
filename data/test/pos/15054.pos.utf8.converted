I know whole wheat pasta is better for you, but I've always disliked its heaviness and chewiness - its lack of buoyancy. Then I found Bionaturae. Forget all other newcomers in the "healthy" pasta sweepstakes. This organic supplier of the Italian fundamentals (pasta, tomatoes, olive oil, etc.) is really good. The whole wheat pastas are a game-changer. They'll have you experimenting with sturdier sauces that complement their delicately nutty flavor: try saute&eacute;ing broccoli with bits of sun dried tomatoes, capers, pine nuts, lemon zest, olives, then combining it and the pasta with nothing but a cup of pasta water (add some dried currants if you like). Out with the white stuff and in with this more nutritious, more delicious Tuscan brown product. You won't go back.
