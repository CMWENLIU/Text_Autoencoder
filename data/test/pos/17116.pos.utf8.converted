I first tried this nut and spice delight at Costco........I had some of the samples that were offered that day and I choose to purchase the Sing Buri. My goodness this is good!! The flavors are just right. You know how a really good (Asian or French) sauce holds together and has a progression of flavors? I found that this happens with the nuts and chili and lemongrass.<br /><br />Really, this is a gorgeous snack and healthy too!<br /><br />Now that Amazon is offering this company's products, I ordered 2. And with the nice 10 bucks off, this is a very nice bargain!<br /><br />Depending on your palate (some folks are happy with Planters nuts you know), I think you will be delighted with this choice!<br /><br />Scrumptious!
