I was introduced to Nutella when I lived in France a few years ago.  Yep, got addicted; but had to cold-turkey when I left France.  Now I'm addicted again, thanks to that buttinski Amazon.<br /><br />Ah well, I can enjoy this stuff again, so thanks, Amazon.  It originated in Italy; and in France is eaten much like we do peanut butter here.  I think the French enjoy their sweets.  And hazelnuts are much more common there than here.<br /><br />Now, I see someone provides us with interesting comments on the New Jersey version.  That, I just can't counter.  My stint in France was '96-'99 and I'm getting old; so maybe my taste buds don't have accurate memories.  It tastes just fine to moi.  Good stuff!<br /><br />My only regret is the cost.  You know, if we on Amazon can make this more popular in the States, then maybe others (if they can find the hazelnuts in quantity) will produce imitations, Nutella will counter, and the marketplace will dictate a lower price.<br /><br />Sound good?  Try this item and get addicted, then.<br /><br />Still, considering the price of other chocolate products, is it that high?
