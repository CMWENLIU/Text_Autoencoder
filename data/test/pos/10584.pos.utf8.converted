I did not bake them for the specified time.  I baked them for only 10 minutes in a 400 degree oven and then froze them immediately. When you take them out, microwave each one for about 35 seconds and it seems like you are eating fudge cake.  I also mixed in a few chocolate bits into the batter as well as on top.  Filling the paper cups half way it made about 12 muffins.
