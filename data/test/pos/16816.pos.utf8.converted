*****<br /><br />This Woman's Dong Quai Tonic from Yogi Tea is for hormone balance. I'm pretty finicky with my tea tastes and I like it. It has an herby and slightly spicy, slightly sweet taste to it that makes it a pleasure to drink. I usually brew two bags in one cup, which is recommended on the package for overall health and fatigue relief. It is stronger that way, and more intense of an experience, although it still tastes great with just one bag. I'd been having lots of hot flashes and wanted to get down to business with this tea.<br /><br />Woman's Dong Quai Tonic comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh) and is organic.<br /><br />The ingredients in Woman's Dong Quai Tonic are: dong quai root extract, juniper berry extract, and a proprietary blend of herbs, including all organic: cinnamon bark, orange peel, ginger root, fennel seed, chamomile flower, dandelion root, anise seed, stinging nettle leaf, dong quai root (I guess as opposed to the extract), black pepper, and orange oil. Amazingly, I can taste some of these, like the chamomile, and the anise seed and the ginger, making for a lovely and complex cup of tea. I'm impressed!<br /><br />Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Organic Woman's Dong Quai Tonic is an effective and organic way to lessen fatigue, restore your energy and balance a woman's hormones. This healing tonic is formulated to ease what traditional Chinese medicine practitioners refer to as "blood deficiency," resulting from stress, poor digestion, or improper eating and health habits. We've included in our tonic the potent "Queen of Herbs" Dong Quai (Angelica sinensis), shown to be effective in supporting the reproductive organs, addressing common female hormone imbalances, helping to regulate the menstrual cycle and building all-around health. Bartram's Encyclopedia of Herbal Medicine (1995) indicates Dong Quai is useful for a wide range of female conditions, including minor symptoms of PMS (such as mild mood changes) and menopause (such as hot flashes). This powerful herb is complemented by Organic Nettle to help detox your body, as well as Organic Dandelion Root and Juniper Berry to help maintain proper water balance. According to yogic wisdom, women have greater emotional awareness and intuitive powers. A woman can choose to be balanced, happy and healthy. Choose to drink a daily cup of Woman's Dong Quai Tonic and feel like your healthy, beautiful, graceful self." I don't know about that, but I do like the tea, and it seems like it might be helping with my hot flashes (I've been having fewer...whether or not it's due to the tea, I don't know!), which is why I bought it---for menopausal support.<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****
