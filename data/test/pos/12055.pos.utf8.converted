When I found these coffee sticks I was excited.  When I received them and tried them I was estatic!  It was the same wonderful flavor I remembered from the restaurant where I first encountered Douwe Egbert coffee. I moved to an area where I was unable to locate someone serving this coffee so I was happy to find a way to bring it to my home.  Even though the coffee is a little pricey, I am totally pleased with my purchase. The coffee sticks produce a perfect cup of coffee every time, in my opinion.
