I have an elderly Afghan Hound with colitis. The vet suggested that I feed him Science Diet Light for the excess fiber content. Well, I absolutely refuse to feed him any of their products, so I did some investigating on my own. He now gets the Innova EVO with Benefiber added, and he loves it! His hair coat is coming back and has finally put on some weight. He will actually finish his dinner when I set it down. I started my toy poodles on it. They love it as well. Innova EVO may be difficult to find, but is worth looking for. It is also a little pricey. I have been extremely satisfied with this product. I have recommended it to several people over the last 3 months I have been using it.
