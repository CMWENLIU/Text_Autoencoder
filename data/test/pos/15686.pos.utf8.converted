When I was diagnosed as diabetic, I decided to try to control my glucose with diet. One of the tools to limit my intake of carbohydrates is my Wasa Sourdough Rye. It tastes as good as bread, even better now that I have become used a lower carb intake. By not eating bread, potatoes, pasta, and high sugar foods, I have been able to keep my glucose levels at a very steady 70 to 110. I reccommend this product.
