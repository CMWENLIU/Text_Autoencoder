When I was growing up and Mom would make pie crusts, we would always take the trimmed off pieces and bake them as "pie crust cookies".<br /><br />I use this Gluten Free Pie Crust Mix to make "cookie/shortbread" because MANY of the GLuten Free Cookie/Cake Mixes already have sugar in them.<br /><br />I ALWAYS USE Coconut Oil instead of butter/margarine/shortening, which adds flavor and a bit of sweetness. I have sometimes used the Coconut Oil when it is melted, thinking, "Oh my, I ruined it," because then the mix becomes more runny than firm. Yet, when I added the liquids (cold water, "eggs" and Apple Cider Vinegar), the mix then becomes more firm and balls up. THe last time I made this, I only used a total of 15 tablespoons of the "butter/margarine/shortening" and this seems to make the cookies better to my taste.<br /><br />Since I am making cookies and not a Pie Crust, I do not chill the dough.<br /><br />I prepare the mix and press it into a 17.25"x 11.5"x1"cookie sheet.(parchment paper lined, optional)(Prepare cookie sheet as per your own needs for not sticking...)<br /><br />Then, I take a knife and gently cut the into preferred shapes before baking--square, rectangle or other.<br /><br />The oven I use cooks extra hot, so I adjust the temperature down and bake them, watching to make sure that they are light, golden brown without getting too browned.<br /><br />***********************************************************************<br /><br />That said, I like to experiment with how to add other flavors:<br /><br />Since I do not keep milk available, I just use 1 1/2 cups water and add other things to it for the flavor. To the water, I add double the amount of Vanilla Whey powder to make a strong flavor. Sometimes, I make a strong concentration of Blueberry Tea (4 or 6 tea bags per the 1 1/2 cups of "milk/liquid"). This creates lovely Blueberry flavor without Blueberries in the mix! OR try other tea blends/Chai flavors.<br /><br />While I am mixing the ingredients, I also add Four dropperfuls of Liquid Stevia as a sweetner (Optimum Nutrition's).<br /><br />You can add any flavors, nuts, chips, etc. as you can imagine. And even top each little cookie with some spread, frosting, nut, chip or other.<br /><br />************************************************************<br /><br />Sometimes for a topping/spread, I combine Coconut Oil and Almond Butter.<br /><br />There are Infinite Ways to play with this mix and make it your own.<br /><br />I hope this sparks other ways for you to enjoy and appreciate this wonderful Perfect Pie Crust Mix.
