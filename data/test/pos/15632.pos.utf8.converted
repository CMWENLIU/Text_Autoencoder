As a German, I cannot live without this oil. Try cooked carrots with a pinch of sugar and this oil. Do not fry or cook with it, just add it plenty AFTER cooking. The aroma is a dream, and it tastes grandious!!<br /><br />Unfortunately amazon is not making any effort in protecting the metal cans. I ordered 3 cans in a set and one book at the same time. Now imagine, they just packed the book in a box and put the oil cans on top. That's all! No packing material, no stuffing, nothing! A box with 3 oil cans in it plus a book.<br /><br />Imagine how that book looked like. It had been roughed up by the metal cans rubbing on it during the 10 days of shipping! And all 3 cans had bendings in the outside. I was glad I still had 2 old cans left from last time, so I could refill the oil into the old cans.<br /><br />If I had a chance to buy this oil somewhere else, I absolutely would, but unfortunately I have not found any other place yet. So I have to deal with amazon's careless packers.<br /><br />But the oil really is fantastic!<br />If you see it somewhere in a store, buy it!!
