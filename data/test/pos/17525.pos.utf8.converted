With my new Sheltie puppy I wanted to give her the best food possible. I started her out on a slow mix of Origen. I started at 25% mixed with the food her breeder had her on, and even on that small of an amount she had very loose stools and horrible gas. After a couple of weeks of trying to give her Origen, I gave up and tried Wellness (less protein, still a good food) and again, the loose stools. I then read about Fromms puppy gold and did some research and decided to try it. From the beginning I tried 50/50 (I really wanted her off the Purina)and she did great on it. After two days I went to straight Fromms and we'll never change from here. She is healthy, bright eyes, great coat, and she loves it! This is a high quality food from a trusted manufacturer. My puppy just couldn't handle the other brands I tried, but this one is great and it smells great when you open the bag. I highly recommend this best-kept secret among premium holistic dog foods. AND, they tell you on their website that their fish and fish meal are Ethoxyquin free. (A known carcinogen for people). The founder of this company created the Distemper vaccine. Check out this food, you'll be happy you did.
