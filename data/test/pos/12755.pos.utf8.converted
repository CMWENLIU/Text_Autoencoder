So glad I got these. My cat is on a motility agent and I dreaded giving him the pills remembering the nightmare it was last year when I had to give him antibiotics for a month. With these it's no sweat. He gobbles it up. So much so that he begs for them. Today I got home and he'd managed to get the whole bag off the shelf he normally doesn't reach and tore up the bag and ate them all (more than 30 of them were left). I cringed at the thought of what would have happened if I'd decided to prefill the pockets with the meds. It would have been a tragedy - he would have overdosed and died. Thank goodness I had the instinct not to do that. So word of advice is do never prefill the treats in bulk. No matter how safe you think your storage place is.
