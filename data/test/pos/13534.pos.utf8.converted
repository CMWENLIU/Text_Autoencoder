My dog absolutely loves Charlee Bears.  Give her a couple at the same time as dinner, and dinner waits, she goes straight for the Charlee Bears.  Unfortunately, the pet store I used to get them from stopped selling them.  I'm so glad I found them on Amazon!  I can't wait to order some, my dog will be so happy!  Plus, they're the only treats I've seen that will fit into her TreatBall.
