I'm going to give this 5 stars, simply because it is the best gluten-free pie crust I've had. I've tried Whole Foods frozen crusts, and also made my own from scratch, both of which were so tough they couldn't be cut with a knife! I've also made crusts from gluten-free cookie crumbs which were actually very good. But for a rolled-out crust, this one so far is the very best. I did find that it required some patching, and after it was baked it tended to fall to pieces when cut. However, in my opinion that is much better than a tough crust, and is the sign of its tender, flakiness. I made mine with all butter because I did not have the butter-flavored shortening. The flavor was outstanding, and acutally tasted like a wheat crust. Kudos to Gluten-free pantry!
