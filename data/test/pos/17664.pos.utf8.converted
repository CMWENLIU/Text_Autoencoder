I count on this to get enough protein, since I'm a vegan.  For protein, I eat nuts, beans, nutritional yeast, but I get about 50 grams of protein from the soy powder.  I mix it with soymilk for morning cereal, and with berries for dessert...tastes lovely and creamy, but mix well to avoid powder lumps!  Being fond of sweet tastes, I add Stevia, which is an acquired taste.  Since soy is all protein, and Stevia sweeter than sugar, it helps keep calories down.
