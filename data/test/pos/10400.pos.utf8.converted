Chaokoh is by far the highest quality coconut milk you can purchase. It is recommended in many cookbooks including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416580573">Stir-Frying to the Sky's Edge: The Ultimate Guide to Mastery, with Authentic Recipes and Stories</a>. It is also highly recommended by professional chefs.<br /><br />Unlike the other reviewers I had no issues with my cans of milk being damaged in any way. A few looked like they had dents but it was actually just a pressure difference between the inside of the can and the outside. As soon as I broke the seal with my can opener the dent popped right out. They must can these hot at the factory which causes a pressure drop as they cool.
