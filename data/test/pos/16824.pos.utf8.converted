This summer I was diagnosed with a hiatal hernia. Coffee, Tea and Chocolate would hurt my stomach so I had to go cold turkey and quit.When I read the ingredients on the package I wasn't too convinced it would taste good. Wow, I was wrong. Naturalis Inka has been an answer to my prayer. It is like drinking instant coffee without the caffeine. I missed my morning cup of coffee with flavored creamers and now I can look forward to having it again and a night time cup  also. I found this at my local health food store.  I highly recommend this product for those who can not have caffeine.
