while searching for healthy treats I came across these biscuits. The ingredients are better than most dog foods! They're also grain-free, and even though I don't feed grain-free exclusively it's good because it keeps him from having too much grain in his diet, and also the product has a high meat content. They're pretty big so I need to break them up in quarters for my 8lb dog, but they're so thick and solid that I have to use a good amount of strength to break them, lol, but I'm a bit of a wimp (the duck variety is easier to break up). The other day I ran out of dog food and didn't realize it until it was time to go to work, so because the ingredients were so high quality I was able to actually give him 2 of these and another brand of healthy treats for breakfast! We're about half way through our 2nd bag and he's not bored of them at all. Next time I'll get another flavour to make sure he doesn't get bored. I almost feel bad for not giving him something more junk foody. I get ice cream and the poor thing gets healthy biscuits! Lol.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Salmon,<br />Chicken Meal,<br />Potatoes,<br />Chicken Fat (preserved with Mixed Tocopherols),<br />Flaxseed (source of Omega 3 and 6 Fatty Acids),<br />Calcium Ascorbate (source of Vitamin C),<br />Vitamin E Supplement,<br />Salt,<br />Calcium Carbonate.<br /><br />(doesn't get any better than that. :D)
