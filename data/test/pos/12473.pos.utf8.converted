I use this straight into my coffee like a creamer, I mix it up for drinking, I use it for creamed sauces...great product.  I used to buy the boxed- Westsoy, Kikoman.  They are good but they take up a lot of room and I can't conveniently travel with them.  This soymilk is just as tastey and  travels without a problem.  I decided to make it my first item on Amazon's new autoship program.  However, be warned that the vanilla version is nowhere near as nice a product - mixes badly and doesn't taste as good.
