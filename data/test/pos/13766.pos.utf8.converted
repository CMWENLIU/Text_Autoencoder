I don't know where the other reviewer got the idea that this is "compressed yeast." It comes vacuum sealed so it feels like a solid block until you open it. Then it pours and measures like any other yeast. Kept in a sealed container in the freezer, this yeast will remain good for years.I use it for bread every week. At one point I stopped baking for several years and when I went back the yeast (in the freezer) was still good. Apparently the expiration date applies when used by professional bakers who leave the yeast out in open containers.
