My first purchase was the assortment (milk choc, rich choc and milk choc w/marsmallows) but not for my use. I was planning ahead and wanted to add some of the packets with each Christmas gift I was giving to homes with children. Snowman 'tea' pots with matching snowman mugs, complete with 'lids' or heads with top hats. I also wanted some of envelopes of instant soup & noodles to throw into the empty pot just to show that the 'tea' pot wasn't actually for the adults' use or just for tea, but more for the kids after school snacks. No 'boiling water' for the cocoa; just hot water, stir and drink. However, I would never give a gift of an item I hadn't tasted myself, so I did. Now, I'm hooked. My favorite is the Rich Chocolate because if/when I do eat chocolate, it has to be dark, dark, dark. This 'rich' choice is heavenly. I did like the other two varieties also, the milk chocolate and the milk chocolate with the tiny marshmallows (that actually look like 2mm pebbles, but they are white and they do float...)<br /><br />In any event, I liked this stuff so much that I even tried mixing 2 flavors: i.e., milk choc and the rich - still good. Needless to say, I am back here to order more (and put it on Subscribe and Save) as the colder weather is coming and this is going to be a nice break from all the tea I drink.<br /><br />Pour envelope (or two) into a cup/mug. (One envelope requires only 3/4 Cup hot water, so if you're looking for an adult-sized coffee mug full, use two envelopes and double the water). I don't even measure the water anymore: just two envelopes and fill my mug about 3/4" from the top. I like using a whisk to mix it up because it creates a bit of froth on the top that sticks to my upper lip and brings back great childhood memories!<br /><br />The powder dissolves rather easily, so even a young child could probably make his/her own that is not too hot to drink immediately. This is rich, creamy hot chocolate and I'm going to keep it on hand from now on. As with any hot chocolate, the chocolate does settle to the bottom of the mug, so one must keep stirring unless you are drinking it down in one gulp, so keeping a spoon handy is recommended.
