I've just finished my first container of CLICK (mocha). I make mine in the blender every morning.  Blending ensures creamy texture and no undissolved globs.  I make mine with half water and half skim-milk.  It has replaced morning coffee for me.  I absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a tasty, easy, and fast way to get some protein and caffeine at the same time.  Please try from a blender if you've had bad luck with getting drinks like this to have the right texture.  I'm awaiting my second container from Amazon.<br />As a side note: I have mixed it in part with Slim-Fast powder as a way to increase the vitamins and nutritional value when I felt I needed more calories. Keep an eye on the carbs, though.<br />This is a great product I plan to continue using.
