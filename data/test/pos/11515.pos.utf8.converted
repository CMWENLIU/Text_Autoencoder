I read a few reviews on here as well as on other customer review sites that said that EVO was meant for working dogs only and that small dogs don't do well on it because of the high protein level which could lead to kidney problems. I have 3 yorkies doing very well on EVO, but I emailed Innova with these concerns anyway. This was the reply:<br /><br />"Dear pet lover,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting us about our products. In long-term feeding studies, EVO has performed extremely well and no adverse conditions have been detected. Further, there have been a number of myths promulgated regarding links between protein and kidney failure, aging, and other health related issues. Repeated research studies have simply not been able to substantiate these myths: Quite the opposite. Much of this work has led us to a better understanding of the role that high quality proteins have on health, disease prevention, and even recovery. The EVO is perfectly safe for smaller breed dogs as well as being suitable for puppies.<br /><br />Please feel free to contact me if you need any additional information or if you have any questions.<br /><br />Veronica Moreno<br />Natura Pet Products<br />800-532-7261"<br /><br />My advice: Feed the Evo. I did the research and there is no better food.
