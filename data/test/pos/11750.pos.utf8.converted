I've tried many different green teas in the States & abroad.  When I lived in Philadelphia, I had many Japanese friends there who made terrific green tea--but until now I couldn't find one to rival theirs.  This one does.  It's tasty & flavorful, certainly not bitter--even if you steep it overlong.  The bags are interesting too.  My only problem is that the string is attached to the middle of each bag vs. the end--which can be annoying--easier for it to slip into the cup while brewing (esp. if you're using a microwave to heat it) & also if you use a squeezing device to get the brewed tea out of the bag itself before disposing of it.  Still, this minor inconvenience hardly affects the value of this tasteful product.  I'm about to purchase some more.
