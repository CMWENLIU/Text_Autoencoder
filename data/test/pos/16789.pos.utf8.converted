I'm one of those people that can down popcorn like there's no tomorrow so I didn't think one of these little bags would do. Even though the bags are smaller than the regular ones, you still feel like you've eaten an entire bag...and they're yummy! Also...they are great for snacks at work and at school for the kids!!
