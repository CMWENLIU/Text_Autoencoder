At my local grocery store, these cans sell for almost $3 each, so I was excited by this bargain. However, the price didn't totally decide me on buying them, as I love artichoke hearts.<br /><br />These are excellent. They're quartered, so they're much easier to use in recipes, etc. I like to chop them up even more and add them to salads, pasta sauces, pizza toppings, etc.<br /><br />They are NOT marinated, so don't expect all sorts of olive oil and vinegar tastes. These are a mite salty, so rinse them if you're not a huge salt lover (I am not one myself, so I rinse pretty diligently).<br /><br />My fave way to use them:<br />I heat up some olive oil in a skillet and add minced garlic. Once the garlic is beginning to brown slightly, I add 2 cups of chopped tomatoes, 1 cup of the chopped artichokes, some chopped black olives, and whatever Italian seasonings light my fire that day. I cook this down until the tomatoes are soft, then add the mix to some whole wheat pasta and toss. I sprinkle some fresh parmesan, and voila! Sometimes, I add chopped chicken breast to the mix. Sometimes I use chopped sweet Italian sausage. Delicious!<br /><br />Anyway, these are an incredible bargain, and you can't go wrong. Just using the artichoke hearts is enough to go through several cans.<br /><br />Enjoy!
