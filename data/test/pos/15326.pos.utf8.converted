This is one of the best red wine vinegars available for those who want something besides the overdone balsamic vinegar.  I first tried it at a Williams-Sonoma sale when they stopped carrying it. It has a wonderful flavor so I was pleased to find it on amazon and received 5 star service from Taylor's Market the seller who sent my order much faster than the promised date and very well packed so I recommend this great product and the seller.
