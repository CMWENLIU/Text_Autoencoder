I bought this sauce primarily to bring to work and pass around to my coworkers and boy did we have fun with it.  I knew I couldn't handle the heat of this sauce as I find Habanero sauces are usually just a bit too hot for me but there were a couple of my coworkers that powered through the burn impressively.  The first thing a few of us did was the toothpick tip test and fingertip drop test.  I did the toothpick test and drew a line of the sauce across my tongue.  The heat wasn't immediate but I began salivating like mad.  The heat built into what felt like a paper cut across my tongue, way too hot for me.  Others who did small drops could feel exactly where the sauce was as it found it's way down their throats.  You definitely want to try this sauce in small amounts before taking on a full serving.<br /><br />Then there was George; he's used to hot foods and without even testing it, put a river down the length of his pizza slice.  Those who tasted it gathered around to see the show.  He did remarkably well and said it was good, he did end up with puffy eyes and was coughing but he came out of the whole thing looking pretty well considering the amount he used.  I asked him the next day "how'd that feel later on George?" and he just grinned.<br /><br />Then there was Enrique, he did the toothpick test and proclaimed it "muy bien" and ended up taking it with him to eat his lunch and it came back less full and he looked no worse for the wear.  I do know that it made him cough though when he first tried it but I suspect Enrique eats Habanero peppers whole.<br /><br />Bottom line, this sauce is likely far too hot for most people but it sure is an adventure even in tiny doses.  It made a fun day in the office and a couple of guys actually enjoyed the flavor and the sauce with their food.  I can't personally tell you how good the flavor is because I just can't handle it; but those that truly tried it said it was pretty good.<br /><br />5 stars for performance and fun.
