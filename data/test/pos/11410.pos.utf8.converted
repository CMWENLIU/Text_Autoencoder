Though this is my first K-Cup review, Let me establish my position and reasons I came to this conclusion. First, I am coffee wimp. I drink coffee only with half & half (fat free) and imitation sugar. Second, my B40 has not yet arrived so I used my Krups model 871 Espresso machine to brew my K-cup which, is not all that different than the brewing process of the Keurig machines. Third, I gave up drinking all drinks made up or including alcohol in 1988 due to health reasons but prior to that time I had drank White Russians and was very fond of them I just can't remember exactly what Kahlua tasted like except it was sweet and I enjoyed them. Forth, Wither one likes or dislikes one K-cup over another is purely subjective and I'm not criticizing those who wrote negative review. With that established, lets move on.<br /><br />When I opened the Kahlua K-cup I noticed a distinct sweet aroma and also a dark roasted bean odor like one might experienced from a Starbucks coffee; so being from Seattle Washington I'm use to that.<br /><br />I pealed off the lid of the K-cup and emptied it into the Krups filter basket. Tampered it down sightly like one would do for an espresso grind, measured about 8 ounces of water and poured that into the machine and then turned it on.<br /><br />When the coffee started to drip into the carafe and some steam arose I wasn't sure wither to hold my breath or hold my nose. Much to my surprise I did notice an odor like from a dark roasted bean or from my espresso's I use to make, but nothing offensive. I was a bit perplexed; again I thought of the reviewers who had complained of an offensive odor emitting from their machines during the brewing process.<br /><br />Upon completion of the brewing cycle, I poured the coffee in my large mug added the Half & Half until it reached a blond- Carmel like color (but not enough to over power the coffee) and the sweetener and took my first sip, with great anticipation. Not bad was my first impression. I actually enjoyed it. It had a sweet but not to sweet flavor and to my mind, a Carmel like flavor with a medium-dark roasted base of a regular coffee. No offensive taste or aroma others had written about and a pleasant after taste that lingered for some time after wards, not to strong nor acidic quite pleasant actually.<br /><br />My conclusion? Perhaps the other reviewers had a bad batch or this particular flavor needs to be consumed with some cream or cream like dairy product and or a sweetener. Either way, I plan to continue on drinking this K-cup flavor for some time and can't wait till tomorrow to have my next cup.<br /><br />When my B40 arrives and I have a different result with that machine I will add an update.
