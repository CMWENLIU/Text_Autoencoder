I had some trouble finding a reputable place to buy good Jordan almonds for my wedding.  Luckily, I found these.  They came in less than a week and were in perfect condition.  Not a single one was cracked and they are HUGE almonds.  They are delicious and smell great.  I would definitely recommend them!
