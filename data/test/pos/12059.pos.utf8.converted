These snails are awesome.  They are the best tasting escargot I have ever had, at any restaurant, anywhere.  I was worried that the giant snails might be too big, and they are larger than any I had ever seen.  But they are so tender that you can just bite right through them.  These are delicious and I am waiting for amazon to get more in stock so I can order more.  I prepared some on a family vacation and parents, cousins, uncles, aunts were all raving over them...even people who didn't know they liked escargot!  And, by the way, this 12-pack is the best deal on earth.  Order the $5 HIC escargot plate with them, find a butter recipe online, buy some crostinis at the grocery store and enjoy.  The little plate fits in my toaster oven and I have wonderful escargot in 5 minutes.
