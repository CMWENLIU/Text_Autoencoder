These little containers are the perfect size for a 10 year old to be able to make himself a bowl of macaroni without parents having to be overly concerned about them getting burned... even once cooked, the hot water is low enough so it won't easily 'slosh' out resulting in burns (which was my big concern!)<br /><br />Don't fool yourself, these aren't anything like homemade, but they are exactly the same as the Easy Mac.  add a little pepper and they're pretty dang good!  I've even been known to eat them occasionally :)<br /><br />I actually signed up for the subscription service so that I could have these delivered on a regular basis because our local store often only has 10 or fewer of these cups or they have them in the other flavors which my child will not eat.  Plus, buying it this way is much cheaper than buying them locally (we were paying $1.25 per container when we could find them).
