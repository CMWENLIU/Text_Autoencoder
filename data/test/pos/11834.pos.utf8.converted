There is no jerk seasoning better than Walkerswood, and few that even come close.  The flavor of the liquid stuff you find in many super markets bears little if any resemblance to what you taste when you visit Jamaica.  The only commercial mix I've found that even comes close to Walkerswood is Jamaican Choice, and that is still not up to par, having less bite and an undertone of sweetness.<br /><br />Rub your meat, poultry, or fish with oil, then apply the Walkerswood Jerk Seasoning to taste, massaging it in.  Let it stand for a while, then bake, broil, or (best of all) grill.  A little bit goes a long way, especially for "beginners" -- unless you are accustomed to spicy food, one teaspoonful will be enough for a thick pork chop.  Don't worry, though.  With Walkerswood, the heat does not overwhelm the complex flavor of the other spices.
