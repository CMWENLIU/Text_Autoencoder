Margarita mix is expensive and usually laden with calories (well, alcohol is too!). I don't drink a lot of alcohol, but when I do, I almost always order Mojitos, Margaritas, or Sour Apple martinis. I love the taste of them and thus the alcohol taste isn't overpowering for me.<br /><br />Therefore I was delighted to discover these new Crystal Light mocktails in my local grocery store (about three bucks a canister). The Crystal Light Margarita mix tastes just like Jose Cuervo Margarita mix to me, even the slight salty tang. This one and the Mojito are so good all on their own and I love them. The Appletini is a bit too much like drinking Jolly Rancher green apple candy, so I only like that one in small doses. They are obviously not as syrupy-thick as real Margarita mix, but that's a plus to me. It's very refreshing on a hot summer day.<br /><br />Each canister has 5 packets, and each packet makes 2 quarts. An 8 oz glass of this is a no-guilt 5 calories. It's great both as an option for non-drinkers and to add alcohol too if you wish. I've been back to the store several times now and they don't have these any more - when I bought them they were marked "temporary".  So now this is the only place I know to get them.
