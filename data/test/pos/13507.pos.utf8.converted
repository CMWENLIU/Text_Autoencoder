My grandkids don't even know they are eating whole grain pancakes, the texture is like regular pancakes. I also like the fact that Bob's Red Mill mixes are all organic but the price is very reasonable. These pancakes are easy to make and my husband asks for them often, many times for dinner. I gave my daughter a package of this pancake mix and now her family is hooked on these pancakes. I highly recommend this mix, once you try it you will be glad you did.
