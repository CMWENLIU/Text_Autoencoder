This is a huge box of tea.  It looks like freeze dried instant coffee rather than like other loose tea leaves that I've used, but it tastes great.  A little goes a long way!  It says 1 tsp per 8 ounce cup and I didn't pay attention to that at first and my first pot of tea looked like coffee!  After reading the directions, I cut down the amount I used in my tea pot and it came out perfect!
