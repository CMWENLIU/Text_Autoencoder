I lived in Japan years ago. This is Japanese green tea. It might say "Kirkland" on the box, but it is really Ito En tea (which is printed on each pack), as well-known Japanese tea company. The best thing about this tea is that it does not get bitter after a long steep -- unlike just about any other Japanese tea. In fact, I have left the bag in my tea holder all afternoon on occasion, and the tea still tastes great. Buy this if you want the real Japanese green tea taste.
