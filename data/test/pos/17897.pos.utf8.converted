I tried this tea in the flowering combo that came with the teapot box. Now I'm here to buy it on its own. It's the best in the assortment in my opinion.<br /><br />Just as you take a sip, the sweet scent of jasmine combines with the lush flavor, and WOW! A real delight. The tea is very light and subtile yet strongly jasmine. Then there's the flowering effect. This is my favorite bloom of them all. All these tiny little tea balls slowly unwind, dancing under water, swimming and growing until the pot is full of delightful little flowers. Absolute perfection.\<br /><br />And it's good for your body and the planet. :o)
