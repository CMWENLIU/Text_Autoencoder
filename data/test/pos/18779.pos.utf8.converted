From my first bite, I was in love with Green & Black's Maya Gold! Both the orange & spices, as well as the chocolate are smooth and just intense enough. Nothing chunky, chewy, crunchy, or gummy in here! Just pure, fair trade, vegan goodness! The flavor is so delicious and satisfying that you can really get that 'chocolate relief' from one itty-bitty piece. The bars are so yummy, that you wanna eat more, though! We're always sure to have at least one bar in the house (although it does go quickly!) these 3-bar packs make it easier to share :)<br /><br />Yum!<br /><br />I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices. I hope this review has helped you in the same manner. If you voted this as helpful, I Thank You! :)
