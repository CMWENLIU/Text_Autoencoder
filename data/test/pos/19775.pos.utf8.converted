My dog is medium in size, but he doesn't like large bones or treats. These are tiny, and I think he thinks he's getting more, because he gets them more often. They are easier for him to eat though and he doesn't need large ones because I don't want him to overeat.<br /><br />He also has a sensitive stomach and these don't bother him.<br /><br />Good choice for us and SO convenient to have them delivered right to the door. I'm hoping my dog will come to think of the UPS delivery man as a friend, but so far it isn't happening.<br /><br />EDITED to say that this order contains a lot of dog biscuits! I think I bought too much for one dog. It's going to take a long time to finish all those boxes. I probably should have bought less or added more dogs.  :)
