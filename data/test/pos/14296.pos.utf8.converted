The rice turns out excellent, which is quite a surprise considering how easy it is to make.  Granted it is very sticky, but they do call it sticky rice now don't they?  Throw some cucumber or something else in, and you have sushi.  For best results, spring for some real nori, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKWZWA">Eden Sushi Nori, Toasted Sea Vegetable, 0.6-Ounce Packets  (Pack of 6)</a>, as what's included are small strips of very thin seaweed.
