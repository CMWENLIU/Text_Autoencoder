A few times a week at work, I'll drink diet soda in the afternoon as a pick-me-up.  I know soda isn't very healthy for you, so I've also tried a few different flavors of hot tea.  Unfortunately for me, a lot of teas are caffeine free.  And those that do have caffeine are typically of a low dose.<br /><br />Therefore, I was eager to try Yogi Perfect Energy Vanilla Spice tea.  The Oregon-based company advertises the product as a natural energizer, without the jitters.  Each tea bag contains 80 mg of caffeine, which is about the same as an 8 ounce cup of coffee.  One of the first things I noticed is that each tea bag has a large amount of ingredients.  There are 14 different herbs listed, including Organic Cinnamon Bark, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and Stevia leaf.  It also contains natural vanilla flavor, Organic Chai Spice Flavor, and Vanilla Bean.<br /><br />You are instructed to use 8 oz of water and steep the bag for 4-6 minutes (longer than a typical tea bag).  Simply put, this is a great tasting tea.  I especially think it's good for people who are not used to drinking normal tea, since the Stevia leaf adds natural sweet flavor.  You don't need to waste calories by adding in your own sugar.  So in terms of taste, I would give it 5 stars.  In terms of energy boost, I would give it 4 stars.  It did not give me as much of an alertness boost as coffee does, but there was definitely a noticeable pick-me-up.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great product for those that like mildly sweet vanilla flavor, or for those that need more caffeine from their tea bag.  I will definitely be ordering these for my office.
