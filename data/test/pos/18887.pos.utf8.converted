I don't normally write reviews (this is my first one on Amazon!) but this product is a-maz-ing!<br /><br />I have a 17 year old dog with a whole list of health problems... least of all is the fact that she has five teeth.  She's now on a steady diet of canned soft dog food and tons of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ILEIUE">Blue Dog Bakery Natural Soft Dog Treats, Peanut Butter Flavor Softies, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  After a LONG search for a treat that was actually soft (we had gotten into the habit of grinding other "soft" treats in the food processor because they weren't quite soft enough) we found these.  These treats are fabulous.<br /><br />First of all, my dog LOVES them.  She may be blind and deaf, but she knows her way to her treat plate and gets up to check it about once every 30 minutes just to make sure we didn't leave any happy surprises for her.  She can't get enough of these treats.<br /><br />The reason why I love these treats, though, is because I no longer have to drag out the food processor to grind up other brand's so called "soft" treats!  They easily break apart with your fingers and are soft enough for my dog to eat, probably even whole (she's a 17 lb dog, though, so we'll continue to break them up with our fingers!).  Think fig newton.  That soft.  Think no longer having to wash the food processor.  THAT HAPPY.  :)  Plus, they're much cheaper on amazon than at my local petsmart and I'm not spending any money on gas!<br /><br />I guess the one "complaint" I have with these treats is that they look like real "people" food!  When we first got these, my dad saw them in the (new) glass treat container and thought they were for people.  However, he didn't think they were quite as delicious as my dog thinks they are... He said they were "a little chalky."  I guess they weren't baked with his palate in mind!
