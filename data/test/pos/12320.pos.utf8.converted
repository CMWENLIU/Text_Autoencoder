Well, Baked Beans make you do a few things, but they sure keep you regular. They are also a great way to jazz up a meal in minutes. Heinz have almost made them a trade mark, and there are none to rival Heinz's beans, in my opinion. With toast, eggs, meat pies, potatoes and just about any other food, (I have not tried them with ice cream, yet), they are a good boost to protein levels and energy. Heinz simply are the best in this food group.
