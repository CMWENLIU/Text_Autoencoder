I tried everything to get my mole to leave peacefully. I sprayed castor oil, used mole repellent pellets, etc. He might leave for a week or two, but then he would be back.<br /><br />I purchased the Victor Mole Trap, read the instructions, studied a bit on the web, and rid my yard of moles in three days. GREAT product.<br /><br />The previous reviewers don't understand that you're not really trying to "trap" the mole with the spikes. In all likelihood you will maim the mole and he will go off to die. You won't really know whether you got him until you notice that no new tunnels are being built. And you do need to pay attention to your yard before setting the trap. Figure out where the mole likes to travel by flattening his tunnels and watching where they reappear. Try to think like the mole and you'll get him.
