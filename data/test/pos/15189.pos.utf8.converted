I am korean and frequently eat at all the best asian restaurants around town. I've tasted the best and worst chajang noodles. With that said, for about $1 a pack (or less), these are AWESOME. Great texture, consistency, and flavor.<br /><br />A tip for you all: Don't boil the water first and then add the noodles. I recommend having the noodles in the cold water as you bring it up to a boil. For some reason it adds another level and the noodles come out tasting better.
