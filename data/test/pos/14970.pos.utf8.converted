I certainly didn't know as much about honey as I do now after researching, buying and using Wedderspoon raw organic Manuka honey.  A teaspoon a day in green or organic tea or vinegar and water is the amount that seems to give me more energy and, best of all, seems to give me some immunity to contagious diseases.  I cannot tolerate an antibiotic internally; I believe the antibiotic qualities of Manuka honey provide healthy assistance to my immune system.  The fact that honey will never spoil tells us something very important . . . and it also tastes good!
