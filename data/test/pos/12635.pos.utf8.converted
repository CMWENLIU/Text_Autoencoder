I ordered these on impulse. It had been a while since I had tried figs.<br /><br />I'm glad I did. These are delicious. They taste like the best Fig Newtons you've ever had, but without any added sugar, flour, or shortening.<br /><br />It's rare to find dried fruits that aren't chemically treated in some way, but these are organic and have no added sulfites or any other chemicals.<br /><br />They are a bit pricey, and there are only a dozen or so figs in each of the six seven-ounce bags. That's okay with me, though -- they aren't exactly low calorie snacks, so that's good incentive for me to not overdo it!<br /><br />And who cares how they look -- they taste great!
