There are already plenty of reviews stating how wonderful these apricots are so I won't bother to add my rave review to the others. Instead I would like to correct the nutritional facts since once again Amazon has gotten them wrong.<br /><br />Here is the info taken straight from the actual product label (July 2011):<br /><br />Serving size 1/4 cup (40g)<br /><br />Calories per serving 100<br /><br />Servings per container about 11<br /><br />Total Fat 0g<br /><br />Saturated Fat 0g<br /><br />Trans Fat 0g<br /><br />Cholesterol 0mg<br /><br />Sodium 15mg<br /><br />Potassium 390mg<br /><br />Total Carbs 23g<br /><br />Dietary Fiber 3g<br /><br />Sugars 21g<br /><br />Protein 1g<br /><br />Vitamin A 10% of Daily values based on a 2000 calorie diet<br /><br />Vitamin C 2% of Daily values based on a 2000 calorie diet<br /><br />Calcium 4% of Daily values based on a 2000 calorie diet<br /><br />Iron 6% of Daily values based on a 2000 calorie diet<br /><br />I hope you find this helpful.
