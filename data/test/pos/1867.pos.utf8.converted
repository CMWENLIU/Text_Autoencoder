Exactly what I was looking for!  After a coworker brought back these treats from her trip to Amsterdam, I was determined to find some to give in holiday gift baskets.  I knew I could count on Amazon to have vendors that imported these gooey little cookie "cup covers." Of course, I saved some for my family, and they were awesome.  I was also very impressed with the quick vendor shipping & careful packaging - not one was broken.
