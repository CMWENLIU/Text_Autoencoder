I am a chocolate fan, I love milk chocolate but I love dark chocolate as well. I saw this and purchased it and I have to say I am superbly delighted. You have to be a dark chocolate fan to really enjoy this, though. Its crisp, it snaps, it has a warm melt in your mouth velvety appeal yet is very bold and in your face. I am also pleased about the ingredients as there is not a whole lot to them. I really loved this chocolate and will be purchasing it again. Thank you Ghirardelli for making such a wonderful, warm and bold chocolate!
