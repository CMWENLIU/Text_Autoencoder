My Sasha is a Pitt Bull like Isaboo, the dog Rachel Ray designed the food for. Sasha couldn't stay interrested in the flavor of any other food I tried, and everything not 100% natural gave her horrible gas. Nutrish finally took care of all that. She gets excited to eat, and never has gas anymore. Plus, meat is the #1 ingredient, and there are no meat by-products. I recommend it to anyone.
