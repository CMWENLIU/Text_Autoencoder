My dog had an infected tick bite on his neck. It was about the size of a nickle and looked so bad I was sure we would be going to the Vet. I took a finger full of manuka and rubbed it on the infection. I did this twice a day and made sure to keep dirt and other things from getting stuck in the honey. After about 4 days it looked a thousand times better and decided we didn't need to go to the vet. I figured I used less than 5 dollars worth of honey to treat his infected wound and if we had gone to the vet I am sure the bill would have been close to what I paid for the whole jar of honey. This stuff is the best, it saved me money and the time it would take to go to the vet. I also make a pre-work out energy drink using the honey. I take a spoon of honey and mix it with some lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, cinnamon and water. I put all the ingredients in to a bottle with a lid and then just shake until the honey is dissolved. One of the most practical things to have in your house for both people and pets! Also when I go camping I use it for first aid and eat some when I need the energy. The latest jar I have received was from Health and Beauty pros and it is also batch #13. The quality of this particular batch is just the same if not better than all of the other jars I have had.
