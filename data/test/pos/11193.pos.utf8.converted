I just received this thai tea and it was just amazing!  I had recently gone to a thai restaurant and had the iced thai tea and I wanted to make it at home. I tried this tea and it tasted exactly like the restaurant tea.  They shipped it to me within two days.  The price was very reasonable.  I have no complaints.  I will continue to order this item in the future.
