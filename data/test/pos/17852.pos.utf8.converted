Even though this bread is gluten free I love it, and I am not on a restrictive diet.  We bought this bread because my wife is a celiac but I love the bread too.  One recommendation, definately keep the dough less than 1/4 inch think like the directions say otherwise the outside will get too hard and the center nearly raw.
