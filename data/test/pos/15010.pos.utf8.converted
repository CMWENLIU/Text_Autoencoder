I didn't know if I would like this or not but I do like it. I will buy more in the near future.  I recommend it. I opened the can and took the bread out and microwaved it just for a minute or two to heat it up. It was absolutely delicious and I ate every bit of it. To me it tasted like a cake. It is very rich tasting. It is great to keep around for when you want something rich and delicious with no cooking and it is 99% fat free.
