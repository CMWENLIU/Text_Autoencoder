Not only is this excellent coffee when prepared in conventional coffee makers, but it's my preferred brand and flavor for my 16 ounce mocha cappuccino every morning.<br />I like being able to order it in the three-pack, especially with no shipping charge thanks to my Amazon Prime account, because it assures I have plenty on hand.<br />Also, this is a much better price than I pay for the same product at my local supermarket.<br />+++++<br />UPDATED ON AUG. 11, 2012<br />At $40+, this is way too expensive. I can buy the same three packages at my local Kroger supermarket for $26.97 ($8.99/package).
