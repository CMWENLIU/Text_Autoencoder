I am a very fussy coffee drinker and this is, without any doubt at all, the best of the decafs available.  You feel like you've had a 'real' cup of coffee.......not too weak, not too strong, but with a rich look and taste.  No one, on a dare, could ever tell that this isn't regular coffee or 'high-test' as I like to call it.  For the record, I've tried many different brands and Tully in general is always very good.
