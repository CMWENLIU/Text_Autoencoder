I'm a big fan of chicken and tuna (and mermaids) so when I saw 48 cans on sale, I had to click Add to Cart. WHAT a MISTAKE. While tuna is nutritious and can easily be turned into various meals (tuna salad, tuna sandwich, tuna in a bowl, tuna as cat food...) you have to be able to REACH the tuna! This tuna is surrounded by a tough, cylindrical barrier. It is smooth, round, and looks and sounds like metal when you throw it against the wall so i'm pretty sure it's some type of new plastic made in China. I would stay away from this unless your cart also contains a can opener made in China.
