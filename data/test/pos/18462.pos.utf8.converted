I could drink cup after cup after cup of Harney and Sons Hot Cinnamon Spice Tea. And everyone around you will be able to smell the spicy cinnamon steaming out of your cup and will start drooling. This stuff is HEAVEN!<br /><br />Yes, you can buy the tea bags for much cheaper, but I happen to really like the sachets. They're pretty, a bit more flavorful, and just make you feel elegant. However, I also keep some of the tea bags on hand since I tend to way overdose on this tea. Try it and fall in love!
