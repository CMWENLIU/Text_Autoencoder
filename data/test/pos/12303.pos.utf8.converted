Bitters are making a resurgence these days and I know many bars (at least here in NYC) are bringing back a properly made cocktail.  Looking at old cocktail books from the 20s, 30s, and 40s I found that bitters were a key ingredient in many classic cocktails.  After doing extensive research I learned that Regan's made some of the best, if not the best, orange bitters (go to their website and read the story behind this product).  Your other choices are Fee Brothers and Angostura.  Regan's however gets, and in my opinion, deserves top billing when it comes to orange bitters.  These bitters are great in a variety of drinks and I usually put two dashes in my Old Raj martinis.  Although you don't get a strong orange flavor per se you do notice that these bitters subtly enhance the complexity of the drink.  Try these and you won't be disappointed.  Go to Regan's website to find literally hundreds of drink recipes that use their bitters.  You'll be inspired to make something more than a boring vodka tonic or gin martini.
