I've tried lots of brands of chocolate chips (yes, I'm a chocolate snob) and only Nestle or Hershey tastes great in your cookie--don't waste your money on store brand or Ghirardelli.  This size package is for the serious cookie baker, but the price from this vendor I see today is more expensive than buying smaller packages in the grocery store.  Sam's Club has this for under $12.
