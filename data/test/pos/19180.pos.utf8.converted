This has to be one of the best bargains on green tea ever.  No, it's not a high-end gourmet tea - but it's not intended to be.  What it IS, is a terrific everyday green tea.  Mellow, slightly earthy, and very pleasant on the palate.  Second brewing yields a good cup, as well.  As with every Davidson' tea I've ordered, the quality of the leaves was wonderful, with very little dust, or stems.  It's obvious that they care about their product, and it shows. The origin is not stated, but who cares?  The tea is just fine.<br /><br />EDIT: I recently received my third order of this tea, and this batch was, quite simply, awful. The bag was mis-labeled, and is not green tea.  As we immediately store tea in sealed containers when it arrives, I do not have the original packaging, and can't return it (thank heavens it was inexpensive).  I have had great luck with Davidson's in the past, and assume that this was a fluke mistake, but, BE CAREFUL TO CHECK THE CONTENTS!
