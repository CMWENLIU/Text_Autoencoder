This is an amazing find.  It tastes like brown sugar, but even better.<br /><br />It doesn't seem to affect my blood sugar levels too much, and it seems to even boost my real energy levels.<br /><br />That is because it has minerals, 17 amino acids, B vitamins, and Vitamin C in it.  It is not processed, which is why it is so good overall, I think.
