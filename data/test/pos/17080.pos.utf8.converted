I won't say we've tried every cat litter there is, but we've sure gone through a lot. We finally settled on a popular clay/crystals blend that worked pretty well, and were using a Litter Locker for disposing of the clumps and feces. Nothing like a plastic container full of used kitty litter to really glam up your bathroom, eh? But when our big Siberian cat developed bladder stones and a stubborn UTI, my research into her conditions led me to too many horror stories about the dangers of clumping clay litters. Eventually, I started seeing references to a cat litter made of pellets formed from shredded green tea leaves (a natural antimicrobial) which had solved health problems for other UTI-prone cats, and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Finding it was a challenge - although it's apparently the most popular cat litter in Japan, it's only carried by one small pet store within a 30-minute drive from our home. And expensive, whew! We nearly fainted. But that first bag was a life-changer for us and our kitties. All three cats took to it right away. It doesn't stick to their paws or their backsides, which did wonders for helping clear up the UTI. There's no added fragrance, but the litter itself has a light, herbal scent that's quite pleasant. It's so lightweight that I can carry three bags of it upstairs all by myself. And it's flushable! (Our three cats have all been tested and found parasite-free, so I flush with a clear conscience.) The urine clumps - which form under the surface of the litter - are just firm enough to scoop easily, and quickly dissolve when they hit the toilet water so you aren't actually flushing clumps. Buh-bye, Litter Locker!<br /><br />This litter doesn't control odor as well as the clay-crystals blend, but I've gotten in the habit of scooping/flushing every time I use the bathroom myself, so odor doesn't last long. The lightness of it means it scatters more than I like, but my cats scatter every litter anyway. At least it isn't painful to step on with bare feet! I keep a small whisk broom/dustpan combo next to the catbox and sweep up two or three times a day, as I've always done. I refuse to have a covered catbox for health reasons, but I do wish our box had higher sides! And I'm hoping as this brand becomes more popular, it will drop in cost and become easier to find. I'm happy to find it here on Amazon.<br /><br />Next Gen Green Tea Leaves cat litter isn't perfect, but it's darn close. So until they invent a cat litter that turns into rose petals when used and is self-regenerating, this one will do.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/24/11: They seem to have tweaked the formula for this cat litter - we've noticed it now seems more effective at controlling odor. We went out of town for four days, and the friend who came over to feed our cats completely forgot to scoop the catbox - for the entire time! With three cats using the same box, you'd think the odor would have alerted her. But even though when we got home the box was a mess, it still didn't stink. Amazing stuff.
