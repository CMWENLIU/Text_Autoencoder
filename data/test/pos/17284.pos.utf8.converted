These are by far the very best GF crackers we have ever had!  We bought them at a GF specialty shop for the first time and we tried themn as soon as we got home because they looked so yummy on the package.  We almost finished the package in one sitting!  We ate them with slices of cheddar cheese and we were in heaven!  They are very well packaged, so all of the crackers were in great shape.  I'm so happy to see that we can now buy them in bulk from Amazon :-)  Try them, you will love them!!
