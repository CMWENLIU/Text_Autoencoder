Campbell's tomato soup is my favorite, and now I can bring it with me to work without the waste of an entire can or the inconvenience of re-packaging at home.<br /><br />Just be aware to watch it very carefully in the microwave, because it tends to bubble over if you leave it in too long because the soup is so thick.
