our cat only ate 9 lives wet and dry.  then one day she started vomitting.  and it wouldn't stop.  after every meal i would find surprises all around the house.  mind you,... i could care less about my cat (it's my husbands and the cat and i hate each other) but i actually felt bad for her.  so i researched and tried other kinds and then came across natural balance.  she loves it!  wet and dry and no vomitting!!!  it's a little expensive, but cheeper than the vet or tons of carpet cleaner.  i just wish more stores sold it so i wouldn't have to drive so far to pick it up.  her coat is shiny and no dandruff.  i don't remember the last time she vommitted.  and she even seems to be acting better (nicer) since the new food.  it did wonders on her!
