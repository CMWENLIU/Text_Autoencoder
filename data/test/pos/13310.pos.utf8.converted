About 12 years ago we took in a kitten who liked to get into things like string, rubber bands, ribbons, etc. This is dangerous because these items can get twisted around their intestines and cause severe illness or death. We began to be very diligent about hiding these items from him by the time he was six months old. Unfortunately, by then so much damage was done to his intestinal tract because of all of his "unauthorized snacks"  that he had constant loose bowels, was too thin, etc. This went on for about seven years, until we moved to a new town and got a new vet who suggested Royal Canin Feline Special 33. Not only have his stools been firm (and not so stinky) for the past five years, but he has put on weight and has a lovely glossy coat.<br /><br />This food is pricey but, if your vet recommends it, it's a good value for your cat's longevity and also quality of life. Fletcher is much happier ever since he can eat without immediately having to visit the litter box.
