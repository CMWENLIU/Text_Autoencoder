The coffee is smooth, not acidic or bitter like most American coffee, it's ground finer than American coffee also so it's trial and error until you get it perfect. The caffeine doesn't make me jittery like other coffees do which is a bonus for me. It's perfect as a breakfast or dessert coffee as it pairs well with food.
