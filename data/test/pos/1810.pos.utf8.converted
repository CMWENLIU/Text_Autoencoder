have to disagree with the other reviewer. these sardines are large (usually 4 or 5 per can) and firm. they have a nice flavor without the overly "fishy" or "oily" textures of some of the other brands. within the varieties offered by Wild Planet, the plain XV olive oil ones are my favorite (the "with lemon" variety has a slice of lemon in the can that unfortunately, adds bitterness to the flavors without bringing a lot of "lemon" to the party - avoid).
