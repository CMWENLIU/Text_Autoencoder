I would never have known about these killer chocolatey treats if my mother hadn't bought a whole crate of them in a fit of nostalgia a couple months back (they were her favorites when she was a kid in the '60s).  After trying one, my world was forever changed.  The ingenius combination of chocolate, marshmallow fluff, and just a little shaved coconut seems simple enough, but only Boyer's Mallo Cups taste anything like this...earth-shatteringly good.  My initial pleasant shock led me to explore more obscure candy that isn't widely availible in my region.  I'll never again restrict myself to the much better known but markedly lower in quality candy behemoths who dwarf the Boyers, Pearsons, Neccos, Atkinsons, and Annabelles of the world.
