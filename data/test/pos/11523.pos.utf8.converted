"I am so impressed. This is the best price I have ever seen for this product, The quality is awesome, and they had it shipped to me so fast that I had it within a week. Fantastic price, quality and service. Don't get no better than that !<br />Once you try this, you will never go back to the one-minute processed oatmeal. There is no comparison.<br />I cook it in a saucepan, for approx. 30 minutes.<br />Use a...... 4-cups of water, to one cup of oats, ratio.<br />Bring the water to a boil, add the oats, and a pinch of salt, lower heat to a simmer,(cover) and stir several times while cooking.  It can be eaten right away or put in your frig. and re-heated in the microwave the next day. YUMMY !!!
