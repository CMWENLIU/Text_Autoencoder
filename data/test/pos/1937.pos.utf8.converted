This matcha tastes a little bitter because it's not the highest quality, but it's awsome for MANY things.  If you mix up a large batch in cold water and let sit in the fridge overnight, you'll have cold brew matcha with little or NO bitterness.  Very smooth flavor when brewed that way.  I make about a gallon at a time and when I pour some I add a splash of milk that gives it some substance and really enhances the other flavors.  Also it works great for making any type of green tea dessert.<br /><br />however...<br /><br />THIS SELLS FOR $5.00 IN THE STORE.<br /><br />Do not pay 15+6shipping = $21!!!<br /><br />Hell if you contact me i'd pick some up and send it to you for like 12 bucks.
