I love these ginger cookies. They satisfy my sweet craving with one or two cookies. Definite ginger/molasses flavor & lightly sweeten. I do not have any restricted diet, but I was looking for a good ginger cookie. I was pleasantly surprised to find this gluten-free cookie so tasty. The texture is soft so they ship well & arrive in perfect condition. (I've learned my lesson & will only order cookies that are soft or cake-like - anything else arrives in crumbs & are a total waste of money since Amazon does not refund on grocery items.)  Hope this helps, enjoy.
