THis is a FINE tea. I also recommend highly their Keemun. I've other tea sources, that I enjoy for their highly elevated, fine qualities in flavor and all that is the tea experience for the very serious tea afficiando. BUt they are very expensive. This is comparable to Yunann teas that cost three times or more the price of this one.<br /><br />The one thing I offer, you don't need as much of the leaves as the purveyor recommends. Only about 1.5 tsp. is enough for a full, big 8 oz. cup to produce a marvelous tea, and steep only 2.5 minutes, precisely, not 3 or more minutes... that will produce a tannic tea that is loses the sweetness that is inherent in the tea brewed a short span. Then, sip and find heaven in a cup. And Yunnan is great for that feeling we all want, uplifting, invigorating, without the nervousness that might come from coffee. Though, must add, love my coffee! Yes, I'm a caffeine fiend, but it is legal!
