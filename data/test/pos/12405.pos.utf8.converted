I had gastric bypass surgery 16 months ago, and have spent all this time searching in vain for a tolerable protein powder to meet all my nutritional requirements.<br /><br />Then I found CLICK, and everything changed.  Yes, it was THAT MAJOR.  I add 6 ice cubes and milk, some sugar-free white chocolate and peppermint syrups, a couple of stevia packets, and top it with a dollop of whipped cream.  It is so good that I feel guilty drinking it - better than anything I've ever had from Starbucks.  I am obsessed.  OBSESSED, I tell you!<br /><br />Try it, people.  You won't regret it.
