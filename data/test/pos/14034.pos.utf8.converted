I first heard about fish sauce from Giada De Laurentiis.  She took a break from the 'Everyday Italian' to do some Thai food.  Based on what she said, it seemed that Fish Sauce could be an easy proxy substitute for Anchovies in almost any simple application.<br /><br />I personally dislike anchovies, and don't like working with them.  With that said, their particular glutamic acids are essential to the flavor certain recipes... like Cuban Paella or Puttanesca sauce.  I decided to purchase some in the hopes that I could forget about wasting half-full tins of anchovies for odd recipes I rarely make.<br /><br />Wow! This sauce is pretty spectacular.  I think it has a lot more punch and much better flavor than mere anchovies, so use sparingly, but use often.  I am now planning to try a lot of anchovy recipes that I was formerly avoiding.  No reason to avoid them now.<br /><br />Try combining this with Sesame Chili oil for a real flavor booster.
