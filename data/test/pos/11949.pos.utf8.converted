Once you've made this you'll never eat instant white grits again. These grits have a rich corn flavor and need little enhancement-just a little salt and butter.  I used these to make a South Carolina shrimp with grits that was the best I've ever made. They are also identical to the Italian polenta.  Don't buy those silly cylinders of precooked polenta or boxed instant polenta.  This product is easy to make on the stove top and ridiculously easy to make in the microwave: just bring the water to boil in a large glass container ( I like my 16 cup measuring  cup), stir in the grits while stirring, along with salt to taste, and microwave until it's thick and creamy, stirring every couple of minutes. Eat it soft or cool it and cut to make grilled or  fried polenta.  Amazon is offering a good price also.
