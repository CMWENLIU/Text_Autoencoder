I did some research on the Camu Camu powder to find out it is a great superfood. The camu powder has atleast 50 times more vitamin C compared to a glass of orange juice. The powder mixes easy in a glass of water and did not have a bad taste. Great product to use especially during the winter months during cold and flu season to keep your immune system strong.
