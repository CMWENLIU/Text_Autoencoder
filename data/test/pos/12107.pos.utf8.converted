I watched this product for a long time before buying it.  I tried to make my own spray oil in a refill yourself thing.  That you pump in the same fashion as this one.  But for some reason only got a stream of oil.<br /><br />Then I bought these.  Wonderful spray/mist depending on the number of pumps.  It will go to a little stream like if you do not pump enough or at the end of your spray.  But it works every time I get it out the the cabinet.<br /><br />The major selling point was that I can recycle the bottle when done.  AND it is SOY FREE!!!!  That was the major reason for wanting this.  They put soy in everything and when you don't want to eat soy you tend to pay more.<br /><br />I have this on subscribe and save and will continue to use it as long as it is made.  Excellent buy.
