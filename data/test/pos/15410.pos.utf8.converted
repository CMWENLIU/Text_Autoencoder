We have a 2 year old King Cavalier.  He has had digestive issues since being puppy.  We've tried everything...5 different foods, both wet and dry...even was on Prescription ID for a period of time at the Vet's recommendation.  Nothing seemed to work.<br /><br />Someone suggested Taste of the Wild Salmon.  WOW!!!  Not only is my dog eating, but his stools are perfect in color and consistency.  We were on Buffalo Blue, but that seemed to be hit or miss as well...causing many days of vomit and diarrhea.  Again, when we changed to Taste of the Wild- everything disappeared...not more vomit, not more diarrhea.<br /><br />Granted, it's like wine, some will like it, some will not.  No need for negative reviews, but keep in mind, if nothing else works for your dog's digestive system, why not try it.  We did...and we are hooked now...so is Bodie :-)
