We used to buy Nutiva in 29oz & 54oz from Whole Foods.  We're using more coconut oil; it is good stuff - you know that or you wouldn't be reading this :-)<br />Anyway, we started with a single 1-gallon order to see how "bulk" would work.<br />It worked very well - the order shipped promptly and was securely packed.<br />Now that first gallon is about used up, so getting ready to put in another order (I'll be ordering 4 x 1 gallons this time).<br /><br />I wanted to write this & say thanks to Natures Approved; I like what they do.<br /><br />We're saving our old Nutiva jars to have an easy-access cupboard size.  This seems to have a bit lower melting point than Nutiva - I ordered in late summer, so it arrived all melted (no leaks - did I mention they were great about secure packing?).  I didn't think about this at the time, but being melted made it easy to pour into the smaller containers.<br />*shrug* What's not to like :-  Highly recommended.
