Torani Sugar Free syrups are a staple in our house!  Caramel and English Toffee are my favorites, but I also keep Peppermint, Orange, and Hazelnut on hand.  Pineapple and Coconut are good, but not very strong so I don't use them as often.  We use it to flavor hot cocoa, coffee, smoothies, plain yogurt, you name it.  If you're watching your diet, this is a must have!  DIY Starbucks drinks are a breeze with these syrups (in fact, I think this is the brand Starbucks uses for its own sugar free syrups).
