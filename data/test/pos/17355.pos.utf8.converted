I don't like strong bold coffee, but I do like something with a little "punch" in it to start the day. This coffee is just right. It is a delicious tasting medium bold coffee that is great to drink in the morning, though I drink it other times as well. It has a very pleasant aroma that completes the taste experience. I vacation a lot in Vermont, and this tastes just as good as the coffee in the small country store where I get my morning coffee.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is one of my favorite "wake up" coffees. I recommend it.
