I love this oil! All the oils by this company are the best I have ever used and I keep them all on hand.<br /><br />The Hazelnut oil flavors a whole salad or dish with just a little bit, cutting back on calories, without losing flavor. It is fresh/ clean tasting, full bodied, rich and aromatic. I keep all of my oils in the fridge and they seem to last forever.<br /><br />I can't wait to try the roasted sesame.
