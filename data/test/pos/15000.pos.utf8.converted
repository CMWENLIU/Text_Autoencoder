I have not purchased this brand from this company yet, but I am quite familiar with this product as a number of my friends, who I cook with, use them.  These are a bit smaller than the normal size therefore are more suited for appetizers than for the main course.  They are quite strong and very easy to work with.  If you make an error, they let you off the hook.<br /><br />My friends have been delighted with the service this company offers and they have found them, i.e. the company, very easy to work with and more than accommodating.  If you have never used spring roll wrappers, you need to read the directions carefully or work with someone who has experience with them.<br /><br />Having used the product and having dealt with people who have purchased these wrappers, I feel very comfortable in recommending them.
