I love this lotion. I even got a compliment on how soft my skin is from someone on the bus. It was very random but I loved the compliment and now I make sure to never go anywhere without using this lotion. The price on here is a lot more than I pay for it though. I will keep buying it at walmart. I divided the price by 3 and you are paying over $7 for one and in Walmart the most you pay is $5.
