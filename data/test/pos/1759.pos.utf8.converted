My 16 month old Cockapoo seemed to not like any kind of food we were buying him. I would even splurge and get expensive organic food for him, but no luck. A friend of mine suggested trying vegetarian dog food, and after doing research and finding out there are so few brands to choose from, Natural Balance was my choice. My dog has been eating this brand of food now for nearly a year and he absolutely loves it. Plus, he never has tummy troubles since having been on this food. Other foods used to make him irregular or have diarrhea, but he is completely regular and never has stomach issues.<br />We have him on a completely veg diet and he's the happiest dog I know. I just wish there were more veg options out there for dogs.
