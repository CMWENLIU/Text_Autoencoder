Purchased this for the first time at a local Walmart. It is $4.69 there.  I did not want to get the kind with the carmel color for a dish that I was making so this was my other choice.  This Vinegar will Be my one of choice from this point on it is nothing short of AMAZING, it is not so stong that it chokes you to death it is mellow and VERY VERY flavorful. as a matter of fact I just ordered 8 to stock up, free shipping made it so worth it, plus it is cheaper $1.23 cheaper per unit here than at the local Mart and there going to bring it right to the door No crowds, no angry drivers, no grouchy cashiers, THANKS AMAZON!!!
