C. Rust is correct, the bags do contain a little less tea as they are designed for those who make tea by the cup instead of the pot, something (shock horror :^) the British have begun to do more often.  We also discovered this when we first brought back several of these bags from Costco in Manchester England.  I too wondered if it was worth it as it does take 3 to make a pot whereas the 240 count box size only takes 2 so I did the math and found that it was still worth it to get the 1150 bags.  I just did the math again using the US price on Amazon (yes, we are running out and no trip to the UK in the near future) and it is still cheaper to buy the bag of 1150 bags versus the box of 240 bags.<br /><br />The box of 240 is $0.77/oz based on the weight of the tea in the box.  The bag of 1150 is $0.55/oz.  But even if you just do the math with the number of tea bags used it is still cheaper.  The box of 240 at $19.95 a box is $0.08/bag or $0.16 a pot if you use two bags a pot.  The bag of 1150 at $48.95 is $0.043/bag or $0.13/pot when you use 3 bags a pot.<br /><br />BTW, a box of 240 at Sainsburys in the UK costs $9.48 today but if you factor in the airfare to go and  get it I guess we're still getting a bargain here :^)
