Having grown up drinking Delaware Punch, I was disappointed to see it vanish from the grocery shelves a few years back.  I found it in concentrated form at a local warehouse grocery store, but it seemed I could never 'get the flavor' of the original put out by the manufacturer.<br /><br />I was so glad to find it marketed again.  The only thing better would be for them to put it in glass bottles.  But I have to say, that just having it available again commercially is great.<br /><br />If you like a non-carbonated grape soda with a smooth, rich flavor, then Delaware punch is for you.  Even if you don't normally like grape type drinks, give it a try.  There is something unique in the flavor.  Beats all the others of its type hands down!
