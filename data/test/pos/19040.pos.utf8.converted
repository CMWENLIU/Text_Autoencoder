I'm so glad I didn't pay attention to the bad reviews for this product. Obviously, it's not going to taste the same for people who are used to cane sugar and corn syrup sweeteners. Now, most importantly, the taste is RICH, SWEET and hearty. It is not weak, and it even has some of that apple "bite". The smell is just like mulling cider on the stove. Each serving is only 10 calories, and best of all, it isn't full of sugar for those of us juvi diabetics and gastric bypass patients out there. This feels like Cheating! It's absolutely delicious and I intend to always keep it on hand. Thank you Grove Square for remembering the sugar-restrictions!
