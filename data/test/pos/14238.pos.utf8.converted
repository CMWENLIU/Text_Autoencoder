I cannot say enough positive things about Nature's Variety cat food. My 3 year old cat was having bloody stools that had been going on for nearly six months. After a course of ruling out many things, and with no diagnosis, the next thing on our list was a bowel biopsy. We had already tried a few different foods, to no avail. Spud was healthy, lively, had a beautiful coat, and no other symptoms. Rather than putting him through a biopsy, I moved toward the idea of him having Inflammatory Bowel Disease, which I had suspected from the beginning. My veterinarian had me purchase some Innova green pea and duck food, but after a lot of deliberation, I decided to switch him to a grain-free and raw diet, and after much research, decided on Nature's Variety. We feed he and my other cat the grain-free chicken dry food, as well as chicken and lamb medallions, and I have never seen them so crazy and happy over food! He starts antagonizing me now at 4am because he wants his food. And most importantly, he has had precisely one bloody stool, near the beginning of the switch to Nature's Variety, and that's it. No more bloody stools, and we are both now very happy! The nutritive value and careful ingredient selection of Nature's Variety, that is health-focused instead of "how can we do this the cheapest?"-focused, has been so important for my cat's health.
