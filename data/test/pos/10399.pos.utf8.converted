I don't really get the other people who have made negative comments on these water bottles.  This is a 5 star product for my family and I would give it 6 stars if I could.<br /><br />I don't care about drinking out of plastic.  I think the health arguments are overblown. I get the environmental arguments and work to do my share to reduce, reuse and recycle.  But we also have lives to live and plastic water bottles in my home will be used when we need them when we need to stay hydrated while we work, play and enjoy our lives outside of our home.<br /><br />We use these as refillable bottles. The plastic is pretty thick and durable.  While you can bend the plastic (and I guess release some of the plastic into the water) the plastic is still firm enough that you have to deliberately push the sides of the water bottle in. These bottles are easy to clean and they've survived the dishwasher several times over. The plastic is clear which makes it easy to tell if there is any dirt or food on the bottle.  Because of how the bottles are designed, there is not a lot of places for mold or mildew to hide. They stay looking nice for several weeks or months.  They have a wide mouth which I like to drink out of rather than those pop up tops that make it difficult to get the water out of.  The silver lid is flat and has plenty of space on top for us to take a Sharpie and write our names on the top. You can keep one of these on your desk and work and it looks nice.  The kids can put these into their sports bags and they don't leak.<br /><br />Buying a case on Amazon saved me a TON of money.  No way could I get that pricing at any store in Southern CA where I live. Each bottle is usually $3 at the store, $4 for the larger size.  With subscribe and save and prime shipping, I paid just over $1 a bottle.<br /><br />These are definately better than spending $10 on a refillable bottle.  In the past when we have purchased those refillable bottles, they've never worked out.  They get lost, they leak, they get moldy after a few weeks and I can't get the mold out, the dishwasher warps the tops so they don't fit onto the bottle anymore.  They make no sense.  And stainless steel bottles are generally $20 each and they are disgusting to drink out of.  I'd rather hear nails on a chalkboard.  When you have a family of 5, it makes more sense for me financially and environmentally to buy 1, 24 case of Voss for $27 which will easily last us a year or more.  I can't justify buying a $10 or $20 water bottle for each of us because that's $50 plus tax and each bottle will only be around for a couple of months at most for one reason or another.<br /><br />As far as the taste of the water?  It's fine.  Water is water to me.
