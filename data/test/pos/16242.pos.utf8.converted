I saw this in the grocery store and I knew I had never tried it.  I do get tired of drinking plain water all the time so I bought several flavors to try.  Wow, I loved it.  I tried most of the flavors and they were all great.  They are slightly carbonated and I really like that.  I've never had one bubble over when I opened it.  Once open it will stay good for several days if you keep the top on tight.  I definitely give it 5 stars.  Give it a try you will be plesantly surprised.
