Between MTR, TastyBite, Kitchen of India, and Tandoor Chef, MTR's Palak Paneer was the best of the bunch.  The spinach and sauce was beautifully blended and thick and creamy/saucy.  The flavor was mild enough for my spice-adverse siblings, but had enough kick to please us who enough that lovely heat.  The sauce was neither watery or did it separate over time.  There was no visible layer of butter/grease in the palak paneer.  The paneer (cheese) was chunky and visible and firm.  All in all, it was the closest I could find to the delicious palak paneer.
