I buy this delicious spread directly at the Trader Joe's store for  $3.99 a jar, why it is so much more on here I have no Idea.  In saying that, I absolutely LOVE it and normally buy two at a time in case we run out.  My husband is from the Netherlands and loves Nutella as do the kids. I do not like it so I thought I would try this thinking if I did not like it (Nutella is made with Hazelnuts and this with Almonds) they would eat it.  I am so glad I tried it.  It is wonderful on soft fresh bread or toast.  I would say try it for sure but but buy it at Trader Joe's where it is much less expensive!!!!
