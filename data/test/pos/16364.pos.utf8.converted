I'd pretty much given up on baked potato chips cause I hate that funky texture that, for instance, the Lays one has.<br /><br />Since I really love the organic Kettle Chips in chipotle flavor, I decided to give these a go. I got the lightly salted first, and the texture was great. They were very nearly like regular. (A very minimal difference). Crispy, potato-y. Nice.<br /><br />I then ordered these, and I love them. Much tastier than the somewhat bland "lightly salted" regular ones. They're sweet and smoky. A very nice barbecue flavor, I have to admit.<br /><br />I really hope they make the chipotle flavor in baked (and organic). I'd buy those in a heartbeat.<br /><br />So, for folks looking for a non-fried potato chip alternative (great for brown bagging lunch, four servings to a bag makes them more economical), I recommend the Kettle Bakes. Very good product.<br /><br />Mir
