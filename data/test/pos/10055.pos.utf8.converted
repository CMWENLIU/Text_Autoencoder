I have sensitive [to sugar] teeth and these are beautiful and healthy.  Most "granola bars" you find in stores are full of sugar and have next to no nutritional value- no, thanks.<br /><br />These are good for you and taste rather good, too.  They are a bit bland but I like the texture... with what's in them and how they're held together, they're a bit like rice krispy treats, but taste....healthy.<br /><br />Yum.  I love taking these to work for a quick snack instead of vending machine.
