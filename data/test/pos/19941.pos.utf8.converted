I love this crust.  This is the only precooked crust that I've tried that gets crispy in the oven.  I think one of the reasons for that is it's not frozen.  With most of the frozen crusts, I think there's some extra moisture that causes it to not crisp.<br /><br />If you're like me, you tend to find a brand that you like and buy other products from them.  I've done that with Schar.  I've tried the bread, shortbread cookies, pasta, vanilla wafers, and choc. hazelnut bars.  My least favorite is the hazelnut bars.  My absolute favorite is the vanilla wafers.  The texture and consistency of them is great.
