As with all of my food reviews, I like to begin by acknowledging that tastes and processing differ from person to person and from batch to batch, respectively. Water is just . . . so water, if you know what I mean; most of my fluid intake is in the form of tea and coffee both of which I consume throughout the day and night. (And no, there is no such thing as too much coffee or tea. Furthermore, mindful of one of healthcare's biggest myths perpetuated by the uninformed, one does not need to drink n-number of glasses of pure water every day: the body will extract all of the water it needs from any source of liquid)<br /><br />I drink two kinds of tea: orange pekoe, primarily with meals, hot or iced, and Earl Grey. I am on my first bag of Coffee Bean Direct Earl Grey, which I found to be rather heavy on the bergamot when I compare it to Bigelow's Earl Grey, my usual choice. As Howard Wilson noted in his review here, "Just the aroma of opening the bag was enough to send us off on a memory jag." Indeed it does! But as I noted at the outset, tastes differ.<br /><br />To compensate for what I consider too much bergamot, I create a 50/50 mix of the Coffee Bean Direct Earl Grey ($15.95/2 lbs.) with Coffee Bean Direct Orange Pekoe ($12.43/ 2 lbs.) which yields the intensity of bergamot flavor which favorably compares with the Bigelow that I am used to - at a total cost of $28.38 for four pounds of tea (for Bigelow tea bags - 6-pack of 40 bags ber box on Amazon - four pounds would cost $98.48!)<br /><br />In a word, for those who really like bergamot, they will enjoy CBD Earl Grey. For others, like me, who find the intensity a bit much, cutting the Earl Grey with plain orange pekoe will yield an excellent cup of tea. Notwithstanding my "critique" of the intensity, I give the CBD Earl Grey a five-star rating because I find my "workaround" to be inexpensive (cost per pound of "my" Earl Grey is cheaper) and easy enough to create.
