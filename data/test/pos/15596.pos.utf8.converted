Is this cheap, "Heck, no."<br /><br />Is this good, "Yes!"<br /><br />Pu-erhs (ooo-air)are made into little (or big) cakes of tea, and then allowed to ferment (rot).  Bad Pu-erh tastes like tea left to rot.  This definitely does not.  It has a warm oak flavor.<br /><br />Pu-erhs are "double-fermented".  Tea makers let the tea oxidize like black tea, and then form the leaves into cakes.  Pu-erhs take awhile to ferment; they actually have vintages like wine and can be as old as 40 or 50 years.  Because of the longer processing time, pu-erhs are generally more expensive, so this isn't a bad price for pu-erh, although it is a little pricey for tea.<br /><br />This is good pu-erh for other reasons:  unless you have a tea diffuser, you can't make pu-erh teas--they're not generally sold in bags.  If you're not really into buying a lot of tea accoutrement, e.g., an American, these bags are a real find.<br /><br />Each one will more than handily make 3 or 4 cups of tea when steeped in a several cup teapot--or you can steep repeatedly for a different taste with each cup.
