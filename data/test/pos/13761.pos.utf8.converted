I love this blend of tea--I've been drinking it since it came on the market (back in the old days when the packages were psychedelic and quirky, and Red Zinger had almost 20 different herbal ingredients--now sadly reduced to a much less complex blend.) However, Sleepytime may have changed its package but the blend is the same--lime blossom (linden flowers or tilia, same thing), chamomile and spearmint. This is a brilliant mix, the linden and chamomile floral, sweet and soporific, the spearmint adding just enough of a hit to make it interesting. It's good as an after-dinner digestif, or as a before-bed soothing drink.<br /><br />Each ingredient has a purpose; linden is a relaxer and is said to restore the liver (hence, it's used as a tisane in France, where livers are always suspected of being upset), chamomile is a tension-tamer and soothes the stomach, and spearmint is a digestive (unless you have GERD--mints can be irritating, sad to say.) After a heavy meal, this tea can soothe a stomach. As a before-bed potion, it's unparalleled. I drink this almost every evening. You can serve it to children with a bit of milk and sugar to make "cambric tea" which is an old recipe for a posset to serve to children, too young for caffeine. (Cambric is a white, sheer fabric, so "cambric tea" is white and thin, no color.)<br /><br />You actually don't need to have K-cups--just brew a cup of hot water from the Keurig and dip in a Sleepytime tea bag. But if you are serving guests at table or in your office, a dripping tea bag is a nuisance and I for one am not a person who drinks her tea with the bag sitting in the mug. I just can't do it, though I know many people do. Call me a fussbudget but I don't like sipping past a steeping bag. The K-Cup makes a perfectly steeped cup immediately and no messy bag to clean up. So if you drink this on the way to work in a travel mug or don't want to deal with a tea bag, the K-Cup is very  nice indeed.
