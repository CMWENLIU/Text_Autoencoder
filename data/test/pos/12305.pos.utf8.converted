This is the best ever dog food.  It has no chemicals, fillers, bad fats, or artificial flavors, etc. It is totally natural and healthy.  It smells so good when I open the bag, I want to eat it myself. My miniature dachshund is 5.5 years old and my very close companion.  Whenever I am out with him, people fall in love with him. Consequently, he has many ardent admirers so he is a happy, healthy, well adjusted hound.  Everyone tells me how shiny his red coat is, how calm and well behaved he is, and how well I take care of him.  He is the best spokesperson and living testimonial for Royal Canin specially formulated dog food for dachshunds.<br /><br />Recently, the store was out of his Royal Canin so I bought another leading brand of dog food. For one month, that is what he ate.  He showed me over and over that he didn't like it as well, but the real proof of how good the Royal Canin diet was for him became evident in that month when he didn't eat it.  He became a bit dejected rather than his usual, full of life and upbeat self. Even more evident was that during this time of being off the Royal Canin, his coat and ears became dry and dull.  His back coat was coarse when I stroked him.  He became a little less interested in life.<br /><br />Now that he is back on the Royal Canin he is better than ever.  It's like he appreciates the food I give him even more.  Each morning he jumps straight up high in the air in anticipation of my bringing his dish of Royal Canin to him.  His red coat has returned to its rich luster and his ears are satiny soft once more.  I will never feed him any other kind of dog food again.
