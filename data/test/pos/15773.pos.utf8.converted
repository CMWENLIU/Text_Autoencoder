This product is wonderful! If anybody wants good Nestle products buy anything made in Chile, the quality and flavour is so much more excellent than those made in Guatemala, Mexico, etc. This Dulce de Leche is not "caramel" just made from sugar, but made from milk just like the homemade one. I use it for spreading on pastries, cakes,on bread with butter, to eat with apples, but specially in "crepes", with a little powder sugar sprinkled on top!!! Try it!!! I make tons of this because my children will eat and eat them!! I buy cases of 6 and even sometimes give one as a gift to dear friends. I absolutely recomend this product.
