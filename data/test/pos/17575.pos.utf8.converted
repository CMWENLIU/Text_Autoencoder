As an avid vegan at-home baker, I use egg-replacer constantly. There are so many things you can do with this product. It works amazing in cookies (I usually add an extra eggs-worth than what the recipe calls for), it is perfect in pancakes and waffles, and anything, like a previous writer mentioned, that doesn't need to rise too much. On the other hand, you can make whipped cream with it and a slew of other things. However, this product has its limitations (most instances where you need eggs in baking it should work just fine). Recipes it is perfect for: cookies that call for whole eggs or egg whites (use flax and water instead for egg yolks or agar-agar in gelatinizing projects), whipped cream, pancakes/waffles, cookie bars, and virtually anything that calls for eggs (mind you its a POWDER, and cannot be used to eat by itself). You can use this product in quick breads, cakes, and muffins, however I usually avoid this and stick with the flax/water combo or applesauce, bananas, etc. depending on the recipe when making these things. Egg Replacer just doesn't have the eggy consistency of ground flax, and the fluffing power that normal eggs do. Also, you can use it as an egg wash, but it will not brown, it will just be shiny. If you want your bread for example to brown and look shiny and golden, I would try super-finely ground flax and water. Most importantly, this will absolutely NOT work in brownies or boxed mixes. Just don't do it. Trust me, I recently had a fiasco with some home-made brownies. If you are doing brownies, again, go with flax. It has to do with the low protein content of Egg Replacer, but I won't bore you with those details. Wow, I may seem like I don't love this product but it's actually one of the best out there and a MUST for anyone's kitchen. Why have all the cholesterol from eggs when you can use this in place of eggs for most recipes? And just because I personally choose to use flax in quick bread/cake/muffin recipes, doesn't mean it won't work for them. I've used Egg Replacer to make these things before ( I just have personal preferences ) and it worked just fine. There are only a few things that I wouldn't recommend using it in as mentioned above, but other than that it is fabulous!!!!!!!!
