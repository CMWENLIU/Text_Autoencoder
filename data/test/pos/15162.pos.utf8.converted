As a fussy vegetarian, I have tried many vegetarian seasonings to use with my homemade soups, and this is the BEST!<br /><br />Update: One star. I had based my previous 5-star review on the taste and the natural ingredients. Well, after receiving my shipment and reading the label, I was disappointed to find Nutritional Yeast Extract as the number one ingredient. From my research, Nutritional Yeast is good for you, but Nutritional Yeast Extract is not good for you - in fact, Nutritional Yeast Extract has the same negative effect on your body as MSG. So even though the taste is great, I won't be recommending this product any more!
