I had first tried the humus Gopicnic lunch, and loved that. The next one I tried was this Pepperoni one. Yes, the pepperoni is greasy. Really greasy. More so than any pepperoni I've ever had. But, it's simple... just dry it off with a napkin... and, yes, as another reviewer has stated, you will need a couple of napkins for this. I am not a fan of asiago cheese, but it was good. Also, dried fruit tends to turn in my stomach (or mouth), but the dried fruit was very good as well. These meals are really quite satisfying... I mean, if you are starving... they will help (but not "fill" you).... as a lunch at work (which, if I am at work, I really don't want something heavy), it is really nice as all of these meals come with five items... a little of "this", a little of "that"... a bit from several food groups. Nice.
