This is the best tasting salt I've ever had.  I learned about this after starting a "raw" diet and I was obsessed about having everything raw.  I'm a condiment queen and it was really hard for me to give up a lot of my condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo).  I was never a salt user - I'm a self-described fresh pepper addict and connoisseur.  However, once I realized this salt was raw, all natural and got great reviews, I decided to try it.  This really does enhance almost every dish I eat.  In addition, there are a ton of articles online explaining why this 200 million year old natural nutrient is so very good for us.  Move over table salt with your history of ridicule and side effects; move in Himalayan salt.
