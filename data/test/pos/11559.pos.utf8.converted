The highest compliment that I can give this cereal is that it might be better than Count Chocula. The people who say it doesn't taste like chocolate have defective taste buds. Don't listen to them! Also, it does get a little soggy after a while but that just means you're not eating it fast enough. When you're eating this cereal pay attention to what you're doing don't be talking or messing around just sit there and eat it then it won't get soggy. Finally, all you one star people are wrong and the 5 star people are geniuses like me.
