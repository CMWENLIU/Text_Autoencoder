I love this product, but its a little strange. When it arrived, it was completely liquid. Not exactly sure why, but it was liquid for days. I liked it better this way. As it got colder it became hard as a rock. Which makes measuring it for my hair a little more difficult, but I dont care I love it. If you are using this as a hair moisturizer this feel good hands down. My hair is Shinny for the first time ever and my scalp is moisturized without feeling like it has a pound of grease on it. its light and a little bit goes a long way. I have this on autoship, but i may skip the next order because this is gonna last! I have thick hair and a tablespoon to a tablespoon and a half goes a long long way. I do not feel this product on my head at all. Also works well on skin. I have dry patches on my face, this is a lovely light oil. My mom uses this product as well and she has think straight hair, and she loves it!<br />Warning, do not add too much to your scalp and whatever you do do not leave clumps of this product in your hair. If it is hard, let it warm up in your hand. Reason: I add it in clumps and as i went out in the sun it began to drip down my face like water. I can only liken the experience to Jerry Curl Juice. BUT i love this product!
