I placed my first order a couple of weeks ago.  Paid something like $23. Decent taste. Easy to incorporate into my cholestrol-reducing plan. If they work (too early to know), yippeee!<br /><br />However, when I went to place a reorder on Amazon this weekend, they were first $42/box. And now $39.  What's up with this?  Heck, I'm really glad I didn't sign up for the automatic reorder.  More like automatic lighten wallet.<br /><br />They are still around $23 on Drugstore.com with a limit of 2, and that's where I placed my reorder.<br /><br />Amazon, I don't get what you are doing with this.  2 weeks ago they were available from Amazon.  Now they seem to be only available through Amazon stores at stupidly inflated prices.
