The cashew and almond bar is very tasty. I eat these whenever I am hungry and want a healthy snack. I noticed that when I eat these before working out, they give me energy too.<br />I love these bars! They are nice and chewy and crunchy with the nuts in it. Very tasty combination and I highly recommend.
