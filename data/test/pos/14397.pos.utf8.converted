Ordered on a Thurs., shipped out Fri. and I received it Mon. A day ahead of schedule! The packing job was great and all the cans arrived safely without any dings or dents. Cream of Shrimp soup is great in just about any seafood dish, especially casseroles. I use it fairly often, so the subscription option is great! This is a significant savings over buying it at my local grocer as well. $1.99 per can versus $3.29 at the grocery-how great is that!
