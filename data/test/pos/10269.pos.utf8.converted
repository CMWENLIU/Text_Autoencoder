Having cats for most of my life (as in I remember litter that didn't clump being the only option that and actually letting your cat go where ever the cat went when you "gasp" let it outside) I am familiar with the woe of the litter box. However for something that literally gets defecated on and thrown out, litter is pretty pricey. Yet no one wants their house to have that "crazy cat lady" odor. I only have one cat but in my single days I had a LOT more (working at a vet will do that for you) and what type of litter to use, what was safest for your cat, what covered the smell, etc. has been an ongoing conundrum.<br />Also lugging the containers home is just such a pain. Unless you want to buy it once a week you have to carry at least 20 pounds from the car to the house.<br />Luckily Amazon and their wonderful Subscribe and Save program have simplified my life! Someone else does the lugging, I get the price break of buying the larger container so with the savings I can buy  the Arm & Hammer brand which is WAY better than cheaper or store brand litter. It's a win/win all around. As I write this I am less than 20 feet away from the litter boxes and I can't smell a thing!
