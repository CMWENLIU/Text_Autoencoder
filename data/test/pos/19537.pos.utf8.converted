Love this product. It's a liquid. So it instantly mixes into water. I carry around a few packets. It turns any water, bottled or tap, into something that tastes great. Artificial sugars sometimes give me a headache. Stevia, the one time I tried it, gave me a strange rash. So I was looking for a drink mix that didn't have any strange sugars. This liquid has about a third the calories of a normal soda. So for the first time in my life I'm avoiding all the sugar of soda, plus drinking more water. If I'm exercising, I'll drink it, and take a minute during a break, to dilute it further. So one packet goes a long way. Try it-tropical is my favorite of the Tropical/Cherry/Lemon options-tastes mostly like peach to me. Equally important, I'm not using a lot of plastic bottles as Flavrz comes in small packets.
