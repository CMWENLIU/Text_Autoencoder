As I am writing this I can see these seeds growing. Just kidding but it has been 4 days and each and every seed has sprouted and is over an inch tall. I cannot believe how fast these are growing. I am looking forward to juicing these seeds. I have 2 15x9 plastic containers sitting next to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016NUZP0">AeroGrow AeroGarden Pro 200 with Master Gardener 1-Season Kit and Gourmet Herb Seed Kit</a>. The light from this bleeds over onto the wheatgrass seeds. I dont know if its the lights, the soil or the seeds but these are amazingly fast growing seeds.<br /><br />I didnt even bother planting the seeds. I just sprinkled them on the surface (like in nature), of damp soil and covered it with a cellophane covering. They have all dug in and have jumped up.<br /><br />I will update this review after we try the first juice from these.<br /><br />Overall a fantastic product, performs better than advertised!<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.
