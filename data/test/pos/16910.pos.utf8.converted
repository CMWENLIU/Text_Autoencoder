The local Starbucks can't keep these in and never seem to have a large package of them so I thought I would try these.  Great choice.  Cheaper, taste just as good and the quality is 98% that of Starbucks.  (more beans are stuck together or missing a bean inside the chocolate)  The convenience and price however make up the difference.  PLEASE do not think these are low quality, they are not at all.  Very good quality just a slight notch below Starbucks.
