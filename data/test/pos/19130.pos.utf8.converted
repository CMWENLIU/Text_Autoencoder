I gave these a try with finicky, picky Emmy, only because everything else--Pounce, Friskies, the gourmet little cans--had pretty much failed. (I have no idea what she lives on, because she's determined to show me she's above eating anything I offer her.)  Much to my amazement, she's crazy about these Greenies' treats and would easily consume an entire package, even in my presence, if I let her.  She's making me feel a little bit like her "dealer," and now that we're momentarily out of her drug of choice, I'm feeling a bit guilty, as though it's my fault she's going through cold turkey withdrawal.  I guess I have no choice but to order another supply and, in the meantime,  endure the combination of her loud complaints and constant tapping of her forepaw on my shoulder to remind me of my duty and heartless dereliction.  I just hope I don't have to bring her to a specialist in feline addictive counseling.
