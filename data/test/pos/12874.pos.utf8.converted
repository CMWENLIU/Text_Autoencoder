My first memory of tea was at my Grandfather's house, sitting at his table sipping tea with cream (the real thing)& sugar.  I was hooked on that wonderful flavor & later dropped the sugar & began taking it with cream or just black.  As we grow our tastes change & it seemed that I would never regain that elusive flavor that I remembered from having tea with him.<br />After many years of trying thousands of cups, I purchased Dilmah Ceylon Supreme in 2009.  At the first taste I was transported back to my Grandfathers table watching him pour cream into my cup, waiting for me to sip & asking me "How's that?"  The year was 1959.<br />Not to astringent, great flavor, so you know you are really drinking TEA, & a nice comforting aroma.  Really something I can appreciate.
