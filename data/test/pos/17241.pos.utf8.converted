While at a petstore I was approached by a rep for BLUE cat food and after hearing what she had to say about the ingredients I decided to buy a bag.  My cat has been on this food for almost a year now and I've noticed a change in her coat- its more soft and shiny.  There are also 2 different sized kibbles, which my cat seems to like.<br /><br />What impressed me was this food is made with human grade ingredients.  Most cat foods contain a lot of fillers and aren't very nutritious.  It is worth the extra money to give my cat the very best in cat food.
