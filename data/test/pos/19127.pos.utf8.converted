I ordered this by mistake, was looking at it online and decided i didn't need it & didn't intend to buy it.  Well i must have forgotten to delete it from my cart and when i placed my order i guess i didn't notice it there. I'm usually very careful about these things so i must have been running a fever that day.  So any-hoo i was a little bit surprised when it showed up on my doorstep one day.  I don't really cook much so i thought what the heck am i gonna do with all this powdered cheese???<br /><br />So far i have added it to a steamfresh package of cauliflower with cheese sauce that i was disappointed to find had virtually no cheese flavor at all. Thankfully this stuff cheesed it up up up and saved the day (i was quite happy to have my random powdered cheese package laying around that day.)  Another time i was having major cheese cravings, I added it to an Annie's microwave mac n cheese packet and i was in heaven.  Oh and i also slapped some on top of microwave popcorn, which was quite tasty as well.<br /><br />SOOOO.....I'm glad i bought this stuff by mistake.  I don't know much about cheese powders in general, but i can say that this particular cheese sauce powder has a great cheesy flavor and nice consistency when you mix it up.  I will order more when it runs out. :)
