I bought these for my 3 year old who has allergies (egg, peanut).  I have bought other brands of gummy snacks in the past and she has not liked them.  These though are great.  They are nice and soft, so they can be eaten by my 1 1/2 year old as well.  Organic, no HFCS, and a better alternative to other brands available.  They are a bit pricey and there are not many fruit snacks in each pouch, but it's the price we pay for organic and healthier snacks.
