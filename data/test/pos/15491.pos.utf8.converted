I became a fan of green tea when my Navy duties took me to Japan and Korea.  In Japan, particularly, I learned a little about the differences in green teas (shade-grown, finely ground, and so on).  Since returning to my land-locked home in the Rockies, the only good green tea I've been able to get my hands on has been through mail order.  (If you're drinking Lipton brand green tea and have judged green tea accordingly, you really are missing out...)<br /><br />This is the first green tea in a bag (as opposed to loose leaf) that really reminds me of the good teas I had in Japan.  At work, I don't make time to pre-heat my tea pot and my tea cups and brew it "properly," so I really appreciate a delicious tea in the convenience of a bag, and if you like green tea, I'm certain you'll like this one!
