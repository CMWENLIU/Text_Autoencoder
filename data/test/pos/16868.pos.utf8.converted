I've ordered and reordered these.  They're dried banana chips, and that's what they look like and taste like.  I'm puzzled by the bad reviews.  I eat them for snacks, and mix them in with my muffin batter, too.  If you don't like dried bananas, you won't like these, but there's nothing remarkably unpleasant about them that I could see.  I hope Amazon continues to stock these!  I think they're fine!
