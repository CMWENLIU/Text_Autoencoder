Just made my first loaf of this bread and was so pleased with the results.  I have not eaten bread this good since I went on my gluten-free diet.  Compared to the ready-made bread sold in some stores, it is heavenly!  Making it in a bread machine took very little time and no effort.  It can be sliced thin for sandwich bread or thicker for open-face sandwiches.  It holds together well and just tastes darned good!  I would call it the king of bread mixes for now.
