This is a great chocolate to let melt in your mouth, slowly, and just savor for the sake of chocolate - nothing else.  It might be too dark for some, as there is very little sweetness, but a little at a time is perfect. The children as well as the adults enjoyed this; it arrived fresh, and well packaged.
