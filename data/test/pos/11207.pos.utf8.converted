I'm a mapleaholic and have bought many, many grade B syrups over the years. Many are really only good for baking and cooking uses, not so much for pancakes.<br /><br />This particular syrup is an exception. It has the intense maple flavor of Grade B syrups, but doesn't have the somewhat overpowering molasses overtones that too many of them have.<br /><br />This syrup is superb on pancakes, yet keeps its integrity in baking. I used it to make my maple walnut cake as well as a maple glaze and both came out perfectly.<br /><br />Considering how high maple syrup is in the grocery store, with Subscribe and Save, this was an excellent value, as well.
