We absolutely love these traditional baked beans and adore having them in single-serving cans.  My husband loves them enough to eat them cold out of the can, so he'll take them to work for lunch and sometimes have a late night snack (better for him than potato chips or candy bars!).  We also use them as a side dish for pork and sauerkraut meals.  In addition to just microwaving them in a bowl (or eating them out of the can!), here are 2 other great ways to cook them:<br /><br />1)  Put in an ovenproof dish and bake alongside anything else in your oven.  They'll only get better.  We put pork and sauerkraut in one open dish and these in another and leave them both in a 400 degree oven for about 50 minutes with excellent results (try putting sliced sweet onions misted with a little olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper into a third dish for an awesome vegetable side!).<br /><br />2)  If you cook pork chops, hot dogs, sliced ham or kielbasa in a skillet, add these beans to the skillet around the pork and let the flavors mix as both are browned and heated.<br /><br />These are also available in full size cans and are almost indistinguishable from a slightly different version <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002W08VRK">B&M Grandma's Recipe, with Molasses, 16 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, which tastes just as good and right now is even a little cheaper.  Which brings me to the third great way:<br /><br />3)  To feed a crowd, get the full-sized cans, heat contents in a slow-cooker, add your choice of flavorings (onions, celery, carrots, brown sugar, mustard, ketchup, garlic, diced tomatoes, etc.) and/or meat (chunks of ham, hot dogs, kielbasa, whatever), and bring on the hungry hordes!  Can leave on keep-warm in the slow cooker literally for days -- great for feeding a work crew that's cleaning up storm damage or running a charity event.
