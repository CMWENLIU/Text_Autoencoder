I have to say I am really glad I read the reviews about this licorice.<br />Sandy R hit the taste on the nose. I also remembered the Callard & Bowser English company who sold the best licorice I ever had (at that time). My grandmother introduced it to me. The licorice toffee candies came in a silver box with each piece separately covered with striped silver and black wrapping. It also came with a certificate of quality. I fell in love with the taste instantly and bought it when ever I could. I was heartbroken when I found that Callard & Bowser went out of business. This confection is so similar to the original taste I fell in love with that the after my first piece, I was smiling and almost giddy. I found the best licorice taste again! This is the same original taste I fell in love with and in a softer and freshener candy. I have signed up for the subscription delivery and cannot be more happier. Gustaf's Licorice Caramels are made in Holland and you won't be disappointed. WOW! I am in heaven again.
