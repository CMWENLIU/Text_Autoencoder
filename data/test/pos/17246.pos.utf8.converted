I totally agree with the last review. It is better then Ghiradelli. Very fully flavoured and not overly sweetened. So you taste the chocolate and not the sugar. Good ingredients. Starbucks calls it "All Natural Mocha Powder" now. It works best for hot cocoa if you follow the directions. It is excellent for baking. I actually buy it specially to make my Grandmother's Chocolate zucchini muffins. The staff at Starbucks told me that it only comes available at the Christmas season. So stock UP!<br />You can order it from Starbucks for half price these people are asking.
