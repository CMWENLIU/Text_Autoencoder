I am very happy with this dashi.  I like that I can use it to make just a small amount of stock if a recipe calls for it, and it also makes an excellent miso soup without having to get take-out every time I happen to crave some. (For two servings I use 1 tsp dashi powder, 3 cups water, 2 big tbsp miso paste - plus add-ins like onion, tofu, etc. It's really good!) This is a good value too - a box this size will last me a long time.  Inside the box there are 3 foil packets to help it stay fresh.  They do recommend refridgeration of the opened portion, but the rest can stay on a shelf.<br /><br />Although salt is listed first on the ingredient list, the sodium level in this product is not very high.  Which is good considering the amount of sodium that other Japanese ingredients tend to have in them. It's important to remember that ingredients are listed by weight: salt is going to weigh much more than the dried fish flakes.
