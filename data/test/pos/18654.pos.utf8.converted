I think that is important to know the vendor as well as the product.<br />My 3 dogs (2 Maltese, 1 Pommie) knock on the cabinet door to let me know that it is Toothpick time.  When I open the package, they run to their beds and wait for this wonderful product.<br /><br />Best of all is that through Amazon, I found Entirely Pets.  They are a wonderful company with true customer service.  They deliver quickly and are easy to talk to if there is a problem.  The one time I had a problem, they were quick to resolve it and went out of their way to make sure that I was satisfied.
