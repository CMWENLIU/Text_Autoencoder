There's an award emblem on this bottle from Gourmet magazine, and after enjoying this maple syrup several times, I can see why.<br /><br />I had read that Grade B syrup was a richer, more flavored syrup via Cook's Illustrated, but living in small town Arkansas, had not spotted any in our grocery stores.  Grade A seems to be what is commonly stocked.<br /><br />But this stuff... oh my.  Darker, richer, and more maple-y than anything I've had before.  Even more than with grade A maple syrup, you use much less to get the same amount of sweetness when compared to "fake" pancake syrup.<br /><br />There is no comparison, particularly in baked goods.  Try it!
