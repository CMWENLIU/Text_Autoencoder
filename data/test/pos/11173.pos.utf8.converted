I have three very active ferals that I tamed as kittens.  They are indoor/outdoor cats and very active.  One of them was throwing up his food a lot and the vet suggested it might be the grain products in the food I was feeding them.  I switched to Wilderness "Duck" flavor and they loved it - and no more sick kitty!  The only thing is it has a very strong smell for a dry cat food.  Not too bad, but you might try a small bag to see if you can live with the smell.  I also tried the salmon flavor - One thing I noticed about the Blue Buffalo "Wilderness" salmon flavor is that it did not have the same pungent smell as the duck flavor "Wilderness" food.  So I liked that!  However, the kitties did not attack the salmon variety with the same gusto that they dug into the duck flavor "Wilderness" dry food.  All in all, this is a good dry food that is great if your kitty has a sensitive stomach.
