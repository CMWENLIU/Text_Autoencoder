First of all, we've tried over a dozen coffee pod providers over the Web -- Baronet Coffee makes the best tasting coffee we've tried.  They offer small (7 gram) pods for machines like the Senseo, and then 10 gram and 12 gram "Mega" pods for larger machines like the Bunn My Cafe Pod Brewer, the Cuisinart Pod Brewer, the Krups 1010, or the Grindmaster Pod Brewer.  I prefer the 12 gram pods as I like stronger coffee; my wife likes the 10 gram pods as she likes it a bit weaker.<br /><br />DO NOT buy the 12 gram Mega pods if you own a Senseo; they will not fit.<br /><br />Btw, our hands down favorite machine is the Bunn My Cafe -- you choose the cup size from 4 to 12 ounces, you can plumb the MCA model into a waterline and never have to fill it, and the coffee is excellent.  It also looks great.<br /><br />We have tried all flavors of the Baronet pods -- among our favorites are the 12 gram French Roast & Sumatra, and the 10 gram French Toast and Butter Pecan.  In short, buy with confidence and prepare yourself for some great coffee.
