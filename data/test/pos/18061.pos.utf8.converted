Sylvia's cobbler mix is wonderful. I have used it for years and for a while could get it at the local grocery store,  but now I must order. It's a product that is worth the wait of ordering.  Every product that I have tried of Sylvia's is top-notch. She adds the "just right" amounts of ingredients and spices to make it just like mom and grandma used to make it.
