Compared to a number of other brands I have tried, especially ones that aren't loose leaf, the taste of this green tea is simply great. Bright green color, fresh aroma, and a very pleasant taste.<br /><br />As the directions indicate, be careful not to steep the tea for too long and in overly hot water. When I leave the leaves in hot water for over 4 minutes, the color of the tea is no longer a clean green, but rather a yellowish green and it doesn't taste as good. Correctly prepared, it is one of the best green teas I have ever had.<br /><br />I usually bring water to just under a boil and steep the leaves for about 2 minutes. If the water does boil, I pour in some room temperature water and then mix in the boiling water. Using the same leaves, the first cup tastes awesome, the second tastes significantly weaker, and after that I don't really like the flavor anymore.<br />Also, use filtered water of some sort for the water if you can! It tastes much better than using tap water.
