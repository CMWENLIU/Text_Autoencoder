The only tea.<br /><br />The Irish tea.<br /><br />To be taken only in the morning unless you have no reason to sleep that night.<br /><br />A tea to heal the disturbed mind and soul. A tea for the Irish.<br /><br />Take half and half with even skimmed milk and you will never see coffee again.<br /><br />Wake up and smell the tea.<br /><br />How kind of the Amazon to offer it on line. I shall never again suffer tea-separation anxiety when the local grocer is out.<br /><br />A source of peace and of comfort far from home. More powerful and peaceful than any artificial pharmeceutical prescribed. Take two cups and call me in the morning.<br /><br />Thank you, O mighty Amazon.
