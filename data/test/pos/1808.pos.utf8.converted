I am from the South and yes, I've eaten a lot of grits in my life. Except for most of it I ate traditional white style. Until I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease, I had to find a gluten-free version of grits that were 'safe' for me to consume. Thankfully I found Arrowhead Mills. I have eaten a bowl of Arrowhead Mills Yellow Grits nearly every day for several years now. They are without a doubt the best-tasting grits I've ever had. They are creamy and flavorful in comparision with white, and they are better tasting than some other organic brands I had to try when the store ran out of AM. They are also consistently produced and I've never had any issues with them. If you haven't tried grits before, or yellow you really are missing out!
