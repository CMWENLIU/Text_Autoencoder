I have tried many different salts over the past few years.  This one is simply the best.  It has a high price tag, but it is worth every penny.  If you have a refined palate you WILL notice how wonderful it is with the first bite.  It is a smooth salt, not sharp.  Not overly strong, but full bodied.  I was buying Celtic Sea Salt, but will not be going back unless my budget starts to squeak.  Good salt is worth it!
