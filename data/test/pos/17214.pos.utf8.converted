Just open the bottle and smell. Mmmmmmm. Wanting to eat healthier, I had tried SO MANY differet olive oils trying to find the best flavor for salads, or for mixing with balsamic vinegar and a little pepper or basil as a dip for fresh baked bread. I even gave the expensive varieties a try, and found many with too much bite or too little flavor.<br />Then I went home for the holidays and Mom sent me to the grocery store with a shopping list that specified "Carapelli" Extra Virgin Olive Oil. It wasn't expensive. No stand out advertising, no neon lights. Nothing special about this bottle.<br />But when I got home and opened it.... I knew this was the one I had been searching for all this time. Mild, flavorful, and deee-lish!  Thanks Mom!
