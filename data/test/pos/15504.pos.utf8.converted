This has been my favorite hot chocolate since I first tried it years ago. I cannot be without it and send away for it if I can't find it locally. It is better by far than any other I've ever tried and even better than much more expensive brands. I don't think you can find better hot cocoa on the planet. This is the very best!<br />Kerri Bennett Williamson, Author
