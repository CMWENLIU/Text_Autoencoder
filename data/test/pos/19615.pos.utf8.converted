I've been a gummy fanatic since gummy's hit the specialty stores in the 80's & then branched out in drugstores, grocery stores, movie theaters, etc. and I can tell you about every gummy brand company, flavor, shape, style, etc. because they are my passion. It was love at first taste when they came out in the 80's and I was a young girl. That being said, I'm also a gummy snob. I like my gummy's to have that perfect gummy taste and texture. I don't want my gummy to have a Swedish fish consistency or an over chewy, overly additive tasted and artificially flavored that lasts on your tongue and leaves your hands sticky! (that being said Swedish fish are delicious but have their place in a different candy catogory) That's a big NO! If you're a gummy expert and you love gummy's like I do, then you will understand exactly what I'm talking about. I have bought many Chocolate covered Gummy Bears over the years, both white and milk chocolate which I like equally depending on my mood. I have bought chocolate gummy bears both from upscale candy stores and from the one that comes packaged in a box typically sold in drugstores. I have had every gummy both regular and chocolate over the years and I love them both and enjoy them equally. I eat the regular ones more often because they won't put a dent in my diet and I save the chocolate ones for special occasions. I also don't eat the chocolate ones as often because they are hard to purchase for me geographically. In fact, I have to resort to purchasing them off of the internet if I want my chocolate covered gummy fix! These gummy's both white and milk chocolate are the best I've ever tasted! The chocolate stays on even after being shipped to me, which chocolate often comes off if it's not a quality chocolate, but these chocolate gummy bears are pan flashed which means they are covered thoroughly and drenched in the chocolate and not made in mass quantities. The gummy's are put through the process in small amounts so that no gummy is missed and the panning effect is only used with the finest chocolate companies. These gummy's are the best gummy's I've ever tasted and I've tasted many gummy bears over the years. You will not be disappointed! I try to keep my ordering of these fabulous gummy's to only special occasions or holidays, but they're so good that I'm finding myself making excuses to celebrate so I can buy these sinful but so delicious little bears of chocolate goodness more often! The chocolate tastes fresh and you can tell that the recipe is of the finest chocolate quality. There is nothing I despise more in the chocolate world than cheap chocolate! These gummy's are on the opposite spectrum of cheap & generic tasting! These gummy's are the best! You will never need to buy chocolate covered gummy bears anywhere else! I'm sold and I will always be a loyal fan.
