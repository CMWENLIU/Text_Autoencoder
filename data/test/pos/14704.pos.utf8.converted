I bought these lollipops to give out to a preschool class that was learning about bowling.  The lollipops were a big hit and the teachers loved them so much that they looked on line to see where they could buy more.  Came very nicely packaged.  Just as an FYI - I was expecting the entire lollipop to be chocolate, but the bowling balls are actually coated with a hard candy coating with the chocolate inside.
