Simply great product.<br /><br />It has stopped the cold, flu and sore throat dead in its tracks at least three times for my children ever since we started using it, around 5 months back. At the onset of the first symptom of cold or flu or sore throat, immediately start the honey dosage.<br /><br />The dosage that we have successfully used is 1/3rd tea spoon, 4-5 times a day during a cold/flu/sore throat episode.<br /><br />In addition to this, we use fresh, raw, crushed garlic with food or any other way. These two (honey & garlic) when used together simply form a winning combination averting the requirement for antibiotics.
