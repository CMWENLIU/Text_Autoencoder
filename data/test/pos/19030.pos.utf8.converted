My wife and I love red rooibos, and without a doubt, Davidson's Tea provides the single best purchase in red rooibos one can find.<br /><br />We read some information that made green rooibos something we wanted to try.  It has somewhat different health benefits than does red rooibos, in ways that white or green tea have other benefits than does black tea.  Since we expect to go through a lot, we decided to give this a try.<br /><br />For those without experience with green rooibos, the taste is rather like a cross between chamomile, green tea, and a hint of red rooibos, but with a slight scent of recently-cut hay.  You will generally find green rooibos combined with other flavors in the store--one popular one is green rooibos with honeybush.  This will likely be our preferred blend, too.  Davidson's Tea also has a very nicely-priced honeybush, so do consider this.  Also, Davidson's Tea has bulk hibiscus, which helps make a nice blend of theirs called "Spring."<br /><br />We will be buying more of this in the future.
