I really didn't believe it was going to be THAT great - I was mostly interested in saving the tons of paper towels I always use when making bacon.  I just used it for the first time this morning and I am REALLY impressed!  And only one paper towel was used.  The bacon itself has an audible CRRRRUNCH when you bite into it.  My poor arteries - I will now be eating more bacon!  Buy this NOW!
