I purchased this item at my local grocery store a few months ago and immediately checked Amazon to see if they offered it.  My family says these are the best!  They're rich, chocolaty, chewy, easy to make --and did I mention chocolaty?  I know there are other flavors I haven't tried yet but I'm betting they are also great.  I think Ghirardelli knows how to do chocolate!
