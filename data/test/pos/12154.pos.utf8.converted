This stuff is awesome. A great-tasting mix of all-natural granola, WHOLE almonds & walnuts, and banana chips that make breakfast the best meal of my day! I'm not a huge banana fan, but the flavor here is perfect: the bananas don't overpower the nuts and vice-versa. What I like the most is that every mouthful is a little different, depending on the mix of banana, granola, and nuts you happen to get. Great with milk or as a snack. Even though the bag looks small in comparison with the boxes of cereal on the grocer's shelf, you get nearly the same amount of stuff, and the quality is 1000% better than any other granola on the market (just compare the list of ingredients and you'll see what I'm talking about.) Highly recommended, also try the Apple Cinnamon and Fruit & Nut varieties.
