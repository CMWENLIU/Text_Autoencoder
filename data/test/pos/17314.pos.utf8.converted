When I started having trouble with my stomach, I was advised by my doctor to stop drinking coffee.  That is the way that I start my morning and a friend advised me to try a low acid coffee.  After a web search and trying several low acid coffees, I selected Healthwise as my favorite.  I drink it every morning and it doesn't upset my stomach at all.
