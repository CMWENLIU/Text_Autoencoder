Natural Balance Ultra Premium Formula for Dogs is the only dog food I'll now give to my pups. I have a picky-eating Jack Russell who also suffers from skin allergies. I tried multiple different brands and types of foods before finding Natural Balance- it's the only dog food that he instantly loved, and continues to eat (bag after bag after bag!). The food is high quality and the bags rarely come with pieces crumbled in the bottom. The premium formula has helped cure my Jack Russell's skin problems, and keeps his coat shiny.<br />I also give the Natural Balance Ultra Premium Reduced Calorie Formula to my just-slightly-over-weight Boston Terrier. While feeding her the same quantity of food, she's been able to loose 2lbs in a month.<br />Natural Balance is a fabulous dog food brand- get it for your dogs, they'll love you for it!!
