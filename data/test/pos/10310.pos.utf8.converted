I absolutely love this tea piping hot & with a dash of cream! The chocolate flavor is wonderful & strong, the cream rounds it out and makes it smooth.<br />This is a great tea for those watching their weight, but still longing for something sweet.<br />I love to drink this tea all winter long (and even during the summer!), and it goes wonderfully with a few shortbread cookies.<br />Hands down the BEST chocolate tea I've ever tried! (and I've tried a LOT!)
