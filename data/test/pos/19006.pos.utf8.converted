This oil is AWESOME! It solidifies in the appropriate temperature and does amazing things to my hair. I slept with the oil from the middle to my ends for several nights and already felt as though my ends were stronger and healthier.<br /><br />I didn't use it for cooking, as most reviews I've read did, but I DID use it in:<br /><br />- my long Asian locks<br />- my hot sultry baths (yummy!)<br />- and my skin<br /><br />ALL of which were incredibly beneficial! PLEASE try! Such a good deal, lasts forever -- As I live in Santa Barbara and have access to some amazing beaches, I EVEN used it for outdoor tanning!
