At first I was highly skeptical.  I mean, come on.  Tofu in a box?!?  It must be loaded with tons of preservatives, etc.  However, my roommate swears by the stuff.  After seeing my roommate using it in a variety of ways, I was curious, and finally one day, I picked up a box.<br /><br />I can't believe it's preservative-free!  And it tastes great!  (or more exact, it has no taste --par for course for tofu).  The texture is just like the regular silken stuff.<br /><br />Also, I'm full after consuming a box of tofu (female, 140 lbs), which is only 120 calories!!!  Good for weight loss/control.<br /><br />Ordering the case is super-convenient.  I order it to my office and keep a bottle of ponzu sauce (soy sauce with citrus lemon) at the office.  When I want a quick lunch or pick-me-up snack, I just make myself one that is healthy.<br /><br />The product is also very versatile.  Similar to my roommate, I use it in tofu scrambles (tofu instead of eggs), tofu shakes (fruit, juice, tofu), and miso soup (by the miso base from Japanese or Korean market from the fridge section, comes in 4"x4" cube container..only scoop out what you need and refrigerate the rest).  There is also tons of books out there on how to innovatively use tofu (has tons of non-Asian recipes).<br /><br />bon apetit!
