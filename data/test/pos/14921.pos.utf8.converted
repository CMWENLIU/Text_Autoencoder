I buy on Amazon a lot and for some reason, I kept seeing this honey.  I read the reviews and decided to buy some for my sister who has some kind of skin condition on her hand.  Her skin was rough, red, scaly, itchy and she has had it for about a year.  Sound like ECZEMA????  She has tried prescriptions and over the counter stuff with little success.  I bought this and brought it to her and I said "You are going to think I am crazy, but this honey is going to heal your hand."  She told me that within 18 hours, the swelling had gone down significantly.  Within 5 days, it was much, much better.  And, in about 2 weeks, it was practically healed, except for her skin looking a little different color due to the trauma to it over the year.  This stuff is amazing!!  She just put honey on it and covered it with a big bandage.<br /><br />Oh, and btw, who cares if it is a plastic container.  You can't have it all.
