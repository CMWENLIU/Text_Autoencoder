We have been feeding Wysong to our cats for many years. It is a wonderful food, with no animal by-products(which research shows is very bad for your pets). We had a middle-aged cat in kidney failure who was given a 5% chance of surviving; we took a chance with the Wysong, and it turned her kidney values around to normal!The vet couldn't believe it and wanted to know what we were feeding her.We currently give Uretic to one of our male cats who had cystitis (the other cats can eat it as well). It is a wondferul food with no preservatives. We have a pet-sitting service and highly recommend it to our customers. It is so much healthier than the grocery store foods and even some of the foods available at pet stores.
