A friend brought me a large bottle back from his trip to Mexico.  I threw out all the other store bought vanilla bottles I had.  They do not compare to this one.  It has a strong, rich flavor.  I add to it everything I can.  My chocolate chip cookies and french toast could not be complete without Molina Vanilla.
