This is an outstanding bread.  I can't say enough good about it.  It tastes fantastic (especially toasted) and it is dense and delicious.  I'm especially impressed with this line of breads, and this variety in particular, because it is made with 100% rye flour and not wheat.  The added taste of sunflower seeds really makes it great.<br /><br />I toast it and often top it with avacado or spreadable cheese for a special treat.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I used to live in a metropolitan area where it was readily available, but I now live in a small town in the Midwest where I can't find it.  I was thrilled to find it at Amazon.  I'm a repeat customer and will continue to be.
