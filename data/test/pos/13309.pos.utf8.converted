And it's all due to eating Royal Canin Special 33.  Missy is a lilac point Siamese.  She was found outside during a Minnesota winter and was nursed back to health at an animal shelter on Royal Canin Special 33.  My husband and I adopted her over 3 years ago.  Royal Canin Special 33 is still the only food she will eat!
