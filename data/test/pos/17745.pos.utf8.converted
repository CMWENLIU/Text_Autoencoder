McCann's (in the tin)  is nothing like the tasteless mush that passes for oatmeal in the U.S.. True, it does take 25 minutes and sometimes you need to fool with the water amount and/or the flame until you figure out what to do to get it exactly as you like -- too high a flame, for example, does away with the water before the oatmeal is completely cooked, but remember you don't want it to cook so long that the special consistency is lost. I've cooked it for years but even so when I took a can to our country place where we have a propane gas stove, it was as though I'd never made it before. However, the finished product is  well worth the time. Even unadorned or  with just a bit of grated nutmeg, it has a satisfying crunch and slightly nutty taste. My husband, based on bad childhood oatmeal memories, initially turned up his nose at the thought of eating oatmeal; he likes it so much he makes it for himself several times a week. Two of our younger grandkids accustomed to starting the day with cold commercial cereal ask for the "special" oatmeal when they visit. Additionally, it's substantial; a  serving at breakfast easily holds you till lunch time. PLEASE NOTE -- what I've written refers only to McCann's in the tin; I've never tried the flakes.
