I've always been interested in nutrition, and spent a LOT of time researching different dog foods.  It REALLY  bothers me that there's no longer an element of "common-sense" with how people view dog foods.  Scraps and treats do wonders for a lot of (less sensitive) dogs, and dogs on unarguably bad foods can be very healthy dogs if they have other sources of nutrition.  So, take all of this with a grain of salt - some foods, good or bad, will work and not work for some dogs.  Better foods do work best for most dogs, but A LOT of these foods are too rich for certain dogs.<br /><br />My now 2.5 year old standard poodle was eating Iams puppy for the first 4 months of his life.  He had mushy, grainy, light colored poop (like picking it up with a pooper scooper leaves behind a mess), occasional vomiting/diarrhea and was on the thin side.  I gradually switched him to:<br /><br />Wellness<br />Core<br />Innova<br />Blue buffalo<br /><br />Back to Iams in between for a couple of weeks, once it was obvious the food wasn't working for him.  Some of the above resulted in horrible diarrhea.  ALL were very smelly once they went through him.  Are they still good foods in my opinion? Yes, but not for everyone!  After months I'd rather forget, Castor and Pollux was honestly one of the best discoveries of my life!  I HIGHLY recommend it to people with dogs sensitive to very rich / high protein foods, as it seems to be less so.  My friends/family with dogs are jealous that my dog is "the best pooper ever" - firm, dark, moist poop with little odor.  And that is way too many adjectives to describe poop. Ew.
