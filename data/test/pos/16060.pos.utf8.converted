Product arrived as promised. Prompt professinal shipping.  Extra business cards and ads for the company in the box; nicely done and not too much.  The blocks are heavy.  Heavy. I cooked scallops on them. Made the mistake of adding salt to the marinade though (out of habit I guess)...do NOT add salt to anything you want to cook on the block.  The scallops were actually very good and cooked perfectly, but about 1/3 too salty.  Still very edible, but you needed a sip of a beverage afterward.<br />The salt blocks heat up slowly, but retain very even heat for a long time. I did notice they take a lot of heat to get them hot enough to sear something...our gas range on high did the trick.  Didn't try cooking on them in the oven.  I thinkmy next recipe will be thinly sliced ribeye.<br />Also, keep in m,ind that when you cook on the blocks, you end up "seasoning" the block a little.  Keep that in mind if you want to cook seafood, but also think you might like to try veggis or fruit...fishy apples are not good.
