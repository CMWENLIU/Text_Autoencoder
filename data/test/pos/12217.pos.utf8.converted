This mix is a life saver.  I know a few people have not given it good reviews. but you owe it to yourself to try it.  When making light tasting cookies like sugar cookies, I mix it half and half with tapioca flour or some other light mix, because it can over power super light recipes, but It makes even great pancakes, bread, cake...you name it.  You can substitute it cup for cup with almost any recipe.  Just add a heaping teaspooon of xantham gum and go for it.  I'm telling you...It's awesome.
