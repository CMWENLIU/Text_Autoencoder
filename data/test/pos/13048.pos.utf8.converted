I will be brief and to the point:<br /><br />I lived in Rio de Janeiro for many years.  A daily treat at the beach was to have a vendor hack open a coconut with his machete, and drink the water through a straw.  Naked 100% Coconut Water is as close to the real deal as you're going to get.  It tastes as though you were drinking it from the coconut itself.<br /><br />It's not a taste for everyone - especially if you like things sweet - but if you like the flavor of coconut water as it comes from the shell ... this is it!
