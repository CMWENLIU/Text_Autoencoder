Its simply water. No aftertaste. I tested it on my friends, switching it in their water bottles, and there is NO DIFFERENCE. However, the caffeine is a great touch. I pulled a allnighter with these with 2 friends, going through 8 each in like 10 hours. Good stuff, cheap shipping, and i'm buying again. Its alternative caffeine, if you dont like soda or coffee
