My daughter is dairy allergic and used to drink another brand of hemp milk, but they changed their recipe and added carrageenan which has been upsetting her stomach.  I was so excited when I discovered Pacific Natural now offers hemp milk.  Not only is it free of carrageenan and sugar, but it tastes great!  It is also really high in calcium.  It is reassuring to know that she's getting such a great dose of nutrients and the essential omega fatty acids.
