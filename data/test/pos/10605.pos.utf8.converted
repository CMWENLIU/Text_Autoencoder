In the world of tea, there are a few varieties that stand out like a sore thumb.  They have a very peculiar taste and probably a small subset of tea lovers partake of them.  Lapsang Souchong might very well be at the top of the list.<br /><br />Prior to this tea, I had sampled a few other brands and never really liked Lapsang Souchong.  For those who don't like it, you'd probably be inclined to describe it as a brew of burnt rubber or factory soot, with just a hint of campfire.  Not something you'd be craving to try again.<br /><br />Well, on a lark I decided to try Taylors of Harrogate Lapsang Souchong, and I'm very glad I did.  Taylors got it RIGHT.  This tea is very smooth and has a pleasant smokey aroma and taste.  You really have to stretch your imagination to conjure up thoughts of burnt rubber when sipping ANY Lapsang Souchong tea, and why would you want to when you can really enjoy it?  Comparatively, this tea is better than Twinings.  I have both and tried them side by side.  There was no contest--Taylors won.<br /><br />So, if you have already tried Lapsang Souchong and haven't quite found a version that suits you, look no further.  You've found it with Taylors.  :-)
