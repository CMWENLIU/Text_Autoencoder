I tried this flour today for crepes.  And they came out fantastic.  The texture is so good that my family and friends did not even realize they were made with gluten free flour.  I read another review here that crepes are not coming out good.<br />Here is my receipe to try.<br />3 eggs, 1/4 cup agave nectar, 1/4 cup vegetable oil - beat on medium until well blended.  Add 1/2 cup of this flour, 1 cup of skim milk, teaspoon of vanilla extract - beat very well until fully blended.  Refrigirate for 30 minutes to let the batter settle and bubbles dissolve.  If consistency is too thick you can add more milk until you get a nice runny batter.<br />This flour has so much rice in it that sometimes your batter will get thicker after it rests.  So it's important to check it after resting to make sure it's thin enough to make thin fluffy crepes.<br />You can also add to the same receipe about 2 tablespoons of melted butter.  They will be even more delicious.
