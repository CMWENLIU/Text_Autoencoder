I recently went to dinner at a Moroccan restaurant and has the most delicious fruit salad there.  What made the dish so special was the combination of orange blossom water and mint that the fruit pieces were stewed in.  I bought this product to recreate the dish, and love it.  I also put it in a combination of espresso and hot milk, along with cardamom, to make an authentic north African-style coffee and it is far better than anything you can buy in a fancy cafe.  Granted, orange blossom water is and acquired taste, and I would not recommend tasting it by itself.  It is much better served in small portions, mixed with fruits, nuts, coffees, teas, and pastries.  A superb product!
