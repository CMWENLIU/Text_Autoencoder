Tried a couple of different brand name formulas and our son takes this one the best.<br />As far as people complaining baout packaging, get a grip of yourselves.  It's an extra measure to keep the food fresher, AND, if you read the box, you can actually dump the powder out of the bag into the tub, as long as you wash the tub prior to doing so.  If you are really that annoyed with the packaging, then washing 1 extra tub (provided you wash all your baby bottles after each feeding) once a week is NOT a big deal.  Get over it and stop lowering star average for this.  Bottom line, the formula itself is outstanding.
