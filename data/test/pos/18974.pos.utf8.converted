I originally purchased this item because my mom has been using Coconut Oil for years and her skin is always so soft, smooth and flawless.  She told me she uses it on her hair and it worked wonders.  So after researching it's benefits on the internet I decided to purchase some.  This brand had the best reviews.  I used it as a leave in conditioner on my transistioning hair (I'm afro american) and it gave me a new head of soft hair!  My hair was damaged from dying my hair after a relaxer and it started breaking and shedding extremly bad.  After using the coconut oil one time my hair is moisturized all the way to my ends, no shedding, shiny, non greasy, and just plain beautiful.  I've also decided to use it in cooking too.  I HIGHLY recommend trying some, you won't regret it!! And it tastes and smells wonderful!!
