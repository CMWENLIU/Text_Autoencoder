I have a photograph of me as a 1 yr old chomping on a WASA crispbread and have eaten it all my life with butter or margerine and ham, cheese, cottage cheese with hot sauce, jam or plain. I grew up in Germany and there crispbread (Kneckebrot) and minearal water are simply basic staple foods. It is, contrary to what the American packaging states not sourdough at all (in it's taste), but has a nice nutty wholesome flavor and is VERY crunchy, but does not break up like some of the thicker kinds of WASA crispbread. Substitute this for potato chips or white bread and you will save hundreds of calories. I used to get it in NYC delis and now order it bulk from amazon....
