Black tea is a staple at our house.  After having this recommended to us by a Canadian friend, we ordered some. This is definitely one of the best black teas we have found. Very full bodied, and yet refined.  Try it.<br /><br />Amazon's price is the best we have found, and we are on subscribe and save - we get the 4 large boxes about every 60 days.  A good deal.<br /><br />There is a lot of tea here - if you want to sample it, I would recommend ordering a small box in case you don't like it.
