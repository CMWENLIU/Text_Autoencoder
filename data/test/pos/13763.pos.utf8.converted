These milk chocolate soft centers have been around as long as I have. In my 62 years I have tried lots of different brands, but nothing taste like the rich full flavor of Sees. We only have one small store here in Denver, and its far from my house, So a BIG THANKS to Amazon for making it real easy to purchase really good quality chocolates. Bet you would like a piece now, YUMMMMM :-)
