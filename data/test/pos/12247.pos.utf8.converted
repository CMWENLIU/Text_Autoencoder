When I first received this product I was not sure what it was supposed to be, but then I read the directions and realized you have to dilute it with water and also sqeeze the bag around to really mix it up. Once I fully understood what to do, I used it in my sweet potato soup and it was the BEST flavor and most strong coconut flavor that I have ever had in my life. This is the best coconut cream and milk that I've ever had, adn I can't say enough good things about it. Thank you!
