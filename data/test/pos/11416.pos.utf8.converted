Much has been written about how great this product is and of all kinds of benefits it has, so there is no need to elaborate on that, other than add my vote to it.<br />The purpose of this review is sharing some practical usage and storage tips with the "newbies" so you don't accidentally waste and have to throw away your supply.<br /><br />There are smaller packages of Dandy blend available even here on Amazon, however economically this size makes best practical sense, as it's the least expensive (price per oz) option, provided you will store it right.<br />The instruction on the label say that Dandelion is sensitive to moisture and the bag needs to be resealed completely after each use.  However I found out that itself is not enough (I live in area with high humidity).<br /><br />From my experience, the best thing to do if you buy this size is to either share it with a friend and/or do the following:  I put mine in a small size glass mason jar with a lid and store it in the fridge (or even freezer, either way).<br />What is left, stays in the original bag, gets sealed, put in additional Ziploc bag and stored in the freezer.  There it will last quite a long time.<br />What happens if you leave it at room temperature is, it absorbs moisture and hardens into a block pretty quickly, and you have to literally chisel it to break a piece off, plus it dissolves lot harder and loses some original flavor, so it pretty much gets ruined.  I found out the hard way and had to throw away quite a sizable amount the first time I bought it.<br /><br />Cold temperature will keep it nice, powdery and fresh for a long time.<br />You can play with the concentration (some people like less, I prefer mine stronger), drink it 'just like that' or put all kinds of enhancements in:<br />sweeteners (I don't use white sugar, prefer stevia, xylitol or coconut sugar),<br />"whiteners" (half and half, rice milk, almond milk etc.),<br />cacao powder,<br />cinnamon,<br />nutmeg,<br />natural flavoring like almond or vanilla, whatever your imagination comes up with), just as you would with coffee.<br /><br />Definitely recommended and worth giving a try!!!
