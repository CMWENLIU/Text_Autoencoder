In a lapse of my usual careful attention I failed to notice that this costs $4.62 with a grayed out shipping cost of $12.95 that's harder to spot. I was just paying attention to my cart total to reach the Super Saver shipping amount, failed to realize the shipping amount is part of the item cost in the cart. Really? $12.95 to ship a few ounces. I won't be ordering from this company again and will be much more careful about ordering from Amazon. I should have read the reviews more carefully because my vegan daughter will refuse to eat this.
