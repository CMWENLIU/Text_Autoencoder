I expected a bag of very moist dates,& got a bag of hard dry ones.I already had 1 bag I bought at Sam's Club I had to use up in Date Bread which were so hard my Kitchen Aid had trouble chopping them up until I added some water to them.These are of the same quality,so now I have 2 bags to get rid of.The price is not that great either,so if you want nice big moist dates--Don't buy these.
