Whether you like this candy or not depends a lot on why you are buying it.<br /><br />If you are older like me and looking for the red licorice that was once sold in Department Store Candy Counters and Candy stores by the bunch in the sixties and seventies then you will be disappointed. This is not even remotely similar to that candy.<br /><br />Until eight years ago our Mall Candy Store sold the original red licorice laces but they replaced it with the kind that tastes like Twizzlers in the form of a string. I have been looking to no avail for the original variety ever since. This order was my last hope and it seems the kind many of us grew up with simply isn't being made anymore.<br /><br />Personally I did not really care for the taste but that means nothing since I was looking for the kind they use to sell and this wasn't it.<br /><br />If anyone does know who sells the original type I wish they would tell me.
