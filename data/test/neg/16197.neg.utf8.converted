My cat developed crystals in his urine after he began eating this food.  He always eats high-quality dry food, such as Wellness, and he wasn't under any stress, so I believe that switching to this food caused the condition.  I took him off of this and put him back on Wellness dry food, and without any other changes in his diet or environment, the crystals went away after about two weeks.  Sure enough, I later contacted Diamond and they informed me that the ash content in this dry food is 8.8%, and the magnesium = .10%.  The lower the ash content, the higher the quality of the meat is.  To give you an idea of what an acceptable amount in dry food is, Wellness contains 6.5%.  I would stay away from Diamond Naturals if you have a male cat.
