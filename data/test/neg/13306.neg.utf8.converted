This is a great concept. I read a good review of it in the New York Times, and I was impressed w/ the idea of a compostable bag and no chemicals. Sadly: the seasoning is SO salty, I found it inedible even using only half a bag of seasoning. Yes, you can use even less seasoning, and it's OK, but you get about 2 cups of popcorn for your $2.50 bag, which is outrageous. Since you're adding your own oil and seasoning with this product anyway, why not just throw 25 cents worth of popcorn in to a pan, cook it yourself and save a LOT of money? Don't waste your money on this.
