I expected the fish to be swimming around in water when they arrived at my doorstep.  Instead, they were in a box!  Oh the humanity!  I put them into my fish tank, hoping they needed some water but they still didn't swim.  They just needed some water!  I am still trying to get them to breathe.  I am reading my Bible and praying religiously hoping they will rise from the dead.  Who would do such a thing?  Satan is at work here.  These fish were so cute and innocent!  They were probably used in shampoo-testing, I suspect because of the orange crumbs at the bottom of the box.
