I think this product is horrible.  It has basically no odor control properties, it's expensive and the litter box needs to be emptied way more frequently than with other litter products. Worst of all it contains completely round crystals that end up rolling all over the floor (unlike other crystal litters which contain irregular-shaped crystals) making it nearly impossible to clean up from hard surface floors like tile and hardwood - I have better things to do with my time than chasing round crystal balls with a broom!  I thought this product would be a good substitute for Tidy Cats Crystals but it's essentially worthless. Very pretty packaging - very bad product :(
