I got these to try because some reported that they are much much different from regular walnuts. I normally eat the 'premium walnut halves' from Trader Joe's (in the US). I found that these were not much different in flavor, or indeed not as good in flavor. They were broken pieces with a lot of bitter dark skin on them and twice as expensive as the Trader Joe's walnuts. I would not recommend these to anyone over the Trader Joe's walnuts.
