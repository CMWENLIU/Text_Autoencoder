It's obvious this isn't a healthy meal, but rather the cheapest thing Hormel can put together for a "budget" meal. I knew this and did not care because I was tight on cash and was willing to risk the new experience with these microwave hormal meals.....<br /><br />While thrift shopping when I was broke a few months back, I picked up the usual 1-3 budget buck items like chef boyardee raviolis and such. I saw these hormal meals at the local grocery store and the price was definitely cheap and fit my budget. Most of them looked really good too. I chose this flavor as it seemed the most protein packed and the most delicious flavor (beef and potatoes, how can they mess that up? Its always good..........right?)<br /><br />Plus for the price, I could just tack it off as a bad "meh" meal if I did not like it. Under 3 bucks a piece for a small lunch type of meal is a good price.<br /><br />**CONCLUSION** - After tring this meat & potatoes meal, it looks good but it smells and tastes similar to opening up a can of wet dog food from Pedigree. I am being honest and I eat junky microwave meals A LOT so you know I am not a picky health nut writing bad reviews online. The other flavors seem to get higher ratings which is not surprising to me....  but this flavor, while appearing so good, is just horrible and almost unedible. If someone gave me this to take home, I would honestly put it in the pile of crappy canned foods I give to the homeless shelter (like lima beans, or kindey beans... yeah its that bad)
