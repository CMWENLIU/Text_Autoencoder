I've been a fan of coconut water since I was a kid and until recently, other than getting it straight from a coconut, it was hard to find pure coconut water drinks without a bunch of additives and sugars (although I enjoy those too). needless to say, after trying my first brand (O.N.E.), I've been on a coco water rampage. I've tried vita coco, amy and brian's, blue monkey, zico, c20, O.N.E., etc. most are good, some are whatever (zico, vitacoco). vitacoco has days in which it tastes ok and some days I must be getting bad packages cus they suck.<br /><br />Naked, however, sucks every. single. time. it hardly has that distinctive coconut scent/taste. good coconut water is supposed to be even more refreshing than water after a good work out but I don't enjoy the taste of Naked at all.<br /><br />unfortunately for customers, coconut water comes at a premium price and is hardly affordable per fluid oz, so if you're going to shell out $$$ to get some, get something worthwhile, like O.N.E., C2O, or blue monkey coconut water.
