You get what you pay for: Barney Butter contains Palm Oil, which is a saturated fat, and sugar. Palm oil production causes substantial and irreversible damage to the environment. Unfortunately, I didn't read the nutrition information until I'd already opened one of the jars, and now I have to figure out what to do with the two remaining jars. If you're trying to steer clear of saturated fats and sugar, find a different product. Trader Joe's carries 100% almond butter, and you can buy Maranatha, Sunland and some other unadulterated almond butters at Amazon.com.
