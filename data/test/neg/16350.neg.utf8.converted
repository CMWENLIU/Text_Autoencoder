The starfish included in this little gift is very likely not sustainably harvested. In fact just the opposite. Anyone who cares about the ocean or the environment should not buy this. OTOH, the idea of a bromeliad in a little crystal hanger is a lovely idea, and there are several other great products very similar to this, without the environmental consequences.<br /><br />What nice is that a bromeliad requires very little care, so even those with a black thumb can likely keep one for quite some time, thus making for a lasting gift.<br /><br />So, yes, a gift like this one is a good idea. Just not this particular version. Please.
