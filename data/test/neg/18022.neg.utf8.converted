I carefully read all the reviews on this Item before ordering! I must say, there are not that many real Tea drinkers writing reviews for this particular Item. Sure, if you are a Lipton dipper, this is a great tea. But if you know what a quality tea should offer, you would not have given this product more than 2-Stars.<br />The Aroma when first open the bag, is quiet decent, but when the tea is Brewed, the flavor is a disaster. It is basically a lipton like flavor. The color, is also unlike a good quality Earl-gray! Which it should have an amber color, that can be anywhere from light, to deep end of the spectrum, depending if the tea is a Single Body, or need to be mixed with another tea for potentiation of Color.<br /><br />At last, the tea leaves are not uniformly sized, which basically means this tea is probably a mixture of low quality teas, just flavored as Earl-Gray!<br /><br />Coffee Bean direct should consider offering a better tea, for a few more $$$!!! At least 2Lb of tea would be worth Brewing!
