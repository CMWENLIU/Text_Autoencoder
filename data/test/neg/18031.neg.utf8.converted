My whole family has tried this product and no one has made it past the first bite.  There is a really horrible fake maple and brown sugar odor that engrosses the whole packaging even before you take the first bite!  Once your skin even touches the envelope, you cannot even wash the fake maple and brown sugar smell off with hot soapy water.  We looked forward to trying this, as we use the the regular variety often.  When you go to the grocery, just pick up the box, give it a slight squeeze and sniff.  The compare it to the regular.  It seems like they are even using a fake aroma on the outer packaging to drive you to an impulse buy.  Really bad stuff!
