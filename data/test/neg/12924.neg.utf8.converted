This is a good flour (white rice). But what you may not know is that it is also the cheapest available flour for baking gluten free. You can usually find it in bulk at big grocery stores for $0.60-1.20 per pound. The other listed ingredients: potato starch, tapioca starch, and guar gum can also be purchased in bulk here on Amazon.<br /><br />If you go to this extra effort, your $23 will go from 6 pounds of baking flour to 30.
