One of the worst things I have ever tasyed that was supose to be drinkable. Under fizzed and over chemicalled. My Grand children tasted it and got sick. Nothing like the real "Fizzies" of old. Reccogmended only for suicides to hide the taste of the poison-naw it might make you throw up and screw up the suicide attempt. They only sell it in large quantities because after tasting one no one would ever buy a second one.
