I LOVE my Tassimo but the Suchard's hot chocolate is just not good. I use the Tassimo for hot water and add whatever hot chocolate mix I happen to have from the grocery store. They're all better than Suchard's. It's weak, watery, and has very little chocolate flavor. I'm surprised Gevalia and Tassimo lend their names to this product. I tried one pod. I'm not sure what I'll do with the ones I have left. It's so bad that I don't even want to use them up. Sorry, Suchard.
