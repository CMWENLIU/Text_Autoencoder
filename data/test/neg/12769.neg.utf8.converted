I LOVE ginger snaps, and we are fans of Newman's Own products in this household, but thumbs down on this one.  First of all, they were very hard and over-baked.  In fact, our bag had several with almost burnt bottoms on the cookies.  We found we could tolerate them better if we dunked them in cold milk first, then they weren't so hard, but it still left a funny aftertaste.  They are very strong with ginger and some other spice we couldn't identify but didn't like. I've never met a ginger-snap I didn't like...until now :(
