I took a chance on this product due to the fact I really like cherry juice flavor.  I skimmed over the reviews which were mostly positive but apparently not well enough to find out the actual contents of the product.  I drank about half the can until I realized something wasn't tasting right.  Then I looked at the ingredients and noticed it contained sucralose (Splenda) which is not something I except to find in a "all natural" drink.  I see no reason why they had to do this since it contains 10g of sugar anyway.  Why can't they just make a sugar-free version and keep that bad tasting artificial sweetener out of this version?  My next compliant is that it is only made up of 5% juice which isn't exactly a whole lot.  Both of these weren't mentioned (intentionally?) on the product description.  It is quite a shame because I think the taste of the product would have been pretty decent otherwise.  I think it is false advertising to say a product is "all natural and no artificial flavors" when it clearly isn't.
