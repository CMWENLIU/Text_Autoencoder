By far the best seaweed out there, but you can get the entire box for $10 at Costco. $27 is way too much money for this. Don't let them scam you. If you buy 3 of these a year, you just wasted enough money to buy you a costco membership for a year and 3 boxes....<br /><br />I have seen some outrageous markups on Amazon for food, but this is one of the worst. Asian grocery stores also carry it.
