I stumbled across these in the grocery store today, after having purchased the 25% less sugar chocolate chip version.  Surely there must be a tasty oatmeal raisin equivalent, my stomach wondered.  Sure enough there is!  Just 90 calories, 10% less than the chocolate chip version?!  Sounds promising I thought.  No high fructose corn syrup, 0 g trans fats, sign me up!  Upon closer inspection, these granola bars aren't quite as healthy as they're advertised; they still contain corn syrup, though not "high fructose" corn syrup, as well as a bunch of preservatives, oligofructose, polydextrose, and various hydrogenated oils.  Minus 1 star.<br /><br />Taste wise, they're terrible compared to their low fat chocolate chip brethren.  There's nary a raisin to be found, and somehow, the oatmeal to barley/rice ratio is very low on these compared to the chocolate chip version.  If I wanted a barley/rice bar, I wouldn't have bought a product that said "granola" on the front.  Additionally, the bar is very dry; I think the lack of a nice fat (chocolate chips) definitely leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />Don't buy the 90 calorie oatmeal raisin bars.  Buy the lowfat 100 cal chocolate chip ones if you truly must have "lowfat", but I'd recommend just getting the full-fat, tastier regular Quaker bars.  It's really only just a 40 calorie difference, and you can teach yourself some better self-discipline.
