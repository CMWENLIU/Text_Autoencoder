This food has such high ratings, I wish it had worked. I have a black lab/weim mix who is over 2 year olds and about 100 lb. As he aged (turned 2 in April) his ears kept getting worse and worse with black smelly gunk and nothing the vet gave helped. He also started chewing feet and legs (made a bare spot on one leg). After researching I decided it must be food allergies. I changed to Dr. E's Great Life Grain Free Potato Free Limited Ingredient Buffalo - worked GREAT ears cleared up. no foot/leg chewing, skin wasn't shedding white flakes as much. but...he HATED it. he would dribble pieces on the floor - I had to mix it with stuff (I'm just not the type who will starve my dog till he eats). He also leaned up quite a bit though he wasn't an overweight dog. I figured since his ears were clear but he hated this, I would try this food as it sounded so good. What a disaster. He loved it. gobbled it down and wanted more. He gained weight (not in a good way now he looks fat), his ears got stinky, his feet got itchy and his skin was so dry and flaky he looked like a partially white dog and his hair was flying out in handfuls. Am going to keep looking as I don't think I can keep feeding him the other as it was such a struggle but really disappointed this didn't work. as a side note, we were at the bottom of the barrel with his old food and I didn't do a two week intro as I usually do, plus his probiotics had run out BUT he had zero diarreah issues switching over to this. I did mix it with grandma lucy's grain free chicken dog food but he was having that on his food before and was cleared up so I don't think that was it. Also, some have mentioned NOT to mix this with water so I'm glad he didn't have bloat issues though I did (as the Grandma lUcy's is a dry flake you rehydrate)
