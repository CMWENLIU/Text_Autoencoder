OK, so I ordered some of his coco juice and received all of one container. Tanks, O.N.E.!!! One day, before I could taste it or myself, my son saw the container on the kitchen table and decided to try it. Here's what he had to say about it:<br /><br /> "I took one sip and swallowed it, and it was not at all refreshing. It tasted like all the other coconut juice you had ever had, but watered down -- like they took the good parts out of the coconut and added water. It was disgusting."<br /><br />There you have it. Another dissatisfied customer. Next time, Amazon, send me a 6-pack so I'll have half a chance to try this on my own!
