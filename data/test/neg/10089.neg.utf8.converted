I have healthy 45 year old teeth and broke a large chuck off my front tooth eating this cereal.  The chunks in my box reminded me of gravel it was so hard.  I have never purchased this cereal before and so not sure if I just got a bad box or this is the normal for it.  I have contacted the vendor to try to find out.  Watch out for hard chunks hard enough to break your teeth.
