This Item Taste Like Dirt.. I've Prob Used it 4 Times & Now It's Just Sitting in MY Freezer.. I Have A High Tolerance for Nasty Stuff.. Just Don't Really Like this Product.. Something In Grinding It Up Makes It Taste Nasty.. The Hulled Seeds Nutiva Sells Are Way Better.. If You Want Good Tasting Hemp Protein Powder It's $15/lb @ Earthshiftproducts.com  but It Taste Wayyy Better Actually Taste Good From Earthshift..
