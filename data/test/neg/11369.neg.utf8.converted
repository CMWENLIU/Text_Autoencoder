Maybe they were better 3-4 years ago but today in 2012 they have gone down hill. Cracker Jacks have always been my favorite and as far as I know I'm the only person I've met that eats them. I went to try the 7Oz bag because I'm used to the little boxes and never had a big bag. Well let me tell you if you see a big bag just skip it alright. In this giant bag there were on 3! YES! I counted them! 3 Peanuts in the entire bag! "Carmel coated popcorn & 3 Peanuts!" is what the bag should say. One, Two, THREE! that is all I got! and you know what I noticed that over the years there has always been less and less and less peanuts in the box. I don't know what fritolay is trying to do. Is it so bad to put what peanuts in the cracker jacks? They're supposed to be in there. All you get in todays bags are mostly caramel covered popcorn. I've been eating Poppycock instead because they have more nuts in them (yeah go head an laugh at that sentence I don't care). I just hate it when companies mess with my favorites just to save a few dollars. I was okay with them putting in those crummy cheap stickers and calling it a TOY. but taking away the peanuts! COMMON MAN!
