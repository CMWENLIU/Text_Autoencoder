This is unlike any chai I've smelled or tasted.  The the cassia oil and maple oil totally overwhelm the clove, orange peel, cardamom and cinnamon (the bag does not list orange peel, cassia oil or maple oil as ingredients, but Amazon's website does).  I can't even be in the same room as the closed bag of tea without getting a headache and feeling like retching.  Had to get it out of the house.
