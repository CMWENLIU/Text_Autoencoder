this is a fairly good asst. of teas, but they sent me an updated version of the product, and I'm not happy with the new asst. it's not as described in the desc. it has pomegranite tea instead of apple cinnamon, and I was buying it to get the apple cinnamon, so I hope someone reads this and doesn't make the same mistake I did.<br /><br />I want my apple cinnamon tea
