If I could have given less than 1 star I would have. The candy is bone dry and rock hard. It's grainy not smooth with white stuff in the middle. There is no breaking pieces off this or biting it, you need a hammer or chisel. The sell by date is July 20, so it should have been ok. Which makes believe the sell buy date is bogus. I just spent $85 for 24 ounces that isn't even fit for maple sugar. I've contacted the company, and I'm waiting to hear back from them. I don't know if I got a defective batch, but these are a supreme disappointment. I like the idea of no additives, but what good is that if it's not edible? Someone else posted "melt in your mouth", when I put it in my mouth, it doesn't dissolve and if I suck on it, it's so hard it leaves cuts in my mouth.<br /><br />ABC Wholesale did get back to me. They do not honor the products they sell. They told me to contact the manufacturer. I am now waiting to hear back from the manufacturer. ABC Wholesale sent me another email stating they are not responsible for any quality issue of the candy and that the normal texture of the candy is hard and dry. They were very rude.<br /><br />I got an email from the manufacturer. The product is not supposed to be hard and dry. They told me they do not sell to ABC Wholesale and are not sure where they get their product so cannot guarantee it's freshness if you buy from them. I checked the link on Coombs Family Farm to buy the candy and ABC Wholesale is what comes up. So the person giving me information from the manufacturer obviously doesn't even know who they sell to. They also told me they would send me a replacement package. It's been two weeks and I haven't received anything from them.<br /><br />ABC Wholesale and Coombs Family Farm are selling an inferior product with extremely low quality and zero customer service.<br /><br />I have bought maple sugar candy from 2 other sources here on amazon. Sweet Vermont - which was good - firm and melt in your mouth. And Manfield Maple - which was even better - glazed/crisped on the outside and creamy on the inside. Mansfield also has no additives. They are less than half the price of Coombs Family Farm. They each only took two days to deliver the product to me.
