STOP...don't buy from this retailer....they charge 21.50 for ONE bottle. All the other retailers sell 2 for 26....even the local supermarket sells it for less. Too bad I wasn't paying attention....I just assumed I was going to get 2 bottles.<br />The oil is ok and while I'd give it 3 stars, at 21.50, it isn't worth it.
