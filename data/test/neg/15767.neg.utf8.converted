I ordered a case of pepper pot soup since Campbell's was discontinued.I was hoping it was similar since<br /> I was a weekly purchased. To my dismay I was not satisfied with your product, it was not spicy and lacked flavor resulting in my cancelling the monthly purchase plan. If you can copy a version of Campbell's with tripe I would be a weekly buyer.
