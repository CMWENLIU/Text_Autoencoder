I typically by these juice boxes in the store for $3.49-$3.99 for a pack of 8.  I should have checked with the seller on tha actual count, but was shocked that they are selling the same box for $14 and change! Lesson learned, and I am very disappointed.<br /><br />On the other hand, my kiddos love the drinks and I love that they don't have as much sugar as the other drinks.
