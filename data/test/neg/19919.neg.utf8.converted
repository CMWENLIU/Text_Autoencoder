We love our Soda Stream and usually drink the bubbly water plain or make our own syrups (very easy to do), but I purchased the Root Beer flavor on a whim. We poured the recommended amount of syrup into the carbonated water and slurped. It was OK for a split-second, THEN came the after taste - YUCK!!!<br /><br />If you are NOT of the persuasion that Splenda is natural and don't enjoy aftertaste and don't want to acquire a taste for fake sugar, then this product is NOT for you.<br /><br />From now on, I'm not buying anything without reading the label first.
