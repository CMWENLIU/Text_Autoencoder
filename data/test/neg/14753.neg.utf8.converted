I had to swear off coffee for health reasons - and chocolate too.  Arghhh!<br />But Ovaltine Malt in hot milk made me feel like I wasn't completely sacrificing.<br />And the vitamins and minerals made me feel OK about adding all that sugar to my diet.<br />NOW - - they've changed the recipe!  It used to have about 3 times the vitamins - especially B's - that it does now!<br />I had noticed a change in taste - it wasn't as rich - and clumped up more.<br />Then I looked at the label.<br />WHY?  Another very disappointed fan.<br />It's like the new coke thing.  Somebody screwed up - and they will be losing lots of loyal customers, like me.
