We drank the new reduced juice unknowingly and thought yuk what's up with this did we get a bad batch? I searched the new can, knowing it appeared simular but could not find the 10% as it was cleverly hidden in the back. I then went to my recycle bin for an old can and compared. No longer proudly displayed on the front 50% real juice. I have justified this expensive,tasty and addictive treat for years and alloted 1 per family member per day. Now this case is going back and we are done with Rockstar until they bring back the higher real juice formula. I even had a stomach reaction to this one and I tend to have a goat gut. Bad taste bad product change and pissed that they reduce the juice keeping the price the same 2-3.00 per can, another misguided by greed rogue corporation. Now I cannot help but wonder if that blogger that rants that Rockstar is owned by Nazi's has some credibility. My wife really resented the fact that the new packaging was predominently identical to the old decieving her into purchasing a product she did not want or like.Back it all goes.
