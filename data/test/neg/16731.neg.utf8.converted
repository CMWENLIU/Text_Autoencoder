If you are looking for product with no preservaties - do not buy this one - has citric acid and this is called preservative. No matter how well the peppers are grown - citric acid kills the goodness. It has sour taste that would give the sour taste to your meal. Secondly, it's a baby jar - the full dish beside the jar on the picture is misleading - maybe filled with 3 jars :(. The peppers are actually very, very tiny. Also, the jar didn't pop up.
