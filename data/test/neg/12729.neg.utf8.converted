I bought this because I would buy Kirkland (Costco's brand) instant mac 'n' cheese and almost always only use the cheese powder as a quick way to make mac n cheese with my favorite pasta. When it came in the mail (quick shipping), I noticed that it has no packaging date, sell by date, or expiration date. I found that a little odd and was iffy to use it but tried it out anyway. From reading other reviews that it tasted similar to them as using store brand powdered cheese, I made my recipe with the usual amount of pasta and put an equal amount of cheese powder as the box would have. It tasted bland to me and my boyfriend. We added more powder but still nothing much. Then some salt this time and it was a TAD bit better but not much. Given the vague packaging of this product and the bland taste of the powder, I'll stick with using individual boxes of mac n cheese powder.
