I bought these accidentally, because I thought they were the crunchmaster crackers. I tried eating them multiple times, putting cheese on them, creamed cheese, jam, etc. It ruined the flavour of the things i put on it. They were so gross I couldn't believe that they would actually be for sale, so I returned them to Costco, who understood that they were inedible, and let me get the right crackers instead. Blech, I get a bad taste in my mouth just remembering them.
