I don't generally buy packaged cookies.  I am of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143114964">Michael Pollan</a> camp that says if you want to eat something unhealthy, then make it yourself.  It will taste better, and be packed with actual ingredients instead of chemical filler.<br /><br />And yes, these "Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond" are unhealthy, no matter that they are qualified with "a wholesome way to satisfy your sweet tooth."  There may be 10 grams of whole grains per serving, but look closely at that ingredients list and you will find a whole bunch of things that mother nature never intended to be used as food.  Each cookie carries a pretty hefty calorie count as well, so this isn't a carefree snack.<br /><br />They taste ... OK.  They have that same chemical aftertaste of most packaged cookies, and for a soft cookie they are somewhat dry and flavorless.  There are chocolate chunks and almonds,  which is a nice addition, but doesn't make up for the chemical flavor and dryness.<br /><br />For me, I will just stick with homemade.  Oatmeal cookies are easy and fun to make, and taste 100% better than these packaged ones.  Quaker Oats has some good ideas, and I think I will toss some almonds and real chocolate chips into my next batch of cookies, but I won't be buying these again.
