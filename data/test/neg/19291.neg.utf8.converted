very disappointed.  All the k-cups were just thrown in a box.  Some were crushed due to poor packaging.  There were too many decaffenated teas and coffee.  Some of the k cups tasted stale.  They could have been expired.  This purchase was not worth the money.  I will stick to my usual website to purchase my kcups.  Do not waste your money on this.
