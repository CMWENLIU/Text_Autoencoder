As someone who did not grow up eating this stuff, I admit that a lot of its praise is lost on my family.  It really is quite a different beast than what most people would consider Spaghetti.  It tastes more like a pungent herbal version that is as to spaghetti what a veggie burger is to a hamburger.  In a similar fashion, opinions are going to vary widely and I've found that many people recoil a bit because they simply weren't expecting it to taste so different.  That doesn't make it bad, by any means, but I would suggest that you don't start with a whole case.  Personally, I find a simple dinner made with store brand sauce and noodles vastly preferable.
