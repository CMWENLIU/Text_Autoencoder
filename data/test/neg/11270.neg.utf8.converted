I have only used epazote one previous time and only the leaves of the living plant.  In this dried product there ara a lot of tough stems, too many in fact to just throw some in with the cooking beans.  Need to wrap the epazote in cheese cloth or similar to contain the stems.  I was surprised because Melissa's usually has a superior product.  Perhaps the stems are included because this can also be used as a tea.
