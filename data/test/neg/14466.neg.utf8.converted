My daughter gets dry scalp and so I thought I would have her try this. But there are no directions on the container?? What is up with that? I don't understand why the company would think that everyone knows how to use these products.<br /><br />By the looks of it when I opened it up, it seems more like a balm, so I assume it goes on dry hair, not wet hair in the shower. But we weren't sure whether it is suppose to be rubbed into the scalp, or just smoothed onto hair. My daughter tried rubbing some into her scalp, but wasn't overly thrilled with it, so she just started smoothing a little on her hair. She likes smooth, straight hair, and kind of liked how this balm looked, but not as much as other smoothing products she's used. So I doubt she will continue to keep using this product. We both are still wondering if we are even using it right. I think it's silly for them to not give better directions.
