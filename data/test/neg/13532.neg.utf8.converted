When I read the word "pure" in an extract, I expect it to be at most some flavoring, and an agent such as alcohol or glycerine to distribute the flavor. This has a few extras including SUGAR, that were not in the description.  The last thing I want in my PURE EXTRACT is added sugar.<br /><br />Wilton is a good name for baking products but this is not a good product and is certainly misnamed.
