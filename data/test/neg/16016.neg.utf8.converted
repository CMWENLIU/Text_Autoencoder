Sorry that I purchased such a large quantity that I now have to use up, will never buy again. The quality and variety of the pieces are not bad but they are rather flavorless. They seem like they may have been pre-washed as they look cleaner, less rustic, with practically no grit, and this may have washed away a lot of the natural goodness. Much prefer naturbosco Funghi Porcini Secchi which are much more robust and yield a deeper soaking liquid. Even dry just the difference in color tells you not to expect too much.  If you're looking for "subtle" for a recipe these may work for you but if you're looking for the real deal this isn't it.
