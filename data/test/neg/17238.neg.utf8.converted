I normally buy several bags of the Starbucks Christmas coffee.  Could not find any this year, but my heart picked up when I saw there was a Via version.  I like the Italian Via - regular and decaf - so much that I actually buy it at the ridiculous prices Starbucks charges.  I got two boxes of the Christmas Via in early December.  Still have one. Hard to figure why this is labeled "Christmas" as it tastes nothing like the good stuff in the bags.  Hard to figure how coffee can be weak and bitter with no character - and as this is "Christmas" no spicyness - at the same time.  Groaned my way through the first box and keep giving the second a wide pass.  Maybe hoping it will get better with age?  May just dump on the azaleas in the Spring.
