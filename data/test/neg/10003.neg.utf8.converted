First of all, I'd like to say that I am a fixer.  If I purchase something that doesn't work like it should, "I fix it".....Not the case here....I gave this item a one star, and that is even too much.....The porcelain pot is very poorly engineered....It "looks" great, but that's where it ends.<br /><br />The top  "rests" on its base with a thin rim and has no support.....If you are not careful, it can easily be knocked off and broken.....Not for someone that has small children puttering around, or someone that is a little "shakey" at hand....You would think that Melitta would have put a locking grove on the top to lock the lid, but it didn't...Keep in mind that this is "ceramic", so that if you knock it off, its going to chip,or even break. (not like a plastic one).<br /><br />The "groves" in the top ARE very slight, and it doesn't matter what kind of paper filter you use...IT CLOGS....Found that a "permanent" filter works a "little" better....But it is still a slow and "pain in the butt" process....Lets face it, when you get up in the morning and want a cup of coffee, you don't want to have to mess with the coffee pot to "coax" it to work.<br /><br />The ceramic pot, if you are lucky enough to get a pot full, does not keep the coffee hot...Its simple.....Put hot coffee into a "cold" ceramic pot, and you have "warm" coffee....So the only option is to pre-heat the pot in hot water first before making the pot.....One royal pain in the butt...And I like MY coffee hot!<br /><br />And lets say that you are lucky enough to get a full pot of coffee, that is hot....its too small for us serious coffee drinkers....Doesn't hold much.<br /><br />WORST product Melitta ever made AND expensive......My wife wanted it so I got it for her as a gift.....Used it for a week, and now it sits in the cupboard gathering dust....Even she says it a piece of junk, and she NEVER admits she made a mistake buying ANYTHING.....But it DOES look nice.....<br /><br />Could have bought a really nice unit for the price I paid for this one....But did I tell you it looked nice?????<br /><br />YES, its that bad....YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED><br /><br />Buy at your own risk......
