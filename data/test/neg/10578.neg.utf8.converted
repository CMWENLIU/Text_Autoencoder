I ordered quantity 2 of this item.  The Nutella sachets came loosely packed in a postal box.  There were 72 of them (2 cases worth), but I had to count them all to determine whether I even got what I paid for.<br /><br />I thought I was ordering two cases as illustrated in the photo but my shipment did not include the Nutella branded box which appears in the photo.
