I have two cats that are very picky eaters, sometime ago I found out about weruvia and they seemed to really enjoy it. So, in order to keep my furry friends happy and save some money I purchased weruvia online, and to my my surprise one of them would not eat it at all. I discovered that the food I purchased online unlike the one I was buying at the pet store was made in Thailand. I found a can from a previous purchase which had been made in the USA and the cat ate it without a problem. So, I wondering if anyone has had the same problems???
