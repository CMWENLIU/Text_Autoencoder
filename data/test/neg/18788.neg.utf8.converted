This is a big disappointment.  Suddenly the formula changes - for the worse.  I have canceled my formerly wonderful "Subscribe & Save" Amazon subscription.  Might as well buy Cap'n Crunch or Frosted Flakes.  "Now Tastes Even Better!" the company says.  Well, it depends on who's doing the tasting! It is now far too sweet, as well as being significantly less healthy - look at the increase in calories and sodium.  What a pity.  Farewell, Special K Protein Plus, old style.  It was nice knowing and eating you.
