I have to say that I really wanted this formula to work for our son. My husband and I are big whole foods, organic people, and wanted that for our son as well when my milk supply never grew to be sufficient for him. This was clearly imperfect (only breast milk is perfect), but it was organic, and I didn't want my baby consuming chemicals.<br /><br />Everything worked out fine for about 4 weeks. Our son would spit up to some extent after almost every feeding, but we attributed it to HIM having some issues, not the formula. As he started to better "communicate" with us, we realized that he would cry nonstop during his feedings, which didn't seem normal. He would continue to suck, but would sob through his eating. It was heartbreaking. We burped him incessantly, thinking it may be gas, but it wasn't. He wouldn't sleep because he was so fussy, and nothing would calm him. He had a dirty diaper only once a day (sometimes even less), and they would often be harder than we would have expected.<br /><br />After doing extensive research, we started our little one on Gerber Good Start Protect. It contains only whey protein and not casein, which is known to create curds in baby's tummy (in ANYONE'S tummy, really). It also has probiotics (like breast milk). When we gave him his first bottle of the new stuff, he saw the bottle and started to pout, and once he started drinking, you could almost SEE the relief on his face. He did not fuss at all through his feedings, and he was instantly happier and calmer. My smiling, beautiful boy was back! After almost 9 days of naps of an hour or less, he got back to his regular 2-3 hour naps and better sleeping at night.<br /><br />While I want my son to have the most wholesome ingredients possible, I believe sometimes the way those ingredients are mixed can be a negative, and I think that may be the case with this formula. We'll continue with our Gerber Good Start, and as much breast milk as possible.
