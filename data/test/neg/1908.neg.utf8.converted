Heads up to all of you out there who love Mrs. Mays.  I too love their products and was a regular customer. I liked the simplicity of ingredients, the fact that most of them were "organic" and that they were Vegan. I purchased a case of various items from them directly, and imagine my surprise when I noticed the box they arrived in said "A Product of China." I emailed them and they confirmed that their product is indeed produced in China. Having traveled in China, and, based on recent problems related to products made in China, I am no longer buying Mrs. Mays. How anyrhinf grown there could be described as "organic" strikes me as disingenous at best. The energy required to ship the product back to the US also strikes me as wasteful. I no longer purchase their product. When they produce their products with locally grown, organic ingredients, I'll be back!
