I have both original and new formula at home. They taste almost the same, but new formula separated after opening and has more oil IMHO. My child loves Nutella, we recently started on a dairy free diet, and this is an ok  substitute for our favorite Ferrero nutella spread. I personally didn't like justin's hazelnut butter taste, especially weird aftertaste, but, since new formula contains almonds, they should put almond picture on the label and the word "blend" should be the same size as brand name on the label. They should also lower the price.
