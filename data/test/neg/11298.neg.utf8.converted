Ever since Trident White changed their "formula" to create a better flavor (which I do not care for at all), I've been on the search for a newer, better sugar-free gum. My dentist recommended Spry, so I thought I'd give it a chance. It's pricier than most of the sugarfree gums I frequent, but it came recommended by an oral expert, so I figured it would be worth a try.<br /><br />NOT WORTH IT.<br /><br />Literally, after less than 4 minutes, the flavor is completely gone, and the gum itself reverts to a stale, slightly metallic, tough-to-chew state of existence. I'm not sure how much teeth cleaning the Xylitol in the gum itself is doing because it seems to lose flavor so fast. Correct me if I'm wrong, but xylitol is a sweetener, so if the sweetness of the gum is lost after a good (or bad?) 3 minutes, then there really wasn't that much Xylitol to begin with?<br /><br />Also, further research showed that you actually need more xylitol than the amount in the gum itself before it proves to be beneficial.<br /><br />Given how much xylitol is in the Spry gum, it's neither good nor bad to be chewing Spry, and what tips that balance towards "No Thanks" is the fact that it is not worth its value.<br /><br />This is USEFUL information for those who want to chew gum to freshen their breath, or prolong the feeling of minty goodness in their mouth for more than just a couple of minutes!
