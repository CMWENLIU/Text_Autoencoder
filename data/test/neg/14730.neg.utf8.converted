My dog liked these but, after reading numerous articles that they're made in China and there have been hundreds of dogs' illnesses and deaths after eating Waggin Train (and other brands) dog treats made in China, I threw the bag into the garbage. I am quite knowledgeable when it comes to harm being done to animals, but I had not heard about this connection until just recently.  I was shocked to find out this has been going on since 2007!  If the companies aren't going to own up and voluntarily recall their products, it's up to dog parents not to buy them and give them to our pets.  Why wait until my dog is dying to decide not to give them to her?
