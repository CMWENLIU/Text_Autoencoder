Just arrived. First thing I look for is where they're made. I bought these hoping they were made in USA. I choose these because the similar product on Amazon had a review stating they were made in China. These are too. Bummer! I just don't trust what you get from products made in China.<br />Hey Amazon, how about you put some pressed rawhide bones on your site that are made in America. I'd gladly pay a little more knowing they're actually made form cows instead of what ever is comming out of China.<br />As for the bones themselves, they look fine. My German Sheapard is less than impressed though. He took it out of my hand, set it down, and hasen't given it a look since. Waste of money!<br /><br />Update... After a while my dogs did enjoy these. They didn't last very long however, as pressed rawhide bones are supposed to. I bumped the rating up to 2 stars because at least they got around to eating them. Still hate the fact they're made in China
