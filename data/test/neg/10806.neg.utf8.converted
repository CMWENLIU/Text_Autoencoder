My review is impacted by the use of this coffee and brew method - not on the sole quality of the taste.<br /><br />We bought two EkoBrew baskets, a can of the Sumatran, and one of the Honduran. When the Sumatran refused to brew a full cup we contacted the company. Received a nice email that explained the grind was "pre EkoBrew" and they admit to it not working well with their single serve basket. That being said, they apologized and suggested for us to use less coffee with a smaller cup setting - as well as offering us a refund for the inconvenience.<br /><br />So, I'm not sure if the taste is fantastic enough for more than two stars, since I can't brew a proper cup with their own product. I gave them an extra star for customer service.
