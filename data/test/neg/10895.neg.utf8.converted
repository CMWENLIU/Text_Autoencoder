the last lot I bought months ago was what one expects if they have tried this tea before. It also was "organic" and "all natural". the flavor of this batch, with the new labeling is completely different in taste and strength.I would not recommend it if one is wanting the original flavor that made this teas reputation. a significantly weaker flavor with a more metalic taste. really a whole different tea.not an improvement.
