I thought this would be an interesting take on pesto sauce which is a favorite in our house. There were some green bits in the sauce but so few that I'm not sure why it is called pesto sauce. It is hard to taste the basil for the overwhelming flavor of onion. Pesto should contain  basil, fresh garlic, olive oil, pine nuts or walnuts, and parmesan cheese. This list of ingredients appears on the label along with tomatoes and cream to make the sauce pink. And then the onions, lots of onions, big chunks of onions. They take over the sauce. The pesto should shine through but it hardly makes an appearance. The folks at Scarpetta need to go back to the kitchen with this sauce and try again.
