I was pretty excited to see this product recently at a local store, because I like root beer quite a bit.  My wife and I greatly enjoy our Soda Stream machine, and have been fairly satisfied with most of the syrups that we have purchased, but we do prefer sugar sweetened drinks to ones that include Sucralose, which all of the standard soda stream flavors have.<br /><br />Having said all of that, I regret buying this flavor.<br /><br />This syrup has a weak taste.  Even adding more syrup does not help.  Additionally I can't taste any of the hints of nutmeg, allspice, or other spicy flavors that a good root beer should have.  I happened to look at the label and see that the product was developed in Israel.  Maybe they should have had some Americans help them develop the flavor since apparently the nice folks in Israel don't know what root beer is supposed to taste like.  I have sampled literally dozens of different root beers over the years, including many of the boutique ones that are sweetened with cane sugar.  This one ranks on the bottom as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />They should reformulate it.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that the dispenser cap is of a particular awful design for pouring the large amount of syrup needed into the Soda Stream carbonator bottle.  Would it kill soda stream to develop a bottle that had a built in spout on the cap for easier dispensing of the product?<br /><br />Also, considering that you get only the equivalent of about 18 12 ounce "cans" worth of product in this $10 bottle it is questionable if you are really saving anything over buying decent quality product at your local grocer.  Whole Foods for example has a really good quality root beer that is sweetened with cane sugar, tastes 100X better than this one and costs about $3.99 for a six pack.
