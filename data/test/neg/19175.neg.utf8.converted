I like all kinds of mac and cheese.  My homemade version uses cream, Beecher's cheese and Dungeness crab.  But then on the other hand, I also like both Stouffer's and Trader Joe's frozen, and I even like the stuff in the "blue box."  Read a lot of rave reviews of Annie's, so I picked up a box at the store today.  I'm not sure what kind of mac and cheese the people that loved this stuff have eaten in the past, but I found Annie's watery and bland.  I think it might be passable if there was twice the amount of cheese powder, but this stuff had no flavor.  Ate a couple bites and threw the rest out.  Luckily I only bought one box, but it was a complete waste of money.  Even Easy Mac is better.
