There once was a rabbit named Clover<br />Sold by Amazon, over and over<br />When they said he was fresh<br />They did NOT mean his flesh<br />Which would make a coyote* keel over<br /><br />When I saw he was missing his head<br />I surmised that old Clover was dead<br />So I took out some cheese<br />Which I melted with ease<br />And served some Welsh rarebit instead<br /><br />*pronounced kahy-OH-tee<br /><br />Note: This item does not come with Amazon's easy-open packaging.<br />It took me quite a while to find it hidden inside the shiny black top hat, even though the instructions stated quite clearly that it was a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.  In the end, I used the knife, in the kitchen.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, August 31, 2010
