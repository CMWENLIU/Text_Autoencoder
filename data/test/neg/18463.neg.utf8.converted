My wife and I thought we were doing our baby a favor by going organic.  We switched from Similac to this formula and it's hard to say if the issues we had were because of this formula....after a 10 day half and half schedule we noticed less pooping and violent screaming after eating.  Since this is our first two kids (twins) we can't say if it's the formula but something didn't seem right.  Then a friend emailed about the controversy of the synthetic additives in this formula...do your own research, but we have since switched to Baby's Only (too early to tell if it's cured the issues) and we feel better we have steered clear of the fact we might be doing more harm than good.  So frustrating!  Here is some info to help in your research.<br /><br />Seems are some issues with DHA/ ARA additives.<br /> EB's Ingredient List below...  have you looked at Baby's Only?<br /><br />Earth's Best:  Earth's Best &lt;[...]>  is the leading organic baby food manufacturer.  The company is owned by Horizon (which is owned by Dean Foods ) and offers both dairy and soy based organic infant formulas. Earth's Best uses organic lactose from cows, so if you are concerned about your baby having problems with lactose intolerance, this formula might not be the best option.<br /><br />Baby's Only: Baby's Only from Nature's One &lt;[...]>  comes as both dairy, lactose free, and soy organic formulas.  Baby's Only uses brown rice syrup, a higher quality and more complex carbohydrate, when compared to lactose.
