I got a sample packet at the GNC and I decided to try it out, couple of minutes later i start feeling a little weird, but I decided to continue with my work out, long story short, it got me very sick, my kidney hurts and I still feels some of the effects, its been almost 13 hours since i drank it!, I have been drinking a lot of water to clean my system, I hope tomorrow will be better, I definitely won't try it again, no more chemicals for me, I will stick to my toast!
