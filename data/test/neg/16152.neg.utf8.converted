While the flowers were cute...they looked nothing like the picture and had none of the same flowers. They were delivered same day as ordering so maybe the flower people used the scraps that were in the shades of pink and red. I will not buy from here again. The vase used was the nicest part of the arrangement. Kinda bummed as this was for my sister who just got out of a serious surgery.
