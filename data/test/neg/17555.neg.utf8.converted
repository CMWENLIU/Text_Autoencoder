1950's Retro Candy Gift Box<br />I ordered this for my husband for Christmas 2008.  The box was torn and banged up.  There may have been $5.00 worth of candy in it and most of it was stuff I could have bought in any novelty shop-even cracker barrel. As a matter of fact, Cracker Barrel did have similar items in a basket for half the price.  I wish I had saved my money.  Then add on the shipping- it was VERY expensive!
