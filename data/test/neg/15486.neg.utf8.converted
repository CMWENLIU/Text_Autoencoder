I ordered these jellybeans for a wedding.  They arrived quickly but it seemed like they were old or improperly stored.  The bag they arrived in was dirty, sealed by a twist-tie and the inside of the bag had a pink residue.  On most of the jelly beans, the white logo had melted off.  Returning immediately.
