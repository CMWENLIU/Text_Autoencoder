The Bag I received had a rancid ingredient in it. The Exp. date was 8/29/2012. Something made it through quality control. It is a product I would try again, though. There is a good ratio of protein to sugars. The bite I did have was mildly sweet, which I prefer.<br /><br />Update: I contacted the company about the product and provided the exp. date and batch information. They believe it could be due to storage and handling of the product. From the way I received the product I could see that as a possibility. When I get more information I will add that to my review.<br /><br />Update 11/28/11: Looks like customer service is either overworked or inept. I am guessing the later. As mentioned above, I sent a short email with the date and batch number. The response I received back asked for that information. I gave my address and after confirming a post-paid envelope was coming, I responded three weeks later saying I never received it. I received a response back saying he mailed it on 11/4. I emailed him my address on 11/7. I have no way to contact the CEO, so maybe the company is inept as well.<br /><br />Update 12/8/11: The customer service rep sent me another bag to try. Mind you, he is fully aware I am reviewing this product on amazon. The second product was slightly stale tasting. The clusters ranged from granola type flakes all the way to a 2x3 inch chunk. The taste varied by cluster the first one I had was bland, the second sweet and excessive with the cinnamon. Basically, this product should have never passed quality control. The only positive I can say is they communicated.<br /><br />I must recommend avoiding KIND snacks. A companies product is only as good as its organization in my opinion.
