I have been purchasing K-Kups for over a year now and most of the time I purchase them from on-line vendors.  They are always packaged very carefully, in single layers, neatly lined up and protected by a layer of cardboard.  This particular vendor delivered my order in a timely fashion, but neglected to package them with care.  They just threw 24 K-cups into a box and closed it for shipping.  3 out of the 24 were damaged/punctured.  Very disappointed, will go elsewhere from now on.
