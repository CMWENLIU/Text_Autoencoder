i read a lot about this product before going to the store to buy it. the low calories and low carbs really sold me, but it tastes so horrible! it was very slimy, and it was soft but still a little hard. i guess its hard to describe. it in no way resembles pasta. other reviewers complain about the smell when you open it up, but since i was cooking other stuff too i didnt notice any smell, all i could smell was the other stuff that i was cooking. i rinsed it thoroughly for about 3-4 mins. i read online that the best way to prepare it was in a skillet until you hear it pop, which is exactly what i did. i even added some low carb pesto sauce to it. the taste was fine, but the texture is something that i couldnt get over. i took two bites and threw it out. if you arent bothered by the texture of your food then this might be a good alternative to pasta for you, but for me...never again.<br /><br />on a side note, the "pasta" is supposed to be kept cold since it is tofu and all. i am not sure how this would be possible if it was delivered to your door. i dont think amazon delivers these items in a refrigerated truck, and even if they did then it would be sitting on your front porch if you werent home. best bet is to go to the supermarket and get it in the produce department (thats where i found it). try it before you stock up
