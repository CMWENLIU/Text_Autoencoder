I wish I was more positive, but I am not really happy with the product.  I have bought Traverse Bay Cherries in the past.  These cherries have an off taste as if they have been in storage too long and are far too over plump as to suggest extra sugar has been added to increase weight.  Michigan cherries from Traverse Bay has been an excellent product in the past.  I suspect these are second rate in some fashion.
