we are now disillusioned by bob's red mill products, based on quality, taste and price.<br /><br />the milk is close to double what we get carnation on sale for (.21/oz) vs .35...and bob's does not mix very well, not as well for us, not as easily as carnation.<br /><br />actually we have in the last few months just stopped buying bob's red mill products and have gone for the less expensive items and have found that they, the less expernsive taste as good, have as good quality and are far cheaper. they are like newman's own; you overpay for image and hype. a taste test for example was done on newmans oreo style vs oreo cookies and the newman came in last. so again, hype and image..
