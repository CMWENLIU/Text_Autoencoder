I have made stuffed grape leaves quite a few times before.  I used to buy a Greek & California brand of brined grape leaves from the grocery store; but since the store doesn't carry them, I ordered "Roland" brand.  These are the thinnest, most delicate grape leaves I have ever worked with.  Only 50% of the grape leaves were usable.  The rest were scraps.  Of the 50% that were usable, they were very thin, torn in places and had to be patched together sometimes.  I stuffed them with rice, etc. and never overstuff.  I think that they processed the grape leaves in brine solution for too long.  As far as my prep on them, I rinsed them and put them on warm water and gently boiled for 1 minute.  I do this all the time and have never encountered such leaves.  I knew prior to gently boiling them that the leaves were fragile because they broke apart in my hand as I was taking them out.  Don't buy this brand to stuff.  Stick with another brand.  I can't remember which brand I used to buy, but I think it had a yellow label (California) and the Greek one might have been "Krinos".
