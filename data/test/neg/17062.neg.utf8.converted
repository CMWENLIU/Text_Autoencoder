Buyer beware. The coffee blend for Obsidian appears to have changed (along with the k-cup packaging).  If you are a first time Obsidian buyer it may not matter to you that the Coffee blend has changed but for me, a faithful Obsidian  coffee drinker, it is a huge disappointment and deal changer.  Until recently, Obsidian k-cups were only available at a certain large chain. Now that they have expanded availability, they seem to have changed the blend/ quality of the coffee.  While the roast remains the same, the bean appears to have changed. No thanks
