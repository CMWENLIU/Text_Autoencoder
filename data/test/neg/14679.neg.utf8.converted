I was glad that I was not the only one who felt that way seeing other 1 star reviews/comments here.<br />I had many wasabi flavored snacks and enjoyed them.<br />When I first open the package and eat couple of them, I liked it.<br />And I ate few more somehow I took a breath and inhaled while I was eating it. It was the first time ever that I felt like I had to call 911. I tried to endure first but it became worse. My chest hurt so much and I thought I was going to die for couple minutes. It hurt my chest and lung area for 30 mins. I never wrote a product review before, but this time I was wondering how a company can distribute something like this.. I like roasted beans so I might try just lightly salted one, but with this one, I don't want to take any risk.
