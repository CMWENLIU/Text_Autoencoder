I started noticing little bugs flying thru my home almost immediately after receiving this tree but didn't make the connection right away. After the window near the tree started crawling with bugs, I was forced to throw this tree out. Now that I no longer have the tree in the house, there are hundreds of dead bugs to deal with! One of the worst purchases ever.
