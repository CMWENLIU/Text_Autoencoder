Yuck. Not one of the Sodastream syrups taste "good" where "good" means "like soda." However, if you like your soda tasting like your 8 year old got loose in the kitchen and made you a "potion" to drink, you'll love it. You can find much better alternatives; e.g. the Torani syrups actually taste good and are not disgustingly sweet like this "stuff."
