I purchased this product because I thought it would be a good quick meal idea.  However, the sauce is very sweet and they provide way too much of it.  I found it more tolerable if I only used half the sauce packet.  Also, this product says it has baby corn in it... each of the sauce packets in the case I bought had a half to 1 and a half pieces of baby corn...<br /><br />This product would probably be much better if you add your own veggies and some chicken or something - but that sort of defeats my purpose of having a quick meal...
