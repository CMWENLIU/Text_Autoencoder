My 1 year old has choked on these biscuits - he is old enough to feed himself cereal pieces, baby mum-mums, etc. but choked within 1 minute of eating these biscuits.  They are hard enough that when they break off in a baby's mouth, the pieces still stay big and hard rather than dissolving like baby puffs or mum-mum biscuits, and the big pieces immediately get caught in the back of the throat.  I might keep the box around and give them to him when he's much bigger, but then it should be marketed towards toddlers who can eat them safely, definitely not to teething babies.  DANGEROUS!
