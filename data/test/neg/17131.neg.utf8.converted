I tried the Red Rain Energy Shot (Berry Flavored) at work as I was looking for a pickup one morning when I had not gotten much sleep.  Having never tried any of the little energy shots, I was unsure what to expect beyond assuming that I would become more alert.  However I experienced - NOTHING - not even the shakes or a feeling wound up or jittery (the typical side effects that you hear about when you drink too much caffeine or sugar.  Well that isn't totally right, I did get to experience the completely awful tast of the Red Rain Shot which was akin to drinking really sour cherry caugh syrup mixed with carbonated water mixed with a wonderful after taste that lasts for awhile.  Obviously these drinks aren't marketed for their taste, but geez it wouldn't hurt if they could be a touch above disgusting.<br /><br />So to wrap up, I felt no noticeable affects of the drink other than a bad taste in my mouth.  Yep - that's worth the money...
