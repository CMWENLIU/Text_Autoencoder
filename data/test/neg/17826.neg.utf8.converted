Very attractive packaging, lots of almonds, order arrived in a very timely fashion.  However this white chocolate was disappointing.  The flavor suggested they were trying to make up for this not being dark or milk chocolate by adding way too much sugar.  Kept tasting it trying to find that signature white chocolate consistancy and flavor...  disappointing.  Hershey's white has a better consistancy and flavor.  Too bad.
