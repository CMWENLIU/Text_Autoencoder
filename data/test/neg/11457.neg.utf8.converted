I just told my wife that I was going to review the 4 pounds of popcorn that we bought, and she suggested the following title: "sucky suck suck suck."  That pretty much sums it up.<br /><br />This popcorn doesn't pop well, and when it does, it tastes only half popped.  Compared to Orville Redenbacher, it only pops up to about 1/3 - 1/2 of the volume.
