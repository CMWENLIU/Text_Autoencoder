I ordered this item because it was described as a quality gift basket that you could "share" with friends and family.  And the reviews I read were outstanding.  However, when I got the basket it was extremely small.  It was smaller than my toddler's Easter basket! The food packages were so tiny that they could not be enjoyed by more than one person.  Most of the basket was paper filler.  The basket itself was slightly warped (not too badly) and the bow was made of cheap paper and was much smaller than that in the photo.  I can't imagine how they justify charging this much money for something so small . . . not to mention the shipping!  I was very disappointed.  Thankfully, I had the item shipped to my house so that I could see it before I gave it as a gift.  Needless to say, I ended up getting something else.  Don't waste your money on this one.
