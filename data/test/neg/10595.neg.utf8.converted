We have had Omaha Steak products for years.<br />We have had stuffed sole (crab and shrimp) that was very nice and convenient.<br />This was awful. Not worth tasting. All we could taste was garlic. It was very buttery(?) on the outside and alittle rubbery.<br />Left a terrible, overwhelming after taste.<br />We will not even ask for a replacement, which Omaha is not very good at doing anyway.
