When the product arrived it had obviously melted enough to fuse together and re-cooled.  This gave, I felt, a very grainy texture that wasn't unpleasant but wasn't right.  I understand they are supposed to have a slightly different texture from "normal" marshmallows but I felt the temperature change exaggerated that difference.  It also meant I had to pick the marshmallows apart to use them.  When trying to convince people they were just as good as un-kosher marshmallows was not the time for this to happen.
