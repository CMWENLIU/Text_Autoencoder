I'm a vegan and love Ezekiel products, and I have no quarrel with the quality or the good intentions of Food For Life, Inc.  However, a 41% price increase since November 14, 2010, for their flax cereal is extreme.  The current price $41.54 for 6 boxes comes out to $7.00 each for a small 16 ounce box.  The other Ezekiel cereals are priced normally ($24-$29/box).
