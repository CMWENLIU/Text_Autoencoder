I typically am not a big proponent of single-purpose specialty gadgets, but the Babycook was appealing to me for convenience. The product does deliver in that it significantly reduces dishes/clean up - however the processing function is surprisingly weak. To puree steamed chunks of carrots takes far longer to pulse than what the manual implies. I have to pulse & scrape down multiple times before foods are completely pureed - something I would definitely not have to do with a food processor or even a blender. I was very surprised not to have seen this shortcoming mentioned in reviews as of yet, but perhaps my expectations are a bit higher because I do cook on a very frequent basis. Although I love the idea of having an easy machine to whip up fresh baby food, I'll likely return it and use a steamer + food processor for better results.
