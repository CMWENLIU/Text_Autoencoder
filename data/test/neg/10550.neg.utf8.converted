This stuff is terrible! It tastes like a homemade fortified wine. We served it at a dinner party of ten and nobody liked it whatsoever...at all....not even a little bit. Thank God we had plenty of real wine and real alcohol to serve, as if we had solely relied upon this beverage, the dinner party would have been a bust!<br /><br />In fact, I am a trained chef and the other chef we served it to also thought it tasted like sparking drain cleaner...<br /><br />Great bottle...nice marketing...very poor product. I cannot believe they actually did any market surveys on product taste whatsoever...!<br /><br />Very...very disappointing!
