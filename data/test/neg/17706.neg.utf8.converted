I agree with I hate it , practically no peanuts. I bought it because there was a couple of 4 and 5 ratings, but should have listened to the 1 rating. I purchased peanut brittle from another company that was delicious but they are not taking orders now. Thought I would try this, and I took a couple of bites and through the rest in the garbage. Save your money DO NOT BUY.
