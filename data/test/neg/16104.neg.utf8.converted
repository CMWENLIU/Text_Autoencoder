Like everyone else my wife and I love these Granola bars.Started by having a golf buddy offering me one a couple of months back while playing a round on the course.Puchased 1 pack of 6 at WalMart and found them to be priced at about $.50 each.Purchased 1 box of 48 at about $.45 each from Amazon.But guess what,I picked up a box of 48 at Costco yesterday and the same identical box for $12.79 or $.26 each.<br />  Thought Amazon beat everyone but I guess I'll have to be more aware of my purchases in the future.
