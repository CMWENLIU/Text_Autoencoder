My daughter loves this product and often purchases it from a local specialty market.  But they are very pricey and this seemed a better way to purchase them.  But what we got was something that looked the same, but the product inside was much different.  The crisps in the store are nice slices that taste like strawberries.  These are mangled pink bits that taste like strawberries that went bad.  Maybe this is just a bad batch, but as you cannot return the items, I am not going too waste anymore money from this seller or on this item from him.
