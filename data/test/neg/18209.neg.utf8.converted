I have Celiac Disease and heard so much good stuff about Hemp Seeds.  I purchased this 3lb. bag and was excited to try it.  The first time I became very nauseous and I did not connect it to the Hemp Seeds.  The next time I sprinkled it on my salad.  Approximately two hours later I got horrible stomach cramps and uncontrollable vomiting.  It was so awful!  I was in pain the whole night.  I was afraid to eat anything the next day.  I just had Gatorade and a banana.  I don't think I could ever try Hemp Seeds again.  I don't know if this was a bad batch or if they share equipment with a wheat facility. I will never buy this again.
