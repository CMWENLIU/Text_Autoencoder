My one-star refers to this so-called "20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition" of this hilarious and eye-popping delight from director Tim Burton.<br /><br />Since the inception of the DVD format, I have been waiting for a proper DVD of Beetlejuice with commentary and special features.<br /><br />I am sorry to say that this pathetic disc is NOT what I have been waiting for.<br /><br />Though they supposedly have spruced up the picture, the ONLY special features are three Beetlejuice cartoons and I think some music track or something.<br /><br />NO commentary, NO behind-the-scenes, NO nothing.<br /><br />So -- NO sale.<br /><br />I'm still waiting...
