On March 21, 2011, I purchased a Brussel's DT9049DCM Crepe Myrtle Bonsai tree through Amazon.  The tree received in a dormant state (No leaves or signs of growth).  In mid April 2010 I became concerned about the lack of growth (Only about six leaves) on the entire tree and all those leaves on a coupe branches only.  I telephoned Brussel's to determine if tree was late to thrive or what.  I received a return call from Brussel's Bonsia Master who stated that it was normal that their trees was just now starting to grow and to give it two to four weeks and call him back with the status.  Upon request I e-mailed them six protographs of the tree.  After a couple weeks all signs of life on the tree were gone.  An additional six photographs were sent and with the exchange of several emails where they indicated they would replace the item.  On May 17, 2001, I received an email indicating you purchase the item from Amazon so go through them for a replacement or you can buy a new one directly from them.  Now I have never returned an item through Amazon, but to say I am very disappointed in this matter is an understatement.  Is there any assistance Amazon can provide in this matter??????  Try and find a phone number to call Amazon.  I sent an email through their system without any response.  Buyer beware, if you want to be treated like a second class system buy from Brussel's through Amazon.  After the purchase of eleven trees through Brussels and about seven of them through Brussel's has lost a CUSTOMEr.  As well if I can't get any response through Amazon they have lost a CUSTOMER as well!!!!!!!!
