I'm unable to review product, but surely can say that Barry Farm is not the easiest place to work with.  Perhaps it's just the Holiday jitters.  Postal Service notified me they received empty package from the order I placed with them several weeks ago.  I thought it'd be an easy matter to handle, but after not hearing back, I called Barry Farms, and was greeted with rudeness from person answering the phone.  She told me I was talking over her as I tried to briefly explain the situation.  Having paid only $2.69 for a product that cost $7.80 to ship, I was not satisfied with their customer service, and since the company told me this happens sometimes, perhaps they need to readjust their packaging methods.
