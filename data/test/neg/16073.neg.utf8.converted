I love dark chocolates, the darker the better. However unlike the many other Ghirardelli dark chocolates this one isn't good.<br /><br />The chocolate itself doesn't melt smooth, has bad mouth feel, and is absolutely flavorless. The chocolate actually reminds me of the poor tasting choco-bits in some ice creams, just waxy and lacking of flavor. And it doesn't even taste the same as their regular 60% chocolate. If Ghirardelli would have used the same chocolate as their other filled delights then it would actually taste really good.<br /><br />The caramel filling is the only redeeming quality of the chocolate. Smooth, full flavored, and not overly sticky (like some chocolate makers tend to use).<br /><br />Overall this is a poor quality chocolate that is waxy and flavorless with the only good thing being the caramel filling. Ghirardelli really dropped the ball on this one and am a bit surprised that they allowed it out on the market.<br /><br />My recommendation, buy a different flavor or brand, this is definitely not Ghirardelli at their best.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Caramel filling tastes great.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Waxy, doesn't melt well.<br />The chocolate itself is flavorless.
