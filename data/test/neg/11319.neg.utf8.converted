Let me say I have been drinking ONE coconut water since it first came to market and I loved it. I noticed my last shipment had a funny taste.  I checked the shipping carton and found that ONE has started getting its coconut water from the Phillipines.  Big mistake.  It's awful. The only way you'd know this is if you buy it by the case.  ONE doesn't identify the source country on individual Tetra Paks. Anyone who started with ONE in the beginning knows they used only Brazilian coconuts as their source.  The original stuff was crisp, clean and totally refreshing.  This new source is murky and not satisfying at all.  Time to look into other brands.  I'm so disappointed.
