This bulk box seems to be defective. I know my Equal, and this stuff just doesn't measure up! I did a side by side comparsion with some I had already (purchased from Walmart recently). The Bulk box Equal wasn't as white and it just didn't sweeten.<br />I suspected it was old, but the outside of the bulk box said it doesn't expire until 2014. If its not too old, it's possible  these packets had a hard life. They could have been exposed to too much heat. Aspartame looses its sweetness with heat.
