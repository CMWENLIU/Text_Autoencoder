This obviously is a chocolate candy such as you might buy for Halloween treats.  However, I ordered it in late spring and the weather throughout the country was unseasonably warm this year.  The people that shipped it simply stuffed the bag in a box and mailed it to me in the 80 degree weather.  Needless to say, when it arrived, there was not one piece of the candy in it's original shape.  It was melted every which way and stuck to the wrappers.  The Reese's peanut butter cups were flattened as though someone had sat on them so had to be pealed from both the stability sheet, the wrapper and the paper cup.  The flavor was ok but each piece was a real challenge to eat.  Doesn't anybody use their head when they are shipping such things?  Where is that supervisor???  This should have been shipped with dry ice.  Capeech????
