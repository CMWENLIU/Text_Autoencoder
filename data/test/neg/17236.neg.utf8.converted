... the herb basil - 'basilico' - got its name from a tale of tragic romance, in which a young damsel concealed the severed head of her illicit lover, Basilio, in a pot of basil, which she watered with her tears. (I think it was Boccaccio, but it doesn't matter...) The relevance of the story is that basil is extremely easy to grow, even in a large patio pot or a window-box. And now it has become available fresh in supermarkets from sea to shining sea. So there's no reason or excuse for 'making do' with jars or tubes of adulterated gunk.<br /><br />Here's how to make it for yourself: finely chop two large bunches of fresh basil, discarding the thick stems. Mince a whole head of fresh garlic. Pound or chop a handful of pine nuts; some people prefer blanched walnuts. Mash these three together in a mortar or a food mill. Mix in your preferred olive oil; no other oil will do. Let the pesto sit a while; a layer of olive oil should rise to the top; if not, add more olive oil, and make sure that the pesto is sealed from the air by it. With this oil seal, it will keep in a refrigerator for weeks. When you need the pesto, mix grated parmagianno or a similar hard Italian cheese into the pesto before using it. The quality of the cheese DOES matter a lot.<br /><br />Pesto is traditionally used on thin pastas, on gnocchi, and in soup. The French 'potage au pistou' is an example. The flavor of basil doesn't survive high temperatures; cooked pesto, on pizza for instance, is basically just oily garlic. Once you've made your own pesto and tasted it, you'll never be interested in the stuff in jars except for backpacking trips.
