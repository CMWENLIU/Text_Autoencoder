This is one of the most awful products I've ever bought.  I had purchased it many years ago and thought it was terrible, but several years later, in a small town with no other options, I tried it again.  And again, really horrible.  It's hard to believe that this extremely oily and disgusting-tasting stuff could still be on the market when there are many other options.
