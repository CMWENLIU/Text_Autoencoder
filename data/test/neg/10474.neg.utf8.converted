The best thing about Melissa's dried blueberries is the plastic bag it comes in which you can reseal.  The ingredients are whole blueberries and high fructose corn syrup.  A serving is 1/3 of a cup (2 servings per 3 oz package).  Each serving contains 22g of sugar and the total carbs are 34%.  That's a lot for 1/3 of a cup of blueberries.  They offer 2% vitamin A, no vitamin C or iron, and 6% calcium.  I bought them to snack on but will try them in cooking after cutting back on other sugar before I throw them out.
