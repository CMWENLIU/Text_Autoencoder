I was so looking forward to these.  Having grown up in Europe and now living in the States, I miss real black licorice (ie. not Twizzlers!). The licorice I was used to as a kid wasn't really soft and sweet so, by the description of these, I thought I'd hit the jackpot. SO wrong! These are VERY salty.  I couldn't finish even 1 piece, I had to spit it out! It's like swallowing sea water. All 5 members of my family tried a piece and not 1 piece was swallowed! Very disappointed and a big waste of $23. All 3 bags went straight in the trash!
