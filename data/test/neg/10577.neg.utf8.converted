Fairly simple. Take a great product like Nutella. Package in convenient single servings (great for camping) and sell them. Ordered 2 boxes for a trip to Everest this Spring. Opened both boxes and discovered a mess - leaked packets everywhere. Don't waste your time or money. Better off buying a container from the store. I'm sure this not the first time this has happened.
