I have tried a couple different brands of Matcha teas, and this was definitely the cheapest, and well, "you get what you pay for."  This tea is a dingy looking, "pea green" and fairly bitter... whereas other higher quality more expensive brands are brighter and fresher tasting (the brighter the tea the BETTER quality it is).<br /><br />Although green tea is ingredibly healthy, you HAVE to be very careful about your source since manyof the poorer quality green teas (particularly those grown in China, Pakistan, and India) contain potentially high levels of metals such as fluoride, lead, and aluminum. Just FYI...aluminum in the body has been linked with Alzheimer's disease.<br /><br />So if your going to be consuming green tea on a *DAILY* basis, spend a little more money for some healthy and PURE green tea!
