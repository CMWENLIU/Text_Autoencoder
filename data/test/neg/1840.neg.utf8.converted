Four out of twelve cans were dented, 3 severely so--the cans are caving in.  I'll try to load a picture.  I have no idea if this was a shipping malfunction (the box wasn't THAT damaged) or if this is why the cans are so well priced?  Now I'm wondering if they're also expired?  If there is an expiration date on the can, it is encoded, so I won't be able to tell if this is just cosmetic damage or not safe to use?
