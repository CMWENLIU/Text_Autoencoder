My family members have used words like "gross" and "disgusting" to describe these chews and I have to admit that I agree.  We routinely eat natural foods and snacks so I wasn't expecting Twizzlers - but I was expecting a product that tasted like raspberry.  Something about the molasses + fruit gives it a weird twang and a wretched aftertaste that was very much like prune juice.  If you love really dark molasses (like blackstrap) then perhaps you might like these but I am having trouble even giving them away.
