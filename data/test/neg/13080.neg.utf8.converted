Recently, I was over watching the Celtics game at my friend's apartment. As the game grew more and more intense, I consequently grew more and more parched.<br /><br />"Hey Brian," I said. "You got anything to drink?"<br /><br />"Yeah!" he replied. "I've got some lavender soda in the fridge."<br /><br />"Lavender soda?" I asked, skeptical. "Where does a person even get lavender soda?"<br /><br />"It was sitting on a table next to a couch in the furniture section of Marshall's, so I bought it." Brian replied.<br /><br />I walked to the kitchen, my interest piqued. Drinking lavender soda sounded like a wonderfully unique experience, as I typically enjoy the scent of lavender soaps. However, I would soon learn that drinking a flower-flavored soda would not be the exciting experience I had hoped it would be.<br /><br />When I took my first sip, I thought to myself, "What have I gotten myself into this time?" The initial flavor tasted like club soda that had been poured into a glass that contained soap residue from a previous cleaning. "Interesting," I thought. "Perhaps the flavor is just subtle at first." However, as my drinking experience continued, I came to realize that this would not be the case. After I swallowed the soda, I was faced with an aftertaste that, rather than tasting like soap residue, tasted simply like soap. Like a bar of soap was in my mouth. This brought back horrible memories of my childhood...<br /><br />You see, when I was but a young boy, my mother would always threaten to "wash my mouth out with soap" if I either said a bad word or said something disrespectful to her or my father. Being one to always question my mother's conviction, I often found myself with a bar of soap in my mouth. This had a tremendous, lasting psychological effect, as even twenty years later I can still taste the flavor of soap in my mouth when I consider saying a bad word. Consequently, when I took my first taste of lavender soda, I was hit with a flood of emotions. I felt as though I had said a bad word or broken a rule. I felt as though I was being punished for something but could not recall what I had done. My vision began to become cloudy. I began to lose control of my small motor functions. I was soon reduced to a bluthering mess on the floor after being bombarded with such deeply-buried memories. I vowed never again to sip of such a soda as long as I shall live, lest I suffer another episode such as the one described above.<br /><br />In summary, this soda tastes more like lavender-scented soap than it does soda. It might be better suited for a more delicate palate than my own, but I, personally, do not prefer it.
