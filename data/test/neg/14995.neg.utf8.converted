This coffee might taste like Kalhua if you added some, but I couldn't taste anything but a nice medium strong cup of coffee. Only my opinion and I'm not a coffee expert, so take it for what it is.<br /><br />Update: I may have been a little more critical than I should have, I guess I was expecting a little more flavor like some of the other flavored coffees. There is a slight taste of Kahlua, not much but it's still a good cup of coffee, just don't count on a strong Kahlua taste. I'll have no problem buying it again just for the taste of the coffee in general.
