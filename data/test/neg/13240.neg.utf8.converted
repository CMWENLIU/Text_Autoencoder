Guess I'm in the minority here!  I just received my package with the butter toffee peanuts and couldn't wait to try them...and what a huge disappointment.  After reading all the fantastic reviews I thought they would be great.  WRONG.  I only opened one of the six bags but I think all six will be the same- soggy and stale tasting.  Not crunchy or enjoyable in the least.  Also, they taste way too sugary so even if they were edible I don't think they would have been as fantastic as what all the reviewers were giving them.  I know everyone has different tastes, but these had such a heavy praline coating that's just overpowering.  When I eat something coated I still want to be able to taste the main flavor of the item that is coated. Too bad I wasted $27 that is non-refundable.  I definitely will not be ordering any untried grocery items from Amazon in the future.
