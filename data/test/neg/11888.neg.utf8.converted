After reading the reviews I was looking fwd to these crackers to supplement the excellent Glutino Ritz-cracker-like ones I enjoy.  I love Ener-G Food's wheat-free pretzels, they are outstanding and a main staple with my meals & snacks.  These crackers remind me of extra-thin graham crackers.  They are fragile, dry, and tasteless and don't hold up well to anything other than a delicate scoop of dip.  I was disappointed to say the least!
