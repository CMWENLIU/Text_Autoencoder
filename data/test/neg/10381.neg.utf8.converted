I purchased this based on the very good reviews and while it was on a sale.  I am so happy that I didn't pay full price.<br /><br />I do not like this coffee at all.  When I opened the first tin I was concerned because it was such a light roast.  This is not at all what I would call a robust coffee.  This is more in line with Dunkin' Donuts or a Deli cup of coffee.  If you are a fan of Starbuck's or Seattle's Best roasts this will be a let down.  I wound up mixing the coffee with a darker roast in an attempt to make it more palitable.  Now I have two cans left that I don't want.<br /><br />I'm not saying that this is awful coffee, but it's not for me and may not be for you if you're used to darker roasts and stronger coffee.  I was really disappointed because people generally seem to really like this brand, and I liked the idea that it was sustainably grown.
