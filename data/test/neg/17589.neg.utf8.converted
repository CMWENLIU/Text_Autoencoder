Don't believe you are getting Tippy Golden Assam as the picture on the box suggests.<br />Once again I was deceived in believing that the little picture on the box is the actual end product I will be getting, this is the second time The Tao of Tea had me fooled with misleading good looking picture of full leaf tea on the box only to discover extremely low quality leaf inside the box.<br />This Assam is pretty bad.
