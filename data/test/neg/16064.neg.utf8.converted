I rarely ever write reviews, but after spending the last hour trying to force feed myself this ungodly soup, I felt it was necessary. To put it simply, this soup should be classified as a warcrime in a can. The chef's responsible should be brought up on charges and sentenced in front of an international tribunal.<br /><br />Yes, it has lower sodium. That is why I bought it. Little did I know ALL OF THE FREAKING FLAVOR lies in that second 50%. Who knew?!?! What's left taste like a Motel 6 bed comforter, a carrot and a handful of rusty nails have been simmered slowly in a dirty bathtub. Mmm mmm mmm! Dang, it feels good being healthy!
