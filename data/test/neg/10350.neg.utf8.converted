I bought these through Amazon from Ozbo and the package is listed at the top of the page as .85oz but they are really .60 oz.  KV Pet is doing this, too!  Now Drugstore.com!.  They don't sell this size product.  No .85's just .60 ozs!  They're ripping you off!  Shameful!  But the treats are great.  1 Star because of the bait and switch.  5 stars for Pure Bites!  Avoid these sellers!  Ozbo!  Kv pet!  DrugStore.com!
