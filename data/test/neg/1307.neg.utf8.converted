#1  The shipping is more than the item.<br /><br />#2  I just received this "orgeat".  Orgeat is an almond infused sugar syrup.  The Fee Brother's "Orgeat" is corn syrup, artificial flavors and preservatives.  Not surprisingly, it had a bland flavor.<br /><br />#3  Good cocktails are made from good mixers.  This is not a good mixer.
