Ok, I read all the reviews & looking at the picture on the pkg, this sounded like<br />it would be in consistancy like a cracker.  More than one reviewer saying how you<br />could put peanut butter or cheese on it.<br /><br />Well, DON'T BE DECEIVED!  These are thinner than paper!! & see through!  {unlike the picture on the pkg].  One reveiwer said how "filling" they are!  How is that possible?  Maybe if you eat the whole pkg which would be like eating 2 crackers!<br /><br />Extremely disappionted with this purchase & false advertising.  :-(<br /><br />One unhappy customer here.
