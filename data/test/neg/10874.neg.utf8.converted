I did a search for low carb foods and this was one of the items that popped up! Hooray! The carb content isn't listed but I figured that Amazon wouldn't lead me in the wrong direction. WRONG! I got my order and this is chalk full of carbs. I didn't even bother to try it so I don't know if it's any good but if you're looking for a low carb goodie.... keep looking. This isn't it.
