Okay, this doesn't taste like chicken at all, contrary to popular belief or what you may have been told.<br /><br />Why the hell are they selling rabbit that doesn't taste like chicken?  Next time I want something that tastes like chicken, I'll get the frog or snake instead, not this stupid rabbit.
