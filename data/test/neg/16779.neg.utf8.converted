Having used virgin CO for a few years now, decided to try a different brand from my regular, since this 3-pack was a good price (I try to pay under 50 cents per ounce).<br /><br />This product has a more prominent flavor than my regular (Nutiva). I enjoy coconut flavor, and so this wouldn't really be a problem except that it has a noticeable off-character. I tastes spoiled (though it's not). If you have children you may recall the scent of spit-up milk from an infant--that's the flavor. It's hard to palate! This is likely the result of the processing method. This may be a "traditionally-processed" (Philippine method) oil, in which the chopped coconut is allowed to ferment in order to separate the oil. Other cold-processing methods avoid this fermentation step and extract the oil mechanically. Both result in a minimally-processed, truly "virgin" product (as opposed to a refined oil which is further processed with heat and solvents to remove flavors and other natural components). Also this has a grittier texture than I'm accustomed to.<br /><br />Two stars for overall quality (and I'm just a big fan of coconut oil), but beware of the stronger and unpalatable smell and taste.
