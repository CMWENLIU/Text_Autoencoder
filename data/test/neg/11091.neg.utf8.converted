You won't find yourself soaking up the last trace of Scarpetta pasta sauce on your plate with a slice of pugliese. In fact, I would be surprised if you even made it through the meal.<br /><br />I'll have to contact Amazon as well, because at least one of my containers was leaking and I received a variety pack instead of only arrabiata. I love arrabiata sauce and it's not easy to find. However, something just went very wrong with this one. It's possible that it arrived spoiled, because it tasted somewhat foul and I developed a stomach ache a couple hours after I tasted a few bites of pasta and pushed the plate aside.<br /><br />I don't even know if I want to try out the other three containers anymore. Life is short. Eat accordingly.
