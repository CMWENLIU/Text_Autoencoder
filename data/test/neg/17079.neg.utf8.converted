I loved this product and would buy it again IF I had not discovered that it actually has more fructose than HFCS (high fructose corn syrup), and so is not a good choice for diabetics at all even though it has been touted as such.<br /><br />Splurge for good quality organic maple syrup or raw honey and enjoy the additional micronutrient health benefits instead. Don't be fooled like I was--unless you don't care about the fructose (which causes inflamation, etc. etc. etc)
