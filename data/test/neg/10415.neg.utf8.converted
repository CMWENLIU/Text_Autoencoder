I have eaten merguez in France all my life until moving to the US, and by the time I purchased those I was getting desperate.  Those sausages are simply not very good.  They are bland, the meat is gamy, there is no heat (there should be anywhere from a little bit to a lot of heat), and they have very little spice in them.  The meat is neither lean nor fatty, but releases a tremendous amount of water.
