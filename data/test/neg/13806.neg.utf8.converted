Usually I don't bother to review products, but in this case I feel consumers should know that they're getting. I recently bought a jar of Polaner All Fruit with Fiber Raspberry jelly. The strange thing was it didn't taste like raspberry, nor did it taste good. I finally looked at the ingredients list, and found the following: Juce concentrates (pear, grape), maltodextrin, raspberries, fruit pectin, natural flavoring, citric acid. Raspberry was third down on the list, after maltodextrin.<br /><br />What I was tasting and had paid a premium price for was grape jelly! I thought Polaner produced premium products. No where on the front label did they say grape and pear were the predominant fruit. To my view, false advertising.
