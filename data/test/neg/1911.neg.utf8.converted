I love roasted seaweed, and had purchased the Sea's brand on amazon several times. I wanted to branch out and maybe get a better bang for my buck so I tried these. They didn't compare. The seaweed itself was all stale; it lacked the crunch of other roasted seaweed. I supposed I could have tried adding strips to soup or something, but I really just wanted something I enjoy eating directly. I don't know if I just got a bad bag, but I don't think I'm going to try another one. Too bad, I loved the idea of the small wrapped portions that would fit in the pocket.
