This is the second purchase that I have made of this same product, from you, in the past six months. The first purchase went without a problem. The second, however, arrived with one of the bags being opened. There were chips in the box and oils used in the preparation of the chips had soaked into the cardboard box used for shipping as well as the other eleven bags. Apparently, more care needs to be exercised when packing the box for shipping or more careful examination of the product needs to happen prior to shipping.
