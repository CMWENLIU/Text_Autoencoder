I realize quick and easy is what all mothers strive for, but really, have you read the ingredients of this stuff?  Homemade may take more time, but do your family a favor and take the time.  There is nothing but chemicals in this stuff!  Seriously, MSG is listed twice, yet with 2 different names.  Google the ingredients!  MSG kills brain cells and leaves holes in your brain.  Don't be so trusting of what the FDA tells you is safe!
