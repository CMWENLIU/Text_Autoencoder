If you like the greaseball look, such as was popular waaaaaay back when, you can achieve that by getting a jar of this super grease from Clear. I got it because I have been using Clear shampoo which is a very good product and I expected this to be good for my hair and scalp as well. I figured that after a Clear shampoo I could just slap a dab of this Clear Balm and my hair would be more manageable and my scalp would benefit from the alleged "Therapy". Not so. This stuff is monumentally greasy. Once applied it defies all removal efforts for weeks. I will addmit that my use of this grease was not aided by any type of instruction, suggestion or comments from the maker. Nor was it packaged in any type of box or carton that might have some type of usage assistance printed on the sides. Nope, just a simple jar of ultimate grease. It does have one attribute in its favor and that is the odor. Not bad at all.<br /><br />Since I am not fool enough to use this on my hair again I tried to find a practical use for it. Recently I had a new garage door installed. The hinges made some noise during opening and closing. The installer said that they would be noisy just during the break-in period and that I should keep the hinges lubricated. I loaded the Clear grease into my grease gun and gave the hinges a shot of this amazing lubricant. My door is much quieter now and, as an unexpected additional benefit, it smells great. Useful and inexpensive - what a deal!
