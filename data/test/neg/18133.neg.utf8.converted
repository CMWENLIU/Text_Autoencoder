If you cut the ham into small pieces and mix it with a large amount of rice, beans, pasta, etc... then it would probably taste ok. But when mixed with a relatively small amount of noodles, the taste of the chemical preservatives is so overwhelming that it makes your snack/meal almost inedible. Having said that, everyone's taste preferences are slightly different, so you may want to pick up 1 can at your local grocery store and decide for yourself.
