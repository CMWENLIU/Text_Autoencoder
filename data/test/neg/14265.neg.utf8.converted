The plants arrived well packed and on time.<br />It was planted in a patio Pot with drip line and starter Miracle  Grow pellet.<br />Within a few days the healthy leaves turned bkack and dropped off leaving the center pod to grow.<br />Within a week the leaves there turned black and now have dropped off also looking like one sick plant.<br />I took lots of photos over these days.  Finally I replanted it in the soil near another Banana tree, with a drip line.<br />I have done all I could do and it looks like a loser.  It has not been in direct sun and we have not had a 100+ day.<br />Maybe they will exchange for another Banana?<br />Yuma, AZ.
