I LOVE honeybush tea.  However, this is too strong and a little bitter.  So far my favorite brands are Stash & Numi.  If you get Stash, make sure to get the tea bag and not the lose tea.  Their lose tea have a lot of sediments due to fine tea leafs.  I heard that Numi lose tea is bigger but haven't tried it yet.  Anyhow, I would not purchase this again.
