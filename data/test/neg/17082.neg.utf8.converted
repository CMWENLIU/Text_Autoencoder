Frey Lemon & Black Pepper Dark Chocolate has not been available locally for several years. Nor could I find a supplier online. So I signed up for the Cachet brand thinking it couldn't be too different. Wrong! Whereas the Frey brand was beautifully balanced, the Cachet version has a very strong dried lemon taste and the pepper burn lingers far too long. I've never experienced any food with such large, hard chunks of pepper. Really, this should not be allowed without a warning to watch out for the pits! The thing I love about the Frey Lemon Pepper Chocolate is that you can't really identify lemon or pepper, just an unique flavor explosion. And then you realize it was lemon. And pepper.
