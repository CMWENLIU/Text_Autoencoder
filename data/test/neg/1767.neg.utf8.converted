My jams were very runny when using this. Not only runny, but the fruit & liquid seperated!  I had to mix it together every time I wanted to use it.  Due to the excessive moisture, it quickly soaked through & sogged up my home baked bread for sandwiches if it wasn't eaten immediatley.  Forget having a sandwich at work!  I needed a fork for the soppy mess! I don't plan to purchase it again & even gave away my surplus!<br />I am now using the Pomona's Universal Pectin sugar free & it is fantastic!  Every single batch of every type of jam turned out stunning!  Excellent color & flavor!  I'm so thrilled with Pomonas!  Avoid this stuff & invest in the Pomona's, it's the best!
