First of all let me say the beans came quickly, were packed adequately and were priced right.  They looked and smelled fine, not too dry and decent amount of aroma.  They probably would have been fine for cooking, but they did not perform up to my expectations. I have been making Vanilla extract for the last 5+ years or so and that's why I bought the beans.  I make 750mL at a time using vodka as the base. I cut up 4 beans and began soaking them a week before Christmas.  After 2 weeks the extract was not strengthening correctly (too light of a color) so I added 2 more beans.  Now that it is the end of January (over a month of soaking) they still have not extracted properly. I have the last batch to compare it to (different beans -- I believe Tahitian) and the current batch is half the shade and strength of the previous with 50% more beans.  So I will go back to the more expensive Tahitian beans.
