I like to try all different health food bars and when I saw one that combined my two favorite things together (chocolate and hazelnuts) I said, "oooh I have to try".  I was sorely disappointed.  I bought two of these and I was excited to try one.  I opened it and was hit by the awful smell of... well a foot-like scent.  So that was a turnoff, but I said hey I have never been one to let looks or smell hinder me from trying something new.  So I went ahead and ate it.  I had to force myself to finish it.  It was like torture eating this.  It tasted awful.  I actually opened up the second and dared a coworker to try it because it was so bad.  He tried it and he felt the same way.  It has almost no flavor, but what flavor it does have lingers in your mouth and grosses you out.<br /><br />Who I'd recommend it to:  1.) People that like to give friends that lose bets something awful to eat. 2.) My enemies.
