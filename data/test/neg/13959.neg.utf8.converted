While eating this bar, I compared this with two other dark chocolate bars with coffee beans that I regularly eat: Endangered Species Dark Chocolate with Espresso Beans (72%) and Chocolove Coffee Crunch in Dark Chocolate (55%).<br /><br />My first impression of the Scharffen Berger is that the coffee more finely ground, so it's not crunchy like the Endangered Species or Chocolove, but it's not smooth either. It's more similar to the Green & Black (which I didn't have with me to compare while eating the Scharffen Berger so I don't entirely recall). It ends up just making the chocolate feel gritty in my mouth.<br /><br />My next impression is that the bar itself is significantly thinner than other bars, which gives it a softer, smoother texture, but ultimately just ends up emphasizing the gritty texture of the coffee.<br /><br />I also felt like the chocolate itself was a little bit sweet which I attributed to it being a 62% versus the 72% of the Endangered Species. However, the Chocolove is a 55%, which should be too sweet for me, but that chocoloate holds up much better and seems smoother than the Scharffen Berger.<br /><br />My final issue with the Scharffen Berger is that it has a lingering, bitter after-taste that I don't get with the other bars, providing a less-than-satisfying experience that makes me want to go eat or drink something else.<br /><br />Overall, I think the Chocolove and Endangered Species coffee and/or espresso chocolate bars are far superior.
