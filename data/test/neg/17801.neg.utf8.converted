This stuff is awful. It is mushy and weighs only about 31/2 ounces. The brine soaked parchment paper must be added to the weight. I don't know what whole lobster meat means as printed on the label, but these cans had no tail meat at all and the claw meat bordered on inedible. What a sucker I was. Don't fall for the positive reviews; they cannot be legit. This is garbage.
