I bought this rice in the ten pound bag at my local indian market for twelve dollars.  I bought it over my usual brand b/c I thought my toddler would like the cute zipper top zebra bag.  Bad decision, upon rinsing the rice I noticed a solvent smell, like kerosene.  I thought I'd cook some to see if it went away, or what would happen.  It still smelled and I could taste the kerosene-y smell.  I threw it all away and will go back to my regular brand.
