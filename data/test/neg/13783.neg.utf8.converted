I continue to be disappointed with the quality of the Camel Halvah that I have received from Amazon. When it is available, it has been stale. I usually do not order the vanilla, but since they had been out of the marble for so long I decided to try them. They were even more stale them the majority of the marble bars I had received over the past year or so. I really don't understand that if a product is temporarily out of stock and then they re stock, in my mind I think it is fresh stock. Apparently this is not true with this product. I will point out that though I have emailed the manufacturer of the Camel Halvah, Nobel Foods, about this problem with little satisfaction, I have not contacted Amazon customer service to complain. I am guessing that when I have the opportunity to and with their track record, they will do their best to make the situation right with me.
