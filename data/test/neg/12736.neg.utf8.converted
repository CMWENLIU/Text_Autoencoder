A long time ago, Burger King had this little promotion going on that had a little packet of cheese powder that came glued to a paper bag with your order so you could dump your fries in, add the powder, and shake the bag up and coat the fries in cheesy decadence.<br /><br />I've been trying to find the equivilent of these packets on the market. This wasn't it. Not only was this NOT it, this isn't a very user friendly product, and it's uses are very linear.<br /><br />>The powder will NOT work in any sort of shaker, unlike the cheese powders you see for popcorn. This makes dispensing the powder a little annoying because it pretty much as to stay in the bag.<br /><br />>While it does taste like cheese when you dap a bit on your finger, the flavor ends there when added to any foods (in a moderate amount)<br /><br />>Tossing it with anything wet/fried with result in large clumps of cheese gathering at the bottom with less than 5% of what you used actually sticking to your food.<br /><br />>Adding it to soups for flavor proved to be just as problematic because the powder mimics the old "Ovaltine" habit of clumping up in little bubbles of itself and won't mix in.<br /><br />Basically, this product has only one real intended use it seems: if you want to make your own macaroni and cheese that tastes just like Kraft, here's the powder in bulk form. Still need butter and milk.<br /><br />So I suppose if you are REALLY pinching pennies, this is a cheaper alternative to an already cheap meal. But there is no diversity whatsoever and to me, that's disappointing enough to keep me from ever ordering more.
