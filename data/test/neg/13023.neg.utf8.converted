I have bought other Taylors products before and have enjoyed their quality, but felt this one wasn't quite up to their usual par.  I like a good strong cup of tea, and this was much milder and less malty in flavor than expected. Also, when I opened the bag, the tea leaves were very small, almost like filings; not the "leaves" I expected.  Don't know if I just got a bad batch or this was a bad year for this type, but don't think I would buy again.  Will stick to their South African Kwazulu tea- it's delicious.
