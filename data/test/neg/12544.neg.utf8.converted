I have to say after watching the Narnia movie, I was curious about the turkish delight that Edmund so desired to have. Well I ordered some and my husband and myself were both disappointed with the product. Too make matters even worse, the order was for 4 boxes of this stuff. I took a box to work with me and this is the only food item that sat back on our break table for a whole week and only half of the box was gone. My husband had the same experience when he also took a box to his work. The flavors were not appealing to most including us. I would not buy any more of this product in the future.
