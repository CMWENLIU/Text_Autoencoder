Bought this in sept. and did not pay to much attention to price at 16.83  3lb box and then saw them in the store for 7.99. Boy did i feel  like an idiot.  do your comparison shopping and do not waste your money on 3rd party sellers.Update.. Food 4 less had this box for 6.49 good buy and the cookies were fresh this time ?
