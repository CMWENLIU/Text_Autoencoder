I bought this syrup because my partner loves everything pumpkin. I thought I'd try it out to make pumpkin lattes and potentially use it to flavor other things.<br /><br />However, when tasted it, I was overwhelmed by cinnamon. I like cinnamon, but I felt the "spice" completely overpowered the pumpkin.<br /><br />Just in case the flavor would mellow when combined with food I tried it in a latte. The cinnamon still predominated and my drink had such a strong aftertaste I actually couldn't finish it. To be fair, I often find pre-flavored coffees to have an undesirable aftertaste as well, but I've had good luck with various syrups and additives... for instance, I can't stand Irish Creme flavored coffee, but I quite enjoy the occasional coffee with an actual shot of Irish Creme.<br /><br />I'm not saying the syrup is of bad quality, it's just that I feel it's important to let folks know exactly what they're in for.<br /><br />SUMMARY: I can't really taste the pumpkin over all the spice... very strong presence of cinnamon.
