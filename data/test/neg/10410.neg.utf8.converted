There are a lot of reported benefits to xylitol, but Trident is just using it as a marketing gimmick here. The ingredients list for this gum starts out like this: sorbitol, maltitol, gum base, mannitol, xylitol... That's right, xylitol is the fifth ingredient, and the fourth sugar alcohol!<br /><br />If you do a little searching on the internet, you'll come across a number of doctors and dentists who have said that this gum has too little xylitol to have any practical effect. For people who don't read labels closely, this might also lead them to think that this gum is actually sweetened with xylitol (which causes fewer digestive problems than sorbitol and maltitol).<br /><br />The bottom line is that they've added a few milligrams of xylitol so that they can pretend that this gum is healthier and thus charge more.
