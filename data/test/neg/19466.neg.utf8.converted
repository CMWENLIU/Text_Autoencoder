Oils should be in cans or dark glass. This is one of the oldest companies who supposedly supported healthy foods, but then turn around and use plastic, which can leach hormones [ used to make the plastic ], into the oil....virtually tainting their own originally high quality product!<br /><br />I can't believe they did such a thing and am very disappointed with Hain.
