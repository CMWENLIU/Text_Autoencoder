This was one of the most bitter stevia products I've tried.  The best I've had is probably Nirvana stevia, but it's based out of Australia, so shipping's pretty high.  Second best is NuStevia's packets that have stevia mixed with a sugar alcohol.  NuStevia's regular stevia is not good, in my opinion, though not as bad as Spoonable stevia.
