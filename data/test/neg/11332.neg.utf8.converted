Ever leave a glass of water on your night stand and then take a sip the next morning? That's what this "Coconut Water" tastes like. Well, if you added a teaspoon of skim milk to a stale glass of water, you'd have an exact match. This product is terrible. Even if I was REALLY thirsty, I would rather drink tap water that is filled with chlorine over this stuff. At least tap water has a little crispness to it. Do yourself a favor and skip this product.
