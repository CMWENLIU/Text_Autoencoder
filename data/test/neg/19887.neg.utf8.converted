I got this as a Christmas gift and was at first thrilled.  But after a month of use, I have to finally admit that it makes horrible coffee.<br /><br />For starters, I like good coffee (and I do NOT consider STARBUCKS in this category).  I buy Seattle's Best or Lion Coffee, use filtered water, and clean my coffeemaker thoroughly every use so it looks new.  I use 2+ scoops for 14 OZ and somehow it still tastes incredibly weak.  By contrast, I only use one scoop in a regular drip maker and not only does it taste robust, but I don't need to go through coffee twice as fast.<br /><br />Greatly disappointed.
