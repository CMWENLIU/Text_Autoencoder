What once came in a 12oz can, had 70% fruit juice and tasted uniquely refreshing has been unnecessarily transformed into an over-priced, 10.5oz can of flat 7-UP.  The only term I can think of that describes the new version of Knudsen's Mandarin Lime Spritzer is "Whooptie-Doo!"<br /><br />Just for archival purposes, since Knudsen's think they're doing us all a favor by ruining this drink, here's a list of differences between the old tasty drink and the new flat 7-UP version:<br /><br />OLD Mandarin Lime Spritzer Ingredients:<br /><br />* Sparkling Filtered Water<br />* 70% White Grape Juice Concentrate<br />* Natural Flavors<br />* Tangerine Oil<br />* 12oz Can<br /><br />NEW Mandarin Lime Spritzer Ingredients:<br /><br />* Sparkling Filtered Water<br />* 60% White Grape, Lime and Mandarin Juice Concentrates<br />* Natural Flavors<br />* 10.5oz Can<br /><br />For me, the biggest difference is the lack of Tangerine Oil that gave the original version a unique, fresh flavor.  The new version tastes like flat Sprite or Flat 7-UP and is absolutely boring.<br /><br />Additionally, what once came in a 6-pack now comes in an over-priced 4-pack.<br /><br />Less quality, less juice, less flavor and fewer cans for MORE money. What the heck is Knudsen doing?  Why change something like this that wasn't broken in the first place?<br /><br />Hopefully others will reward Knudsen for this kind of self-destructive behavior and stop buying their products.  After all, flat 7-UP is really cheap and easy to make - and still comes in 12oz can 6-packs.
