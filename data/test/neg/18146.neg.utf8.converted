It is good juice, but it is not concentrate like it says. It does have water added. I have seen a bottle of this brand that is a concentrate and does not have water added, but cannot find it anywhere. I thought this was it, but it's not. I can get this locally with the water added. I want the concentrate, just cranberry (with the c). If I wanted the juice with the water, I would have given it five stars. I give it one because the ingredient list is different, and that is what I expect, the ingredients to be right.
