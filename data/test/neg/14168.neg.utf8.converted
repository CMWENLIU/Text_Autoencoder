I received this item and although in the same packaging, the contents do not look the same as what I buy at the stores.  I expected this item to be clear and crystalline in appearance.  What I received was tan and crushed and I am afraid it may be old and spoiled.  Amazon does not refer the buyer to online customer service so guess I will have to call.  Not that they can help me as they won't know if the product is bad or not.  This may have to be returned.  What a hassle...
