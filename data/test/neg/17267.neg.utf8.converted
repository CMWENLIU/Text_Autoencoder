I was very excited to find a natural beef jerky without any wheat in the ingredient list!  HOWEVER, once we actually got it and read the (very long) ingredient list, we were very disappointed.<br /><br />Here's what the manufacturer listed as ingredients:<br />Ingredients:<br />Beef, Lite Salt (Salt, Potassium Chloride), Chilies, Brown Sugar, Sugar, Black Pepper, Garlic, Citric Acid and Cornstarch.<br /><br />Here's the actual ingredient list from the Hoppin' Hickory flavor:<br />Ingredients:<br />Beef, water, corn syrup, sugar, salt, soy sauce powder (naturally fermented soy beans, wheat, salt, maltodextrin), worcestershire sauce powder, corn syrup solids, salt, caramel color, garlic powder, sugar, spices, soy sauce solids, naturally fermented wheat and soybeans, salt, maltodextrin, caramel color), palm oil, tamarind, natural flavor, citric acid, garlic powder, onion powder, spice.<br /><br />Not the worst ist in the world, but since we have wheat allergies, we can't actually eat the product.  We're also trying to avoid corn syrup.  I realize it takes a while to type out all of the lable ingredient lists, but since these are non-returnable items and will be ingested, it is the manufacurers responisbility to inform customers accurately regarding what is actually in the product.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that a product had sucralose in it...some folks get very sick from these ingredients.  It's my responsibility to read the package and double check prior to actually eating someting (which I did) - but it's disappointing, expensive, and a hassle to get something other than what I've ordered.<br /><br />My appreciation to Amazon for refunding my purchase because of the inaccurate info on the web site.
