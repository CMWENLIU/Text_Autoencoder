I purchased this item, as well as the Oskri almond granola, as a healthful alternative to my current snack regimen. I was hoping for something more "clean" than the usual crap available at my local grocers. However, I did not realize that I would be sacrificing flavor. This granola was not good at all. The morsels were clumped together and there was overwhelmingly unpleasant taste. In addition, each package is actually two servings (i.e. more calories, fat, sugar, and carbs = not healthy). This item is not what I had expected nor anticipated. I will eat fruit or something else instead.
