The first box I received tasted fine but the second box arrived stale.<br />Amazon does not allow returns on food so that does not leave much confidence in ordering any further.<br />It's too bad because this particular mix is the best out of all of them as some of them can taste really disgusting, makes you wonder what the KIND team was thinking. Will have to try and find them locally.
