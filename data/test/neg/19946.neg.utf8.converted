I was happy to see the list of ingredients here listing the peas and broccoli before the pears, thinking that as in package ingredients the larger ingredients are listed first. But after ordering I see on the package ingredient list that, yes, pears are the majority of the ingredients. Common but misleading the way this prodcut description was written.
