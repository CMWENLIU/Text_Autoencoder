Not sure why all the rave reviews. I sent this as a gift to my mother for her birthday. She said all the items were in large  boxes with only one item in each except for the 3 1" biscotti. So 13 or so boxes with 1 or 2 items in most boxes. The only thing weighty was the mustard. She did say the cookies and such tasted good(THUS THE 2 STARS) but I think for the price there should have been more content. Will not buy from this company again. And I use Amazon alot.
