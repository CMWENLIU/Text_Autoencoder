I was really looking forward to sharing some of these "old time" treats, I had as a child, with my family.  Some of the most desired items listed were not in the box, like A&W, Target Sticks, Bit O-Honey, etc.  Even so, there was a decent variety.  Sadly, most of the items were stale, flavorless, or too chewy. What was supposed to be a fun walk down memory lane, was just a disappointment. I gave two stars because the hard candy was acceptable and the wrappers were nostalgic, but I cannot recommend this item.
