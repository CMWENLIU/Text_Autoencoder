My cats have been eating this for several years and up to now-have loved it.  I have purchased this product from pet shops and amazon.  This last shipment from amazon is not the same product as the label claims.  When the can is opened, it initially looks and smells like salmon, but underneath the 1/8 inch of a top layer of the real looking stuff, is something else.  It looks like a wee bit of the real product was sprayed over an imposter product, because it is not the same underneath, nor does it look or smell the same.  My cat vomited with the first feeding.  My cats don't like it now.  they eat the salmon coating and leave the rest.  I want to know where amazon got this batch of cans, because it is not Dick Van Pattens Natural Balance. Someone is duping us and we are paying a high price for a fraud. Identifiers on the bottom of the can are: NBSCP, best by Jan 13 15, the numbers below the sku on the box are: 723633004152.
