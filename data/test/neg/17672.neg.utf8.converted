I have to agree with another reviewer that this is not the best of the Kona coffees that I have relished in the past. That includes those that I have had the pleasure of drinking in Hawaii several times. Frankly, I found it to have a bitter aftertaste rather than the smooth finish that is typical of this type of superior coffee. I can't knock the seller for his promptness, though I was surprised the coffee arrived in a bloated looking USPS priority envelope.<br /><br />Now granted I haven't been to Hawaii for a number of years so I am not sure if the criteria for Kona coffee quality has slipped to a large degree. If this is any indicator then I suspect that I will not be in the market for Kona in the future as it is not worth to me the premium price. I've been an avid coffee drinker for over 40 years, and tasted coffee from virtually every global region. Unfortunately, this coffee was a disappointment, and I will not be ordering it again.
