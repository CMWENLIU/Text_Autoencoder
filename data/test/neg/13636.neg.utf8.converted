I am moderately interested in eating healthfully and am ecologically aware...but there is a limit to the greening of my palate. It seems Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams is way beyond my limit.<br /><br />I am glad that the box materials are recycled and non-damaging to the earth, but the taste of these crackers was so dry and oat-y that I couldn't choke down more than a bite. Maybe someone more Moosewoody in nature would be willing to force him or herself to eat something so naturally unsweet, but I am ready to write a love letter to Nabisco.
