Double order on a promotion.  Arrived on time, with ice somewhat intact, but berries were poor quality, some so green they were crunchy,  some with an odd chemical taste that seemed to be associated with a clear liquid that oozed from inside the coating around the berries, some with grey discolorations. The chocolate /candy coatings seemed tasteless, but may have been overwhelmed by the chemical taste.  We sampled half of them, threw them all out.  Note to customer service generated no response, not even an apology which would have been good enough. I am so glad I ordered these sent to me instead of directly to the intended recipient.  Feel as tho I dodged a bullet there
