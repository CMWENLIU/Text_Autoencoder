I'm sorry I bought this impossible toy.  The instructions on the box do not match the product.  In order to open it, you are supposed to insert your finger into hard plastic and turn.  I had to put on a glove as it scratched me so much.  It's very difficult to open and to close.  The instructions include difficulty settings and there are none on the ball.  The dog would have to bat the ball like a cat to get it to work.  Waste of money!
