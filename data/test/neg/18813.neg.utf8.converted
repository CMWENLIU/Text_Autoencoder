So I am partly at fault for my poor raring. I had entered in the search for egg nog coffee and this popped up. I figured 48 Egg nog k-cups for 49.999 (which is what I paid here...of course today it is on sale) was kind of high however I was thinking it was just the egg nog, which is my favorite. It arrived (damamged I might add) and it is a combination of 3 flavors...2 of which no one in my house likes. What really is awful is I paid 50 bucks...this exact same box is at my local walmart for 25.99. The price is WAY too high...totally not worth it.
