I had heard so many good things about using this in place of wheat (white) pasta.  For me, it did not do it.  Now, I did not cook it as I eat raw foods.  I soaked it overnight and rinsed it well, but it did not have the same texture as al dente pasta.  I tried to warm it a bit in my dehydrator which made it harden very quickly.  This means I would always have to eat it cold if I did not cook it.  I did not like it.<br /><br />As far as the fishiness, though, that some may be concerned about.  I did not find it fishy at all and I am not a huge fan of sea veggies.  It was very mild.  I think it is worth "trying" if you are a raw vegan/vegetarian because you may like it.  I just wish I did.
