These things are made in Columbia... is there anything made in the USA anymore???  They're not very good, they have a chalky taste... perhaps due to the TITANIUM DIOXIDE they put in them (listed in their ingredients).  TITANIUM DIOXIDE is thought to cause CANCER according to some studies.  What a disappointment!
