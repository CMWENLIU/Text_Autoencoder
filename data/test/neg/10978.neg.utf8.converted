BEWARE!! you are getting a good deal on these because the cans are dented and the contents taste metallic. they cant's sell these damaged products in whole foods so they sell them to you on amazon. blech!! disgusting!! tastes like the nickels and pennies you are saving when you shouldve just gone to the store to get your coconut juice
