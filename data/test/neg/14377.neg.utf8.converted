An avid coffee drinker I can say that this is one of the worst coffee's I have ever drunk. Had seen it advertised on a "bargain website", tried it and just can not drink this stuff. It tastes like a cross between dirty dishwater and garden soil, basically yucky coffee. Since trying it I have noticed it appears on sale almost all the time, probably to get new people to try it as I doubt many folks will reorder this product.
