I don't understand the difference that this pod has over other kcups that I could use to brew iced coffee since the only difference is that I brew it over ice.  I like the flavor of coffee so I didn't mind that there wasn't much difference.  I did have a huge problem with the kcups themselves though because every time I tried to brew coffee the top of the pod would come off and then I would get coffee everywhere and grinds would go everywhere.
