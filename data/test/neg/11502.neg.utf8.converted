It seems to me that Tazo makes horrible tea concoctions that are for people who don't like the taste of tea. Be warned, if you like the taste of straight green tea this is not for you. Om is a mixture of black and green tea (bad enough) with peach and cucumber. And even if that sounds okay to you, the taste is crap. I bought it by mistake. Not one I will repeat.<br /><br />There are far better tea companies out there (Choice Organic, Stash, Yogi),  but if you insist on Tazo, their Chai is first rate and China Green Tips are good as well. But I'd stay away from any of their herbal blends.
