Everytime I get this shipment delivered, the cans are broken and the food leaked out and there are bugs everywhere. I have to throw away part of the the shipment and go through the disgust and hassle of cleaning it up. This is the third shipment we received like this (I had one shipment damaged and had the shipments on automatic renew each month and the last shipments were damaged too) and I am fed up. I posted a comment to the seller about this after the frst shipment and never received a response and the problem keeps happening. SO NOT WORTH IT and I AM VERY UNHAPPY!!!! I am going to the local Walmart to get it there is not much of a difference in price and at least I know I am not getting bugs shipped to my home and having to throw out cans that are damaged. I cancelled my future shipments and DO NOT recommend anyone order this product from Amazon.
