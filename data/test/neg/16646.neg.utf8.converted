So many products are denatured - these are no exception.<br /><br />Fully expected nice "oily" beans just like the organic roasted ones I buy.  What a surprise to find green, unroasted beans denatured (the oils removed).<br /><br />I expect whole, organic products to come just the way they arrived from nature - not processed.<br /><br />Natural, organic products that are denatured have the essentials required for good metabolism removed.<br /><br />They may be "organic" but they are certainly not WHOLE.
