I just got this, one of the Nile Spice black bean soups (dry mix), and the Lime Dr. McDougall dry mix. This one is the saltiest of all, is quite watery (and as it is not a dry mix, there is no way to make it less watery). Of the three, this is the worst. The Lime black bean one from this same company has the salt separate in a 'flavor packet' and is a dry mix. You can avoid the salt by not using the full packet, and you can use less water to make it less watery. This has far far more salt that either of the others, and you are mostly buying water. I do not recommend this variety at all. If you want one, try one of the same company that has the flavor packet and is a dry mix. Summary: You are buying a lot of salty water and not much nutrition.
