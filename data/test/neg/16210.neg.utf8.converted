I searched for a long time yo find sorghum syrup.  After receiving my JUG of Barry Farm  sorghum syrup, I still have not found it!!  It was totally tasteless and goopy.  I spent nearly fifty plus years in the food and food related<br />industry, I've experienced the very best and a good deal of the worst, this product belongs to the latter...enough said!
