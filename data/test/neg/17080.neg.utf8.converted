The following is a review a just wrote for the 6 23.5oz bottles but applies here as well.<br /><br />"I have had this on subscription for at least the last 2 years. When my last subscription order was sent there was something very off on the flavor.<br />Each bottle had about a half inch of foam on top and had a very strong plastic or soapy taste. It's hard to describe but it was so bad I was unable to use it. I contacted Amazon and they were great, sent out a new order right away but when I received the shipment it was as bad as the first. When I contacted Amazon again they refunded my purchase price and actually made this product unavailable while they checked in to it. I see it is available again but I never found out what the issue was.<br />I figured it must have been a bad batch so I reordered and did get a new shipment last week, this time of the 2 44 oz bottles. It was just as bad. I contacted customer service and they were great and promptly refunded my money.<br />I ended up ordering another very popular, but more expensive, brand. This 'other' brand is much better. No problems at all. "
