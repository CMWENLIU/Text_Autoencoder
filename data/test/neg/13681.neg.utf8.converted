I've heard a lot of good things about TVP and have enjoyed other Red Mill products, but if all TVP is this horrid then it'll never find a place in my pantry again. The directions called for rehydrating 1 cup of TVP with 7/8 cup boiling water. As soon as the boiling water hit the TVP a smell exactly the same as chicken poo came wafting up from the bowl. All the bowl contained was TVP and boiling water but the smell made me gag. I covered the bowl with a plate while the TVP soaked for 10 minutes as directed on the package. When I removed the cover the smell burst forth like chicken poo from hell! I hoped the smell would go away when I added the TVP to the pasta, red sauce, and mushrooms but it didn't. Eventually I had to add a lot of extra oregano, basil, rosemary, and Parmesan cheese to only barely cover the smell and taste of the TVP. This has got to be one of the worst things I've ever tried and this is from a guy who cooks and eats June bugs!
