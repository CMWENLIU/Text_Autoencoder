If I could give less than one star I would.  These are not the way this type of licorice is supposed to taste!! When I found these on line, I was ecstatic!  I, too, bought two boxes in my excitement.  One box for me and one for my sister and cousins, whom have all ranted on how much we miss these Delfa, Danish, Broadway licorice rolls.  I ran to my mailbox everyday for 5 days.  Why it took so long to arrive is completely beyond me since Amazon items usually take a day or two at the most!  When it finally arrived, I ripped open the box with my coat still on and car keys in hand. Patooie!  It taste like sugar and silly putty (Yes, I still remember that silly putty taste from when I was a kid.) Yucky! Just regular 'ole licorice.  I am very, very, very, very disappointed and I am returning both boxes!!!!
