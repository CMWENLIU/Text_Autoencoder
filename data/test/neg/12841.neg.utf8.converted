I love the Happy Baby and Happy Tot products, but the Happy Squeeze Super Orange and Pumpkin is really awful tasting.  My 17 month old will eat anything out of a pouch (spinach, peas, green beans etc) she made the funniest face when she ate this and then spit it all out and said "all done".  I then got my 5 year old to try it and she spit it out in the garbage can and then told me she thought she might throw up.  After their reactions I tried and I agree.  Thumbs down!!
