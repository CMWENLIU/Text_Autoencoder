These bars are packaged fairly nicely; the individual sleeves have a cool, smooth exterior and a very Trader Joe's friendly design that's gender-neutral and age-appropriate for any adult, though I do not like that the box lays flat and takes up far more space in my pantry than it would if it stood up. But that's unfortunately the nicest thing I can say about them. The texture is on the dry side, and the flavor combination of the special cocoa blend with orange and cranberry ended up tasting very chalky -- it would have been improved by being either sweetened more or sweetened less. And the bar, which is quite small, is a whopping 200 calories, 6 grams of fat, and 34 grams of carbohydrates -- and with not large quantity of protein or vitamins/minerals to justify it. It may have the antioxidant power of a cup of green tea, but I'd find drinking that cup of tea quite a bit more pleasant (and easier on my waistline).
