Boiling water destroys the active ingredients called kavalactones.<br />I found the tea pleasant, but did not notice any of the calming effects described on the box.<br />I googled kava root and found several articles describing how the active ingredient is destroyed with hot water.<br />I am currently waiting on my cup of hot water to cool down to room temperate to try again.  I figured I would try it this way instead of throwing away the box and buying the kava root and making my own the way described in the articles.
