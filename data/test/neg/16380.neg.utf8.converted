This juice is phenomenal--it's not the product I have a problem with, but the price I just paid ($35.76 for a case of 24).  Spicy V8 is all I ever buy, but is extremely difficult to find in the 11.5 oz cans.  I ordered this online thinking it would probably cost a little more, but imagine my surprise and chagrin when I found a case of 24 regular V8, 11.5 oz cans, at Costco yesterday (1-12-11)for $12.59. Just how much could spicing up the V8 cost the manufacturer?  My stupidity (I rate myself a "minus one star" for consumerism), but paying TRIPLE the price is a bit much.  I'm keeping the order, of course, because it was my mistake totally, but you can bet this won't happen again.
