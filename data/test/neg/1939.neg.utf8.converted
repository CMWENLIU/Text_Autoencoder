This tea tastes like paper.  I have made it by "Sun Tea" method and steeped tea then I tried steeping it long and short times. It lacks that wonderful POW, it used to have.  This cannot be the "Original Tea".  More than the color of the box is changed. I do not like this new tea. I drank the old Good Earth Ice tea instead of sodas.  I am unhappy about the change. I tossed out my old box, so I cannot compare the ingredients or distributors.  This was a comfort, hot or cold, and now it is gone. How sad.  I will not recommend or purchase this tea anymore.
