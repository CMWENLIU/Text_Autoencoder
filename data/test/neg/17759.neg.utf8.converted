The only way these sticky pads work is if a flea accidently jumps into the trap. I guess you could wrap them around your ankles and see if the fleas jump on them as you walk around. Im going to just put some soapy water in the bottom of the trap and it should work BETTER than the sticky pads. But the trap doesnt attract fleas anyways. Shame on you Victor company.
