I had heard a lot about coconut water and thought I would give this a try.  I wish I had tried a bottle locally rather than buying multiple bottles through Amazon.  The taste of this is really bad and has a cloying aftertaste.  If you haven't already tried this product I would recommend getting a small bottle from a local health food store first.
