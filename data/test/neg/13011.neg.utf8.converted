Be careful when you order this particular package. It contains only 23.2-ounce tubs. Even with free shipping and no tax the price per ounce is much higher than your local wholesale club. I mention this because the product first came out in these tubs at the wholesale clubs and looks the same as this package. The wholesale club tubs are 34-ounces.<br /><br />I'm annoyed by this because I don't usually price or value shop Amazon products. I operate on the assumption that Amazon offers the best value in general. If there is a small difference in price it's usually made up in free Prime shipping or tax. So beware on these grocery type items.
