My order arrived yesterday and every one of the 12 cans was dented - some had small dents while others were badly crushed. Was this just a bad batch or are these factory "seconds"?<br /><br />Followup on this order: I just received an email from Amazon and they are refunding the full purchase price of this order. That's good customer service!
