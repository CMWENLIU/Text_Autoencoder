I bought this tea hoping to find a good, economical sencha green tea. Unfortunately, this is very low quality.  Whereas other sencha teas I have tried have a sweet, grassy smell and taste, this tea has a musty smell and almost no flavor. This is the only sencha I have seen where the leaves are not rolled. Instead, the leaves are dried flat. This also contains a fairly larger percentage of stems (more like a kukicha). The smell and quality remind me of sweepings from an old barn floor. I recommend avoiding this product.
