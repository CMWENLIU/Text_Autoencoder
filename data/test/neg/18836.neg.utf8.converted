I was looking for a flake salt. This product has tiny flakes not much larger than ground salt.  If you're looking for giant flakes as I was, look elsewhere.<br /><br />By the way, the same product sold at a local supermarket (so. cal.) for $3.99.  This is the first time I'm flustered by an Amazon unrealistic pricing.
