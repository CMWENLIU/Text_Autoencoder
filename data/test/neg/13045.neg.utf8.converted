I usually love Green Mountain Coffee, but this was very disappointing.  I like dark roasts and this is a light roast, so that's what it comes down to.  If you like a light roast, then the breakfast blend might be ok.  But if you like your coffee with any darkness/flavor to it then say away from this watery mess.
