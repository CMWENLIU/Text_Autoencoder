I had purchased this ginger once in the past, and it was very good quality. However, the latest order that I made gave me quite a shock! The ginger powder had a very peculiar, chemical odor. I tasted a small sample and had to rinse my mouth as it was disgusting. Then I looked more closely at the label, and discovered the problem. This ginger is from China, and although labeled as organic, I'm quite sure that it was laced with pesticide or other chemicals. I have read reports of "organic" ginger leaving China literally covered with insecticide powder, and I suspect that this is what may have happened to this batch. I would recommend that you avoid this product until these issues are resolved.
