I purchased this from my local market and boy, am I sorry to have done that.  This particular Starbuck's blend is awful to say the least.  I knew it wasn't going to end well when I opened the bag and was nearly overcome by the nasty aroma.  To me, coffee is supposed to smell good as well as taste good.<br /><br />I decided that maybe my nose was deceiving me.  So I brewed a couple of cups worth (I make my coffee at night for the next day) and waited thinking that perhaps it would taste better than it smelled.  Once it finished brewing, I took a sip of it black.  UGH!  I thought maybe sugar will help.  NOPE.  My next trick was to add vanilla flavored creamer.  NADDA!<br /><br />It seems as if this is a smokey blend.  The taste is very heavy and not at all appealing to me.  I think I expected a lighter, smoke free and perhaps more tangy flavor.<br /><br />Now I have to try to give this away....(sigh)
