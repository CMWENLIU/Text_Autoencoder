I have used Melitta pots for around 30 years.  I have always had the plastic filter cone with the clear glass pot.  The coffee always ran freely from the cone to the pot.  I tried this pot because I thought it was an upgrade.  I had a lot of difficulty getting the coffee to flow.  The pot is visually beautiful, but I plan to send it back and go back to the pot I was using before.
