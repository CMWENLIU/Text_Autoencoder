I purchased the "Just Tomatoes Just Fruit Munchies, 8-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2)" The fruit mixture is good until you eat the raisins. Some of them are very hard and I almost broke my tooth. I would not buy this product again because of this. Buy the Strawberries they will not break your teeth and they are excellent! I would suggest the company not include the raisins in this mixture anymore. Thanks! :)
