Pakage was leaking after I got out of my mail (mailman left this in larger mail box specially for large deliveries - at my neighborhood mailboxes).<br />2 cans soup BUSTED and LEAKING ALL OVER ALL cans! Had to wash ALL cans off! 2 cans totally open and busted!!! 2 more cans badly dented!!<br /><br />Product NOT pakaged sufficiently - bubble wrap only around 2 sides... NO bubble wrap on bottom or top... and NO bubble wrap on 2 other sides.<br /><br />Very upset... looks like someone DROP KICKED the box!!!<br /><br />This is 2nd order of this soup. First order 4-6  cans BADLY dented but NOT leaking like this one.<br /><br />I love this soup and want to keep ordering but not if this is the way it will arrive!!!
