I received this product a day earlier than the estimated shipping date and was excited to try out my favorite coffee flavoring. Unfortunately, when it comes to this syrup I taste nothing but extremely strong spice, that gave me a bit of an upset stomach.<br /><br />*EDIT*<br />The same day I posted this review I received a call from Amoretti to discuss my review. I was given advice on using the syrups and had products sent out to try! Absolutely amazing customer service! Just amazing!
