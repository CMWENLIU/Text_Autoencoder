Originally I was very happy when I received this beautiful little tree ... unfortunately it seemed under-potted and root bound so it died within the first month.  I drew the root bound conclusion as I made one final attempt to save it by re-potting the tree into a bigger dish with new soil but the roots were already dark brown and just a tangled mess to deal with ... I have left the tree in the new soil and water it occasionally ... as of yet no signs of life have returned.
