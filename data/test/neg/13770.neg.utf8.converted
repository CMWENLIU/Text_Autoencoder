This was the biggest waste of our money.  I don't know what the solution is, but this trap is not it.  The so called "spikes" are not sharp enough to even penetrate my hand when triggered, much less something as small as a mole. When you pull the trap up, you don't know if you got the mole, because, unless you plan on digging up your yard to see if the mole might be there, you don't know.  We emailed the moleman, and he said that we needed to stick a piece of wood under the trap so that when the "spikes" come down, they do not just trap the mole.  So the past 6 times this trap has gone off, we have caught the mole, only to pull the trap out and set him free.  No where on the box or in the directions does it state the detail that needs to be taken.  I say, either live with em, or hire a professional.  Or, MOVE!!!!!!!!!!!
