I've used Cento San Marzano DOP certified tomatoes many times in the past and was always pleased with the quality of these great tomatoes.<br />That said, this is the 1st time I've ordered this item from Amazon and ALL 12 cans arrived completely dented and banged up!<br />Terrible presentation for an expensive item.<br />As an aside, none of the cans I received has a "DOP CERTIFIED" label but only "CERTIFIED" and no serial # on the side of the cans so I'm not sure if these tomatoes are actually DOP certified or not???
