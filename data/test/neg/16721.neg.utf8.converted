With an enormous range of essential ingredients, including krill oil, a super-antioxidant rarely found in other pet foods, this product is ostensibly ideal for both cats and dogs. THE PROBLEM is that it contains so many NON-ORGANIC ingredients, including corn protein. Newer studies just released point to a greatly increased risk of tumors in animals that are fed corn, simply because ALL of the corn grown in the USA has been genetically modified (courtesy of one very large multi-national corporation whose name is familiar around the world.) You can't escape it. So until Wysong decides to produce an all-organic version of their Epigen WITHOUT any GMO ingredients, we won't be buying it anymore.
