I bought this at Whole Foods so just naturally assumed they would be made in the US or Japan or somewhere reliable. NO. MADE IN CHINA. Very very sad and disappointed. My baby thought they were ok, but after a while got bored of it. I realized they were made in China half way through the box. Not letting baby eat any more of these tho and not buying it. I just don't trust ingesting anything made in China.<br />----------<br />*UPDATE*<br />----------<br />Whole Foods recalled this product from their shelves (at least the WF's around here). Can't buy this product anymore at WF.
