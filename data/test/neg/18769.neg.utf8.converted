Boo to this.  I was SO happy with it when I had finally found a low-carb cereal in which I could add my own sweetener to control how sweet I wanted it, and safely - with Stevia or something else.  Even just a couple of sliced strawberries.  This was the only one to fit into a reasonable daily carb allowance.<br /><br />Then they changed it to be sweeter and loaded up on more sugar and carbs.  I complained to Kellogg and they replied that they did a taste test and found people wanted it to be sweeter.  A TASTE TEST.  On people that probably had no interest in its intended purpose to be a healthier option for people that actually need to watch their diets closely - they evidently didn't test for value when it came to its health benefits, they tested purely for flavor.  Shouldn't this have been tested on people that WERE concerned with health...?  It's that essentially the goal demographic?  The general public has TONS of sugary cereals to choose from.  Can't we just have ONE?<br /><br />You've lost my business, Kellogg, as well as many others that follow a low-carb/keto diet.  I was once recommending this cereal to everyone that was trying to be more healthy so they didn't have to give up all the types of food they love--those on Atkins, Protein Power, the huge following of low-carbers on reddit, to name a few.  Now we're back to pretty much no cereal options once again.
