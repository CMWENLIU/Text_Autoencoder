These apple chips are good. But after picking up a bag at the store they are MADE IN CHINA??<br /><br />Why do chinese apple chips need to be so expensive?<br />With the recent recalls on Chinese foods and flavorings here I do not want to eat those products from china.<br /><br />Bare fruit has apple chips that are cheaper and just as good! and from the US
