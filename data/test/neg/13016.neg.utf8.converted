I came home with this brand from the hospital, so I automatically assumed it to be good for the baby.. instead what I found was that my baby would be screaming for more when I did not feed her timingly on the dot, which in turn I found out was because she had basically come off a sugar high and wanted more.  I had switched to an organic brand by earth's best which tasted a lot less sugary and she never screamed for more milk... plus it lasted longer in her belly.  They get around not having to label sugar because it's under 'lactose'... but you need your mommy tastebuds to figure it out.  I would not recommend similac or any other highly sugary formula..
