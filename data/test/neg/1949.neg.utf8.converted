I LOVE...LOVED this tea, I have been drinking it for so long I am not sure when I started....but it is not the same, I had a stash downstairs and recently ran out. At the grocery I noticed the packaging had changed but I didn't think much of it.<br /><br />The tea just doesn't taste the same. I read other reviews and I don't know if the sweetener is the cause but its not the same. It does appear they may be putting less tea in the bags or again they have changed something. My cup of tea is no longer a dark, aromatic cup of joy, it is light brownish and the flavor is a hue of its former self. I sadly had to add black tea to my cup just to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />I grudgingly broke out my last original tea bag and made it next to this "new" tea .... the difference is huge.<br /><br />If only I could get the original recipe, I'd make it at home!<br /><br />I wrote the company for what it is worth.
