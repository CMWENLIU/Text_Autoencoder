I HAVE BEEN ORDERING THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER 6 MONTHS NOW. WHEN I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FROM THE US POST OFFICE, THE CANS WERE ALL CRUSHED. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. USUALLY MY SHIPMENT COMES VIA UPS AND THE CONDITION IS ALWAYS GOOD. WHEN I OPENED THE ONE OF THE CANS  I CUT THE SKIN INSIDE MY THUMBNAIL. I WAS BLEEDING FOR AT LEAST 30 MINUTES. I FEEL THAT AMAZON SHOULD COMPENSATE FOR THIS INJURY.
