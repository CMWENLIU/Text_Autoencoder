I am continually amazed at the shoddy treatment that some movies get in their DVD release.  This DVD is simply a disgrace, especially considering what a great movie this is.  I give the movie itself 5 stars; it's a wonderful example of Tim Burton's energy and style.<p>This DVD has no extras worth mentioning.  No deleted scenes, no featurettes, not even a lousy commentary track!  To make it even worse, the film has been CUT DOWN from the theatrical release!  I have never seen a DVD release before where you get LESS than was originally presented in theaters.<p>My advice is to save your money until somebody figures out that when a movie is released on DVD, it needs to live up to the capabilities of the medium, and should always provide more material than was originally released, not less.
