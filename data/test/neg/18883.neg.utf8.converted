I really like Pop Chips potato based chips so I thought I'd take a chance on the corn "masa" based chips. I ordered this 4 flavor combo pack. Now I admit I don't like all flavors of potato based pop chips; FWIW cheddar and salt & pepper are my favorite. These corn based chips are not very good which is unfortunate as I bought a case of 12. I knew it was a gamble, but hey, I live in Las Vegas...<br /><br />It is hard to pinpoint exactly where these chips fall short. Too me they seem very salty, although each serving is only 6% to 8% of sodium RDA. The nacho cheese flavor is the most tolerable of the four flavors, although it does not taste much like cheese. The ranch flavor tastes very artificial (although these are naturally flavored). The chili limon and salsa flavors are just okay. The chili limon flavor is rather bland and does not have much chili or lemon-lime flavor but it also does not seem as artificial or overly salty. In sum, I could eat a few of the nacho cheese, chili lime, and salsa but could not stand the ranch. Perhaps a plain, corn flavor would have been better that these heavily flavored, salty tasting chips.<br /><br />Of course personal tastes vary so much, but to me these are not very satisfying snacks especially compared to potato pop chips. I would not buy them again but I thought I should post a review since I already played the roll of guinea pig.
