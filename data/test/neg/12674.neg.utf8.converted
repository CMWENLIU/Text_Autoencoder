At the time that I purchased these, this "Dora the Explorer" nonsense was all Amazon was offering in the way of SpaghettiOs.  I figured it would just be just like the SpaghettiOs quality I was used to, only with silly shapes instead.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />This is like tomato flavored water punctuated by monstrously large doughy shapes.  The "sauce" was what was really sickening.  I don't see why they would have changed the sauce recipe just for some branded can, but they simply must have.  It's downright disgusting.<br /><br />If I had any sense I would have spent a buck and picked up a can at the grocery store first.  But as it is, the remaining 14 cans will be sitting in the basement waiting for the next nuclear war.  It might improve the flavor some.
