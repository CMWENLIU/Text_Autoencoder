I foolishly bought this whole case because the reviews were so good and I could not find 1 can in a local store to try.  It was the WORST canned soup I have EVER tasted, it even smells sickening, like rotten garlic.  The noodles were complete greasy mush.  I had only 2 spoonfuls and have thrown the rest away.  Do not be fooled by the picture on the label, the contents do not even come close to looking like that.  Celiacs have enough trouble finding decent food, stay away from this product.
