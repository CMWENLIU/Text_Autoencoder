I've had this variety of tea from other sources, so I have an idea what it should taste like.  When I opened the bag, my nose was assaulted by a strong smell of turpentine - I thought it was the packaging, so I moved it into a plastic storage tub.  The brewed tea tasted equally of turpentine.  I did find that if you leave the tea out in the air, the taste and smell dissipates, but keeping it for any length of time in a closed container causes the turpentine taste/smell to return.  Even aerated, the tea has a very grassy taste to it.<br /><br />Maybe I got a bad batch, but I will not buy a Numi tea again after this bad experience.
