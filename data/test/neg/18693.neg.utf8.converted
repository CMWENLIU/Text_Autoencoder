My cats will generally eat this but the last two times the cans came bug infested. It appeared that the cans were damaged as swarms of little black bugs came with the food and I threw both sets out. Why, do you ask, did I buy a second time? I wanted to give the company the benefit of the doubt but the second time the same thing happened, after sitting in pantry, when I went to grab a can there were small black bugs inside the plastic wrap covering the cans.
