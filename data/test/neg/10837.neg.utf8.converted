I bought this shampoo and conditioner after being lured in by the commercials. I was able to buy them at WalMart for a very cheap price($4.75 a piece). That is the ONLY positive thing I have to say about this shampoo and conditioner.<br />After using them I noticed that my hair looked a little funky(I color my hair, and it looked a lot lighter...and somewhat nappy). I blew it dry and almost cried. My colored hair(which is normally shiny and sleek) was at least 2 shades lighter...no shine whatsoever, and was gummy:( I was so disappointed. So I would caution any one who is contemplating buying this product, and advise them to pass this one by. It does NOT do what the commercials say it will do, and actually harmed my hair.
