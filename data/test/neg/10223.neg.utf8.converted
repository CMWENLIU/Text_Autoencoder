I feel bad for alot of other gf bread/baking flour makers because if more people discover the goodness of pamela bread mix they would go out of business. My sister and I are celiac and believe me we tried it all. We tried baking our own to purchasing about every different mix we could find and It came down to pamelas or BRM because they are more readily available at local grocery stores. Let me tell you Pamela blows them all away. I've had family member and co-workers (who by this time were pretty scared of taste testing my gf baked goods) completly surprised some even said they preferred over wheat varieties. The Sweet bread recipe taste almost like a moist potato bread. Sorry BRM
