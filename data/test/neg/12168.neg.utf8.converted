Have I owned one of this make and model?  No.  But I have owned 4 or 5 of the Webber units that are essentially the same design.  I have also owned 8 or 10 of the probes that stick into the meat.<br /><br />The thermometers are great when they work.  They are so good that, even knowing the design flaw, I keep buying them and replacement probes.<br /><br />The receivers and transmitters all work well and seem to have an expected long lifetime.  The probe is the Achilles heel in every make and model of wireless thermometer.  Within the metal, flexible shielded cable that runs from the probe to the transmitter are small wires.  Small weak wires.  Small fragile wires.  Small worthless wires due to their failure rate.<br /><br />If the user closes the lid of the BBQ or smoker on the metal shielded cable between the probe and the transmitter, the internal wires WILL fail.  It may take 2 or 3 times, but they will fail.  If the metal shielded cable is kinked or bent too sharply, the internal wires will fail.<br /><br />A couple of years ago I was on the Webber customer service line (again) requesting a new probe because the wires failed.  I asked the customer service representative if she owned one of these wireless systems and, to my surprise, she said "Are you kidding?  I would NEVER own one of these".  I asked her why and she said "I have a full time job, 7 days a week taking calls just like this one -  people complaining 8 hours a day, 7 days a week because the probe failed".<br /><br />Now, if I were her boss, I would have fired her on the spot.  From a consumer's point of view I found this conversation somewhat alarming.<br /><br />This summer I will probably buy another and attempt to keep the smoker's lid from crushing the tiny worthless wires - but eventually I will fail and so will the probe.<br /><br />In short, this is a great product with a major and easily correctable design flaw.  Be prepared that the wires within the shielded cable can and will fail.
