I ordered this SO CALLED Honey Powder from BARRY FARMS ~ it is a FRAUD !! It is not HONEY POWDER.  It is<br />WHEAT with something else mixed with it.  It does not dissolve, it DOES NOT have HONEY in the mix.  On top<br />of their frauding the public, they make sure you cannot return it and get a refund.  They should be<br />reported for the fraudelent manner they are operating.<br /><br />I THREW  both bags in the trash.
