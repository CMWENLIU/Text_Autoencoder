I love these Oatmeal to Go bars and have had a hard time finding them in the stores lately.  I was thrilled to find them available online.  The problem with this item is the picture.  If you are familiar with the product line, the green box shown is the "kids" size, featuring 9 bars which are smaller than the regular size. The picture displays the smaller size bars and the box says 9 in the lower corner. Nowhere in the description did it say the number of bars in the box so I assumed by the picture that it was 9 of the smaller bars.  When my order arrived it was a pack of 6 boxes of the larger bars in the red boxes.  Not what I expected and not what I wanted. Too many calories per bar when you're watching your weight.
