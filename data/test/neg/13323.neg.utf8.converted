"Seapoint Farms" sounds so American.  So wholesome, so family.  Their soybean packages feature happy-faced Spongebob Squarepants, and in big letters: "USDA ORGANIC".  But then if you turn the package over, you will find: "Product of China".  That's right... you are NOT buying a US food product, you are buying Chinese food, cleverly packaged to LOOK like an American food product.  Ugh.  Do we now have to eat Chinese food?  Isn't it enough that we buy their VCRs, cellphones, garden tools, towels, furniture, flashlights and toys?  The quality control is not good.  Please.... buy American food, and NOT frozen vegetables from Red China!
