I was searching for USA-made chicken jerky for my two chows and the Plato line came up. My goof not to realize these 'strips' are baked cookies, not dried chicken meat strips, and the dogs have made it very clear -- they definitely prefer real jerky. They don't seem to like the (sort of dry-fudgy) texture of these treats, but will 'accept' the chicken and the salmon, while simply rejecting the duck version. Broken up as training bits for the puppy these will probably be usable, which is good since they aren't cheap.<br /><br />Later I found Bellyrubs brand chicken jerky (at about half the price of Plato) at a feed store, and I am back in the dogs' good graces.
