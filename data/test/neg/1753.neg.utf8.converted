Earth's best organic food are wonderful if you're on the go and didn't have time to make your baby's food.<br /><br />The food that was shipped expires in two months! Since it was a good price, I thought I would stock up. If I knew this, I would not have purchased it!  The baby food that i purchased last week at our local Whole Foods Market expires in two years.<br /><br />Now i'm stuck with 48 jars of pears that will expire in two months.
