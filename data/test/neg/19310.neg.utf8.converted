I was disappointed in this spritzer. I wanted a light fizzy citrus juice, not overpoweringly sweet. After I purchased this drink I discovered that the main juice ingredient was white grape, which was not indicated anywhere on the can except in the list of ingredients. I didn't intend to buy white grape juice so it was a bit of a letdown, but I was still willing to give it a chance. When I poured it into a glass over ice I was dismayed to find that there was NO fizz whatsoever. None. That was a deal breaker for me. When the label says spritzer I expect bubbles dammit!  The flavor was also not what I hoped for. I could definitely taste the white grape juice more than orange or lime. What I was wanting and expecting was something like a perrier or pellegrino mixed with orange juice and a little squeeze of lime for bite. This didn't fit the bill at all. This would be good for kids as an alternative to soda or straight juice. It has a flavor more suited to someone who typically drinks white grape or apple juice.
