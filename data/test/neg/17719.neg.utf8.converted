I'm really confused because I  see everyone else giving these vanilla beans excellent reviews which is why I ordered them.  I could tell they were off as soon as I opened the packaging.  They had a smokey odor to them and the flavor was completely off.  Certainly not something I would add to ice cream or other desserts.<br /><br />Maybe I received a bad batch.  They went into the garbage.
