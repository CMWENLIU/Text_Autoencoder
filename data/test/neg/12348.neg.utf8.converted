I ordered this off of Amazon because I had never tried caviar before, it arrived & the whole family tried it - it was not good - we didn't even finish the jar. I thought maybe it was because I had never tried caviar before, but I just tried fresher caviar last week and realized I love caviar - this stuff is just gross.
