If you've never had marzipan, you might perhaps like the hint of almond flavor in this item. But if you know what good marzipan tastes like, then<br />you'd do best to stay away from this. The paste tastes like cardboard, the good flavor is not there . For some reason, this product contains wheat, and that might account for the weak, cardboard-y flavor. Good marzipan uses organic almonds, sugar and rose water. It is also more expensive than this cheap imitation, and it tastes heavenly.
