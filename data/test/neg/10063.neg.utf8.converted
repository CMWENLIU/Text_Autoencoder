Okay I usually LOVE Fondarific fondant and order it any time I want to splurge and save myself the work of making my own fondant. Since I had a cake that I wanted to be hot pink I figured I would order some premade fondarific to avoid the hassle of trying to dye marshmellow fondant to the shade of pink I wanted.<br />What a mess!! I started the cake late because I thought "hey I have fondarific and it is a cinch to roll out" WRONG. The stuff was a sticky, gooey mess that kept melting away and tearing when I tried to pull it off the rolling mat. I used a ton of shortening to keep it from sticking and rolled it super thick just to compensate. It sort of worked, my cake had pock marks in the fondant from where it started to tear and stick to the mat but at 1am I was more worried about getting the dang thing covered than I was about pock marks. Seriously it took me about 90 minutes to get my 2 tier cake covered where it usually would take 20 mins with fondarific. I don't know if it had to do with the pink dye in the fondant (I have never used this dark of a pink before) or if there was a manufacture defect with this batch of fondant. All I know is I live in Washington where there is zero humidity and you would have thought I was in Savannah Georgia with the way it was drooping off my hands. I will not be ordering this color again any time soon.<br />I have 3 other colors I ordered and will try out soon, will let you know if I have the same problems with them.
