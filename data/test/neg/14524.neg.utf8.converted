I ordered this on the autoship because it was the only lavazza available at the time.  I'm a true espresso drinker and I found this coffee to be not up to the lavazza standards. It has a weak flavor and flat finish.  The crema is good, but that just tells us that there's a lot of robusto beans in it. To me it tastes like supermarket quality coffee. If you look on their website it doesn't even tell you what the blend is. I would not recommend buying this blend.
