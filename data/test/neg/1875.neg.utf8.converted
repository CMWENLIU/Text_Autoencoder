Not only does it tastes like there is no sweetener, it has a horrible chemical aftertaste to it.  I would rather just have an unsweetened chocolate - then I could add my own sweetener to make it right.<br /><br />It is so strange that the sugar free is so awful.  The hershey's 50% reduced sugar tastes almost like regular.
