These are great chips!  I also like the red chips.  UNFORTUNATELY, Amazon ships these out in the vendor boxes which are very flimsy.  All of the chips end up broken.<br /><br />It's so funny -- everything else Amazon sends out is in rugged Amazon boxes -- sometimes the item inside is in the vendor box so you get double protection.  The items that should be double boxed (chips) don't get any protection at all and they are the most fragile.
