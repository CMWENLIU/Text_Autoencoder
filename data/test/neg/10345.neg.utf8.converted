We all know that Swiss Cake Rolls will never achieve the delicious status enjoyed by Yodels, but I really do give them an A for effort. The major complaint with these snacks is that they are just too dry. They attempt to surround creme filling with some kind of chocolate cake, but the result comes off as a cheap tasting joke. I don't really have any advice for Little Debbie to improve this product, though. They should simply leave it up to the experts at Drake's Snack Foods.
