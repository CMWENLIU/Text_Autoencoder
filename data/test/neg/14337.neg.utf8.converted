Although the product is very easy to use and the rice sticks together perfectly to make a sushi roll-----the rice is tasteless because it has neither mirin vinegar nor sugar nor salt in it (commonly called sushi vinegar)--------the nori wrappers are too small to make any decent sized roll and too thin to withstand any handling-------I have had better sushi rolls at the worst japanese restaurant---------the soy sauce is OK but without wasabi mustard you cannot achieve the taste of real sushi
