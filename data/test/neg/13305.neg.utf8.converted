My sister purchased this product, and was kind enough to share two flavors with me, the Lemon Sea Salt and the Rosemary Parmesan. With the Lemon, I followed the instructions to the T. I popped the corn, I poured the oil in the bag, I shook it furiously, and then sprinkled the seasoning in, shook it furiously again, and then ate it. Like my sister, who had the same experience, some kernels were devoid of flavoring, while others, that caught most the oil, were overwhelmingly seasoned, to the point of being distasteful.  So...the next bag, I decided to experiment. I made a small opening in the bag prior to popping, added the oil packet, popped the corn, poured into a bowl, and sprinkled on the seasoning a little at a time as I ate the bowl. That was absolutely delicious, however...that being said, I used about 1/6th of the amount of seasoning provided in the bag. It is an intense amount of seasoning, and if used as instructed, I would find it overwhelming.  I'm happy to try healthful alternatives to microwave popcorn, ones that use organic products, good quality corn, and interesting seasonings, but this method left me feeling it had not yet been figured out just right.
