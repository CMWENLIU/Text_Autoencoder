The products are great.  I love mixing drinks, and these bitters give me a bit of an extended arsenal on some otherwise standard and expected recipes.<br /><br />But there are 2 major problems.  The first, and in my opinion more minor, is in packaging/shipping.  At least 2 of the 6 bottles arrived having leaked 1/4 of their contents.  When I received my order I opened my large-ish Amazon box  of office supplies and was greeted with a wall of fruity boozy KABOOM!!!.  This was because the orange and peach bitters leaked all over themselves, their fellow bottles, and into the enclosing box.  No biggie, some lost product, but I can deal.<br /><br />The second and more problematic problem is that the shaker caps don't fit.  I wanted 3 dashes of lemon bitters in my manhattan and received 3 oz.  It's not a loose fit, it's a non-fit.  The cap is way way too loose.  Even if you try to shake it cautiously it jumps right off.  Not just 1 of my bottles, it's done it on the lemons and the grapefruits.  I've only tried 4 of the bottles so far, so that's a 50% catastrophe rate.  2 drinks with fine bases, down the drain, undrinkable.<br /><br />This set is awesome, but HEED THE WARNINGS, sailors.
