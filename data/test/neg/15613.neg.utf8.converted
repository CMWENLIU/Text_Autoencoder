While this juice conforms to USDA organic standards, it may fail prop 65 standards of 5 microns or less (can google this product and "lead" and find the study).  I called the company.  It seems that the water they use may contain lead.  They filter it, but it doesn't seem to get rid of all the lead.  Lead is a toxin that gets deposited in your bones.  When you get older and bones start to deteriorate, it gets released back into your system causing brain impairments.  Even a small amount may contribute to this problem.  I certainly don't want to knowingly give this to children.  The company also said something about the problem being in their california processing facility, not the maryland one.  So, depending on your location in the country, you may be able to obtain this product with no lead.  Until the company issues a statement that they conform to prop 65 standards, though, I for one will not buy any Santa Cruz products (which is a shame, because they are generally pretty tasty).
