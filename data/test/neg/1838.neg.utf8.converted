I wasn't expecting a lot, but I do not understand the five star reviews.  When you are on a restricted calorie diet you will eat, and even enjoy, things which normally you would not care so much for, perhaps that is it.  Maybe some of the reviews are marketing plants by people who have a financial interest in the product sales, I do not know.  Perhaps some people do not find the rubbery texture offensive - I have friends who enjoy squid, octopus and eel - which I do not care for unless it is battered and deep fried.  With respect to the smell of this product, the strong fishy odor can be reduced to a light vinegary odor with proper rinsing.  The deal breaker for me was the rubbery texture.  I DID read the instructions, and other reviews, and recipes posted elsewhere.  Boiling for a minute, and even longer, did not improve the texture.  I tried drying them in a frying pan as one reviewer suggested, and that did not help.  I even tried frying them, but the best I could do was to take the "bounce" out of the rubbery texture to where they were merely tough and fibrous like the stringy strands in a celery stalk.  If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  I once tried zero calorie chocolate sauce, marshmallow creme, and even peanut spread, based on highly positive reviews posted on Amazon.  That stuff tasted like toxic waste to me, and unfortunately these "noodles" are just as inedible IMHO due to their texture.  There is an old Three Stooges short where they are trying to eat pancakes that accidentally had some glue (or something similar) mixed into the batter and this "pasta" immediately reminded me of those rubbery pancakes.  I do highly recommend this product to those who enjoy pulling April Fools Day pranks, as this would be perfect to serve to friends and family on April 1st.
