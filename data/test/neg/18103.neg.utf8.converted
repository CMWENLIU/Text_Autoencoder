I regularly order this product and it is normally as described by other reviewers, tender, moist, sweet. Occasionally, it seems to be distributed by another company and in those cases the quality is poor. The ginger is darker, dry, bitter, and tough. Lack of consistency of this product is unfortunate because when it is good, it is really good. When it is bad, it is a waste of money because you can't return it.
