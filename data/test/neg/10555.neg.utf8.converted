It's good tea, from a good manufacturer.  However, Amazon REALLY needs to re-label this.  It is ORGANIC GREEN TEA, with no bergamot, meaning, IT IS NOT, I REPEAT, NOT EARL GREY green tea.  It's just plain green tea.  I didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back as a return, so now I have 96 bags of plain green tea to go through.<br /><br />So, if you want good organic green tea, go with this.  If you want earl grey, take heed, and don't buy this.  This was my first disappointment with Amazon.
