...hate it. I'm a Jelly Belly junkie and keep them on hand most all the time. I've never been able to decide if "Buttered Popcorn" or "Juicy Pear" was my most disliked flavor. To me, it's one of those flavors that just doesn't even sound like it would be good.<br /><br />I keep a large jar of beans on my desk at work, and you wouldn't believe how often the topic of "favorite flavors" gets started by someone saying "I HATE the Buttered Popcorn!"  One day, a co-worker walked in and said, "Oh wow, Buttered Popcorn is my favorite!" Subsequently, I was surprised to discover that this flavor has an almost cult-like following. I guess it just reaffirms the diverse nature of individuality. As the old saying goes, "one man's junk is another man's treasure."
