Like the previous reviewer, I also received a wet box, with most of the bottles leaking from the spout.  The ones that weren't leaking will start to soon, as the spouts are also starting to rip.<br /><br />Opened a safe-looking bottle, and couldn't stand the taste.  I drank regular ONE coconut water throughout my pregnancy, and kept hearing good things about vita coco... luckily they didn't try this flavor...
