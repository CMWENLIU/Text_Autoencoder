I purchased this as one of a group of items to test before buying for a trip. I chose this one because of the high protein content - 9 grams of protein per serving, or 18 grams for the complete can. Since it also has a relatively low carb count; it has 9 grams per serving with 3 fiber for a net carb count of 6 carbs per serving; it looked like a good choice.<br /><br />However, I did not enjoy this particular salad. The tuna tasted very "fishy" and the vegetables and pasta were very drab tasting. All I could really taste besides the tuna was the oil. Later, when I walked by the empty container in the trash I was overwhelmed by the fishy smell remaining. I can't imagine leaving the empty container in a car or in my trash can at work.<br /><br />It's OK, I would eat it if I were hungry, but it wouldn't be my first choice of meals. If you end up with this in a variety pack, I suggest heating it with cheese over the top, making a tuna casserole. A few crispy french fried onions on top of the cheese might really "spiff it up."<br /><br />Another thing to note is that the box says the container is "microwave safe." However there was an insert that said you should remove the contents from the container before placing in the microwave. Since the container is metal, I'd take the safe route and heat it in a microwave safe dish.<br /><br />An OK meal, but not great at room temperature on its own. I suggest if you want tuna for a trip to buy one of the packages with crackers, mayo, and pickles, cheaper and better tasting.
