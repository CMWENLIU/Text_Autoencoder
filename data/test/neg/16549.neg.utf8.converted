I found this tea to be one of the weakest mint teas I have ever tried.  I also should mention that these are not foil wrapped bags, but are instead plastic wrapped.  If one is out for a better base level green mint tea go with Bigelow Green Tea with Mint instead of this.  Also want to give amazon a big thumbs down for shipping out such a short coded product not listed as such.
