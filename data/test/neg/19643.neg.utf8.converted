I have 6 cats and do cat rescue.  I bought a case, since I mainly only use organic (Newman's Own)canned food for all my cats.  This looked and smelled like human food, but the cats won't touch it.  I left it outside for starving wild cats and THEY would not eat it either.  So buyer beware.  Don't buy a case to start with like I did.  I still have 20 cans left and no one will eat it.
