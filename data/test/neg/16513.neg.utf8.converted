<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FNB3AI">Nana's No Wheat - No Refined Sugar - Chocolate Chip Cookie, 3.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>  I have tried several of Nana's products and they are VERY, VERY tasty for the occasional snack or special occasion. With my gluten-free diet (and expecting family members with dietary restrictions), I ordered a box of these renowned Chocolate Chip Cookies for inclusion on the dessert table at my son's graduation BBQ.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: these "No Wheat" cookies DO CONTAIN GLUTEN--in the form of barley flour and malted barley.  In my ignorance, I excitedly purchased these without carefully reading the ingredients. WHY would these cookies be advertised as being free of Wheat, Sugar and Dairy, and yet, contaminated with Barley??? Yes, they are, indeed "wheat-free"... If someone can explain this, I would love to hear the explanation. Consume these with caution.
