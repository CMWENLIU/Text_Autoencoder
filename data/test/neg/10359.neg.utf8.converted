Other reviewers compared these to goldfish or cheezits.  No way!  First, they have that sandy, powdery feel that so many gluten free baked goods have. Plus they are really lacking in cheese flavor.  I'll probably use them with chili or in crab cakes. But as something to snack on, I'd have to be really desperate.
