These gummies have rave reviews, so I decided to give them a try.  Looks like I'll be sticking with Haribo ones.  These gummies are indeed very soft, but for some reason, they just taste like soap.  They even smell a bit like soap.  I'm trying to see if there's ways to remove the smell--I'm going to try sticking them above a jar of rice to see if the smell can be absorbed, but it's really that bad.  The soapy smell/taste almost covers up any of the fruity flavors of the bears.
