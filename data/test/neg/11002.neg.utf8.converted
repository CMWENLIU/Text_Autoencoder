I purchased this rice milk powder with an open mind.  I had read other reviews that claimed it was too sweet or lumpy, but decided to give it a go anyways.  Here's what I found...<br /><br />You must prepare this drink per the can instructions otherwise it is lumpy.  Warm water and a blender are a must, plus a container to store the prepared mixture in your refrigerator.  Shake the prepared mixture before use because it quickly settles.  I found the taste to not be sweet but rather have a sweet smell.  It reminds me of the smell I get when I open a bag of Honey Nut rice cakes; it is faintly reminiscent of cotton candy.  Once you drink it, the sweetness is very mild.  It is kind of like the lack of sweetness you experienced as a child when you bit into your cherry chapstick thinking it would taste like it smelled.  As for using it in coffee, I haven't cared for it.  I used to drink half rice milk, half coffee in the morning, but it just doesn't have the consistency to stand up to coffee like my other rice milks do.  It separates quickly and gives the coffee a thick quality.  As for the price, I did the math and it is only slightly less expensive than if I had purchased the Trader Joe's rice milk I normally get.  The packaging is correct that this rice milk travels well because the powder does not require refrigeration, but then again I usually don't travel with a blender so that was a moot point for me.  I would have also liked it more if it was organic.<br /><br />What I really like about this rice milk is that it uses less packaging when compared to aseptic boxes (one can is like 16 small boxes), it has a long shelf life, it does not contain vitamin D2 (I don't care to take synthetic vitamins... I'd rather use D3, but that's not usually vegan so you won't find it in rice milk), it works as a milk substitute in recipes, AND I can use it in recipes that call for powdered milk (sort of -  there isn't any protein in this rice milk, and that's usually why most recipes call for using powdered rice milk as an ingredient so if that's what you wanted to use it for I would recommend going with powdered egg whites or powdered protein shake instead).  So, you could easily use it for cooking or for breakfast, but the idea of using it for a coffee creamer is out of the question.  It is almost unpalatable in coffee.
