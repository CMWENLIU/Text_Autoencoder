I paid for the product and the shipping and i paid to return it as the bottle was open and part of the foil top had loosened as (i guess) it had not been packaged well, there was kitchen bouquet everywhere.  I contacted them and luckily i had saved the sticky box because they wanted it back.  So i sent the whole mess back asap.  At my expense, no apology or refund of my money for return postage nor even a darn coupon......hmm not even an apology.<br /><br />Rosemary Blazek
