I mean, from the description, you'd expect this peanut butter to be a major new discovery in taste. I'll tell you what I discovered!  VERY little cinnamon flavor; WHAT swirl?; are you SURE those are raisins?; what were you thinking?; what was I thinking?  Just make yourself some good ole cinnamon toast and spread some good peanut butter on it and be done with it.  I'm beginning to think Amazon won't be happy until they have at least two of everything to sell.  Kinda like Noah's ark meets Wal-Mart!!  I'll be going more with my gut instinct than the reviews next time I consider a purchase, AND SO SHOULD YOU!  (Mine included!!)
