I have been using Amazon for years and have rarely had a problem. After reading the reviews for this tea I purchased it only to find that the tea received was tasteless as another reviewer described. Now I have a pound of tea but I will not drink and have found that I cannot return it<br />(I definitely do not agree with this policy). Regrettably the bag was not dated selected not tell if I had gotten an out of date bag.
