These things are the most disgusting thing I have ever tried (well okay except jelly fish, that was gross too).  In fact these taste and feel like eating Jellyfish (and that was on a dare).  I guess if you like raw fish or eating rubber bands, go ahead and buy them.  Total waste of money in my opinion.  Sorry.
