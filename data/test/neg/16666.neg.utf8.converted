While this was an economical way to purchase a 'Large Serving Size' (not available in stores) I was disappointed with the condition the box arrived in and the poor packing of the product. Instead of the bags being lined up and covered with a protective cellophane wrap, they were tossed into the mailing box without any protective wrapping. Individual bags were all crushed. Chips were not as fresh as they are when purchasing them directly from the store.
