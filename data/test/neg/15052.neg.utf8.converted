I love pea soup, so it seemed like a no brainer to buy this.  I mean seems like a good buy, easy to make and no hassle cleanup, right?<br /><br />WRONG!<br /><br />This stuff is so gross.  I followed the instructions to a T and the stuff was gross and had the weirdest consistency of any soup I've ever had.  I'm only lucky I bought this using a $5 Amazon gift card I had, otherwise I would have been out $10 of my own money instead of just $5.<br /><br />Bleh, the smell is pretty gross too, its still lingering in my kitchen.  Think I'll just give these to my health freak friend, she'll eat anything so long as its organic and vegan, no matter how crappy it tastes.
