Sorry I bought this -- my terrier mix was not challenged in the least.<br /><br />It is a good idea, and I liked that it provides the opportunity for three different games because I thought the variety would be a plus, but all three games are too easy.<br /><br />The basic problem is that for two of the games -- the two where the treat is uncovered by sliding a piece -- the sliding pieces are so easily displaced that they pose no challenge.  The slightest touch makes them slide.<br /><br />The remaining problem is that the third game -- the one in which the covers have to be lifted -- requires the dog to do nothing more than what a dog does naturally:  pick up something with its mouth.  No biggie.<br /><br />I can see how this toy would be valuable to an extremely old, arthritic dog, who would appreciate the minimal effort needed to attain a treat.  Other than that, I think it is a waste of money.  An average dog would be unchallenged and a smart dog would be positively bored.
