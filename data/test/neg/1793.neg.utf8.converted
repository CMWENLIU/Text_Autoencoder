This syrup is very, very sweet, and it does not have a very strong violet flavor.  I was hoping to use it to flavor ice creams and yogurts, but it does not have enough violet flavor to work in this way.  I've tried just adding more of it to increase the flavor, but then the sweet taste becomes too strong.  If you are looking for a sweetener with a hint of flavor, this will be great for you, but if you are trying to make violet flavored treats such as are available in Europe, you will be disappointed with this syrup.
