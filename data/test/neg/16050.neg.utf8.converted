Let me start by saying how much i love chimes and their adorable little tin packaging. I ordered these last Christmas to include in little gift packages... Ive ordered them before from amazon and had no problem, though this time they came in an opened box and with the expiration code on the bottom of the tin rubbed/blotted out. On some of the packages I could still faintly make out a date from early 2010 though. By no means did I want to give as gifts expired candy, let alone boxes that had been tampered with. I called amazon and they promptly replaced the case, though unfortunately the new case was expired as well(despite me asking for them to check), though the dates had not been rubbed out. At this point, I knew that the entire batch was just probably old and took my chances and asked them to replace with a different flavor(as I knew they would not check), hoping the new flavor was from a different shipment. Luckily, the mango ones I ordered were fine and did not expire until 2012. It was just terribly unfortunate that such a great item had no checks or balances before they left the amazon warehouse- ultimately amazon replaced both boxes, but it was a hassle and disappointment to keep getting old merchandise.
