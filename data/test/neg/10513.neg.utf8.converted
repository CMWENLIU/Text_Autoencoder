In my excitement at thinking I'd found the perfect house for my pet bunny, I was horrified to discover that I'd mis-read the description - this isn't a "fresh rabbit hole" as I first thought!<br /><br />Please take more care when describing items Amazon.  I threw this carcass into my bunny's hutch and the horror in his eyes will stay with me always.<br /><br />It's hollowed out insides do actually make a nice snug bed for my hamster though, hence the extra star.
