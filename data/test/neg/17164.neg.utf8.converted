I usually order Really Raw Honey directly from the manufacturer, but saw it on Amazon and wanted it quickly. I got it in two days, but when it arrived it had been so poorly packaged that both jars broke and there was glass and honey everywhere!! They were in a small box with just one layer of bubble wrap on one of the jars! I requested a refund from Amazon, and I'm sure they'll take care of it, but this was disappointing. Recommendation: Order Really Raw Honey directly from their website...it's cheaper there anyway, and they know how to safely package their products.<br /><br />I love Really Raw Honey and it's the best honey I've ever tasted!! Has lots of great healing properties as well.  When my daughter and I get a cold or our allergies are bothering us, it's the first thing we reach for!  Love it...just wish Amazon could've packaged it properly<br /><br />Update:  Amazon gave me a full refund.  Thanks Amazon! Best customer service EVER! Hate to say though, I'll still be ordering this honey from the company's website in the future.
