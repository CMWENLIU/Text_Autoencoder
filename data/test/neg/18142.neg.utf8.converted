We have been geting Pemmican Beef Jerky for years and now they have changed it enough that the texture is off and has an off taste. My husband opened the first bag and threw it out because he thought that it had gone bad. The bad news was that they were all like that. I think the "New" was defenitly not for the better. We will not be buying any more of this product.
