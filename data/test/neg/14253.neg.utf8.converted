Outside of taste and people with soy issues, I haven't found a reason to drink almond milk. There is only 1g of protein and fiber in it. How do you take almonds which have fair amounts of both and suck them all out to make a drink? There's not a lot of calcium or other nutrients as well. So most of the calories is coming from sugar and fat. I just don't see the appeal. Same goes for rice milk.<br /><br />I'd stick with soy milk if you don't have an intolerance to soy. Just find a brand who's flavor you like. I'm rather fond of Westsoy and Trader Joe's personally.
