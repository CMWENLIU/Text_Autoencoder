As a lover of boxed mac and cheese, I thought that these would be the perfect thing for me, so I bought some--and subsequently pawned them off on unsuspecting neighbors. Okay, it wasn't that bad, but they are definitely not like homemade (though I wasn't suspecting that), nor were they even like boxed mac and cheese (which I thought they would do a good job of replicating). I felt that these cups taste very powdery and were unappetizing.<br /><br />The only way I could get them down was to mix some milk and butter with them. However, after already paying over $1 for this food, I feel like I shouldn't have to add more cents on to the price by supplying my own milk and butter. I also question the environmental friendliness of this food--there is an awful lot of extra waste made for a small amount of gain.
