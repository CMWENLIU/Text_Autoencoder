This chocolate, when fresh, is delicious.  I love this brand. Or did until today.<br /><br />It arrived today from Bengalla Organic Wholesale.  Apparently they sent out the oldest chocolate in stock.  It has a waxy film on it and tastes awful.  I called them immediately to tell them about the problem, but they will not send me new chocolate or give me a refund.<br /><br />I am so disappointed because it cannot be eaten.  I tried, but it is really bad.<br /><br />My advice, buy this from a whole foods store in your city.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Good news:  Amazon was kind enough to efund me the purchase price.  So while Bengalla gets 0 stars, Amazon gets 5 stars!  THANKS AMAZON.
