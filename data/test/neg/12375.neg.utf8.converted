Some of my friends were using Earth's Best formula and were raving about it so we decided to switch from Enfamil Infant Premium to the Earth's Best organic infant formula since it was available on Amazon subscription and was a little cheaper. I have to say that I was very disappointed with this product. It does not disolve well at all and leaves chunks of formula in the bottle regardless how well you mix it and whether you use warm or cold water to dilute it with. The baby does not seem to like it any more or less, so we will be going back to Enfamil Infant Premium, which has all the same vitamns and completely disolves within seconds.<br />After mentioning about the chunks to a friend, I was told that it is a common problem with this brand of formula.
