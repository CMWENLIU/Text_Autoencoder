I was really surprised how horrible this stuff smelled when I opened the can.  It is like a chemical not a food.  I'm a die hard hummus lover known to drive 3 hours round trip to get hummus.  My girlfriend and I made hummus with it and couldn't get the hummus tasting right.  I switched tahini brands to Kironos, which I bought right here on Amazon.  I followed on [...] the Hummus III recipe with Kironos tahini and it is to die for.
