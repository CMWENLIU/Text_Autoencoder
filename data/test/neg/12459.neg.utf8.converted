The first bag of this I received was good and aromatic, so much so that I quickly ran out and had to order another bag. I opened the second bag upon arrival and noted that the aroma was "off". Thinking that maybe my sniffer was just not working, I went ahead and brewed a pot. The taste of the stuff almost made me ill! From the smell and the flavor, I thought I had received a mislabeled bag of lemon grass by mistake!<br /><br />Undaunted, I went back to Amazon and ordered this instead: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELLB20">Numi Organic Tea Moroccan Mint - Herbal Teasan, Full Leaf, Loose Leaf 16 oz bag (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />The Numi's packaging was greatly superior to Davidson's and the flavor was superb! I'll have to check out their other teas.<br />No more Davidson's Moroccan for me!
