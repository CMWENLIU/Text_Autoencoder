I bought this stew a few days ago because I remebered how good it was when I was a kid, i.e, big chunks of chicken, big carrots and potatoes, and delicious flavor. Sadly this product has changed. There's barely any chicken, the potatoes are very small and sometimes black, and there's not many carrots. Is there a chicken and potato shortage that I don't know about or is Dinty Moore really cheap ?. Also some of the cans were dented, so I contacted Amazon and they sent me replacements, overnight express shipping(Amazon's customer service is the best!); this is before I tried the stew or I would have asked for a refund. Anyway, I am very disspointed and I will not buy this product again.
