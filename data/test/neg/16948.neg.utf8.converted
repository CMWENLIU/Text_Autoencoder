I've used this product for 9 years, ever since we went through puppy training with my dog.  Since then, it's been a relatively healthy treat and a good tool for behavior reinforcement.  I say relatively healthy because so many dog treats are full of wheat and other grain fillers.  The Amazon product ingredient listing is for the OLD formulation.  Let's examine the first 8 ingredients of that formulation:<br /><br />Lamb, Lamb Hearts, Lamb Kidneys, Lamb Lungs, Whole Wheat Flour, Rice Flour, Lamb Fat (Preserved with mixed Tocopherols and Ascorbic Acid source of Vitamin C) Sucrose.<br /><br />The first 4 ingredients are lamb, and so the inclusion of wheat and rice flour as the fifth and sixth ingredients, while not optimal, is allowable for texture.  The lamb fat is perfectly good for a dog's diet, while the eigth ingredient, sucrose (table sugar) is not healthful at all.  Presumably it was added for palatability, but as the eight ingredient overall, it might be an acceptable concession.<br /><br />Now, check out the new formulation's first 8 ingredients, from the Natural Balance web site:<br /><br />Lamb Lungs, Wheat Flour, Sugar, Lamb, Wheat Bran, Lamb Hearts, Salt, Rice Flour.<br /><br />Only 3 of the first 8 ingredients could be considered optimal for canine health: the rest is filler or worse.  Wheat flour and sugar displace two meaty ingredients in the top 4, and SUGAR is now the third ingredient overall.  SUGAR.  Folks, this is NOT good for your dog.  They've taken a mostly healthy treat and made it sweeter, pumped up the filler grains, and even increased how much salt is in it.  This isn't a MEAT roll any longer, it's basically meat-flavored Doritos.  AVOID this at all costs if you care about your dog and keeping him healthy for a long time.<br /><br />It's too bad that my dog loves this so much, because now I will have to buy a better, more healthful product, or make my own treats.  SHAME on Natural Balance for junking up their product at the expense of the animals' health.
