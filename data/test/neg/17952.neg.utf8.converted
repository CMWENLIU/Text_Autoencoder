I agree with the other reviewers who say these Vine are stale and HARD. I had been buying these almost exclusively through Amazon and was willing myself to like them as they were sugar-free and a better option for my sweet tooth. After gnawing through the first batch I got from Amazon, I was notified the Vines were not in stock and headed to a local store and bought a package. HOLY MOLY! It's like night and day!!! That's what Vines are supposed to taste like!!! they were SO soft and I could chew them without getting TMJ. I realized that all Vines are not created equally. I thought, "hey maybe my first Vine batch was a bad apple" and lo and behold, my next batch arrived last week....I rushed to open the package and taste the chewy goodness I experienced from my local drug store Vines and NOOOOOOO Hard as a rock! I value my teeth so I am going to cancel my subscribe and save on these Vines. I will pick them up at my local drug store where I can squeeze the package and make sure they are fresh and not going to give me lock jaw. I suggest others do the same until Amazon works out their freshness problem. Maybe my children can use these to make a craft or school project, because they definitely are NOT edible.
