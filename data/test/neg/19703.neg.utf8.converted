I absolutely love Reeses Peanut Butter Cups. Because I could not find the Big Cups locally, I searched Amazon and ended up ordering two boxes from the Online Candy Shop. Given that selling chocolate via mail-order is their business, I figured it was safe to do so, in spite of the gross shipping charge ($12.00).The only thing "good" I can say about the end result is that the candy arrived quickly - end of "good" remarks. The outer carton they arrived in was crushed at both ends. Even the inner carton showed signs of the crushing. And apparently the chocolate had gotten so hot it caused the chocolate to stick to its paper covering, making it impossible to remove the candy whole.  Well, I learned my lesson. Never again will I order ANYTHING from the Online Candy Shop. You have been warned!!!
