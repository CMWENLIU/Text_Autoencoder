I don't know what I was thinking. The carrot powder looks yellowish. Probably all the beta carotene are all gone. I hoping to use them on my smoothies but it's has no taste to it. It looks and smells old. I can smell the plastic bag better than the carrot powder. No details if it's freeze dried or regular drying method. This would affect on what's left nutritionally.
