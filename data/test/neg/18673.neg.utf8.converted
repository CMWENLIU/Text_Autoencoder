Know what you're getting into! This is extremely heavy on szechuan peppercorns, which numb your mouth and completely change the taste of the ingredients. My water even tastes funny - kind of like lemon.  I've traveled in Sichuan, so I am not a lightweight when it comes to exotic foods. I expect that even adventurous eaters will have trouble with this sauce.
