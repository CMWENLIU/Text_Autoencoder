The food itself is O.K. The cat eats it and gives it an average rating. She favors many other flavors over this.<br /><br />Seven of the cans were crushed on receipt, with 3 being totally popped open, and food from them strewn over all the other cans.<br />The box was not damaged. I have ordered cans several times from other vendors and never had more than 1 dented can on time. I will<br />NEVER, EVER use this particular vendor again. What a friggin mess of a shipment!
