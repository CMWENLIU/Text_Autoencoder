Most of the Gloria Jeans coffees I've tried do not meet my coffee expectations. Some of the foo foo flavors, like Mudslide, are okay, but still not exceptional. Luckily, I was able to trade my almost full box at the K-Cup Exchange on yahoo ([...]), and in return get a flavor I liked.<br /><br />I recommend this site VERY highly. You will learn a lot about brewing with your Keurig there, and it's free.
