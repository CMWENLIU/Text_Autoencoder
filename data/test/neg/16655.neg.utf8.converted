I was really disappointed to see that 3 squares of these (the serving size) contain 1g of trans fats. The 6g of saturated fat doesn't really bother me, but trans fats (in any product) do. Therefore, I can't really enjoy them and am going to give most of them away. For taste alone (disregarding the trans fat content), I'd give these 4 stars. They're pretty good taste-wise. But overall, I'd say these are only worth 2 stars based on its aforementioned ingredient issue. There are plenty of sweets and chocolates out there with better ingredients.
