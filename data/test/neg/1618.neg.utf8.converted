On the cover, pink guava and coconut sounds very interesting and tasty.<br /><br />It was the complete opposite.<br /><br />My taste is very good and i am not picky at all. I can eat most food on this planet without hesitation.<br /><br />But, the taste on this drink is different. It does not taste good or bad. It for sure doesn't taste like a $10 product.<br /><br />It taste like the container that holds the drink. The taste does not taste like guava or coconut water.
