I love dried mushrooms.  All kinds of them.  But I was very disappointed in these and am trying to decide what to do with this huge container now.  They have no flavor at all.  Reconstituting is a challenge, because  the different types of mushrooms require different amounts of time to hydrate.  But I worked with them, removing the different types from the liquid as they were ready.  The problem is that they have no taste at all to them. None. Neither does the broth.  I have purchased other types of Roland dried mushrooms and been very happy with them.  These are a big disappointment.
