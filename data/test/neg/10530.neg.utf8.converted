I found 2 worms in my current batch, after I had baked them (and, unfortunately, was eating one) - still trying not to gag. I have written customer service - am completely disgusted. I'm disappointed, because I used to love them for breakfast. They're quite tasty...but I'll never be able to eat one again after this experience.
