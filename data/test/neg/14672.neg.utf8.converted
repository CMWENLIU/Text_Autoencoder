I got a free sample of the mocha flavor at Starbucks. The employee told me it was quite sweet and I probably wouldn't need any additional sweetener. When I tried this at home, I got quite a surprise and not in a good way. I love bold, rich coffee and this was NOT pleasant. It tasted watered down and weak. The "mocha" flavor was artificial and barely palatable. I added cream, thinking it might make things better but it only marginally helped. I added a tiny bit of simple syrup and that made it drinkable. All in all, I was disappointed and would not purchase this. I have had the original VIA (Columbia and Italian Roast) and they were far superior to the flavored stuff. If you already drink flavored coffee, maybe this will appeal to you. Otherwise, save your money! You can get instant coffee granules from Trader Joe's and their sipping chocolate for a better instant mocha coffee. Just make the hot chocolate (instructions on the tin of sipping chocolate) and add some instant coffee to taste. Ta-da!
