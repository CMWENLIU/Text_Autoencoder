I was surprised to find that these are PLAIN gummi bears covered in chocolate.  That combined with rather bland chocolate leaves you with a very "meh" tasting product.  There's just no flavor.  Even if they were regular flavored Gummmi Bears the chocolate probably wouldn't help at all.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to these but ended up not eating more than a handful due to how uninspired the product ended up being.
