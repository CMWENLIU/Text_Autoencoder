Day:1 Hmm, I was excited on seeing Amzn.com's offer which pretty much dwarfs the price I pay for noodles at the Indian grocery store...when the box came, I ripped it open to taste the noodles hoping that the taste would be great... hmm not quite.. it had a stale smell, not intolerable, but recognizable.<br /><br />Day:2 I ate two packs and did not get the flavor... something fishy..<br /><br />Day:3 I decided that I am not going to return a 96 pack (rather 94 now) box and decided to stock the noodles in my shelf. Suddenly my eyes fell on the expiry date, it was February 2011.. and what date is it today? August 2011..<br /><br />The idea is not about being able to return products, but to make sure the products are good in the first place.. think about the effort I have to put in now to return it... why does this happen? Is Amazon not reading reviews? Are people who pack the noodles not literate enough to read the expiry date? I am disappointed.
