Unless I missed it the seller does not divulge the<br />weight.<br /><br />For this price $5.94 plus a hefty $6.95 shipping, one<br />would expect 7 - 8 ounces of chipotle (a bulk purchase,<br />as 8 oz is alot of chipotle!).<br />Yet 8 oz would be reasonable amount of chipotle for<br />someone paying the $12.89 total in this transaction.<br /><br />Otherwise a good int'l food supermarket might be a better<br />deal cost wise.<br /><br />So please indicate the chipotle weight offered here, and why the shipping<br />is so high.<br /><br />The same request, please, for your other diced/dried ancho, jalapeno, etc.
