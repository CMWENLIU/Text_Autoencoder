We bought the Toxic Waste candy, based on the entertaining label, promoting the extreme difficulty in eating them. (Indicating it is nearly impossible to keep it in your mouth more than 30 seconds) Warnings abound on the label, severe discomfort, "don't eat more than one", etc. I am used to super-hot hot sauces, where warnings are justified, so expected extreme sourness.<br /><br />We set up a Christmas eve game, with 35 adults and kids, with a video camera, to record the event. Most of the people either never eat, or hate sour, so this was going to be fun! First person was an adventurous woman "guinea pig" ... Ate it without a wince. Next person, a young boy, who easily ate it and proclaimed, "warheads are much more sour".<br /><br />Some people winced for a few seconds. Only 2 had problems getting past the initial sour. After a few seconds, the sour goes away. Another discovered, if you chew the candy, it is hardly sour. Even a 6 year old boy, who absolutely hates sour, ate one. Several people said the flavor makes a difference, speculating that the green apple was more sour than other flavors.<br /><br />While we had fun, it was very disappointing. I was expecting super-extreme, Umeboshi plum kind of sour, or worse!<br /><br />With a room full of people, from age 6 to 84, 100% ate the entire thing, with the kids eating them like candy. This may be sour candy, but it is NOT "Toxic Waste" sour.<br /><br />On the plus side, those who love eating sour, (mostly the kids) liked this candy, but it is just candy, not an adventurous challenge for the strong-willed.<br /><br />Sorry, guys, fantastic marketing label, but poor execution. I have no idea why our results were so different than expected, but we went through 3+ cans in an evening. We will try again next year, but I will try to find something *really* sour, something that at least 2/3 of the people cannot eat!
