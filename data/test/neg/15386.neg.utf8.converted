Lets break it down:<br />Chicken- looks like 1st ingredint, but really isnt since all ingredients are listed based on weight prior to extrusion and since meat is 80% water, it slides way down the list.<br /><br />Main ingredients:<br /><br />brewers rice- byproduct when nutrition portion of the rice is taken out (for human consumption)<br /><br />wheat- another filler, common allergen<br /><br />poultry byproduct- rendered slaughterhouse waste , whatever is leftover when prime cuts are taken out, can contain diseased animals.<br /><br />corn gluten- another byproduct, remnant after the nutritious portion is taken out, common allergen<br /><br />animal fat- unidentified, could come from euthanized shelter animals.<br /><br />and the list goes on, more corn, soy and plethora of other indigestible matter.<br /><br />Probably costs $3 to make, more goes into the pretty packaging.
