I love Weruva for my dogs, let me say that up front. I ordered 2 cases of this food, and out of 24 cans FIVE were usable. The rest were so badly dented that they were opened and molded. When I tried to return it, I found that This food has a NO RETURN policy. I ended up paying more than $10.00 a can for those 5 cans. NOT ACCEPTABLE. I have been ordering my dog food through Amazon for some time, and this shipping problem is getting worse. Much of the product arrives dented, but unopened. Instead of throwing money away like this, I will pay a little more and pick it up myself! Buyers, please be aware of this NO RETURN policy!!!!
