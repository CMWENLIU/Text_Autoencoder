I gave this as a gift to a friend in my office. She and I love this kind of stuff and I was very excited to send it to the office so we could open it together. The packaging is very cute, including the booklet about the 50's. We were going through the candy, yelling and screaming about how we remember this one and that. Then we got to the moon pie which not only looked crushed, but it also looked old. Then we checked the other candy like the MaryJanes and those were hard and inedible. Though we checked the expiration dates on the candy that had them, and they were within the dates, they definitely were not fresh and the enthusiasm for this product quickly faded knowing we weren't going to be eating any of it. I am very disappointed in this item. Especially because it's packaged as a gift to give to someone. I would not recommend sending this to anyone because the quality of the candy is not acceptable. To make matters worse, this item is not returnable.
