Goji berries CAN be very tasty and enjoyable, however this is not how I would describe Navitas goji berries.<br /><br />I bought a bag once, from Amazon, and found the berries to be nearly rock hard and absolutely dry.  The only good part about it was that they sorta tasted ok after chewing on them a while.<br /><br />If you want really, really good goji berries get Heaven Mountain brand.<br /><br />They cost twice as much as these, but these aren't really worth anything, in my opinion.<br /><br />These are the best and well worth the price:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010EBEKU">Bija  Heaven Mountain Goji Berries 8-Ounces</a><br /><br />Do it right or don't do it!
