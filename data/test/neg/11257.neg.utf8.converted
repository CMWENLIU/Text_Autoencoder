I'm giving this two stars because they taste sort of okay. Nothing special - I'd probably call it three stars if they weren't labeled as Tim Tams. I grew up with Tim Tams and it's a joke to give them the same name.<br /><br />They're a version made for the American market. Skip these, try the real thing instead.
