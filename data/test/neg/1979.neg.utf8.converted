The flavor is now bland and boring (think Hershey Kiss), and the "new and improved" smooth texture reminds me of plasticizers.<br /><br />I spent probably hundreds of dollars on Lindt 70% chocolate bars over the years, but as soon as I tasted the new version, I will never by another Lindt product of any kind until they bring back the old one. Looking at all the other reviews, Lindt has made an identical mistake to Coke of releasing a new version and discontinuing the old one.<br /><br />I wouldn't be surprised if its cheaper to make (soy emulsifier wasn't on the original ingredient list and it tastes like they are using inferior coca), but this bar is an insult to the intelligence of every person who's tried the original.
