I tried this product and it had the most horrible taste. I really thought it would taste nice. This is the first time I have ever tasted Goat milk though. Very strong taste.  My advice is buy one can and see if you like it first. I have extra goat milk that I or my family will not drink. I plan to use it in making homemade soap so that I get some use from it.
