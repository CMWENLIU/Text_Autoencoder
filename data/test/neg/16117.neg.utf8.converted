I was looking forward to receiving my tub of Warheads until I opened the box. In the photo in this listing, you see multiple colors represented evenly in the resealable tub. By my estimation, the tub I received has about 80% YELLOW LEMON FLAVORED Warheads in it. YELLOW! The worst of the candy flavors. The last Starburst anyone eats. LEMON.<br /><br />Looks like I'll be eating around 48 Warheads and then donating 192 EXTREME LEMON YELLOW WRAPPERED Warheads to an orphanage or something. Don't be fooled by false advertising, you're getting LEMON candy.<br /><br />YELLOW LEMON.
