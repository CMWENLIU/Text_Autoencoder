Packaged arrived dented, and most if not all 4 variety bags of cookies were clumped, in pieces and crumbly. I use to get these at WFMarket, and they were just fine. However, it's been extremely hot across the country, and add in the reckless shipping carrier (no AC on trucks). These cookies really need to be kept in a cool environment. Oh well, what can you do. Too bad, I really do love these cookies.
