Tried it out for the first time tonight and hated it!!!  The Texture was terrible, the quality even worse.  We are big popcorn people and this is by far the worst I've had.  The popped kernels are big but HARD.  We use a stove popper that has been great with our other brand of Popcorn, this left tons of kernels un-popped.  Worst of all I broke my tooth, and that wasn't even eating a un-popped kernel.  What's up what that?  I would recommend NOT buying this.
