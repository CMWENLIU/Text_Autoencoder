Hi, first time reviewer here. Not because i never have an opinion, its just that i've never fully been moved to take time out of my day to give my two cents about something that someone is just going to read, ignore and go find out their own opinion anyway. But this seaweed snack that everyone is raving about is by far, bar none the nastiest bucket of yuck i have ever tasted in my entire life! it tastes like fermented ocean A**. Again i feel compelled to tell you the truth about this sea-garbage because every other review here is obviously someone who works for trader joe's and just trying to pitch the new product that they cant move off their shelves because there are no return customers. this seaweed snack has completely ruined my day and if it weren't for this beer in my hand to rid my tongue and nose of these rotting aromatics id probably take my own life just so that it would end. thank you for your time, and never buy this s***.
