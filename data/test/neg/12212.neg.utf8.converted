I thought this item would be a good addition to try on the diet I've been following.  I was looking for a low sodium, vegetable flavor.  The brand I usually use DOES make a vegetable flavor, but not in the low sodium variety.  I have not opened the package of Frontier as yet.  I was not happy after reading the label.  The first ingredient listed on the label is, "Corn Syrup Solids."  There is a carbohydrate content, a sugar content and a relatively high calorie content, comparatively speaking.  My usual brand has about 10 calories per serving. Frontier's has a calorie content of 60 per serving.  Frontier website states, "Frontier Natural Products Co-op specializes in natural and organic products."  I did not expect to get sugar in their soup product, albeit a less sweeter one.  Lower dextrose, nevertheless is still sugar.  If you look on their website, this is what Frontier states about the product:  " Vegetable Flavored Broth Powder, Low Sodium  - Use this rich flavor blend of tomato, onion, garlic, carrot, basil, celery seed, kelp, parsley, spinach, turmeric and bay for soups, rice and pasta. Pure, natural taste-without fillers, hidden ingredients, artificial flavors, preservatives or colors. "  DOES ANYONE SEE CORN SYRUP SOLIDS LISTED, HERE? :( DISAPPOINTED and didn't even taste it, yet! Not what I was expecting.
