I am a tea-a-holic, I drink tea all day long, and was looking for a decaf subsitute to my vanilla hazelnut Bigelow. This does not taste like vanilla or nut to me, it is kind of fruity and has a bad aftertaste. I am very sad, even tried to give the remaining 5 boxes away and none of my friends wanted them after drinking a cup. Too bad, I love Stash green tea, and the white/green fusion one is my favorite.
