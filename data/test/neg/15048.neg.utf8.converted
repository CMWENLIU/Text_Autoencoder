i have already entered a review but, now realize i entered it as a reply........<br /><br />i did NOT realize this one was the low fat version. i didn't like it as it does not taste like i remember it tasting. i will try the "regular" version at a later date. perhaps it wlll be the delicious moist bread i remember in my "younger" days. it left a faint bitter taste after eating it. i hope to be able to have that delectable bread back in my life soon. but this low fat version just "ain't" it! LOL
