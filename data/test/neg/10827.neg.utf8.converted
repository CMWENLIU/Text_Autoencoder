When I read the reviews for this gum, I chose to believe the people who said the gum doesn't have a mint flavor. Perhaps that was a bad idea. Chewing the gum, I have found the flavor to be a bit inconsistent from piece to piece. Some will taste pretty good with barely a hint of mint, others will full on assault my taste buds with a horrific menthol sneak attack. The licorice flavor itself isn't very strong and doesn't last very long. It's pretty much through after about 10-20 minutes, leaving only the atrocious menthol flavor. If you can't tell, I'm not a fan of menthol. I know the name Extreme Ice should have given it away, but can't help being rather disappointed by the whole thing.
