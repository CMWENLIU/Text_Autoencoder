My husband and I love barbecued ribs but are trying to cut out sugar and Scott's was recommended by the eating plan. The pictures looked like a thick red sauce on the meat, but in reality, this is a thin, watery, vinegary, marinade - not a BBQ sauce.  It isn't that it doesn't have a good flavor, but basted our ribs all day in it, and the ribs had no sauce on them at all, looked rather unappetizing and now we are left with a case of something we don't like. I know, I know, we should have just ordered one bottle and tried it first....
