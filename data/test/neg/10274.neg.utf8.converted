Please note that this product while listing organic ingredients also lists AUTOLYZED YEAST EXTRACT<br />an alternate name for D-glutamate or MSG.  Is autolyzed yeast extract organic?  I don't know, I don't know the defintion of organic for food labeling, but this is food labeling trickery.<br /><br />Pacific Natural Foods Organic Beef Broth<br />Ingredients<br />Organic beef stock (water, organic beef), Organic beef flavor base (organic roasted beef including beef juices, organic cane juice, organic beef flavor, organic onion powder, sea salt, organic canola oil, caramel color, organic garlic powder, organic black pepper, organic paprika, flavor), Sea salt, Autolyzed yeast extract, Organic garlic powder<br /><br />Of course it tastes good.  Autolyzed yeast extract is a flavor enhancer.  I am still looking for a commercially made broth that does not have MSG or one of its other forms/names.  You may want to check out the [...].[...] website  for more information than I have listed here.<br /><br />I for one will not buy it again, sorry.  Please clean up your product, Pacific.
