I was so excited to find this product.  I have used the beef and chicken.  Both have very nice flavor but can be too salty if you use too much.  My main reason for buying these was because they were suppose to be MSG free.  Silly me, I saw msg free on the label and didn't even pay attention to the ingredients.  Two of the ingredients are just another name for MSG!  Autolyzed yeast and Hydrolyzed protein.  What a bummer.  I have major health issues and try to avoid msg at all costs.  I will not be purchasing these again.  In fact the jars I have in the house now will be tossed.  It isn't worth the health issues!  I would like to find a bouillon product that doesn't contain any hidden msg.
