Today I decided to try Justins chocolate hazelnut butter since its organic and the first ingredient isn't sugar -like Nutella but it is seriously nasty. It tastes like burnt salt. I couldn't taste the hazelnuts or the cocoa over the sea salt. I am really glad I only purchased the sample size at my store. This stuff is terrible. If they had a salt free version I would try it though, because Nutella is too sweet.
