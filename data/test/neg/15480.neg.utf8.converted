This Zamouri berbere spice that i received did NOT have the same list of ingredients that are listed here for their Berbere. It contains no chili peppers even though Berbere should contain five (5) different peppers; but unfortunately this mix DOES contain BOTH cumin AND tumeric.<br /><br />Most ardent Ethiopian foodies know NOT to include tumeric with the cumin in Berbere spice. They are not used together in the same dish.  Ethiopian dishes are made with one or the other, but not both.  Also. the ingredients were listed in a completely different sequence, which changes the taste considerably, not to mention how much the lack of chili peppers changes the balance, keeping it way too bland, and without any heat.<br /><br />Fortunately, i live in Los Angeles where there is an Ethiopian section of town where injera and classic berbere can be purchased. I ordered a lot of Moroccan spices from Zamouri, and added the berbere just to try a new product.
