I ordered 3 boxes of Jammie Dodgers (over$24) as Christmas gifts on Dec. 2, 11. They were not opened until Xmas and a week or two later. They were spoiled. They smelled off and tasted awful. The best by dates were covered up. They seemed like they were over a year old. I will never order anything from them again!
