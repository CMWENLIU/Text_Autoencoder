I've tried several of the other jerky flavors, thai peanut, barbecue, teriyaki etc. and have enjoyed most of them although I find some better than others.  This one is awful for the following reasons:<br /><br />1.  Flavor: it is barely "spicy", more sweet than hot.<br />2.  Texture: unlike the other jerkies this one is a lot thicker and comes out like a slab - the others tend to break up easily and are a lot more moist - it is nothing like "real" jerky which I still recall after 20+ years as a vegetarian.  There is nothing jerky-like about the texture - think of a piece of cardboard it's about that thick, dry, and very unappealing.<br />3.  Aftertaste: I get an awful aftertaste from this jerky - sort of a mushroomy/sweet taste that doesn't fade for quite awhile.<br /><br />I would highly recommend you try this by buying one - not 24 as I'm busy trying to find anyone to give these away to.<br />To sum it up in one word - yuck!
