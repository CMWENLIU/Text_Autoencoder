I like black tea and have tried many kinds, but I find Tazo's Awake to be awful.  Starbuck's serves it and I think it's very bitter and have ended up tossing it.  I've tried it a few times hoping that maybe something went wrong the first time.  No, it's just a poor tasting tea.  Not sure about Tazo's other teas. I suggest trying Tetley, Red Rose, or Stash's English Breakfast for good black tea.
