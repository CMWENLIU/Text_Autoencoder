I'm only giving one star because I believe there's some funny business going on with their listed ingredients. As I am always on the lookout for a decent tasting vegetable stock or bouillion that isn't loaded with sodium or additives, I snatched a box of this "unsalted" veg. stock off the shelf in my local supermarket when I saw it. Then I noticed that the sodium content was 240 mg. per cup. I know that vegetables contain a certain amount of natural sodium--some more than others--but there's no way that THAT much sodium can be attributed to just the vegetables. A lot of companies lately have been sneaking salt into their products under the guise of "Natural Flavor" because technically, that's what salt is so they can get away with it. And since this product does contain "Natural Flavor" as one of it's ingredients, I'd bet the farm that's EXACTLY what they did.
