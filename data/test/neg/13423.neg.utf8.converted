The LorAnn pistachio flavoring oil was purchased for baking cakes and making frostings. There is a scant semblance of pistachio in this product and adding more than a few drops completely transforms quality ingredients into noxious, bitter, chemical-tasting trash. I believe these products were originally intended for making candy and may very well still be suitable for such things. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR BAKING.<br /><br />On a side, there are many LorAnn oils that have worked for me very well in baking (some of the berry flavors are excellent). I'm somewhat ambivalent about the flavors which are supposed to be rich or nutty such as their hazelnut or chocolate oils. I'm not dissuaded from buying LorAnn oils but I will certainly avoid purchasing 4 bottles prior to testing out a flavor.<br /><br />Happy cooking!
