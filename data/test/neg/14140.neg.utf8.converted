This product's written description does not accurately reflect the total carb count.  It is higher.  While it is a bit lower than traditional pasta, it is not "low."  I would like to clearly see the total grams and the net grams (adjusted for fiber and sugar alcohols) posted for other consumers, so they know what to expect.
