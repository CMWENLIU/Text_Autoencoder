I ordered a box of regular honees and a box of the milk-n-honees. Well i got the regular honees fine but the milk ones came 4 weeks later (after I got another box of the regular ones and e-mailed the mistake).They were awful!!They werent stored right so they were chewey and the honey had crystalized.
