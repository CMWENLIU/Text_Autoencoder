You'd think you can't go wrong with a basic staple like rice, right?  Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this rice.  Lotus Foods Madagascar Pink Rice was described as having a hint of spice flavor such as cinnamon or clove.  I didn't pick up on that in the slightest.  In fact, this rice had very little flavor at all.  I normally buy brown basmati rice, or Lotus Foods Forbidden Rice which are fantastic all by themselves.  Those rices can be enjoyed without a speck of salt or other seasoning added.  The Madagascar Pink can't begin to compare.<br /><br />I wish this had been available in a small package instead of an 11 pound sack.  I read the full description on the Lotus Foods website and I liked the idea of this rice.  The Amazon subscription price was a great deal, so I went for it.  I'll still eat the rice, of course, but it will be served in recipes that don't depend on the rice for flavor like other whole grain rices provide.
