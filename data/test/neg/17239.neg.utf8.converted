Big Starbucks fan, VIA fan, but this Christmas Blend VIA isn't very good for me.  Now, I'm not one of those super strong coffee people, but this is also a little bitter in my opinion.  I will say that if you use about 16 oz. and some milk and some vanilla, it's okay.  I see now why they were having a sale on it at Starbucks.<br /><br />I'd got with the Caramel VIA instead, that's the bomb, as is the Vanilla.
