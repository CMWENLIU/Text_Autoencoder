We have been drinking the Good Earth original tea for many years but this recent repackaging has changed the tea for the worse. We barely get one 8 oz. cup of tea with a bag and it is weak tea. Very disappointed with the new tea which is a far cry from the "original" and should not be labeled as it is.
