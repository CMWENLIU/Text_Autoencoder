Personally, I think the good reviews are from someone vested in this company. I have several complaints:<br /><br />1.  It is FROM CONCENTRATE - not in natural form... and it tastes like it.<br />2.  It is in plastic bottles and it TAKES LIKE THE PLASTIC.<br />3.  More of a saltier taste than all other brands I have tasted... and I drink coconut water every day.<br />4.  The only one worse than this one is the Zico brand - also from concentrate.<br /><br />Don't buy it.
