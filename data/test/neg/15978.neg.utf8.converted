Prior to this purchase, I had been a staunch supporter of Dog Nips brand (previously "Free Range" brand) chicken wrapped apple treats.  And, perhaps it's just this particular merchant that sold me old, outdated dog treats.?  But in any case, they made both my dog & my parent's dog puke.<br /><br />Only after both dogs became sick did I closely inspect the bags for an expiration date.  The only thing I could find was an imprint on the front that said "LOT # 20110305."  I took this as an expiration date of March 5, 2011.  I just recently bought the treats (in October 2011,) so they were very outdated!  When I received them, the chicken had indeed appeared somewhat darker in color than other bags I've bought in the past, but I didn't think a whole lot of it.  After the dogs became sick, however, I felt I had to discontinue feeding them to our dogs.  3 BAGS & APPROXIMATELY $50 DOWN THE DRAIN!<br /><br />I was very unhappy with the purchase, and I wouldn't recommend ever buying doog food or treats online because of this experience!
