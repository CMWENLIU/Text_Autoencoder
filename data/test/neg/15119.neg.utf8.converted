My daughter loves this chocolate milk, and always asks for it when we go to the coffee shop.  I thought of buying it in bulk for car trips, but decided to read the ingredient list first.  I'm not a super health-nut, but there are a handful of harmful ingredients that I look for on nutrition labels and one of them is carrageenan. It is a know carcinogen and hides in a lot of "health" foods. This chocolate milk contains carrageenan. Needless to say, I will not be buying it.
