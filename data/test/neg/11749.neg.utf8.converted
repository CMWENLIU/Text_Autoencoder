Like the other reviewer stated.....they must be rancid!  I wasted some beautiful, expensive fish using this product.  After anxiously waiting for the fish to cook, I took a bite...... and almost vomited.  This is the worst oil I have ever tried to eat.  I immediately drained the oil into the toilet and recycled all the remaining bottles.  Ohhhhh, I can not tell you how putrid this oil was.  I get sick to my stomach just remembering the taste.  Do NOT. I repeat, DO NOT buy this company's products....at least not the ones with oil in them.  What a waste of money and produce.  I can only hope I did not do any permanent damage to my health with my limited exposure to this criminally discusting food.
