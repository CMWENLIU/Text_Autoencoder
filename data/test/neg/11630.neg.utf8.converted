Learned after eating these I have a food intolerance to the konju root/glucomannan.<br />Purchased to help lose weight.  Got opposite affect.  Major water retention throughout<br />my whole body.  After several months of eating noodles, 5# weight gain.  Stopped eating<br />the noodles and dropped 5# in 4 days.<br />No complaint about the flavor or texture.
