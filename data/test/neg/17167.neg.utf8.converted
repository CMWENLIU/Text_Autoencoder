The texture and toughness of the jerky was very close to the real thing.  I was quite impressed.  However, the flavor and after-taste left something to be desired.  The only one i could eat was the Original Hickory... by far the best tasting of the sampler variety 8 pack.  All of the others were inedible to me and my wife.
