I was so excited about these "Miracle" Noodles and Rice. I order them both. I have been on a no or low carb diet for 6 months now and was ready to try these in hopes that someone finally found the answer to the cravings of a diabetic.  But alas.. this has not yet happened. despite the reviews about the really bad fish smell ( which I did not experience) and the Texture (which I found utterly disgusting) I ordered them anyway feeling that everyone is different and I had to find out for myself... Really....I mean really? is someone out there really enjoying these disgusting things? I can eat ANYTHING.,. that is part of the reason I am having the problems I am having.... But really.. all I can say is that if someone is promoting these things.. they must have stock in this company... BAD is an understatement.....!
