I know that white tea is supposed to have even more antioxidants than green, but sorry, Lipton Pyramid Teas: this is the only one of the Pyramid Teas which are otherwise excellent, especially the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM6PS0">Lipton Green Tea, Mandarin Orange, Premium Pyramid Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMAZPO">Lipton Black Tea, Black Pearl Pure Long Leaf, Premium Pyramid Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> that I find rather awful. The other two mentioned above are excellent.  This sad comer is infused with a simply terrible fake peach flavor that is, to me, nauseating.  If you really like that sort of thing you might still try it. To me it tastes like the awful flavored Bigelow green tea series.
