When bought the shipping was a Great surprise! Shipping was more than the Sauce. Contacted Merchant & they said they would cancel the order. (It doesn't take 29.00 to ground ship a gallon of Teriyaki Sauce!!!) I was happy they said they would cancel the entire order, however... it arrived 7 days later & my credit card was charged... I believe they enjoy just telling you what it is you want to hear & they will do what they want & keep the exorbitant Shipping rate as margin. Very disappointed & would suggest purchasing elsewhere. I did keep the gallon & the sauce is average in taste & is not as great as talked up... Again BEWARE of exorbitant shipping with this merchant...
