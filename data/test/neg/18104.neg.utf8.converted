I wish I had listened to the reviewer who said this is "sometimes really bad."  This shipment of crystallized ginger is old, dry & disgusting! And I have 5 lbs of it!  This quality is horrible, & I cannot eat it.<br /><br />This was my first purchase from Bayside Candies.  I love crystallized ginger, and this was the better deal with 5 lbs for approx. $20.  I have bought this ginger from Amazon before, but from a different company.  The other company's was $9 for only 16 oz.  It was fresh and delicious.  I am very disappointed with my purchase.  I could kick myself!
