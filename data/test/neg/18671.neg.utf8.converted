I love these cookies, but I am very disappointed at Amazon. I bought 2oz package (Pack of 32) and chose Two-Day Shipping. When I got the cookies I found out the expiration date is coming soon. Only "23 days" left. The label is AB091910. If my understanding of expiration date is correct. Can Amazon sell food to people like this??  I even have no right to return it. Very disappointed!!
