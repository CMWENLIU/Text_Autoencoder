The third ingredient in these puffs is corn syrup.  Organic corn syrup I'm sure, but corn syrup???  Shame on you, plum organics, I buy your products because they are healthy - but I will not be buying any more of  these radioactive colored organic fruit loop stand ins, no thank you.  I'll stick with Happy Baby puffs which my kids like just fine, and that way they won't be 300 lbs by the time they hit the 3rd grade.
