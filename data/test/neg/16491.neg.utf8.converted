<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00164X6BO">Kraft Creamy French Salad Dressing, 1.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 60)</a>I was really pleased to find the Kraft Creamy French Salad Dressing in the individual packets. Those are much more convenient to put in lunches. Unfortunately this does not look or taste like the stuff in the bottle. It seems to be a watered down version, possibly so it's easier to get out of the packet. It's lighter in color and has much less flavor. I also ordered the Kraft Thousand Island and found it the same way.
