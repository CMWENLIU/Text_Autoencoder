I like strong flavored coffee, and only occasionally roast coffees.  I brew in the little Bodum 17 oz (makes 250 cc) French Press using boiling water and a 4-minute cycle time. I use about 5 level scoops of fresh ground coffee per batch.<br /><br /> I found this brew to be weak on flavor, and very often bitter. With a halved cycle time, the bitterness doesn't disappear.<br /><br /> I love the smell of fresh coffee brewing in any time of day. I seldom find any aroma during brewing or tasting this coffee, and only occasionally when the beans were ground.<br /><br /> One more observation - the ground beans hold considerable amounts of air. When wet with boiling water, most of the air is liberated - producing a three-phase foam: air, liquid, and solid ground coffee. If allowed to stand, half of the contents of the filled French Press container will be this foam. Slowly it will lose air and evaporated water, becoming a solid matrix! So I continually stir the contents of the container for at least half of the brew time until nearly all the air has been liberated and the foam has been "beaten down." Then I can add the other half of the water - filling the container. The result appears as does Guinness Stout - dark liquor with a little aerated foam on top. OK!. Without the stirring, the water-soluble oils in nearly all the ground beans are extracted into maybe half of the liquid - not the uniform and consistent brewing environment I was hoping to obtain. THEN, when the brew cycle is complete, I find that the grounds are so swollen with liquid that they don't easily liberate brewed coffee liquor as the filter element is depressed. You have to force the thing downward and hot coffee spouts from the top of the French Press container. Odd..... as I don't find this in any other bean coffee product.<br /><br /> Just to check my senses, I bought a
