I fed this to my premature babies since this is what the hospital gave to them when they were born.  I continued to use the ready to use cans thinking that it was the best for them, since the powder formula "is not sterile."  My babies have had problems with gas, indigestion, reflux, spitting/vomitting all the time they were on this formula.  I just thought it was what all babies go through and didn't want to switch to a different formula again.  I recently switched over to the powder formula, and they seem so much better.  It's like I turned off a switch....amazing.  I can't say that I'm 100% sure it's the metal cans, but my instinct tells me that the BPA they used to line the cans made them sick.<br /><br />There's a growing concern over the BPA used in infant formula cans (and other canned foods).  BPA is used to line the cans in order to "preserve" the formula...and giving it a longer shelf life.  BPA is commonly found in plastic containers/bottles, and there's a movement to remove BPA from baby bottles because of its adverse effects on infants.  If babies ingest BPA, it can cause developmental problems in the brain and reproductive system.  The latest studies show that the level of BPA in metal formula cans is so much higher than what is found in baby bottles.  There's more information online (check out the Environmental Working Group) about this issue, and as a concerned mother, I felt that I needed to let other mothers out there know about this.  I know that there are millions of mothers who know little or nothing about this issue.<br /><br />I get sick thinking about this.  At the very least, we have a responsibility to be informed when it concerns our babies.
