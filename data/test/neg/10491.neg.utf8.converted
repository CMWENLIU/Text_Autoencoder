So, the title "Fresh Whole Rabbit" perplexes me a bit. If it was really "Fresh" as it is stated, wouldn't it still be alive? This takes the fun out of 'hunting for wabbits' with my collector's addition Elmer Fudd hat on. Instead, you take the thing out of the box and it just lies there. No amount of yelling or making loud noises will scare it away. I give this a two out of five. The fun factor is just non existent for me.
