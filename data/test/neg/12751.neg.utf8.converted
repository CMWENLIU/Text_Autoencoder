i ordered caffeine free tea bags. the box that was shown said caffeine free on it. my box does not- the writing on the front is different than the box shown and nowhere on the box does it say caffeine free. i attempted to contact seller but when i clicked on the sellers name it told me there were no matches. there is also no royal king web site for me to read nutrition facts, and the other sites that list caffeine content do not have info on this product.
