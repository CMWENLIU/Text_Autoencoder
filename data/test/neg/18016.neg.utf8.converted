If you want PURE, 100% PALM SUGAR (and there are plenty of options), DO NOT BUY GOLDEN PAK PRODUCTS.<br /><br />I am beyond disappointed, and here is why:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Coconut sugar<br />REFINED SUGAR<br />POTASSIUM SORBATE-->the stuff they add to cheap brands of red wine vinegar and loads of processed foods; not the worst by far, but they couldn't leave it at that :(<br />SODIUM (aka disodium) METABISULFITE-->E223 for countries that require chemical additives to be labeled (ie not the USA)--see below<br /><br />What's worse is they are distributed out of Kent, WA!! Just a stone's throw from Amazon HQ! Seattle's supposed to be a bit better than this!<br /><br />There's PLENTY of REAL palm sugar out there--I've been using the stuff--pure, plain, preservative-free, CANE SUGAR FREE palm/coconut sugar, and THIS ISN'T IT.<br /><br />Every benefit of palm sugar--and most things--gets totally lost when you (in ascending importance)<br /><br />1) ruin the flavor with nasty preservatives--in this case a sorbic acid salt to kill mold and a particularly nasty sulfite that kills just about EVERYTHING good and bad<br />2) do not clearly state it contains SULFITES, which happen to be DANGEROUS FOR SULFA ALLERGIC PEOPLE *hence needing to be labeled--which they only reliably do, from what I could see when I went back to get REAL palm sugar, on their 17.6oz vac-sealed single-slab packs (Na2S2O5--the disodium metabisulfite--is an inorganic, lab-made DISINFECTANT meaning ... yep, they threw it in to kill junk from poorly harvested/stored/transported stuff! ick! It's what you CLEAN equipment with... not to mention it can eat through hardwood floors and top grade lumber!)... Na2S2O5 is also dangerous for people with asthma and other respiratory conditions<br />and...<br />3) Hello, when someone wants PALM/COCONUT sugar... pure straight forward stuff... don't give them nasty refined sugar cane! One of palm sugar's great benefits, beyond tasting awesome, is *glycemic load* and if you toss in REFINED cane (not even the less-abrasive, still-has-some-molasses Florida Crystals or succanut etc), you are just asking blood glucose to spike. Agh.<br /><br />So yeah. This stinks. I'm upset because this is a huge, central part to my career and I get really angry knowing that most people I work to help day in and out trust these companies to sell what they say they are selling and not hide behind "no MSG added! (tiny print: "except for the amount contained in yeast extract"=>yeast itself isn't a free glutamic acid containing product; it's autolyzed yeast, ie break it down so much it's not yeast at all anymore and has ZERO properties of yeast, merely a derivation from it like fuel from corn or sugar not being corn or sugar to your body). So yeah, Golden Pak FAILS. Golden International Corp is their head company, so there are undoubtedly things under that parent name, too. Should've known better when I saw a FISH as a logo on sugar--something fishy indeed. Negative stars.
