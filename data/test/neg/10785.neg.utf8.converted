The plant is very healthy. It arrived quickly and in good shape.<br />What disappoints me is that it is described as 10-12&quot; tall and in a 10&quot; pot. This plant is 20&quot; tall and in a 5&quot; pot. It looks silly.....the pot is WAY too small for the height.  It does not look &quot;Bonsai&quot; due to it's height. If I had seen it in person I would NOT have bought it.
