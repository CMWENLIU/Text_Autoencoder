Another reviewer summed it up nicely:  "The ingredients of Godiva are far from top notch. At the prices they charge, it's a crime that Godiva uses artificial vanilla (vanillin), palm kernel oil, lecithin, preservatives, and artificial flavors made in some factory off the New Jersey Turnpike."  Additionally, the company itself is not customer friendly.  Don't expect much help if there's a problem with the order or delivery.
