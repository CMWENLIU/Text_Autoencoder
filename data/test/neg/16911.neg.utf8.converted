My son loves these milks and we used to get them for him when we went to Starbucks.  I was familiar with the Horizon brand and thought that the vanilla flavor would be fine.  I began to notice a few times after drinking this he would say his tummy hurt or he would act sick(really tired) shortly after drinking them.  I read the label and saw 29g of sugar...yeah holy cow!<br /><br />When we serve him a flavored milk I give him Gerbers smart sips, they have vanilla and mild vanilla flavor with 11g of sugar, I think the mild vanilla has even less grams of sugar.  He still loves the taste too!  I find them in the babyfood aisle at the grocery store.
