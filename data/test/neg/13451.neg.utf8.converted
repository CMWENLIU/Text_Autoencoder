Organic beans wrapped in "Bisphenol A" lined cans<br /><br />I went through the trouble to contact them and indeed they are using BPA lined cans.<br />BPA is the same substance removed from plastic baby bottles, because it is rated dangerous.<br />Many countries have already outlawed the use of BPA.<br />To be fair it has to be said that more than 90% of all manufactures of canned products in the US use epoxies containing BPA<br />Why can't an "Organic" manufacturer not go the extra mile?<br />Buy Eden Food beans right here at Amazon.<br />http://www.amazon.com/Eden-Organic-Pinto-Beans-15-Ounce/dp/B000GZW5MA/ref=pd_sbs_gro_7<br />[...]
