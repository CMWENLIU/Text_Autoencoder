We've been buying Equal in bulk for years because both of us drink a lot of tea and coffee that require sweetener. We were away from home for six months this year, and when we got back, I went ahead and ordered this bulk box to restock our supply.  But as soon as we started using the Equal from the box, we both noticed a problem: it didn't taste very sweet.  What would normally have taken two packets to taste sweet suddenly required four packets, and even then, it tasted odd.<br /><br />There have been a lot of news stories about fake products being sold online, so I worried that this was not real Equal and went online to do a lot of research.  I noticed that Equal recently changed their brand packeting and had a look at the packets inside the bulk box.  The packets we had gotten had a strawberry on the cover, while more recent Equal packets just have a stripe.  Then I noticed that the packets were all quite old, with manufacturing dates from 2008 & 2007.  While Equal says on their website that their product lasts forever, they ALSO say that they recommend discontinuing sale of the product after three years.  I suspect they know that Equal begins to lose its flavor over time, which would explain why the sugar we got in this box, all of which is from 4-5 years ago, tastes much weaker than it should.  After learning all this information, we decided to throw out the whole box of weak sweetener and buy an Equal box that had the more recent branding on it (striping).  That Equal tasted right, so we're going with that from now on, and no longer buying ANY Equal packages that have the old strawberry logo on them.<br /><br />This bulk box, in our opinion, is full of sweetener that is past its date and therefore not worth buying.
