...these muffins are a big disappointment.  See that lovely BROWNED muffin top on box picture?  Welllll, I've tried several boxes of these, using different oven temperatures, making them plain, with fruit, with nuts, with everything I could think of except chocolate (hmmm, maybe I'll try that!)  The tops stay a pale, pasty WHITE!  Sooo unappetizing.  And false advertising, IMHO.<br /><br />Now for the taste.  Another disappointment.  They are bland bland bland, blah, blah, blah!  You MUST add additional ingredients or they are just plain, uh, RICEY tasting - and if you're an older celiac, you know what I mean.  Those first corporate attempts at making GF mixes were hideous!  These are no better.  Yuck!<br /><br />Now for the size.  I'm a pretty doggone accomplished baker if I do say so myself, both prior to my diagnosis in 1985 with non-GF ingredients, and since, using mixes and baking from scratch.  These just don't RISE!  See the photo with that lovely dome muffin shape?  Nuh-uh.  Perhaps they use old, REALLY old leavening?  Dunno.  But they puff up only about 1/16" of a centimeter.  Maybe.  But I doubt it.<br /><br />Now for the boxed ingredients.  Cheesh, you have to add all of the EXPENSIVE stuff to make these work.  Butter, milk, eggs, and fruit/nuts/whatever.  Fer cryin' out loud, it's truly no more trouble, and a WHOLE lot cheaper to make muffins from scratch.<br /><br />I desperately wanted to love these and give a great review.  But I just cannot.  Make your own muffins and save your hard-earned money for some of the Gluten-free Pantry's other mixes - I rate the following 5 stars without hesitation:<br /><br />Country French Bread mix - absolutely delicious!!  We use our bread machine and they come out PERFECT every time!  And when we've used regular oven, in our french bread loaf pans, we add some toasted sesame seeds, and they are incredible.<br /><br />Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix - OMG - completely addictive!!  Gotta watch out for these if you're on a diet.  You'll want to gobble up the whole batch!<br /><br />Beth's All Purpose Flour - quick & easy to use for all your baking (including those homemade muffins).<br /><br />Spice Cake and Gingerbread Mix - delicious - and sooooo easy - I can prepare it faster than it takes my oven to heat up.  (Isn't that one of the BEST reason for buying a mix?)  I add additional cinammon, nutmeg, ginger - we like it that way.<br /><br />Coffee Cake Mix - fantastic - and EASY - the crumble topping is included.  Wonderful for a breakfast treat and NOT just for Celiacs.<br /><br />So that's about it.  Try it - you may like it. Hey - that's what makes horse racing! But don't buy a whole case in the event that you don't.<br /><br />Regards to all you brave Celiacs out there.  Let's hope that someday science can find a solution for us to make our lives a little easier.  In the meantime, heaven bless these fabulous companies for providing us with these products.
