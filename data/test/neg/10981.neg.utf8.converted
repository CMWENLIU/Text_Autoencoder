Well i was pumped to get these and wish i never ordered them. The cost of the items was a total ripoff for money reasons and i got them on sale!<br /><br />The cheese is ok but it is like those cheap cheese slices you buy from non brand name stuff.<br />The pretzels hell we all know we can get those super cheap!<br />The meat well is was mild as in taste not hotness. I tasted these and felt like i got ripped off. I wanted to try something new and this was a dud for the sale price i got it at.<br /><br />The last point is there is not much of the product really for the money to. It sure looks like alot at first glance but that is cause half the package is hollow and nothing in it. This felt like smoke and mirrors. I recommend this to people that find them dirt cheap and on a budget type product. If you want to spend more money on better names look somewhere else this this product here. It was fine tasting just not even close to being worth the cost i paid even when it was on sale..<br /><br />I never tried there other products but after this product i will never bother trying another product from them.
