I really wanted to like this, I don't like the regular Skinny Girl Margareta, but then again I usually only like flavored margaritas. I love peach so I thought it would be perfect. First off the bottle is very hard to open, once I got it open and poured a glass the cap would not screw back on tight, so that's not good. It smells great, very peachy, but this taste has a bite. Almost like drinking a peach scented cleaning product. I love Bethany, I love her show but I don't think I'm going to like her Skinny Girl drinks, bummer.
