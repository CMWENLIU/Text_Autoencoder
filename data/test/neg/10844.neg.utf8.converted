BUYER BEWARE! This caused severe intestinal bleeding and an inflamed stomach lining in two of my toy poodles who had to be taken emergency, to my nearest animal hospital! The vet bill cost me $1,200 for a $25 6 pack of death strips! I have the remaining 5 packs that are sealed and was going to return them to amazon, but they don't accept edibles..<br /><br />I always buy Mellow Mut and wanted to give these a try. I don't know what possessed me to switch, but I'm so sorry I did!!! They seemed a bit rough, like an old piece of leather, very coarse, not the usual kind of texture my dogs have been used to. I didn't think much of it at first, because they eat these types of treats all the time and they are supposed to be the ''nautral choice'' only healthful, not harmful! But, I never knew the damage they would cost my dogs. They began to become very listless after digestion, severe bloody vomit and explosive, watery diarrhea with blood followed, almost to the point of shock!!! I just got home from a long night at the hospital with them and they are in a very delicate state and still not in the clear. I have to return with them if the vomiting continues for futher investagation!<br /><br />I don't know what to expect in the next couple of hours! They are on very strong medications and must follow a very bland diet for three weeks that is, if no more complications arise! I pray my babies make a full recovery! I urged amazon to pull these off the website, before this tragedy occurs with another innocent life! They are poison for dogs, maybe this batch was just the contaminated one? Either way, you don't want to take that chance with your beloved pooch! Please stay away! I don't even care if I lost my money on this order, you can't put a price on your best friend! I just want everyone's dogs to be safe! Vitality brand dog strips are toxic!!!!<br /><br />P.S. I just found out Mellow Mut and Vitality dog chews are made in China and manufactured by the same company Dogswell! I will never EVER purchase their products again! I'm reporting them to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration!
