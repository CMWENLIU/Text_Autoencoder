Well I have dogs that have figured out that if they run real fast<br />they are thru the shock zone so fast that it doesn't bother them at all.<br /><br />I've spent $800 -1000 bucks on various "Electric" fencing devices..<br />NOTHING works. Even a old fashioned 100mile power electric fence.<br /><br />This spring Ill put in a real fence with buried wire mesh in the ground to keep them from digging out.
