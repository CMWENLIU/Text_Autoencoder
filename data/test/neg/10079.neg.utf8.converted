I bought this coffee after reading other reviews.  I thought "pumpkin spice", yum!  Something similar to the taste of a pumpkin pie or coffee and pumpkin pie.  WRONG!!!!  This doesn't even taste like coffee!  I shook the K-cup around prior to putting it in my Keurig machine, so as to make sure that the hot water would run through all of the coffee beans or flakes or whatever you call the chopped up coffee bean.  Fresh, clean, cold filtered water, a little pure cane sugar and a small individual serving of coffeemate (the liquid kind).  It smells like coffee, it looks like coffee, but it tastes like hot, almost coffee flavored water.  I am so disappointed. I will never buy Timothy's Perfectly Pumpkin again!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0KG5K">Timothy's World Coffee K-cups Perfectly Pumpkin for Keurig Brewers, 24 Count Box</a><br />I've gone through half of the box and there's no improvement in taste.  I will try again with another brand.
