I recently bought "Barney Butter Almond Butter 90 Calorie Snack" and loved it. However, I found the size to be a bit too small and found myself eating TWO as snacks.<br /><br />I decided to try Justin's Almond Butter due to the size and fact it's organic.<br /><br />The taste and consistency are pretty disappointing - bland, tasteless and somewhat "watery."<br /><br />Once I finish these 30 packs (eeek!) I'm going back to Barney brand, which is far more satisfying.  I regret buying 3 boxes of this stuff.  :-(
