My wife and I have purchased J. LeBlanc Champagne vinegar from other suppliers on the net and become great fans of it. So, when my usual supplier had no stock, I ordered the product from Touch of Europe, who were a dollar or so more expensive, but who had stock. When the vinegar arrived, it was not the white wine colour of previous bottles I had bought, but brown - rather like cider vinegar. The taste was awful - not at all what we had gotten to expect. So I returned it to Touch of Europe, saying that, based on my experience with this vinegar, their product tasted bad and was probably "off". To cut a long complaining consumer saga short, the company has continued to insist that there is nothing wrong with the product they supplied.  (Whatever happened to "the customer is always right"?). And the bottom line, after multiple e-mails and phone calls, is that they have now agreed to refund me - but I have to bear the shipping costs of the return, which was around $8.95.  I have previously found the J. LeBlanc Champagne vinegar to be an excellent product. The product supplied by Touch of Europe was unacceptable, and when I returned it, I was not dealt with the way customers ought to be treated.
