I got these bars at a local organic grocery store and they were great, but the box I bought here wasn't nearly as good. It seemed like I got the bottom of the barrel of some almond shavings and barely any cherry. Basically a boring dark chocolate bar... and they are expensive. I wrote to the company to help them with feedback and they didn't reply for a week and they expect me to mail the bars back. I will if I get time, but that is a hassle.
