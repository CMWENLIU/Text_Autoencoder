I purchased six different varieties of spices from this company.  Four of them were acceptable and two were not.  This one was one of the ones that I wish I had not purchased.  The price is much lower than the gourmet salts you can buy on Amazon, but the true cost of a product depends on the value you receive from it.  This smoked salt smells exactly like liquid smoke.  It you like that aroma, you will probably like this salt.  The salt arrived too moist, as if it had been in a humid environment, but it was easily broken up.  I had hoped to use this as a table condiment, but felt it detracted from the food rather than enhancing it.  I then tried it while cooking and felt it fell short there as well.  I ended up trashing it, thereby making it the most expensive salt I had ever purchased.<br /><br />I love the Artisan smoked salts I have purchased on Amazon and intend to buy several other varieties of that brand.  While initially more expensive, I can wholeheartedly recommend that brand.  Sadly, I cannot recommend the Marshalls Creek brand.
