I'm extremely disappointed with these berries.  I gave them a 1 star, however, if I was allowed I wouldn't have given any stars.  I usually get Heaven Mountain berries and thought I would try these because they can be included as part of a free shipping order.  Big mistake on my part.  These berries are dry and brittle and have a slightly bitter taste.  The others that I usually get (heaven ones) are moister plumper and have a sweeter flavor.  Do yourself a favor and get something other than these.  You can get the Heaven Mountain ones from a partner company with Amazon - Vitacost.  It would be nice if they were listed here.  Anyway, be forewarned.<br /><br />Cheers
