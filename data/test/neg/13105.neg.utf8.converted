This has to be some of the worst tasting tea I have ever tried.  It leaves my tongue with a somewhat raw feeling.  The flavors must be all artificial and not natural,and there really isn't much of any flavor that can be tasted.  If someone handed you a cup of tea it would be pretty hard to tell the flavor.  Don't waste your money on this.  You can get much better tea at Walmart that cost a lot less.  The box the tea comes in is very cheap, and relly isn't worth anything.<br />Jim
