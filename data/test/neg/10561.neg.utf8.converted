I bought this and tried it twice. This tastes like someone added cocoa to grass clippings. It is that awful.  GNC has some very good tasting natural products I would recommend first. Optimum nutrition lean shake and Myoplex are good options for tasty protein (whey) fiber, and vitamins.<br /><br />You aren't going to diet long if your meals taste like this. It is torture.  2 stars for healthy content, 0 stars for drinkability (and I have tried some pretty bland health stuff).  Save some money, just eat some grass and raw eggs.
