I bought this for my husband for Father's Day. My 3 year old son and I were looking at Amazon golf gift baskets, and we decided on this one. Upon arrival the bag all this came in was crushed. The bucket of golf balls is actually two big paperboard cut-outs that are stuck to the front and back of a regular gift bag with tape. I thought it was a bag designed to look like a pail of golf balls...no.<br /><br />As for the items that came in this...not worth the $30. Some pasteurized cheddar cheese 'flavor', some Cajun mix, which I thought hubby would enjoy, but it was crushed, so it was more like Cajun crumbs. Some crackers, biscotti, sub-par coffee, and dry cookies. Overall, I say PASS. We were able to laugh about it and say 'It's the thought that counts!'...but really, this was just bad.
