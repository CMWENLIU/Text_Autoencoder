We bought these for a healthy snack, and they are very healthy.  The issue is that the wasabi seasoning is not evenly coated. So, you'll get some with no coating and then a few with tons of coating and it is incredibly strong.  My husband eats pretty much anything and he won't even eat these...what a disappointment.
