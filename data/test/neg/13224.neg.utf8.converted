When I first got this I was all excited to try it so I mixed some up according to the directions and gave it a whirl. Even if your able to get past the horrible taste the texture was even worse, gritty and chunky. I tried mixing it in a blender and letting it sit in the refrigerator over night and nothing seemed to help. I gave up on it after that.
