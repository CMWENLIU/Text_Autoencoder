I ordered hundreds of dollars from amazons gift  and sent to friends and relatives and did not know that the  receiver is not allowed to know the senders name and as a result all of them dumped these hard earn dollars of mine in the sewer and all because of the politically correct thing. NOw me the sender and the receiver felt bad and i will not forget these throwing hundreds of dollars of my hard earn cash into sending amazon gifts again.
