The truffle "essence" on the label is a synthetic compound manufactured in a laboratory to mimic the smell of real truffles. If that is what you want, cool. But you should know what you are really buying. This is really more of a truffle perfume. No actual truffles were used to make this product. I find the deceptive labeling on this product to be very offensive. I wouldn't buy it just because of that.<br /><br />I am getting negative comments from someone that are rather interesting. They say they called Urbani a different company, and that Urbani told them that their product is made with real truffles and therefore my review is wrong. Here is the direct quote from the person: "I actually contacted Urbani, who is one of the leading purveyors of truffles. They assured me that their truffle oils are pure natural products derived only from truffles."<br /><br />First of all, La Tourangelle and Urbani are different companies and totally unaffiliated. So it is entirely irrelevant what Urbani said about their product. Second, I'm not sure I would believe what a salesperson tells me to begin with.<br /><br />As to the person's claim that the ingredients list for La Tourangelle says extract--it used to say aroma. I find it very suspicious that the label changed from saying aroma to extract. It seemed obvious to me something funny was going on so I just called the Food and Drug Administration and the customer service representative specifically told me that the FDA "has never defined extract." In other words, the FDA has not legally said this is what an extract is so anything can legally be called an extract, including chemicals synthetically manufactured in a laboratory that did not come from the actual product. So if a company calls something an extract when it is not, the FDA has no ability to do anything about it. So a regular person like you or I may believe that an extract is something made from the actual product, but the FDA has never defined it as such.  I can mix two chemicals in a laboratory and call them gold extract because extract is not defined.<br /><br />In other words, the company is now back to trying to trick you again by using the term extract knowing that you will believe that means that extract means something actually taken from a real truffle, but it does not mean that at all. Please, anybody with common sense--do you really think that La Tourangelle changed their label to say extract instead of aroma because their manufacturing process has changed or do you think that they just did that because they can legally get away with it and it will trick some people into thinking the product is something it isn't because they know they can do it since there are no laws against that?
