Chicken By-Products, Wheat Gluten, Meat By-Products. NOT FOR MY DOG. The problems with meat by-products are that they may include indigestible or poorly digested parts of the animal (think hair, beaks, hooves, teeth, etc.) and it may include outdated meats from markets. Dogs can handle the outdated meat fine, but the problem is in the packaging. One report I read said that some Styrofoam from meat trays gets inadvertently included with the meat at the dog food factory. It is then very finely ground with the meat, with unknown effects on your pet.<br /><br />Finally, dogs don't digest wheat gluten (a thickening agent). Wheat gluten from China has, in the past, included highly toxic melamine. The source for ingredients isn't on IAMS pet food cans.<br /><br />Sometimes you get far LESS than you pay for. DogFoodAdviser rates canned Iams at 2 out of 5, "Below Average for Canned Dog Food"  at [...]. The price certainly is above average for canned dog food.
