Let me start by stating that I absolutely LOVE Genmai Cha teas, so after reading a couple positive reviews I was extremely excited to order this tea in bulk.  I waited excitedly for my package to arrive, and now I wish for a return to this positive place of hope and excitement.  This tea has been nothing short of disappointing.<br /><br />I've had this tea for over a month now, and have tried adjusting my brewing in many ways, the best I have managed to achieve for flavor is underwhelming.  I love genmai cha for it's smooth baked flavor and scent.  I suppose I've just been lucky in the past to have bought quality teas.  Placing roasted rice in a sub par green tea seems to just produce a tea that goes straight from flavorless to bitter with no happy place in between.<br /><br />If you love green teas, this is one I'd avoid.
