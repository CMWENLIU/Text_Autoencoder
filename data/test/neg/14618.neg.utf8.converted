We moved our family from sugar about three years ago and had settled on Splenda as our sugar substitue.  We use it to sweeten Lipton iced tea which we make in one-gallon containers.  We'd love to move to a sweetner that is all natural and thought this might work.  Yuck! is all I can say for the taste.  We've used about half of one of the bottles and Yuck is the feedback from our entire family and extended family.  The taste starts off kind of sweet but has a really weird aftertaste that just ruins it all.  I haven't tried it in anything else but this will simply not work for us.  We have tried Truvia and it is almost a perfect substitute taste wise, but is still a bit expensive and does contain the sugar alcohol.
