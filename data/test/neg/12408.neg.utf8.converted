I was so excited to see the price drop and finally broke down and bought some. I received it yesterday, Saturday, and couldn't wait to make pancakes for Sunday morning breakfast! I followed exactly what it said and they were the most disgusting pancakes I have ever consumed! It has been 4 hours and I can still taste the horrific after taste and the smell is repulsive. Now they did cook up nicely! Perfect 'pancake consistency' but that first bite... wow! No good!!<br /><br /> I plan to try another recipe this afternoon and will update my review when I have done so. For those of you that really LOVE soy... have at it! Otherwise... Use almond meal.. flaxseed..
