You reckon when the ad says "whole rabbit" you ought get the whole rabbit. I ain't got a head on this critter! My neighbor kids sure love playin with them rabbit heads. If I ain't got a rabbit head fer makin peace with them neighbor kids they prolly gonna come bust up my old ridin tractor. Without my tractor I can't even get up the corner store for no beer. Another thing is I ain't even got any intestines fer sausage makin! How is Easter dinner gonna be any good with no varmint sausages? This thing looks like it coulda been a guinea pig or a chinchilla or somethin. I mean, it tasted pretty damn good with hot sauce, but I reckon I oughta shot my own critter next time around. That or scrape one up off the main road, sure is cheaper. Least they left some bones in there for my ol coonhound to chaw awhile. Mavis gives it four stars but I'm only givin it two on account of no head or nothin to make sausages with. Reckon also if you ain't familiar with rabbit don't be expectin to feed no three grown men on one, ain't enough eatin on em.
