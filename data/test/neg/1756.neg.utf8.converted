The toy is sturdy and well constructed but my Havanese puppy took no time at all to figure out the three games.  Certainly not a brain teaser.  Because there are small pieces the owner must be involved in the game to be sure a puppy doesn't eat them.  My dog much prefers the ball with treats inside that fall out as he noses it around and so do I as it keeps him independently amused for at least 15 minutes.
