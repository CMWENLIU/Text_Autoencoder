These are NOT ODOR FREE bully sticks.  And it's not a slight smell, either.  I could smell these bully sticks before I even opened that box!!!  And when the dogs start chewing them - forget it!!! The smell gets even worse.  To make matters even worse, when I contacted the vendor, they tried to feed me some line about how the bully sticks may have a "slight" odor.  First, there is nothing slight about the odor and second, I did not pay for bully sticks that had a "slight" odor - they advertized and I paid for odor free bully sticks!!!<br /><br />I am totally unsatisfied with the product and the service.
