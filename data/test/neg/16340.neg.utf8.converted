Is MSG really necessary Hidden Valley? I bought a large container from Sams club last year and used up 75% of it. I decided to read the label today (should have read it sooner) and the third ingredient is MSG. Ingredients are labeled in order of the amount in the product, which means this has a lot in it. I will not buy this product or any of their products ever again, and I suggest nobody else does either. We don't need MSG in our products!
