not particularly this brand; i've tried a couple; followed all the suggestions about rinsing away the stinky smell, dry frying a bit to get rid of  excess water, adding your favorite sauce; but there is no amount of onion, garlic, basil, pepper you name it that can rescue this ersatz stuff; think of the worst calamari you've ever hard, real rubber bands, no taste left; this is worse; so rubbery and tasteless that you start to think it might not be food; the no-calorie allure is potent; but you're better off with some real italian pasta if half has much half as often, one glass of good red wine instead of two or three; realize that's the you only go around once idea, but if that's true you don't want to be doing it on rubber bands
