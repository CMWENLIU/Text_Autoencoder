If you do just a little research you will realize two things. 1. Raw Honey will crystallize almost immediately and 2. nearly all retail honey is cut with corn syrup. So if your not buying from the person who is actually tending the bees and they state that they are not heating the honey to get it out of the comb but have a spinner then it is truly raw and not cut with corn syrup. If it's too good to be true then it probably is.
