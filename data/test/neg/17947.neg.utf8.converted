I ordered these for my 29 pound Wheaten Terrier as she munches on them.  This packaged was labeled exactly the same as the previous packages (size).  However, when I received them each chewie was half the size and paper thin.  These were not fit for a very small dog, let alone a medium dog.  I threw them away as I would not take a chance that my dog would choke on them.  I then decided to call the company.  I was told that they were aware of the problem and needed to do something with their quality control.  I ask her where they were made and she told me Mexico. BE WARE.
