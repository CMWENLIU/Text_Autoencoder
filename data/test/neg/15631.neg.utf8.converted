I can't stand aspartame and Splenda because of the chemical aftertaste, but I read good things about stevia and glucose tolerance (search PubMed on NIH's website for stevia), so wanted to give it a try.  I can definitely tell the difference between sugar and Truvia.  It leaves sort of a woody/licorice aftertaste in my mouth, but the taste does not linger as long as the aftertaste from Splenda.  Truvia is not nearly as unpleasant as Splenda, but I think I would prefer tea or coffee unsweetened over sweetened with Truvia.<br /><br />Just to prove that I wasn't being unconsciously biased against Truvia, I asked my husband to brew a pot of coffee, split it equally into two measuring cups, and add 2 teaspoons of sugar to one cup and 1 packet of Truvia to the other.  (In case this seems somewhat arbitrary, Truvia states that 1 packet is equal to about 2 teaspoons of sugar, in sweetness.)  I didn't want down two cups of coffee at once, so I drank several shot glasses of the differently-sweetened coffee.  After several blind taste tests, I could tell which one was Truvia and which one was sugar every time.  Also, the aftertaste seemed to get worse as the coffee cooled.<br /><br />My husband could also tell the difference between Truvia and sugar, but he didn't seem to mind the taste very much.  A friend of ours can't tell the difference between Truvia and sugar at all.  So before you spring for a box (or 6 boxes, on Amazon) of Truvia, as it is fairly expensive compared to Splenda or sugar, you should try a packet or two elsewhere first.<br /><br />As for how sweet it is compared to sugar - it seems plenty sweet to me but I usually don't put a lot of sugar in my drinks.  Some suggestions to mitigate the aftertaste are:  put it in a hot drink (and drink it while it's hot), or put it in a drink with lots of other flavors to mask it, like strong chai (I could still taste it through the chai, but it's not as bad), or use half sugar and half Truvia.
