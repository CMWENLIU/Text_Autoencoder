My cat devoured this food!  But there comes a time when that which is devoured...  Must be de-devoured....  If you know what I'm sellin...  I live in a larger 1bedroom apt. and she lit the entire 930 sq feet up with a stench that would have a wet nurse running out of the house...  She has never, nor has any baby ever let this kind of raunch out of its body.  I just can't take it!  Awful!  The entire apartment gets raunched, funktified.<br />Currently, she's looking up at me with these innocent eyes, and in my head I hear in a Steve Erkel voice "Did I do that!?"
