Wilton Patterned Sugar Sheets Edible Decorating Paper -<br />Absolutely infuriated by this product. I was so excited to find the Damask pattern that exactly matched the decorations we chose for my daughter's Sweet 16 Masquerade Ball. Plus I knew I was going to have so much to do, that the sheets seemed the the perfect thing to make a beautiful cake with not much effort. I decided to simply wrap the outside of each tier and pipe a border, place a few fondant masques, and call it a day. Buying that many sheets was expensive, but I thought it would be worth it. The plan seemed to have worked perfectly UNTIL I opened the cake carriers at the banquet hall the next day to do the final stack and pipe the bottom borders. The sheets had evidently absorbed moisture from the buttercream and were all bubbled up and buckled over the entire cake. Any attempt to press them back into place resulted in the sheets sticking to my fingers and shredding away from the cake. Thankfully, the hall was dim and I had made extra fondant masques, so I was able to cover most of the damage. BUT, this was supposed to be the centerpiece of the banquet table! It ended up being relegated to a corner table, so that the worst damage was blocked from view by the wall. I don't make my living making cakes, but I have been doing it for over 30 years, so to have to present such disappointment at my own daughter's Sweet 16 party made me sick! Shame on you Wilton for producing such a shabby product!
