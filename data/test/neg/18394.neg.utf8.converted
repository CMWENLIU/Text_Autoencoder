We are a foodie family, and we love truffle salt.<br /><br />We have a jar of this truffle salt and a jar of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5SGI4">Casina Rossa Truffle and Salt by Nicola de Laurentiis - 3.5 oz.</a> in the cupboard at all times.  We go through the Casina Rossa at a 4 to 1 pace, and only because I use the FungusAmongUs brand in heavier stews where it's indelicacies will not be noticed.  I wouldn't even consider the brand for a finishing salt on tomatoes or mild cheeses.<br /><br />If Casina Rossa is a well-mannered Persian housecat, FungusAmongUs is a burr-covered, hacking Maine Coon.  I'd adopt both, but would love them differently.
