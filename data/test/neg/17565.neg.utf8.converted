Very unhappy with texture. Also very sad to see the Ezekiel brand jump on the soy bandwagon, this makes me question the integrity of there products.<br /><br />If you believe soy is good for you then read " The Whole Soy truth" The Japanese eat mostly fermented soy which is ok in small amounts and Tofu is also eaten in small amounts. They also eat a much more healthy diet overall which can counter the negative effects of the small quantities of tofu they do eat.
