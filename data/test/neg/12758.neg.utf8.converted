The product description says: "Plantation 12X 15 Oz Blackstrap Molasses Unsl Organic Blackstrap Molasses."<br /><br />The problem is the item is not organic. Now I'm stuck with a whole case. I contacted Bangalla Organic and they insisted the case was organic despite not saying so on the label. They claimed they called the manufacturer to verify.<br /><br />The reality is that the Plantation molasses that is certified specifically says "certified by the Quality Assurance Internation(QAI.)" There is no certification on these bottles.<br /><br />It find it hilarious that the product description also says "(Note: This Product Description Is Informational Only. Always Check The Actual Product Label In Your Possession For The Most Accurate Ingredient Information."<br /><br />Well, that's not possible to do beforehand if you're buying online. That's why the product description and the word of the seller is so crucial.<br /><br />I will never buy from this company again.  I'm most concerned that they lied to me directly and claimed it's organic with no evidence/certification to support their claim.
