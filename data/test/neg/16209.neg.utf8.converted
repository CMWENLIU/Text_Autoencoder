I am disappointed with the sorgham from Barry Farms! It has very little sorgham flavor to it. In fact, my daughter said that it tastes more like syrup that you would buy at the grocery store and I tend to agree. Sorgham has a dark brown color and you can't see through it even when you only have a teaspoon full of it. The Barry Farm product is clear enough that you can see through it when you pour it into a pint bottle....<br /><br />Won't be buying any more....<br /><br />M. Roberts<br />Loveland, Co
