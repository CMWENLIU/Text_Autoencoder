This product is not always available, and it is favorite in our family. We have been buying more items from Amazon and looked this up. Wow. When it is available, the most expensive 24 can package is 7.98. $19 plus shipping is silly. I'm glad someone is making money in this economy. But they won't be making it from our family.
