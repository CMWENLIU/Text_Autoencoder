My family and I have been drinking soy and rice milk for a number of years and this machine seemed to be a good solution as I wanted to cut down on our grocery bill. After learning more about the problems with tetra-pak containers, I was completely turned off.<br /><br />I purchased the "Elegant" Soyabella and wanted to share my own personal experience. I was initially excited to receive my machine and begin making my first batch of milk. Overall, I found the Soyabella to be very problematic.<br /><br />I read the manual and followed the instructions carefully but when I made my first batch of milk it continued to boil over leaving my counter a sticky mess. After 3 unsuccessful attempts, I did finally get it to complete a batch of milk where I encountered even more undesirable results.<br /><br />To begin with, the milk screen was very difficult to remove as the handle on the bottom is so small that you have no hope in ever getting a finger underneath the handle let alone actually grabbing it to take off the cup. The milk turned out quite pulpy as the milk screen holes are quite large and it didn't grind the beans completely.<br /><br />When I cleaned my machine I found that I had to be extra cautious as the blade is very sharp. Although it is an advertised benefit, I found that having the heater in the base of the milk jug was more of a pain as when the jug has milk in it, it is quite heavy. I also found it difficult to clean because the mess from boiling over each time created a hot sticky mess all over the machine. The jug contains a lot of electrical stuff and obviously it is not made to get wet but in order to clean, it is nearly impossible and time consuming.<br /><br />I realized my hour of efforts yielded less than 1 quart of milk. I found the manual very vague and surely not helpful. I tried making "rice paste" expecting to get rice milk and let's just say, I am not even going to go there!!<br /><br />Thinking that my errors where a result of my own mistakes, I did some research online and found that I was not alone. To my relief many others have experience similar problems. I returned my machine and although discouraged about making home made milk, my continued research led me to buy the new SoyQuick Premier. I am completely amazed by the difference between the two machines. I am not going to go into details but I highly recommend the SoyQuick Premier for anyone looking to make trouble free milks. Here is the link: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EUA0V4">SoyQuick Premier Milk Maker 930P</a> I have already posted a review as I am really impressed.<br /><br />To summarize; I would not recommend buying the Soyabella at all. I hope that my review and experience will save others a lot of time, effort and the extra money to ship back your Soyabella.
