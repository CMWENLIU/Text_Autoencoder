I purchased this item in good faith from an Amazon seller thinking I would be getting a reasonable savings. The outrageous shipping charges of $29.00 plus a super inflated price put the 10 carton purchase up to $99.00. Therefore, each 1 liter cost me $9.99 and I later found that I could buy a liter at a local grocery store for $3.99! $40 locally or $99 from this seller.....which looks like a bargain!<br />D
