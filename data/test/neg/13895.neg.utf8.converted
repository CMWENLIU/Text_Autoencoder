The first time I purchased from them, I was very disappointed in the method. I was apprehensive about placing due to the fact that I was writing a card online and I wasn't sure it'd get picked up. It didn't, and the receiver got the beautiful flowers and spent all day trying to figure out who they were from. She called the company and they said the note was "deliberately" left blank which is not true at all. I was left loving the flowers but not happy with the method or seller.<br /><br />That being said, I was contacted by the company and I now give them a 5 star rating for their efforts in making my experience better. I would absolutely, positively order from them again. And I appreciate them contacting me. I have placed another order and will continue to do so.<br /><br />Thank you Pro Flowers @ Amazon!<br /><br />Update...3/15/12<br /><br />They did indeed place another order for me, which was delivered on Tuesday as planned. And guess what? The receiver called me, after calling a handful of others, because again...the card message did not get delivered.<br /><br />I will NOT be using them again.
