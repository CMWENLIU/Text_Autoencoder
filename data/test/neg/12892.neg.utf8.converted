I was disappointed by the taste of this coffee. The first hint came when I opened the package and didn't get the usual great aroma that I would expect from good coffee. Then I brewed my first batch, and it was a big let-down. This is the kind of coffee that people, unfortunately, think of when they think of decaf: weak and lacking in flavor. I know it's hard to find good quality water-process decaf coffees, but Caribou, for example, is a much better choice.
