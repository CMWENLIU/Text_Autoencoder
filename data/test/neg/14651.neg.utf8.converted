I received a package of Bob's Extra Thick Rolled Oats -- not what I ordered and not what was pictured on the seller's page.  This one is made in a facility that processes wheat.  It has a little sticker attached (covering the bar code) that includes the words "Gluten Free", but am I to believe that?  I wasn't born yesterday!  Back it goes...  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O8MJO2">Bob's Red Mill, Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Gluten Free, 2 lbs (907 g)</a>
