The honey is great, but I have ordered this product 4 times from Amazon and only one made it in one piece. This is the most incompetent packing job I have ever seen! I even called once and told the person that answered the phone to make sure it is packed in a 6 X 6 X 6 box in an upright position with the lid taped around the perimeter with packing tape.<br />He said he would notify the shipping dept. It arrived in one of the same boxes they use for books with an air pillow on top of the jar. The jar was lying in the bottom of the box with the lid off and honey everywhere!<br /><br /> Amazon needs to have a special training class on packing for the people that work in the shipping department(s)!
