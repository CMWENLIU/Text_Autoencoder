Truly Indian Kashmiri Palak Paneer, 15.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)<br /><br />This is a non-review of "Truly Indian Kashmiri Palak Paneer" as I did not receive that item. Instead, I was sent "Truly Indian Delhi Dal Makhani," which turned out to be excellent; if I get the time, I'll write a review for that.<br /><br />As of this writing, there are two reviews for Palak Paneer, and neither of us received the item ordered--way to go, shippers!<br /><br />So, check out the link below for a tasty dish, but be forewarned; if you chow down a whole can of this stuff, you will have consumed a whole day's ration of salt!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018QCJ5Y">Truly Indian Delhi Dal Makhani, 15.8 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>
