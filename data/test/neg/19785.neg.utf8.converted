If these bars are made in China, do we really know what is in them?  These bars are high in sugar and hard as a rock.  Chinese edibles have already poisoned babies and pets.  I'm not taking a risk with my family.  Why doesn't Amazon disclose country of manufacture?  Why doesn't the company disclose country of manufacture on their website?  Shame on Mrs Mays.
