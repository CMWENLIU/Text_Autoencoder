Our son has a ton of allergies, but these Gummy Bears by YummyEarth are an absolute favorite of his.  We couldn't be any more grateful for awesome companies like YummyEarth that make these products.  Personally, they taste way better than the standard gummy bears that you buy from the grocery store.  An absolutely fantastic product.  I have no beaf with the product itself, but...<br /><br />As so many other have pointed out, this product is not well handled at all either at the warehouse or during shipping.  The bags that we received were all just globs of goop.  Nowhere did we see any cute bears that taste yummy.  This really makes me question any product that we order from Amazon now.  I don't think I will be buying any more food products from Amazon.
