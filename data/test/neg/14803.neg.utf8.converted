Too much sugar is added to the dried mango. It doesn't taske like mango. And it is too soft.<br /><br />The containers are too flimsy. Half of my 6 containers were broken when arrived, exposing the mango to air. The shipping box is intact. Just the mango containers; they are no good.<br /><br />The mango from Brand Philippine is much better.
