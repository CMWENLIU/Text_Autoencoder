The first two orders that came from Thailand were fine. Now there are some dented cans, nasty-tasting blend of grease and water. Even the inside of the cans look differently lined than before. Who knows if they are BPA-free as claimed? I'm cancelling my subscription. I will have a hard time trusting this brand again.<br /><br />UPDATE: Nov. 5, 2011. I forgot about a pending order. This time it was from Thailand with bubble wrap between the cans, no dents and much better quality.
