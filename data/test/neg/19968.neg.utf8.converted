First line of "product features" states:<br /><br />"contains one can each of Bird in Hand, Cookie Jar, Game Day Chili, Mull Over This, Peace of Pie and Roast to Toast tins"<br /><br />This line is INCORRECT.<br /><br />The 4th line is correct:<br /><br />"Six tins (1 tin each of chile pepper (mild), coriander, cumin, fennel seed, ginger & turmeric) come in a handsome box and stylish belly band."<br /><br />Since the product is not returnable, don't make the same error I did!<br /><br />Note to AMAZON: I love your service and order from you often, but I was very disappointed with the misleading product features. PLEASE CORRECT THIS. I am out $32+ dollars.
