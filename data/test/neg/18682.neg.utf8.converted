I listened to a couple of friends that raved about this item.... wrong move. I love a very strong, bold cup of coffee. Increased bitterness is OK, if it is balanced by the flavor. This item isn't it. It was perhaps the most middle of the road, marginal cup I've had in a long time. Little taste, marginally robust, and lots of caffeine. I won't ever buy it again. The Coffee People Black Tiger is a much better product. I also enjoy Emeril's Big Easy Bold....long before this slack waste of time. Save yourself drinking a marginal cup of coffee and try something else.
