I do my best to be a discriminating shopper, which can be a challenge when shopping on line. I love tea (especially Darjeeling), and regularly look for good quality and value. For a moment, I thought I was on to something with "China Mist" a quality tea at a bargain price........... but then, the devil is in the details. First, it was the elaborate review which was obviously written by a publicist of some kind, overflowing with hyperbole and product history. No big deal, but kind of annoying when it's the only review available. The clincher, though, is the shipping charges......$6.00 worth of tea with a $7.95 shipping charge. See ya.
