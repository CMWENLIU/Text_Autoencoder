This is my fourth AeroGarden kit and I am very disappointed in the quality of the kit. Only 4 of the seed pods have sprouted, leaving 3 not growing. The sprouting plants, 2 types of basil, 1 dill, and 1 mint, are growing very slowly and are very spindly<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI61OQ">AeroGarden 0001-00Z Gourmet Herb Seed Kit</a>.  We always clean out our Aerogarden before planting a new kit. I bought this in August and I am going do have to remove the plants early, and start in again.  I think this is an out-of-date kit.  I would not recommend this product.
