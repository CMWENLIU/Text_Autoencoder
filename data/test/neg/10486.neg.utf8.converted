I bought this Fresh Whole Rabbit for my stuffed rabbit Ella Weez and she was not pleased. The price was right, but Ella found it to be in bad taste. After a little coercing I got her to accept it and let it sleep in the bed with us. The only problem is that it didn't stay as "fresh" as I thought. We had to toss it out of the bed after a few days, and get new sheets.
