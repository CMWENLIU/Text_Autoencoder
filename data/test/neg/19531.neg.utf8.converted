This candy comes with a warning on it that it will cause stomach discomfort and has laxative effects and suggests to have only 8 beans at one time, but on the back the suggested serving size is half of the bag... After consuming half of the small bag, like the suggested serving size index I was bloated and in pain for hours. This was the worse candy I have ever tried and I am amazed the FDA has not pulled it off the market yet... Do not buy
