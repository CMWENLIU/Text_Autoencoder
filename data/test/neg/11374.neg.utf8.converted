Having explored the world of Japanese tea for several years, I'm always keen to find new companies and explore their tea and teaware. Serendipitea was not a good choice sadly,(especially given the fact that they (Amazon) do not accept any returns. Tea arrived in a VERY cheap cellophane package that had been loosely sealed with a heat press to  melt the plastic and a plastic sticker folded over the top which did little to keep the tea from spilling out. Accordingly, the tea had a STRONG plastic odor and had lost any semblance of its essential tea oils. To be fair, this was likely a high quality Gyokuro in another life(a yame perhaps?) Unfortunatley, I'll never know as the pathetic packaging ruined its flavor. I've tossed it in the dust bin and relegated it to experience. (I wouldn't even give these pathetic "sweepings" to an indigent, much less good company) Stay far away from their teas (their kukicha is packaged poorly as well and has little flavor) Consider Charaku and Rishi as they are excellent sources of quality gyokuro and sencha teas. They use a high quality foil lined resealable pouch that does not impart any plastic odor or cause the tea to lose essential oils.
