I'm sitting here munching on these and they are delicious. However I am giving one star because this price is more than double what you should be paying. I bought a package last night at Trader Joe's for $3. At this pricing they're charging over $6 a pack!<br /><br />Just go to TJ's to get your dried mango goodness.
