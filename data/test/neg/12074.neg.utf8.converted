Purchased this same product from a different seller 3 months ago. The first product came in a box and was a bright green color, as matcha should be. This product that was shipped to me recently was listed as matcha, but was a dull olive green color, like fermented tea. It tasted terrible and did not mix well like the original matcha I purchased. Very disappointed. I used the same link to purchase the second batch, but a product from Taiwan was shipped and was completly different from the first.
