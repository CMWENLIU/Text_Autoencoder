I really wanted to love these. I waited so long to try them because of all the Thinkfruit varieties, this is the most expensive one. While most of the Thinkfruit varieties only have sugar, maybe a little oil, and/or "natural flavors" added, this blueberry variety has malic acid added. I don't know if this is causing the problem for me but the blueberries tasted "off" to me. Nothing like a dried blueberry. I looked it up and (simplified), malic acid provides a tart flavor and that's not what I'm tasting. I'm not tasting blueberry either.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving this one star is because I can stand them if I rinse them or soak them in something before using them for baking or consuming. Once rinsed and soaked, they taste much better, regardless of what I had to soak them in. (water, juice, amaretto)<br /><br />The best variety of all of the Thinkfruit flavors is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UZX06Y">Thinkfruit Whole Cranberries , 1.5 Ounce Bags (Pack of 10)</a> in my opinion. They taste just like what you'd expect a dried cranberry to taste like.
