These treats can create a very serious problem.  I just opened the new bag I bought from Amazon and gave one to each of my three dogs and TWO OF THEM GOT THEM STUCK IN THEIR THROATS.  Both were choking and both had to have them pried out of their mouths by my husband and I.  Very scary.  I have thrown them out.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE BUY THESE.  Based on their shape, size and the fact that when they get wet they get sticky, they can choke your dog.  DON'T BUY THESE. PERIOD.
