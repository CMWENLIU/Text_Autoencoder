Tasty, but arrived crushed. No, I did not order other heavy things with this item, it was the only thing in there, yet I opened the box to find the corn in several pieces in the bag. It looked like it was the candy corn no one wanted to buy after Halloween, if you know what i mean. There was not one perfect looking corn in there. For me, this was a huge bust because I was going to make candy corn cupcakes for Halloween, and these were going to be the decoration on top. 2 stars though because it tastes good. Not the best ive ever tasted, but it makes for a good snack. Again though, it really was disappointing for all of them to be crushed. I'll probably just take the 4 mile drive to buy some for a bit cheaper next time. Those I know won't be crumbled.
