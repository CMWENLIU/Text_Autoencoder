Love twix and since I can never really find it in my area I thought I would buy it from Amazon. Great price for a box of 24 the only gripe I have is that the expiration date is right around the corner - meaning I have to start eating these things NOW!!! I would have appreciated at least a year expiration time but I only have close to 30 days to eat 24 bars. I like to eat my candy in a casual setting not in a rushed setting - but we live and learn. I took three stars away for that reason and for the reason below.<br /><br />UPDATE: I contacted the seller over 3 weeks ago to complain about the expiration dates and they have not returned my emails or even let me know they were concerned. They sell OLD STOCK that is expiring soon. I would not advise to buy from them and I would and will not buy from them at all again.
