I tried both the "Health" and the "Mana". Both were awful in taste and neither had any discernable effect on my energy levels. I bought them for their appearance as a fun gift for my LAN group. One of the bottles had leaked in the box and the smell alone should have warned me to not drink it. But live and learn. The one benefit I got out of the purchase was that the bottles can be filled with water and food coloring to use as game props or displays. They are aesthetically pleasing to the eye when you hang them in a window with the different colors catching the daylight.
