I bought three boxes of this. The first package I made, the cupcakes fell in the center and I followed the directions exactly. I chalked it up to a fluke and a few months later made another box. They didn't fall this time, but the consistency was just not right...crunchy. I threw the third box away and won't buy again. Keep in mind, I usually make things from scratch and am an experienced baker so I don't think the error was on my end, maybe the packages were old.
