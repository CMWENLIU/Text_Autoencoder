So sorry, I have had every chocolate sugar free syrup made, and this was by far the worst I have tried.  I purchased it because it was cheaper than the others, but there was a good reason it was such a good deal.  The consistency was not like a normal chocolate syrup, it came out in big plops.  It was a very strange color, nowhere near a dark brown like any other syrup.  Not that the color has anything to do with it, but when you are dealing with eliminating sugar, all the senses need to be pleased.  To top it all off, it molded very quickly.  I would not recommend this to anyone, even the no name sugar free chocolate syrup at WalMart is better than this....
