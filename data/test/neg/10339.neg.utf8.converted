Candy was stale the blow pop was soft and the candy was not from the seventies that I lived in.  We had no sour patch kids or Bublisious that was 80's thuff, I rember rain-blo and long sticks or gum or apple super bubble.  I only paid $6.99 at cracker barrel and that was a rip off.  3 tiny pixi stixx, 3 pc gum a pack of gum and 2 lolie pops at 2 other pc of gum and a 1 flavor lick a my stick.  always wondered what would be in one of these boxes now I know.  You will be very disappointed if you invest the money for maybe $1.50 worth of stale candy.
