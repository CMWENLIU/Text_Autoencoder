I seriously DOUBT that this California tomato packer exports to Italy, so WHY is there Italian on the can?? To FOOL THE CONSUMER..no other reason.<br /><br />These are so-so tomatoes if they were priced like Hunt's..but they're 3 times the price and they are NOT REAL SAN MARZANO TOMATOES!!<br /><br />Buyer BEWARE!!!!!!
