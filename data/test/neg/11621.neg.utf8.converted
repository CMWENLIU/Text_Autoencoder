After reading the many positive reviews, I suspect that the 4 pounds I received is just too old (as a few other recent reviewers have experienced), but there is no way to tell how old it is as there is no "Best by" date on the container.  There is also no seal to maintain freshness other than the plastic lid.  Preparing the kernels stovetop and with a Nordic Ware microwave popper yielded the same results: small, not very fluffy and fairly tough popcorn.
