I love this tea, and had placed a standing order for the 3-pack of 4.5 ounce tins.  Imagine my surprise when the last shipment came in and the amount of tea in each tin was reduced by a full ounce (from 4.5 to 3.5), for the same price.  There was no notification of this change, and I only figured it out because I still had a couple of the older tins on hand.  To Amazon's credit, they did issue a refund.  Still, I am not pleased with what happened.
