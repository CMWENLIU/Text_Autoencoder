I bought these directly from their website. They smell awful.  Also my dogs eat them way too fast.  I usually buy bully sticks at my dog's breeder (which do not smell and last a lot longer than these) but they have been out of them so I decided to try to find some online.  As soon as I opened the bag the smell was disgusting! I do not understand how they can say these are odor free.
