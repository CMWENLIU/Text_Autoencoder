I love Brazil nuts. I think I am a connoisseur of a Brazil nuts. I like them fresh and crunch. Unfortunately, these nuts tend to be expensive so I shop around for the best price. I bought 2 packages of nuts from this company and 3 packages from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CD2T4U">NOW Foods Brazil Nuts, Raw, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> (Pack of 3) to compare them. I tried NOW Foods Nuts first. They were delightful!<br /><br />Then I opened this product. The nuts looked the same, actually were a bit more cleaned than the other company's. However, there was no flavor to them. I couldn't understand what was wrong. I kept tasking them trying to figure out the difference and then I started finding STALE NUTS in this product. Unfortunately, I opened the both packages (not at the same time) and emptied them into a special canister where I keep the nuts. So, I can't return them. What a waste! I spent $21.98 for the nuts that are ROTTEN and SPOILED. I thought maybe I have gotten one bad package. But the second package was just as bad. There is NOTHING worse in the culinary world than chewing on a nut and realizing that it's spoiled. It takes 3 teeth brushing to get rid of that awful taste!<br /><br />So, if you want good Brazil nuts, do not buy these! Buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CD2T4U">NOW Foods Brazil Nuts, Raw, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> I've bought from them 5 times and each times nuts are fresh and tasty, just like they are supposed to be. Now, if only they didn't have so many calories... :)
