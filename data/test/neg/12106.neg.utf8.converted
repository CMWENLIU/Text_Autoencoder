I used to buy these regularly at BJs in a multi pack box, but then they stopped carrying SB products. The chocolate peanut butter ones were always my favorite. I haven't been able to find them for a long time so when I saw them on Amazon, I jumped on them:) Eagerly awaiting their delivery.<br /><br />I hope they travel well, as when I purchased a box of Atkins bars, the chocolate looked as if it had been left in too high a temperature and was all discolored.<br /><br />I will update the review when they arrive.<br /><br />Jan 18, 2012<br /><br />They just arrived today, and I'm sooooo disappointed. They're not at all as I remember. Left a weird aftertaste in my mouth. They're not made by Kraft anymore, either. Even the texture is different. They used to be nice and crispy, but now they're just - odd.<br /><br />I have 39 more of these to go:(
