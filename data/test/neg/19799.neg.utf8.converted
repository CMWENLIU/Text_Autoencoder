I bought these chocolate frogs as part of a surprise gift for someone and needless to say I am very disappointed in the size of the chocolate frogs. Way too small! Even for the price of both packs together, it should have been a third of the listing price because they are so small. I didn't get to open the packaging yet to see what the cards inside look like because it's a gift for someone else. I'd rather have waited to go to the HP Theme park and purchased a chocolate frog from there. The shipping charge was over priced considering the packages were not that heavy. Overall very displeased.
