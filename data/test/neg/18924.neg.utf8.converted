I was so surprised to see how tiny this basket is!!  I think it may be 12in height and 12in in length.  It looks a $15 gift basket and I don't even think the exact items or basket is used! I can see in this picture that the basket is "taller." I was very disappointed and I am so embarrassed to give this as a gift. I can't believe I paid $40 for it.  I'll probably go to Costco/ Sams for a better quality basket.
