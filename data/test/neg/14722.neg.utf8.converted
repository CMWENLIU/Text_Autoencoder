ALMOST ALL Hershey Miniatures are now made in Mexico.  If you disapprove of the outsourcing of US food products, please DO NOT BUY MEXICAN MADE Hershey products.  You must turn the product over to know for sure if your Hershey Product was made in Mexico and read carefully.<br /><br />Please note that at the time of this review (12/2010), the regular size Reese Cups are still proudly made in Hershey Pennsylvania!  If you truly care about the American Worker, please continue to purchase Hershey products that are made in the United States and make Hershey aware of you decision.  Outsourcing does not work if the outsourced products are not purchased.
