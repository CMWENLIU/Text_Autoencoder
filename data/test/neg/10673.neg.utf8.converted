For reference, I have tried The Puck sumatran and the Diedrich. This Green Mountain sumatran was bitter and lifeless. It tasted stale and old, even though it was well within the sell-by date. For further reference, I also roast my own sumatran at home. I rate that a 10, starbucks would be a 9, the Puck k-cups would be an 8 as the best of the k-cups. I give this a flat 1. Very disappointing, will not purchase again. I wrote this about five minutes after finishing a cup, and I still have a terrible, bitter aftertaste. A true sumatran will have an earthy, almost tangy flavor, but with no bitterness. I would say they used coffee beans that had been sitting around for a while.
