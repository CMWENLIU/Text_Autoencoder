Must admit that if I hadn't read that this Red Mills had apple and blueberry I would never have noticed it, taste-wise. There are a few dark flecks in the package which I presume are the blueberries but you would never know.<br />Prior to this I had the Back To Nature blueberry granola (that particular variety not sold at Amazon). You can smell the blueberries when you open the package and the blueberries are very noticeable. I have milk on mine and it actually turns blue from the berries. These packs are also resealable whereas the Red Mill are not. Probably won't be buying it again.
