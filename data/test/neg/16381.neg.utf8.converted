I loved this product as a teenager and hadn't seen it for years until it showed up on the shelf at my local grocery. The quality of the product I bought at the store was great and I love this product not only for taste and versatility but it is low cal. However, I was disappointed in the product I received via Amazon. It seemed that the toast was very brittle and if I had to guess I bet it was because maybe it was past its prime shelf life. I will still continue to order groceries from Amazon because for the most part I have been satisfied.
