This green tea doesn't even compare to Japanese matcha.  Kirkland Ito En Matcha is extremely weak in flavor.  In fact, with one tea bag it doesn't taste, smell, or even look like the matcha you find in Japan, or the green teas you find elsewhere.  It is flavorless and odorless unless you pack two or three tea bags in a cup and, even then, it's very poor quality in comparison to other green teas.<br /><br />This Kirkland Ito En Matcha isn't even close to as good as other green tea available for about the same price on Amazon, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009K77OI">Yamamotoyama - Green Tea (Sushi Bar Style) 90 Bag Value Pack</a>.  That brand is significantly higher quality in every respect, even if the price is mostly shipping charges.<br /><br />The bottom line is that if you're looking for top quality green tea, this Kirkland Ito En Matcha is not it.
