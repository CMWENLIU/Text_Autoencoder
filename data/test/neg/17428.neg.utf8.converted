These crackers are way too crunchy. They remind me of the corn nuts people used to eat in high school. Just way too hard on your teeth! The flavor really isn't that bad considering what they have to work with being gluten free and all, but I just can't get past how crunchy they are. My teeth ache just looking at them.
