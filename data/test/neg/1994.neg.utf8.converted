I bought this cereal partially to benefit from the omega 3's from the flax.But the company admits their flax is in the form of WHOLE flax .It is a well accepted fact that little if any nutrients can be absorbed from the whole seed.I must admit the cereal is delicious.I recommend the multigrain cereal from Hodgson Mill or the 5 grain multigrain from Bob's Red Mill where the flax seeds are ground so they can be digested and the nutrients absorbed.
