I hate giving one star reviews.  In my quest for edible, sugar-free chocolate, I'm trying all I can find.  I get really excited when one is actually *tasty*!  This one, made with stevia, is hard, chalky, bitter, very dark chocolate.  I know, it's 83% cocoa, but to me, it's just too bitter.  If you like bitter choc, this may be for you!  I'm going to try cooking/baking with it.
