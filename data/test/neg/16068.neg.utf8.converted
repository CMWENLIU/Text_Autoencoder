Our three dogs have been grain free for over a year, and we were feeding them Taste of the Wild almost that whole time.  However, they had TERRIBLE, persistent gas everyday, so we decided to try a different brand of food.  We transitioned our boys to Blue Buffalo's Wilderness line (grain-free), and they did wonderfully for about four months - very little gas, healthy coats, and minimal dog-doo, too (which is a big deal considering we have a Mastiff, a Boxer, and an Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog).  Amazon didn't offer Blue Wilderness for Prime (free shipping), so I was going to the store and lugging heavy food bags at least twice a month.  First we decided to try Nature's Variety Instinct (grain-free line), which gave them slightly more gas and couldn't be purchased locally.  We like to buy on Amazon, but sometimes, with three big dogs, we run out faster than I anticipate - having a local store for emergencies is pretty important for us.  We went back to Blue Buffalo for a couple months, and then next we decided to try EVO - all of my research said this was the absolute BEST.  Well, as the title of this review indicated, all three of our boys got miserable diarrhea.  We transitioned our boys slowly, but once we went over one-half EVO, all three of the boys filled the yard with 100% liquid stool.  Poor guys!  We transitioned them back and once they were below fifty percent EVO, their movements went back to normal - but only after two days of constipation.  Our boys are back to feeling good, and we're back to buying Blue Buffalo Wilderness.  You don't know unless you try, I guess, but I feel terrible for putting the boys through that.  Good luck to everyone searching for a new favorite food.
