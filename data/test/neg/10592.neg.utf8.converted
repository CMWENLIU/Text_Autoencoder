should have taken the hint and PASSED... this tastes artificial and gross.  I even tried to doctor it up with real bacon, crumbled and tossed in!  It took longer to cook (and I measured), and was truly one of the most disgusting pasta dishes I've ever tasted.<br /><br />I will be trashing the other ones (I foolishly ordered a case), as I wouldn't even donate that to a homeless shelter.  It is THAT UNAPPETIZING.
