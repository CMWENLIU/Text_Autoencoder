Ordered these because I was super excited for new flavor. HUGE disappointment! Absolutely no candy corn flavor. The price is outrageous, I thought I was ordering at least a box with four packages of cookies. Save your money, or if you really want to try them, go to Target, they are available, exclusively, there.
