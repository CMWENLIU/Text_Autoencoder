I believe this is my first review. I am slightly addicted to Goji berries. I snack on them at work and re-hydrate them in tea before adding the mix to a tall bottle of ice and fresh lemon juice. I have a subscription to Navitas on Amazon. I got my first bag. I found the fruit very hard and dry but decent in size and still a great snack until I kept having to spit out mouthfuls due to the distinct nasty taste of mold. I thought I just got a bad bag but when my second order arrived.....same thing. You could see the black spots of mold on the berries. Most Goji's coming from China are dried til they are hard as pebbles b/c of the long month long journey (or more) to get here. They are still prone to pathogens and mold. I ordered Dragon Herbs Heaven Mountain Goji's and will follow up on how they are. Dragon herbs is a reputable company that has a process for dealing with the issues facing Goji's travel from China. If anyone knows a locally grown organic source of Goji's that is reasonably priced, please list it. Goji's grow easily in the US and it's obviously more sustainable. Regretfully, I am cancelling my Navitas subscription. Beware when purchasing. I read other reviews about mold and you can't return this item.
