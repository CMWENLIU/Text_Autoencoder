I went to BRU today to buy these after seeing how great a 6 month old was able to handle them. Every time I give my son a teether biscuit (Gerber or Earth's Best), he ends up chewing off a huge chunk and almost choking.  The 6 month old who was eating these today had no choking problems because they melt.  I was so excited to buy these.  As I was walking to the register, I saw that they are made in China. Also, if you look at the ingredients, they have nothing of any value in them.  Just empty calories...no protein, no vitamins, no fiber, no nothing.
