I ordered a larabar variety pack for around $39 dollars.  It just said variety pack but did not indicate the amount.  I assumed it would be the same as another variety pack I ordered for about the same amount f $ ($39 for 36 bars);  however, when I received the box it had only 13 bars in it, which calculates for about $3 per bar, unlike my previous order which was just above $1 per bar. I love larabars and will continue to order them, I was disappointed to say the least and will not order from that vendor again.
