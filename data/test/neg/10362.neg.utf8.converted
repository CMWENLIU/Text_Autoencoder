The image of this product shows a 24 oz can, which led me to believe that is what I would receive, especially since the cost is $139, only about $5 less than you would pay for six 24 oz cans at the grocery store. The product description says the cans are 20 oz, but Enfamil doesn't even come in 20 oz cans. Med Super Store sent me six 12.9 oz cans, which at the grocery store would be about $84. After emailing Med Super Store several times, they still have not resolved the problem and I had to file an A-Z claim.
