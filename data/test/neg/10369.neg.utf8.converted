Item arrived and was completely enclosed in a packaged but the inside package was damaged. The original Voss box was torn as though it had been dropped. There were a couple of bottles leaking. bottles were placed in the box in all kinds of ways.I paid good money to receive this? I will not order from here again if this problem is not corrected.
