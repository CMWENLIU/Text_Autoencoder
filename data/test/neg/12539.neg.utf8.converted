It is tasty (like coffee mate which I actually like) but I'm afraid it's far less nutritious than soy milk or milk ---- 1 serving (23g powder) has 100 calories but only contains 2g of protein (26g of non-fat milk powder contains 9g protein!). And the list of ingredients for this product is long with several long words ...<br /><br />I will keep it but only as coffee creamer (To be fair, it is probably healthier than regular coffee creamer.) ButI don't think it is as natural, healthy, and nutritious as soy milk.
