In my pack of 6, I had the misfortune of having two bad pouches of rice.  It was moldy and definitely inedible! Four edible pouches out of six (67%) in my book is unacceptable.  Both pouches had the expiration date of 07/2012; it makes me wonder about their quality control standards.<br /><br />I love Indian food and really wanted to rate this product highly.  However, I cannot with good conscience recommend this product when it appears their quality control process is substandard.
