I bought these for my daughter who drinks decaf due to her heart condition.  14 of the 35 were not even decaf. Very disapointed with the product.  35 k cup loose in a box.  Can't even return them! I usually read reviews but for some reason I didn't think you should have a problem with buying tea.  I was wrong!!  VERY WRONG!!
