Normally I don't take the time to review food products I buy but this product was ABSOLUTELY GROSS.  The noodles tasted mushy and overcooked and the sauce and toppings were abysmal.  Maybe I have higher standards for asian food but the sauce is overwhelmingly and sickenly sweet (and thats just adding a little over half of the bic packet they give you), the sesame seeds had no flavor, and the "vegetable toppings" consisted of a tiny packet of bits of dried carrots and green onion.  Sesame teriyaki? Not even close.  Even dried ramen noodles taste better in my opinion (if only because they are deep fried).  If you REALLY want to buy it and try I'd suggest going to publix or kroger and sampling one before you shell out the money for 6.
