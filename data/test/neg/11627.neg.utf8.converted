Like others have said, I really wanted to like these.  While I didn't expect anything approximating true noodles, I was not prepared for these.  This is only a noodle (or fettucine in this case) insofar as the shape is the same.  But that's where the similarity ends.  This is a translucent slimy tapeworm-resembling product that does not remotely resemble food.  I tried it with spaghetti sauce and cheese and the only thing that made it edible was mixing it with true pasta.  But of course that defeats the purpose of the zero calorie angle. While I was thinking perhaps this could act as a filler or stretcher for pasta to lessen the calories, I have to say it is not worth it.  I rather just eat the one or two forkfuls of real pasta than mix it with this.<br /><br />P.S.- You may want to put on a DVD of Fear Factor to give you courage to eat this-<br />or just that old Charlie Chaplin movie where he eats his shoe.
