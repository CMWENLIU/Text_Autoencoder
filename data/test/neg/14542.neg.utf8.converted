I purchased this Yeast because the description stated that the only ingredient was YEAST.  However, when I received it I found that SORBITAN MONOSTEARATE has been added to the yeast.  I am allergic to sorbital and sorbitan is a derivative of sorbital.  If you google Sorbitan Monostearate you will find many discussions about the allergic properties of sorbital/sorbitan.<br /><br />I called Bob's Red Mill who did not care and put all the blame on amazon.com<br /><br />So for those of you with allergies or want plain yeast buy Red Star active yeast in the red, white, & blue packages and you will find only yeast. Do not buy the Red Star in jars, or the one for bread making as they also contain sorbitan.  I emailed the Red Star company for this information.<br /><br />It certainly is becoming a challenge to find products that don't have additives.
