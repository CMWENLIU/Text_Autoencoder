I recently ordered the 10-pack so I could try all of the flavors after reviewing the positive reviews here.  After trying it myself, I can say I am very disappointed.  The texture is more like frozen yogurt and the flavor is a cross between lowfat yogurt and frozen no-fat milk.  There is nothing creamy in the flavor. I would suggest just blending it up as a smoothie.  It definitely didn't satisfy my urge for ice cream.  If you want to try it yourself, the best flavor is the vanilla maple.  It comes the closest to tasting like it's in the ball park of ice cream.
