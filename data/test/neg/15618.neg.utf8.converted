This product is imported rye crispbread. It is full of small bugs. They seem to be thriving but the crackers are not fit for human consumption. The packages are marked, "30 NOV 11". I assume this is the pull date but the bugs have been in the product for many months.<br /><br />I want and deserve a refund! This product was purchased from Amazon.
