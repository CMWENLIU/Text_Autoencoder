This product has an awful taste.  I cook quinoa at home and thought this would be an easy way to enjoy it at work.  It's horrid.  I will not order this again.  It's only edible if you disguise the taste with sauce, gravy, or salad dressing.  I have a few packages left and I am considering just throwing them out.
