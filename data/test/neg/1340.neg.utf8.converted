Broadway Strawberry Rolls-when I was a kid-and later, the Ruehllers from Denmark as well, were my Favorite candy-ever!!! They were sold in Solvang, Ca for a few years!<br />Recently, someone bought the Broadway name and are making these rolls again! I am an expert-been eating these since I was 5!!!<br />This new batch is an utter ABOMINATION!!! These are WRETCHEDLY AWFUL!!!! Change the name to OFF Broadway Rolls! These are REALLY off!!!<br />This is as if Yoko Ono toured as The BeaTles!!! Like comparing a Big Mac to the best Fillet Mignon! Like comparing Katy Perry to Joni Mitchell!!!<br />Like comparing The Flaming Lips to Pink Floyd....<br />Like comparing Sarah Bernhardt to Natalie Wood...<br />Anyway, they went from the BEST candy to a contender for Worst!!! Don't be fooled!!! This has No taste! Oh! Actually...it Does!!! It's AWFUL...!!! Yech!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Want great licorice???? Get the Australian kind! at World Market or any fine candy store!!!  Realllly good! or Lindt Intense Orange! Yummmy dark chocolate!<br /><br />I WOULD rate this -5 stars!!!!!!!!
