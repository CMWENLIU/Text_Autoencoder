I received yeast and "Sorbitan Monostearate" I did NOT order "sorbitan Monostearate" I ordered just "YEAST"<br /><br />I waited ten days for chemicals? A person who bakes their own bread wants the best! This is garbage.<br /><br />To return this item I must pay out of my own pocket to ship it back for their mistake. What a rip off. This same yeast at my grocery store does not have the extra ingredient. I am very disappointed and feel they have stolen from me.
