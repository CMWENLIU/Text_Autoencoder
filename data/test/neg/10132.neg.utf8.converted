I thought Smokehouse products were always from the USA - that is why I ordered these. Much to my surprise, these were made in China. Not only that but they contain wheat flour. I am returning them. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased, I see another review mentioned that these were made in China. I guess Smokehouse doesn't keep the quality as consistently high as I thought.
