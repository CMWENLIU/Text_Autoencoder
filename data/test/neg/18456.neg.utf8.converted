We switched my son from Enfamil Infant looking for an organic comparable. We decided to try Earth's Best and although my son would drink it within the next day he was constipated. We decided to keep trying the formula until we finished and supplement him with apple juice and apple and pear purees to help him digest. Four days later and he was still terribly constipated, and he struggled. We decided to change to Baby's One and within a a day he was having some normal looking bowel movements. I was really disappointed that this formula was so harsh for his stomach. I think the intentions were good but it obviously isn't a complete trade off and I have read that they extra fortify the milk-base formula with more lactose which makes it difficult for children to digest. My son is taking really well with Baby's only and we will continue with this formula since its better than non-organic.
