I purchased it at Old Time Pottery for $1.99--- so i thought i would see if i could purchase this  item  on-line in bulk- then I saw the price-- uh, i don't think so. what a rip. i did see a site that shall go unnamed that sells it for $1.39 but shpping is kind of steep but even with shipping it is a bargain compared to $3.49--- i am kind surprised that this item is so expensive at Amazon
