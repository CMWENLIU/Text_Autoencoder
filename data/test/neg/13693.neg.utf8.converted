I am originally from Europe (Germany) and love Italian Cooking. After moving to the States, I have a hard time finding the ingredients that I was used to get easily there in the american grocery stores. If I can find them, they are overpriced and of inferior quality (parmigiano reggiano anyone ?). I often feel that people are knowingly tricked by the industry by product names which resemble the "real product", the best example would be olive oil.<br /><br />Happy of at least finding one of my favorite pasta brands ("deCecco"), I was looking for the San Marzano tomatoes which I was used to get at my local italian grocery store for 1.50 Euros (about 1.80 USD) a can (the acidity of most american canned tomatoes is too high, in my opinion).<br /><br />So far, I have only found this brand at the local grocery stores, and after reading the label, I was very suspicious about it - a San Marzano tomato, produced in USA ? I gave it a chance anyways, at last, they have a high price and they are still on the market, so they might have something going for them.<br /><br />After opening the can, I instantly saw that these can not be real San Marzano tomatoes - San Marzanos are long and thin and bittersweet (once you tried them, you will be able to tell), these are spherical and sweet and sour.<br /><br />I have used them in soup and pasta sauces so far, at least they seem to be a little better than the regular canned tomatoes in the grocery store, but it can not justify the price tag - in Europe I can get this quality for about a dollar.<br /><br />So if you are searching for a good canned tomato, keep on searching - these here might not taste all that bad, but they are not San Marzanos and they are expensive as well.
