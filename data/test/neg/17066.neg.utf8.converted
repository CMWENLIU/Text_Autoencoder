I hate that I bought this before researching it, now I feel ripped off. Agave is nothing more than chemically man-made fructose which is stored as fat in the body and also makes a person's arteries hard. Table sugar is a healthier and excellent substitute for agave. This product is as natural and as healthy as corn syrup, it's a marketing scam. It should be called hydrolyzed inulin syrup.
