This cat food literally has the consistency of chicken noodle soup.  It is at least 70% water.  And I mean straight up WATER.. not moisture.  You shake the can and it sounds like it's full of liquid, and it is.<br /><br />My cats didn't even bother to smell it, much less taste it, and they will eat darn near anything.<br /><br />The first time, I dumped it in a bowl and it looked like some kind of soup with a few fragments of ground meat.<br /><br />The second time, I tried squeezing out the can with the lid, like how you would squeeze out the water in a can of tuna.  This yielded maybe 2 ounces of food in the 6 ounce can.  The cats wouldn't eat that either.<br /><br />In summary, this is the most pathetic excuse for cat food I have EVER seen  and I have lived with cats for all of my 29 years.
