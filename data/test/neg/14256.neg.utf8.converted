I am a young adult just starting to try to convert to Veganism and read many good reviews of this particular brand of nutritional yeast claiming it was the tastiest of the bunch.  It is included in many Vegan recipes as a substitute taste-wise for cheese - and after tasting it myself I can't imagine the people who created the recipes have ever tasted any kind of cheese - even bad cheese - because this tastes like sawdust and stale mini wheats.  I can only imagine it being useful as a possible thickening agent for sauces and the like.  I'm sure the company is totally respectable and the product is probably a fine choice, but nutritional yeast was not, I found, all it was touted to be.
