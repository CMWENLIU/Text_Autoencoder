Caveat Emptor: This company does not seal the boxes in any way. The flaps are not taped, so air can get to the candies and harden them.<br /><br />I have loved maple sugar candy for many years. I've tried dozens of different brands and this was the first that was hard as a rock. There is no expiration date on the box, but it seemed as though the candy was quite old due to the improper packaging. Even the middle of the largest leaf wasn't soft the way maple sugar candy should be.<br /><br />A really fresh piece should have a slightly crunchy/sugary exterior and be smooth and almost buttery inside. This was definitely not.
