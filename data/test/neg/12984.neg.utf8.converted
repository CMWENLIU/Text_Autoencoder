These do not get chewy and soft...they are glass-hard, and broke 3 of my mini poodles rear teeth, one of which had to be extracted! I bought these to help keep her teeth clean, not destroy her teeth! My recommendation is to avoid at all costs.<br /><br />Note that our vet said not to give our dogs anything to chew that is too hard to indent with your fingernail.  She recommended Bully Sticks and rawhide chews.
