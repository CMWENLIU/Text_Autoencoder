I had wondered how HIT removed the trans fat from their cookies.  While hoping that they would have replaced the "bad fat" with a poly or mono unsaturated fat they have chosen to go with palm and coconut oil, two of the  nutritionally worst "vegetable oils", to make matters worse they fully hydrogenate these oils making the ratio of fat that is found in the cookies 86% saturated (6gm/7gm)!<br /><br />Nutritionally one could do better by picking almost any other cookie - so I'd recommend skipping this one.
