In February of 2010 I ordered a 14 oz canister of Pro-Treat Freeze dried chicken liver dog treats.I had been giving another brand of freeze dried chicken liver treats to both my dog and cat. They both loved these treats. When I opened my new Pro-Treats freeze dried liver treats I smelled an odd odor. My cat would not eat these new treats. My dog did eat these treats  but every morning he started throwing up. I stopped giving these treats to my dog and he stopped getting sick. The liver treats may or may not have been responsible for my dog getting sick but I didn't want to take a chance of my dog getting sink again.
