This product does work. I have taken it multiple times. Every time I do take this 5 hour energy, I am more alive and aware.<br />It helps, but it makes me crash real bad at the end. It says no crash, but just last night when I took this, I couldn't keep my eyes open after taking it, I kept trying to stay awake, soon as I laid on my bed, at 9 pm. I woke up at 1 pm the next day. I missed the entire morning because I had crashed so unbelievably hard.<br /><br />I do not recommend this to everyone, everyone has a different reaction to it, but mine wasn't so good.<br />I suggest if you take these when "Not Tired" to avoid heavy crashes like mine. I took mine after being up for around 18 hours. So take them when you are only feeling a little worn out, not exhausted or restless.
