After opening the fancy box and unsealing the gold bag, I was excited to brew a few cups of succulent, chocolate richness.  Instead, I got a pot of synthetic-tasting sweetness that was completely unbefitting of the Gevalia name.  This tastes like a cup of store-brand coffee seasoned with those artificial flavoring tablets or Coffee-Mate flavored creamer.  What's more, there was none of the characteristic freshness that "bag" coffee typically has.  For a much better cup of chocolaty coffee, try Millstone's Chocolate Velvet, which has an immeasurably smoother, more natural chocolate taste (and carries a much smaller price tag).  One part Gevalia Kaffe Dark Chocolate mixed with three parts unflavored coffee makes a more palatable cup, but the saccharine sweetness and totally artificial taste are just way too intense when brewed "straight." Truly not a good cup of joe.
