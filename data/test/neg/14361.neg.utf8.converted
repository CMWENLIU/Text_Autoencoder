Diffefent type of Manuka honey was shipped. The item picture shown on the amazon page is with green cap and manuka flower illustration on white gackground, and clearly said "100% raw certified."<br /><br />What I was received was totally different package. With blue cap and with no "raw" statement at all. This was the same product I saw the same one at my nearby health store and I've been avoiding to buy it since I was not sure if it was really raw.<br /><br />I felt like I was cheated.
