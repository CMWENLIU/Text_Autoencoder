After reading so many positive reviews on this product I decided to give it a try.  I never ate this as a child so I have no attachment emotional or otherwise to it.  Luckily, my local Kroger still sells this item so I didn't have to buy a case of it to give it a try.  I have to say I was really disappointed in the flavor.  It wasn't really a tangy flavor but rather a strong and somewhat bitter flavor.  The noodles were very sub par as well.  My husband and children wouldn't eat this and I ended up making sandwiches for dinner.  I would not recommend this product unless you have that nostalgia for it.  Please don't order a case of this thinking you're going to love it only to end up hating it like other people on here have.  See if you can find one box and give it a try.
