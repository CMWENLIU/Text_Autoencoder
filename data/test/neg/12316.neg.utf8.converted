I started adding coconut of all different forms to my diet since learning of its health benefits, particularly as a rare source of medium-chain triglycerides and its resistance to oxidation from the heat of cooking. I also thoroughly enjoy the sweet, nutty flavor of coconut. I not only cook with coconut oil, but I add it to foods for its theoretical health benefits as well. For variety, I sometimes will use coconut butter instead. So, when I came across these 7-ounce packets of creamed coconut, and at a lower per-ounce cost, I was expecting to be pleased. Unfortunately, I must say that I dislike this product. First, the health benefits of coconut are found mostly in its oil, so the added coconut meat in this product offers very little nutritionally over the oil. Second, the coconut meat of this product makes it too sandy, producing an unpleasant mouth feel for me. Third and worst of all, this stuff requires too much effort to use. Pouring  the soft, oily product from the plastic pouches is messy. Even worse, when cooled and solidified, it becomes rock-hard. Melting it is just not worth the effort. I'll stick with coconut oil or coconut butter.
