My first loaf of this excuse for bread was gooey and baked like a brick.  The second had the consistency of play dough.  It did not spring back when kneaded or pressed. It did not rise.  The description of it as biscuits was apt although I baked it in a big loaf it was just like heavy dense biscuits.  Not what I anticipated.
