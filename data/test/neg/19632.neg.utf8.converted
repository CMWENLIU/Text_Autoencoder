Ok, so first of all -- the package in the picture says RAW, and received packaging DOES NOT! So obviously is a mislead. The almonds I buy from the grocery store are not organic, cost less than half, and they taste/look far better than these... Sun Ridge almonds are very small, wrinkly and dry... So disappointed, asking for refund, and never buying that brand again! If you think they're great -- you either have never tasted fresh, good quality almonds, or I just received a awful bad batch...
