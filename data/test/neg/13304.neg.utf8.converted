I bought these cherries based on all the positive reviews on Amazon, but I guess I have different tastes than most the reviewers here.<br /><br />The cherries are way, way too sweet. It really detracts from the actual flavor and tartness.<br /><br />Maybe if there was half the sugar in them than what it has now, they would taste much better.
