I did read the disclaimer, but was still a bit surprised when the package arrived.  The boxes of grits were nothing like the description.  The photo used in the ad is apparently a stock photo of some kind?  While that was only annoying, what ruined it for me was the fact that these are quick grits.  Please, don't call them Southern Style, if they are quick or instant grits.  I certainly would not have purchased quick grits had that been stated somewhere in the description.
