I had my Airedale Terrier puppy on Wellness Super Mix Just for Puppy from about 10 weeks to 14 weeks. During this time I had loose stools to no stools (i.e. the squirts). It was very frustrating. The ingredient list looks great and I was looking forward to feeding this kibble but it did not work out for my puppy. I switched her to my adult dog's kibble out of frustration and suddenly perfect poops. My adult eats Wellness Core orginal. I asked my vet if it would be ok to continue feeding the adult food to the 14 week puppy and she said it was fine.<br /><br />My recommendation is to buy a small bag of Wellness Just for Puppy at first and if you don't get good stools then switch to something else immediately - don't wait around like I did. Not every food is going to work for every dog.
