I recently switched to a vegan diet. I was at a store that had no other options than Knorr's for vegetable bullion, so I bought it. I didn't pay attention to the ingredient list, which I should have. I made a soup, and then next morning I woke up swollen like a balloon and feeling totally lethargic. I couldn't figure out what I'd eaten that would create such a terrible response-tomatoes, fennel, salad and onion should not cause any problems- and then I thought about the bullion. So I checked out the ingredients on the bullion, and I should have known it would contain MSG (if you aren't scared of MSG yet, go google it). So if you don't like MSG and you don't like getting about 50% of your RDA in sodium in one meal, don't use this bullion.
