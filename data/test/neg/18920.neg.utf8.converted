I have a young, healthy, athletic Boxer and he had diarrhea so bad he had accidents in the house 3 times and moped around for a whole day after I gave him some of these cut up in his Kong treat puzzle toy. Boxers can have touchy stomachs and he has had a touch of diarrhea before with a new treat but never anything like this. Even the time he got hold of some chicken wings it wasn't this bad. I recently purchased a carpet cleaner and was never so happy to have one on hand, I used it 2 times that night and once again in the morning. If your dog has any sensitivity introduce these slowly or just pass them up, there must be something in them that takes some getting used to.
