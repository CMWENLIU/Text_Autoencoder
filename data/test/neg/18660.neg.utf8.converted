I was really looking forward to these pods based on the reviews.  Starbucks is good, but I prefer bolder taste.... imagine my surprise when I ordered 2 boxes - both were expired! One expired back in 2005 for gosh sakes.  I admit that Amazon agreed to credit me for cost plus part of shipping, but geez, 2 years expired!!!  I'm hoping to find local San Diego area shoppe that carries pods so that I can try something different than starbucks.
