I bought this at the supermarket since it's more natural than some of the other mainstream brands expecting for it to be tastier, but apparently I like the major brand's creamy smooth peanut butter better.<br /><br />I thought it was personally TOO sweet, and it wasn't smooth and creamy because of all the crunchy little granules of what I can assume is salt since the ingredients did not list sugar.  I do not like those crunches/shatterings of the granules in what is suppose to be a smooth peanut butter - it just messes with my expectations.  Too bad because now I have an almost full jar of uneaten peanut butter
