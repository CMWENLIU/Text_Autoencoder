Just a warning:  These Cashews came re-packaged in ziplock bags.  No safety seal or anything - just normal ziplocks.  I am not comfortable with that from a retailer, which may be coloring my impression that the nuts smell bad (though a friend smelled them and agreed).<br /><br />The seller will only refund me $1 unless I personally pay shipping to send the ziplock bags of nuts BACK to them, presumably to be resold. They were explicitly concerned about not being able to recoup costs if i did not return the product. They want me to bear the costs of their bad product instead.<br /><br /> Do NOT buy these - who knows how many times they send these nuts through the mail, have them returned, and resell them, with NO way to assure they have not been contaminated.  Very gross.  I plan to throw these away.  Sad.
