I agree completely with the reviewer before me! W/O even changing the labeling, Sun Maid has changed the way they prepare the fruit in the Tropical Trio. Where the pieces were small enough to use in a granola, in cookies or oatmeal, on cereal or yogurt, they are now huge chunks that do not blend well into anything! I wrote to Sun Maid, hoping I had purchased defective bags, the response was<br />"Thank you for your inquiry regarding your package of Sun-Maid Tropical Trio.  We have changed this product due to the fact that the larger pieces have more flavor and they do not 'sugar' as quickly as the smaller pieces."<br />I am not sure what they mean by "sugar" but I always found the small pieces to be quite flavorful. I have tried cutting them up on my own, but the results were not good, too sticky on the inside to cut well.<br />I am switching to Welch's Tropical Sensation, since they are the only other brand I have found with the smaller cuts of fruit. What a shame. I hope we can find those here on Amazon soon! They can be difficult to find at our local grocery stores.
