For the price you can get a much better tasting veggie broth/powder: Seitenbacher Vegetable Broth + Rapunzel Pure Organic Veggie Broth (higher salt content than  Seitenbacher but you need smaller amounts to acheive similar effect. So, it all balances out at the end?). Also, if you're cooking anything with mushrooms & you want to keep the mushroom theme, use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2B8">Savory Choice Liquid Reduced Sodium Vegetable Broth Concentrate, 4.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />I cooked with Pacific and size of pks are not convenient at all. It all depends on the portions you're cooking; which makes powder option (the above recommended ones) much more convenient.
