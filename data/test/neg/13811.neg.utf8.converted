I have a wonderful bread machine and have used dozens of Hodgson Mill bread mixes with perfect bread results everytime.  Tried this Krusteaz Cinnamon Raison bread mix and it was terrible!  The texture was gummy, tasted terrible - and we usually love Cinnamon Raison breads.  Don't recommend this.  Will stay with Hodgson Mill products!
