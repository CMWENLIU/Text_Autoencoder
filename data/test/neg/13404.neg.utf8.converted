These were wrapped very well, too well, to the point it was difficult to unwrap them. Luckily they were individually wrapped because one of the LEAKED and got tossed in the trash. The other did not leak but I wonder about the 'safeness'.  They were wrapped extremely well so it wasn't a wrapping problem, perhaps it's the high temperatures we've had or the ligs are just not tight. I'll try the remaining and wait a day to see if I get sick.<br /><br />There is a break-away plastic ring on the bottol lid that does allow some movement before breaking. There are no other barriers (a punch seal) once the lid is removed. Dosen't seem like a hermetic seal.<br /><br />Sold by 'Cheapees', not that that means anything.<br />They arrived quickly, delivered by Unites States Postal Service.<br /><br />I do love A1 sauce but this is too expensive when one leaks.
