"light" - because there's almost no food in the can. I'm trying to eat a little healthier but this is NOT helping; there was maybe an inch and a half of vegetables in the bottom of the can and a few tiny shreds/bits of beef mixed in there - see photo added. The vegetables are *seriously* over cooked. The bland, muddy tasting broth does not save this soup at all.<br /><br />Would not purchase again nor recommend.
