I admittedly liked this product.  People thinking "I like smoked salmon" may be thrown by this product at first, but think "jerky!!"  Very chewy: the larger pieces can give your jaw a good workout, and every once in awhile you hit a peppercorn which makes your eyes water (in a good way).  Good salmon flavor.  I would be a happy consumer except that I have run into moldy strips in two separate orders.  Got the 8 pak, and on pak #6, almost the entire contents were fuzzy.  An e-mail to the company got absolutely no response, but Amazon was kind enough to replace it in spite of it being a generally non-returnable item.  Unfortunately, the replacement jerky also had a white fuzzy mold pocket in one pak.  Not in every pak, but since you tend to chew jerky while busy doing something else (fishing, driving, whatever), it gave me the creeps knowing how little I looked at most of this stuff when shoving a strip "in between my cheek and gum."  Eat in good light and keep your eyes open.
