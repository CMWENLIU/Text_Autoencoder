I gave it one star because they don't taste like pasta at all.  They tasted mashy even cooked for just 1 1/2 minutes, and the brand is called Al Dente?<br /><br />Yes, I did cook them according to instruction the first time - in 3 minutes, then I did it the 2nd time in 2 minutes, and the 3rd time in 1 1/2 minutes, what should I do with the rest of 3 packs?  (They are sold in a 6-pack deal.)
