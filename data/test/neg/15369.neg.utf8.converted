Below is a note that I sent to 1-800-Flowers regarding a recent order that I made on their website (through Amazon).  1-800-Flowers first presents you with a reasonably priced item for sale, then they slap you at the end with a last minute service fee that is equvalent to 1/3 the cost of the item.  This is just plain wrong.  If I did not need the item, I would have gone to their competitors.  My issue is not with the product, but with the business practice.  You be the judge:<br /><br />Good Day,<br />I just placed an order with your company, the confirmation number is attached.  My reason for contacting you is to raise my displeasure with the pricing.  As you can see from the details below, the "service charge" is 1/3 of the cost of the item that was ordered (there was no previous mention of a $20 service fee).  I do not see why you believe that this type of "bait and switch" online tactic wins repeat business (I am assuming that you are competing for loyal customers).  If you are going to sell reasonably priced items, you should not surprise the customer at checkout with excessive fees.  These actions only reduce the value of the product and of the service in the customer's opinion.  Thank you for your kind attention.<br />Order Summary<br />Merchandise Amount:<br />$59.99<br />Discount Promotion Code xxxxx:<br />($5 discount has been applied to your order )<br />-$5.00<br />Service Charge:<br />$19.99<br />Sub-Total:<br />$74.98<br />Tax:<br />$0.00<br />Order Total:<br />$74.98<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037BUEW8">Flowers by 1800Flowers - Rose Elegance Premium Long Stem Red Roses - One Dozen</a>
