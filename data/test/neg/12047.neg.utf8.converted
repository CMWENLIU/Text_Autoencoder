I ate a KIND bar (Almond & Apricot) for the first time yesterday. Fabulous taste, crunchy, yet soft and chewy. One thing that concerned me was the ingredient "Glucose". That could mean so many things. So I contacted the company to see what their glucose is made from. It's corn syrup. This was their response:<br /><br />"Thank you again for contacting KIND Healthy Snacks.<br /><br />Please note that this ingredient is corn syrup, but is not to be confused with high fructose corn syrup.  I am pleased to inform you that we use only all-natural, non-GMO corn syrup, which when combined with honey, helps us achieve the best flavor while allowing our bars to remain crunchy.  Please also note that 13 out of our 15 snack bars are considered low GI foods, which includes the flavor you are referring to, our Fruit & Nut Delight bar.<br /><br />I hope you find this information helpful.  Please also feel free to contact me with any additional questions or comments, and I would be happy to help you.<br /><br />KIND Regards,<br /><br />(Name Removed)<br /><br />Customer Experience Manager<br />KIND Healthy Snacks<br />(212) 616 - 3006"<br /><br />Corn syrup, even if it's "non-GMO" and not high fructose, isn't healthy. One of my children gets very sick eating corn syrup, so unfortunately Kind products will be on our list of things that we never buy.<br /><br />Kind is being deceptive in not listing where their glucose comes from. They probably know that it wouldn't be well received if that ingredient were listed as corn syrup, not glucose, which it should be.
