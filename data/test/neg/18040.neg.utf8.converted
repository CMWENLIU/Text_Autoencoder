Just received these two boxes which I purchased to go in my son's stocking for Christmas, but the boxes are so small, I regret ordering them, especially for $10! BE WARE! These boxes are about the size of a cigarette lighter. (I bought a box of these years ago and they were a regular size candy box, so i had expected these to be about the same size.)
