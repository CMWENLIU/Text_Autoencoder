I have a lot of fine, wavy, dark hair, and this product didn't seem to do much for me. I was hoping this product would subtly darken my hair and also nourish it and make it softer. This product did seem to remove some of the red undertones in my hair, but didn't make it thicker or softer. This product is mainly mineral oil with dye and a bit of amla mixed in. For my hair, I prefer natural coconut oil or olive oil, so now if I wish to darken my hair I mix pure amla with either of those oils and get great results.
