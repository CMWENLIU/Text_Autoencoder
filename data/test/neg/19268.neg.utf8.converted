I tried this cheese sauce to see if it was as good as the "El Rio" Naucho Cheese Sauce. No comparison. "El Rio " is still the 5 star champ. This sauce taste like someone unscrewed the cap on the salt shaker without the cook knowing about it. The cook tries to season the sauce normally and the whole shaker of salt falls into the sauce. It then taste as if the cook didn't want to waste food so the cook packaged and sold it anyway. This may not be true. But that is the flavor it gives me. I opened 1 three ounce cup. I could not stomach even one ounce. It was like licking a salt lick. I threw the cup away. Now I have to find a very bland recipe to use it with or throw it away. Bad Chi-Chi. Very bad indeed.
