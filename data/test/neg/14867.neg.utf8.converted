The nerve of some companies to charge $50 a bag for a product chock full of by-products and corn. This food is on the same nutritional level as the Pedigrees of the world which you can get at the local supermarket. If you're on a budget and want to feed your dog a healthier diet, check out Blue Buffalo at Petco, Kirkland's Signature at Costco, Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul and Taste of the Wild online and pet food oriented stores like Pet Food Direct. You owe it to your pets to keep them healthy and you can save money while doing it!
