I am a huge fan of Shirakiku brand shichimi togarashi, but I can't buy it in bags anywhere any more, so I thought I'd try this "See Smell Taste" brand.  While this brand does have a lot of flavor and is very fresh, the flavor is overwhelmingly Sichuan pepper, that's pretty much all I can taste with this brand, so I didn't like it at all.  In the Shirakiku brand, the flavors are balanced so on one of the seven seasonings in the blend comes through too much.
