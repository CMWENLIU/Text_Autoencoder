Although I have a beef eater in this house, this one, well, just didn't make the grade.  I can't figure it out either - it smells wonderful.  And, better in color, grade, etc., than most others I've tried.  These gourmet varieties are usually gobbled up around this house but this one, it went down the garbage disposal and the rest of them went back to the store!  Can't say I can recommend this one.
