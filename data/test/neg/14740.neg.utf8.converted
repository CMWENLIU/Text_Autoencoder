This product is actually great.  I love it and always keep several containers on hand but I overlooked the size here.  I thought I was ordering the larger 1 qt size. My own fault but still I was upset with myself for not catching this error sooner.  When the case arrived today and I discovered I had purchased 1 pint containers for almost $32 instead, I cried.  I recommend the product but don't buy it from Amazon...any place else will probably be cheaper.
