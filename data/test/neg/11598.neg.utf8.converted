I am a huge fan of red teas, and citrus teas and tangy teas, but this tea didn't do it for me. Maybe I got an off bag, or maybe I didn't use enough rosehips in my tea, but the flavor was wholly different for me than the other reviewers. I didn't taste any tang, the tea tasted more like a vegetable soup than a tea -- almost salty. I'm not at all a fan.
