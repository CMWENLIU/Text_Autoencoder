Some people seem to be getting DOP Certified tomatoes; other people just get Certified Organic.  Mine were not DOP.  The label looks similar, but does not say DOP.  This is a distinction that not even all Italian Delis get correct.  Too much hassle to return.  Good tasting tomatoes anyway, but not what I paid for.
