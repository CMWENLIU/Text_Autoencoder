Purchased the shampoo and conditioner after reading all the hype in magazines.  Been using Bed Head products from my hair salon prior.  After 1 week using this I noticed my hair felt thinner and could feel more of my scalp!  This was a tad alarming.  My hair went to feeling somewhat healthy (highlight my hair so has some processing stress but not much) to feeling unhealthy.  Texture was changed.  Also noticed the color looked washed out after using.  Products going in garbage can and back to shampoos/conditioners from salon!
