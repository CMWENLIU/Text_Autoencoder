I decided to be brave, spend the 20 bucks after shipping and buy an 8 ounce bottle of the new release of Postum from [...]  I still have one unopened bottle of the original postum left in my pantry that I just cant bring myself to open,  so I compared at least the looks against the new one.  The new bottle, first of all is plastic.  Thats fine I have no problem with that,  that shouldn't effect the product. I noticed the color of the mix is a lot darker than the original Postum, almost like it has oil in it or is wet  and less "grain like" in its consistancy, more like  a fine sawdust. After comparing the two bottles side by side the moment of truth was now at hand.  I cracked the seal on the little white paper stuff that covered the top of the bottle.  To my suprise there was almost no smell. I do remember the original postum having a distinct smell when you stick you nose an inch or two from the bottle,  and this hardly had any odor to it.  I took my 1 spoonful of mix and dumped it into a hot cup of water.  It created a ton of foam as it mixed in,  which I dont rember the original doing.  I then poured my  small amount of milk in it, and it turned a very light color.  I added a touch of sugar and prepared for the taste.  the first sip was kind of flat.  I had to ask "did I put way to much milk in,  or not enough mix?"  well,  I finished most of the cup and found myself a little let down.  to me the first cup didnt seem like an exact match to the good old Postum of 2008.  Weak on aroma and a little weak on taste.  I will experiment alittle with the mixture and see if I can improve it,  but I probably won't be buying another bottle.  Were my expectations to high?  Maybe,  but if my memory of Postum is better than the real thing I think Ill stick with just the memory!
