I bought these because the Wild Oats roasted sunflower seeds were not available.  Boy, I got sicker than a dog on these.  A bunch of the bags smelled rancid (I did not eat anything from those) and the other ones did not smell as bad but made me pretty darn sick (for 3 days).<br /><br />Double yuck.  Bad experience.  I wrote the company too and gave them the lot number.  Not sure what happened, but bad seeds and I probably won't buy another product of theirs either.
