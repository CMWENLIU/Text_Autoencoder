Ordered two 56oz bags. They arrived quickly, but most of the candies inside had broken shells, completely shattered shells, or where just reduced down to chocolate covered peanuts. The ones that did not break are coated with an layer of M&M shell shards from their murdered bagmates. Poor fellas had to watch their poor friends and family shatter then were violently dismembered right in front of them, left only to be covered in the skin and guts of those they love.
