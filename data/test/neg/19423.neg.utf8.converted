I'm a veg who makes vegan baked goods and generally uses applesauce or banana as an egg substitute, so I'm no stranger to fruit in baking.  However, these cookies have an overwhelming fruity aroma, smell and taste, that I found hard to like and even swallow.  I'm guessing it might be the prune puree in the ingredients.  Oh and there were a disappointing number of chocolate chips in them - one cookie had two small chocolate chunks.  With no chocolate to compensate for the fruity aroma - 2 stars.<br /><br />However, I find these filling and better with a big cup of coffee.  So if you like fruitiness and want something filling for a breakfast on the go, this can be a good vegan breakfast item.
