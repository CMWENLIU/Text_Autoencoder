Just made and tasted a pizza with this yeast.  I have been baking for over 25  years and have made pizza dough the traditional way with excellent results.  I was a bit skeptical of this dough but since it had the Fleishmann name, I gave it a try. I purchased yeast at local supermarket not Amazon.  I followed directions with exact measurements using regular flour.  My sauce was simply crushed tomatoes with basil, salt, garlic powder and olive oil. Topping:  Grated mozzerela cheese. Baked in a pizza pan with holes (provides for crisper crust and can be found in most retail stores)  Prep and cook time:  25 minutes.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Quick to mix<br />Was easy to press onto pizza pan<br />A great time saver for busy familys<br />Kid friendly<br /><br />Cons:<br />Overpriced<br />Flavor 3 on a scale of 10<br />Crust was not chewy or crisp, biscuit like consistancy<br />Overall, I would not use this product again.  Felt it was a waste of good pizza toppings.  Will only use a traditional yeast to make my pizza crust in the future.
