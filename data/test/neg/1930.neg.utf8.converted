Bought this tea only to find out that the third ingredient is Artificial Flavor, even though the front of the box has the word "Natural" on it and the packaging certainly gives the appearance of a natural product.  I called Good Earth and spoke to the manager of consumer affairs to find out what chemical they were putting into the flaver.  Guess what.  That information is proprietary.  Guess the artifical chemicals they are pumping into their tea are bad enough that they won't even relase that information to their consumers.  Shame on you GoodEarth!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F6SNPS">Good Earth Original Caffeine Free, Tea Bags, 18-Count, Boxes (Pack of 6)  [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]
