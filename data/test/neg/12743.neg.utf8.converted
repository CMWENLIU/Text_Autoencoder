Wait a minute....Are you guys actually charging 30 bucks for two 9 oz canisters? I paid $5 for one from the grocery store an hour ago. What a complete rip off!!!! And what's worse is that the product itself isn't as healthy as Planters wants you to believe it is. It's made with sugar and oil. The ingredients should be nothing but fruit and nuts to be really healthy.
