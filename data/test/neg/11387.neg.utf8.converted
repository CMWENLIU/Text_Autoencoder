I love Tazo Chai concentrate (just heat with milk) and this nothing close.  It has a very strong artificial taste.  It Smells good, but tastes strongly of powdered non-dairy creamer and way too much sweet and low (those pink packets of sweetener).  Too bad, because it is a great idea and I really wanted to like this.
