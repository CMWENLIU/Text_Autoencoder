This product ships in great packaging and it looks good, but the taste... horrible. In fact, there is not much one can do wrong with good fresh crab legs, just steam/boil, and freeze to ship. They added salt to the legs while cooking so much so that it tasted not only bad in my opinion, but my cat did not eat them either.<br />So, save your money, and go to any local store that carries the king crab legs, I bet you they are not worse then the ones I had to throw away.
