DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT AN AUTHENTIC WASABI TASTE! The ingredients on the amazon site lists: Horseradish and mustard. For those of you who care about preservatives and anything artificial this definitely is not your product. Here is a list of the ingredients: Horseradish, Corn flour, mustard, Vit. C, Artificial Flavor, Artificial Color (FD&C Yellow #5 + Blue #1). After receiving the product #1 the picture on Amazon's website was not what I received. I got the plastic container but not the nice red label, just a white label that looked as if it was printed from a home printer. #2 I can not return this product so I am out $16. #3 This fake wasabi tastes like crap, lack of flavor, and has no spice to it. I highly recommend to all, pay the extra for real wasabi, it is sooooo worth it!
