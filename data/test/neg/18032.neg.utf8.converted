I bought these 'retriever rolls' for my 18 month old yellow lab.  He went through most of one in an evening.  They are not very compressed and unroll easily.  He got his teeth attached to the end that was unrolling, put his paws on the roll, pulled hard and basically unrolled it like fruit leather.  The rolls don't hold up as long as others and I won't be reordering them.
