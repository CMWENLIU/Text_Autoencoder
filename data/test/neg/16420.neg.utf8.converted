I've purchased this from Costco when the vanilla I purchased from my cruise in Mexico ran out.  I've always been pleased with the products from the Kirkland Signature Brand but after I used this I poured the whole bottle down the sink.  I guess I've been spoiled after using such a high quality of vanilla and frankly I can never go back to using sub par vanilla in my baking.  But that goes for all vanilla here in the US, so sad we can't have a company that sells superior vanilla here too.
