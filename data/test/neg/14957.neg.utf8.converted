Very Disappointed in this.<br /><br />So much so, that I was inspired to write my first review.<br /><br />This products labeling is just wrong:<br /><br />1) I called the company stating any cocoa has caffeine, so it cannot be 99% caffeine free.<br />They said it has 30 mg CAFFEINE per 2 tsp. serving which is too little for a good flavor.<br /><br />2) IT TAKES MORE than 2 tsp. per serving or tastes very watered down & not creamy. I<br />  I required 2 TBSP for 12 oz. water<br /><br />3) IT WASN'T SWEET at all, just enough to cut the bitter - I assume.<br />  So I preferred adding a regular amount of Stevia for a better taste.<br /><br />I suggest anyone give Hills Bros Sugar free french vanilla cappuccino a try.<br />Besides tasting great, you'll only get 30mg max. of caffeine for a satisfying 12 oz. serving.<br /><br />Bon Appetit
