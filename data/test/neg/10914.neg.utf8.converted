The first time I posted my experience, six readers immediately disagreed with it (obviously they felt they knew far better than I whether FRS Healthy Energy provided me with any "lift").  I withdrew the review, but upon reflection I've regretted my decision to do so.  Whether or not the product "worked" for an individual is necessarily personal and anecdotal, one person's report.  It's hardly a matter for disagreement--unless the responder is intent upon promoting an agenda.<br /><br />All of the FRS products have ingredients likely to be familiar to users of "energy" drinks, powders, supplements, and bites: sugar, corn syrup, fructose, caffeine, green tea extract. The drink also offers the MDR for key vitamins along with antioxidant activity from the green tea leaves and, most importantly, "quercetin," a bioflavanoid that is used in red wine replacement capsules as a highly potent free radical scavenger.  While "quercetin" is widely recognized as an effective blood toner, conditioner, and "bad" cholesterol reducer, FRS is prominently promoting it as an energizer, capable of "extending" the body's natural adrenaline "and" removing the "oxidants that cause fatigue."  A controversial statement, backed by little controlled studies, especially if the inference is that quercetin will provide an immediate "lift."<br /><br />Of course, FRS points out that it's not simply the individual ingredients that provide increased energy but an optimal, catalytic combination that promotes thermogenesis, increases metabolic rate, and helps the body make efficient use of carbohydrates.  So it's possible the product has worked for many (besides Mr. Armstrong).  If so, testimonials on its behalf deserve to be taken seriously by any curious, health-minded individuals.<br /><br />The powdered drink mix perhaps makes the most sense to start with, and the chewy bites the least (the sugar in the bites actually had a paradoxical effect, momentarily enervating rather than energizing me).  The drink is flavorable enough, with a convincing fresh-fruitish "tang," and not overly sweet.  But in my case it did not counteract either the late-morning or late-afternoon "crashes" and obviate the need for that extra expresso or two.<br /><br />If you choose to try the product, be exceptionally careful about the apparently generous internet offer, endorsed by Mr. Armstrong, of a complete sample kit of the products sent free of charge (with the exception of postage and handling costs).  The merchandising tactics of FRS are practically antithetical to the full-disclosure, consumer-centric policies of a site like Amazon.  (If Bezos offered everyone a free Kindle, saying it's yours to keep if you don't like it, I'd have full confidence in his offer; FRS employs more deceptive, misleading tactics that could result in your admittance to a pricey club before you even realized you were a member.)<br /><br />So put Lance Armstrong and his company (he's part owner) to the test, but order the products through Amazon to avoid unwanted hassle, hustle and hype.  If you decide the product is for you, then is the time to inquire into the benefits of being a member of the club.
