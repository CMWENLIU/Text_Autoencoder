It is unfortunate that the wording of this item description doesn't make it clear that this is artificial flavor. Real vanilla is always brown because vanilla beans are brown. The artificial vanillas are by-products of wood processing and contain petro chemicals.  Do your taste buds and body a favor - use the real stuff even though your cake/frosting will not be pure white.
