I don't normally use mixes in my bread machine because it is so very easy to start everything from scratch.  But I saw this Fleischmann's Sour Dough boxed mix and couldn't resist.  While doing my research I did run across several reviews which mentioned "dead" yeast for other mix types.  I'm thinking that had to be my problem this morning.<br /><br />Instead of using yeast from my fresh jar in the refrigerator, I followed the instructions exactly by adding the water, the flour mix, and then the yeast packet included in the box.  Three and a half hours later I have a brick of bread.  There was practically no rise at all.  The bread has a quite interesting sour dough tang and we will certainly eat the bread, but it is definitely not 'gift giving' quality.<br /><br />When I bake up the remaining packs from this order I will definitely proof the packet of yeast from the box before I trust it in my loaf.  Quite an interesting thought process there, I trust the Fleischmann's in my jar but not the Fleischmann's in the mix container.  And before you wonder, no, the expiration date on the package had not passed.<br /><br />My lesson:  proof any yeast that is included in a packaged mix!
