Palatable for kids but that's about the best I can say about them.  On par with the more mediocre generic instant hot chocolates, but at the cost per cup for these should be much better.  Making a 4oz cup and bolstering the flavor with 2% milk is required even to get a child to drink them.  My advice is to pick up an alternative brand's seasonal premium hot chocolate for the K-cup makers and skip this Green Mountain/Cafe Escapes variety- as these are disappointing at best.<br /><br />Avoid if possible, but not a total waste.  Consider my 2 stars as "generous."
