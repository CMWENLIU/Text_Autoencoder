The feedback I got for the quality of this product was fabulous.  The problem was that they sent me an email that they had shipped all three of my orders out on December 12th.  It turns out they only shipped one.  I kept waiting for my friends to say something and didn't want to appear rude and ask about it.  Finally, I got an email that the remaining two orders, which had supposedly already been sent (confirmed by a second email, not the first order confirmation) were in fact being sent ground UPS on December 23rd.  This was outrageous.  Miraculously, they both arrived by the 24th but it was only because of the diligence of UPS.  This company almost screwed my Christmas.
