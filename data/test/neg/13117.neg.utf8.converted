I have been using flaxseed meal over the past three years; I would use them on almost everything from salad, soup to baking good. And, among several different suppliers on the market, I like Bob's Red Mill best for its reasonable price and trusty brand name.<br /><br />However, the latest batches I ordered were not nearly as good as before. They are dark, coarse (most is barely gridded), and BITTER!!!<br /><br />Check if yours with sell-by date later than 10/2008.
