I am so disappointed that the manufacturer has drastically changed the formulation of this food.  It can no longer be considered a healthy food.  Amazon has not changed its info, which is irresponsible because customers are buying based on the info presented here.  The real ingredient list is:<br /><br />Lamb Lungs, Wheat Flour, Sugar, Lamb, Wheat Bran, Lamb Hearts, Salt, Rice Flour.<br /><br />So basically, it's like feeding your dog a lamb-flavored doughnut. Sugar as the third ingredient?! More sugar than actual lamb?  Why not just label it "lamb candy"...?<br /><br />Sad. My dog loved this food.  Well, no wonder, I guess.  I love doughnuts, too... but I don't eat them.
