I was very excited to receive these M&Ms, however, they were a huge disappointment. They do not taste like pina colada or little morsels of heaven. They taste like m&ms with a hint of artificial imitation coconut flavor. The 5 star average over 16 reviews won me over and I bought these at more than a dollar per package. In retrospect, I can't believe I paid vending machine prices for a "grocery store" purchase. Finally, YMMV, but more than half of my packages had broken M&Ms and about one third had large clusters of M&Ms that had melted and then fused together. 3 star product, -1 star for the price, and subtract another for the condition. Ugh.
