I came across these when I was hunting for a product to soothe morning sickness, and they came with such stellar reviews that I had to try them.  I am even a fan of baking with ginger, but I found these to be far too strong for me.  Oh yes, for a brief moment they took my mind off my nausea while I ran frantically to get water to put out the fire in my mouth they caused!  Not for the weak of heart.
