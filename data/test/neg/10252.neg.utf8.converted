When I received my shipment of Milka chocolates from Euro Food Mart, they were already stale! I opened the first chocolate bar and more than half of it was discolored and obviously stale. I find it suspicious that the expiration date was coming up in six months yet the chocolate was already stale, and when i wrote to the customer service department of this company they told me I had to pay return shipping to send back the unopened chocolates for them to refund me. This is not the right way to do business and I am never buying anything from this company again. They should pay for the return shipping since I already paid a $10 shipping fee for this company to send me stale chocolates.
