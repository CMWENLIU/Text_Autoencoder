I purchased this because it sounded so good. We love the Donut House decaf (and my husband would not drink and decaf before we found this brand). I was hoping this would be as yummy as it sounds, even tho I had read many negative reviews. I am really not that picky. I love most coffee, especially flavored unless it is very "fake" tasting flavor. Save your money on this one. Unfortunately, this is pretty awful tasting, even after I tried to "doctor" it up with syrup and cream. The nicest thing I can say about it is it smells good while brewing.
