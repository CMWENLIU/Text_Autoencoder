About a month ago, I sent one of these sheets to my dorm-living daughter.  She loves Rice Krispies Treats, and I thought that these would be a good substitute for the ones I usually make.  After all, they're the best she's going to get with no kitchen facilities.<br /><br />Last weekend, my daughter came home, lugging these under her arm.  "None of the girls would eat them for the calories, and the boys wanted to eat the whole thing by themselves.  So, it's comin' home."<br /><br />I decided to open the package and have a square.  I looked for a re-closable zipper, but the package has none.  It didn't have any directions for opening, so I opened one end and tried to slide out the treat.  Yeah,right.  After much turmoil, I ended up with a giant treat stuck to cardboard on one side and with strips of colored mylar hanging from the other.  I picked off the strips of mylar with my nails, which made just opening this package a longer chore than making Rice Krispie Treats from scratch. (As much as you can say that)<br /><br />I cut the giant treat in squares, and kept thinking I was missing something.  Then I realized it!  I didn't smell the faint cooked sugar and butter smell that I get when I make the treats myself.  These smelled like corn syrup.  They cut easily enough, which is something you can't always say about the homemade kind.  But when I lifted the treat to have a taste, I realized why it was so easy to cut.  It's gummy and gooey, with lots of "stuff" between the little puffs of cereal.  It has a lot more marshmallow to cereal than the ones made by the recipe on the side of the Rice Krispies box.  I like the cereal, and the normal smell and the firmer texture of the homemade treats.<br /><br />I like the taste of the homemade treats, too -- and these didn't have it.  They tasted more like a candy bar than a bunch of marshmallows melted in a bit of butter (or margarine, which I don't use)  and mixed with a box of Rice Krispies.  There was an overwhelming rush of sugar, and the corn syrup featured prominently in the taste of the bars.  There was an aftertaste I couldn't recognize, which I will attribute to being carried back and forth to college.  Have to be fair, you know.<br /><br />I gave it two stars for convenience.  If you don't have a kitchen and you want a Rice Krispie Treat, then this is the only way you're going to get one. The packaging needs work, though.  Expecting this to taste homemade probably isn't fair, but since this costs more and bills itself as "the Original," I'm going to keep comparing the two.  And in that comparison, this loses badly.  Make the things yourself in a few minutes and wrap in buttered foil before shipping them to a friend. It might be a little messy, but it will also be worlds tastier.
