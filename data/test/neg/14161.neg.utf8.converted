This item is not like any cookie I've ever met.  I am not sure what to call it.  It's large, 3 oz. and 300 calories.  It looks like a thick patty.  It is dense and chewy.  I bought the double chocolate chunk flavor.  It has a mild cocoa flavor with notes of prune and bitter coffee. It is only slightly sweet, and has a hint of medicinal quality.  Though listed in the ingredients, I could not find a single chocolate chunk that was large enough to differentiate from the rest of the heavy, soft patty.  Most of the doughy thing is chewable but there are small grains of something that are distinctly harder and got caught in the cusps of my molars.<br /><br />If you are too busy to enjoy your food or can't taste anything anyway, maybe these are for you.  For me, when I spend 300 calories, even on the run, I want something that makes my mouth happy.  Half a whole wheat English muffin, a tablespoon of natural peanut butter, half a banana sliced on top.  All around better! And no messier to eat because these patties are crumbly and a slightly sticky.  You'll have bits on your upholstry and traces on the steering wheel.<br /><br />Reformulate, Erin!  Food should be a healthy PLEASURE.
