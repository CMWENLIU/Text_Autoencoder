I've had and enjoyed the TGY tea in the past so I knew what to expect. This tea was disappointing. The flavor is too strong and of a rather rancid quality. The leaves were very dried out and there was much powder in the tin. This is certainly not authentic TGY, the flavor is quite far off the mark. Other tea's I've under the label "Golden Dragon" have been less then spectacular imitations of other famous Chinese teas. This is by far the worst. I now avoid the all Golden Dragon label tea, it is low quality
