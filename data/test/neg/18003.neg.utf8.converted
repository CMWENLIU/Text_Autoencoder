I like organic. We do organic milk and meat (and vegetables when we can afford them).  My children like macaroni and cheese - not my homemade casserole that I sweat and work over--of course lol).  But only Mac that comes out of a box. [My hubby likes my casserole btw]<br /><br />In any case, you would think organic *Back to Nature Macaroni & Cheese* that comes out of the box would be popular at our house but it's not. Simple put, my children won't eat it.  We have tried three different kinds --white cheddar, regular, and special shapes--all with the same results.<br /><br />Perhaps it is because of the *lack of chemicals* that the cheese sauce comes out a little grainy. Or maybe I just made it wrong, but my testy tikes won't gobble this down like non-organic, over-processed wheat Kraft Mac.<br /><br />Two Stars. Maybe I just had a couple of bad boxes. Or maybe I just didn't make it right that day, but my two (boy and girl) would not eat this macaroni and cheese product. If you are going to try it (products do get IMPROVED every day) then my advice would be to buy ONE box and try it; and not a case.
