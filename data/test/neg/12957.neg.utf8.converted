The item I purchased said 28oz and I received a 12oz bag and also they were not the same product I purchased in the Maui Costco, the ones that I purchased had fresh coconut around the macadamia nut, these are coconut mixed in the chocolate, not very good.  The name and brand is exactly the same as what I purchased but different product inside.
