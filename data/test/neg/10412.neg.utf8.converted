I've tried several of the Hint Essence Water flavors so I always get excited when I see a new flavor.  These drinks are basically water with a hint of natural fruit flavor.  They have no calories or added sugar (or artificial sweetener) so they are great for someone who is watching their calories and trying to avoid artificial sweetener while still seeking out great flavors.  They really are true to the hint name.  They taste more like a water lightly infused with fruit than a strong fruit juice.<br /><br />Sadly, this was my least favorite of all the flavors.  I liked it the least because while the other flavors like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTP12K">Hint Essence Water Pear, 16-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTL2QE">Hint Essence Water Honeydew Hibiscus, 16-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a> taste true to the natural flavors they are named after this one tasted pretty artificial.  It reminded me more of a Fruit 2 O drink.  I'd recommend it only if the artificial nature of the flavor doesn't bother you.  Otherwise I'd recommend the Pear and Honeydew Hibiscus flavors over this one.<br /><br />If trying this water taught me anything it's that the flavors can be hit or miss so I think I would definitely not order a case of a flavor without having tried it first.
