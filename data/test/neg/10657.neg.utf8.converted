Roger That!<br /><br />After two years in my bin, I uncovered black moist compost and...wait for it....UN-decomposed green bags.  What the heck?  "Compostable" bags that do not Compost.  Have returned to putting everything in my compost can and just dumping into the bin and then rinsing-out the can.
