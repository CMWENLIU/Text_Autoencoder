The second ingredient in this product, after peanuts, is evaporated cane juice. This is pure sucrose which elevates your blood triglycerides level. The next two ingredients are honey and natural honey flavor. ?? Then Palm Fruit Oil and salt. Looking at the label I was expecting peanut butter mixed with honey, period. Amazon needs to start listing ingredients. I would not buy this product again.
