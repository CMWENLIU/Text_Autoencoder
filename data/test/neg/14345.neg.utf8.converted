We're pretty avid Whole Foods shoppers now, and have felt pretty good about purchasing organic baby food for our now 9.5 month old son.  Earth's Best brand has been popular with him, so we bought these teething biscuits recently.  Today, he could have died eating one.<br /><br />Although I'm an anesthesiologist, and half of my job is to "protect people's airways", one needn't be a medical professional to realize why these biscuits are dangerous.  Most babies get their front teeth (upper and lower incisors) first, long before molars arrive.  So, they're limited to biting with their front teeth, and only mashing with their gums (where their molars will someday erupt).  These biscuits are great for the first 5 minutes, baby happily chomping away on the hard surface.  Then, they soften.  Pretty soon, baby bites clean through the biscuit with their front teeth (size of chunk depending on how far they had inserted it into their mouth at the time), and the chunk that remains in their mouth is WAY too hard to mash with gums.  Baby has nothing to do but try to spit it out (difficult at this age), or swallow it whole (if lucky enough for it to be a small piece), or have it completely occlude their airway.  We were able to quickly fish one large chunk out with our fingers, but our poor soon started gagging, tearing, and wretched once before something resolved (still don't know if he swallowed a large piece or if it ended up on ground), but not before we scooped him up and tried to knock it loose with some back blows.<br /><br />In any case, although the kids may love these, all it would take would be one infant death from choking to prompt a recall or something.  Why risk your own kid?
