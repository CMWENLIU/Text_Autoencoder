I am surprised (NOT) that they will not list the ingredients of the spices on any of their products. Even after emailing their cust support folks, Pacific is not going to tell you what is in them, which makes me wonder if MSG in its myriads of forms sometimes called yeast extract, torula yeast or citric acid is part of their soups as a preservative. Why hide your ingredients Pacific?
