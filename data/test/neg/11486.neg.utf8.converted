Proflowers say they only buy flowers that are ethically grown, too bad they don't have as much respect for their customers. It's nice to know that they'll stand by hate mongers like Rush while they go about calling socially conscious women "sluts" and "prostitutes". It's nice because it means that I can cross them off the list of potential florists this coming Easter.<br /><br />ProFlowers, the misogynist's choice.
