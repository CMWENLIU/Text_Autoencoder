I'm kind of addicted to pomegranates at the moment, so when I saw this product I decided to give it a try.  I was looking for a nice energy boost since my workouts have been getting a little more regimented, so I figured this could be the start of something nice.  What I didn't expect (and maybe this is a common occurrence in the `energy drink' market that I'm just not privy to) was for this product to have the consistency and texture of medicine.  Seriously, it was like drinking `Airborne' or `Alka-Seltzer'.  The minute I poured the packet it began to fizz, which was an instant turn off, and then once I had it stirred in (which it never really completely dissolved) I tasted it and it was rather chalky.  I was an unpleasant experience to say the least.  The flavor was NOT pomegranate, or if it was it was so faint that it was completely swallowed up by the chalky medicinal overtone.  Maybe the other flavors are better, but as far as I'm concerned I'm not quick to reach for another packet of these.  The energy boost was marginal, nothing extraordinary enough to validate drinking this mixture again.
