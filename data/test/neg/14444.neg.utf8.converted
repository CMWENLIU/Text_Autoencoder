I used the same amount of coffee to make a full pot and the Cameron's coffee is very, very weak.  My husband wouldn't drink it.  I mix it with a stronger blend so that it won't get wasted.  Trying the French roast next.  Thought the flavor was nice and not bitter but you'd have to use triple or more measures to make a good pot.  The pricing is good, hope to find a blend that we like.
