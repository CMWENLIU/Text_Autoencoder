Prior to trying this we had been using the ghirardelli hot chocolate packets for the Keurig machine.  My kids hated this product.  It tasted like water on the 7.25oz setting on the B70 machine.  I also tried it using the 5oz setting and adding it to coffee.  It was pretty much tasteless. The K-cups may be more convenient but there is no comparison in taste.  My kids prefer the packets and so do I.
