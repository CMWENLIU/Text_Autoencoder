Horrendous texture and even worse taste!  Bar was waxy, dense and bland tasting with NO semblence of pecan pie flavor whatsoever.  My expectations were reasonable considering that this is a nutritional product rather than an actual slice of pecan pie, but it was so awful I had to throw it away after 2 bites, followed by a thorough rinse-and-spit session with a glass of cold water.  Blah!  Sorry Larabar,  I tried to like you...
