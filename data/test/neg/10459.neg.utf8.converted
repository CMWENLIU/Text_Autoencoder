I make cupcakes and ordered these because the description said the product had "chocolate" centers (like sixlets).  I wanted chocolate or soft centers specifically so there isn't a hard bite to anything on the cupcakes. I ordered several colors only to find they are like sweet tarts inside. They do taste good and they are beautifully made with pretty color and sheen, but overall I am dissapointed because it isn't what I ordered.  If you order these, just be prepared they are NOT chocolate!!!!!
