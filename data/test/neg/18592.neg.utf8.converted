Got this litter because my cat was having a respiratory problem.<br /><br />As soon as I poured this into our 2 Cat boxes, my home became inundated with a strong chemical smell.<br />I have an aprox. 850sf apt. and it permeated everything in my home.  I got rid of it this a.m. and I can still smell it, even on my clothes!<br />This litter is also made in China which doesn't exactly have a great track record with our pets.<br />I have since found a benign safe litter- Feline Fresh- which smells of pine and hopefully won't hurt my cats or us.<br />It also doesn't cut down any trees in the process.<br /> It's a win-win!  And it is made in the USA.<br /> Update: Feline Fresh is too dusty!<br /> Have switched to Feline Pine.<br /><br />The bottom line:  Just sticking with the pine litter, my cat has stopped coughing!!!  Yea, pine!!!!!
