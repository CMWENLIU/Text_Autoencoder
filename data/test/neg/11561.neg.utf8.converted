I purchased the  pink powdered sugar by Wilton,  thinking since the list price was 9.99 that I would be getting a 16 oz size.  The price had been reduced to 1.49, sale price.  When a finally received the pink powdered sugar, I received 3 oz.  No way was this originally worth 9.99.  They did not list the  ounces in the advertisement.  It led you to believe that you would be receiving more. Not good. Bad reflection on Amazon and Jo-Anns.
