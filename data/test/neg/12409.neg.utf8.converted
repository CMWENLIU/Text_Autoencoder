I found this baking mix to be horrible, to be blunt.  It has a bad smell and taste and bakes up gummy and spongy.  I know it's a low-carb product, but honestly, I can make my own up and it tastes MUCH better than this stuff.  Not to mention, it's ridiculously over priced, especially for what you get (the aforementioned poor taste and smell)<br /><br />If you have an extra $12 - that's what I spent - to throw away on a few cups of flour, go ahead.  But, don't say I didn't warn you! :)
