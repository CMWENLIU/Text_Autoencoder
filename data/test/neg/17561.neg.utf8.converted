First of all, I love amazon.com and I have always enjoyed the convenience of making a few clicks to purchace almost anything I want and get it delivered right away. I rarely write product reviews but I think I should this time to let others know what I have found out. If you have Asian grocery store within driving distance and you would like to get this product, I recommend you get it from there or at least make a trip to check out the price. I was shocked to find out that I could have gotten this product for 10 dollars less (it is $19.95 at the store). The product itself is OK - it wasn't as soft as they said it is so I cook with "brown rice mode" with my rice cooker. To be honest, I cannot really tell the difference from the regular brown rice, but I am a big fan of Koshihikari (premium short grain rice) so I think I will continue to buy this product unless I find better alternatives - but never from Amazon again!!
