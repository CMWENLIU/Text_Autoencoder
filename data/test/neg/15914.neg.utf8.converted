These nuts are hard to find at my local market.  Ordering online has been easy.  My last order from Amazon arrived, and the coating on the nuts tasted burnt.  The coloring was off.  Perhaps it's a one off mistake, but Amazon did not include paperwork to return the nuts for exchange.  When these nuts are right, they are great!
