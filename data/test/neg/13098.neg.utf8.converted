I had the most wonderful orange spice tea in a hotel recently and even took some bags home to enjoy. It was Lipton Orange Gardens. I ordered this orange herbal thinking it was the same one but it is not even close. Although the ingredients look the same this one is like water compared to the deep rich orange spice tea I got from the hotel. I went to the Lipton site and there are several orange teas and the one called Orange Gardens is under the food service section available to hotels and other food services like cruises etc.. I did find it searching on Google though and it looks like it is available from one company. If you like very weak mild flavored tea then this orange herbal is for you. It's not bad it's just way to weak for my taste. If you like a strong aromatic, robust and very tasty tea look for the Orange Gardens it is amazing!
