I purchased a Bear Naked chocolate / peanut butter granola cereal first part of last year 2009. The Peanut<br />Butter recall came out. I asked the Bear Naked company if this cereal was involved in the recall. They said no<br />it was not. I still did not open the cereal. Then 3 weeks later I actually found it on the recall list. Then they<br />listed it on their site. I inquired again and asked for a refund. Sent several emails and received no response.<br />They do not back their own products. They were apparently using crappy peanuts in there own cereal and did not even know the source of the peanuts. Can't trust them on any of there items. I never got a refund. This company cannot be trusted. Stay away.
