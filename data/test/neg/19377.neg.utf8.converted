I used to love Plum Organics, and this one is actually really tasty.  My toddler loved it.  That is, until this last shipment batch, which was completely sour/spoiled.  I looked for the expiration date, and that is still within range.  It was however, really really bad.  I ended up throwing away the entire big box of it.  Very disappointed.
