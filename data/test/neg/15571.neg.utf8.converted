Despite what some reviewers think, "Black Lava Salt," while being "black" and being "salt" has nothing to do with lava. It is sea salt from any of many places around the world that is colored black with activated charcoal. Largely a decorative item. You could take Kosher salt and make this stuff yourself, I suppose. As a geologist, this current paroxysm about different salts seem inexplicable. NaCl is NaCl (or the mineral halite). Your taste buds are attuned to it in a very restrictive sense, regardless of the presence or absence of trace amounts of coloring stuff--it all tastes virtually the same--your tongue sees to that. Spend you gourmet $$ some more useful way!<br /><br />By the way, a pinkish-orange coloring in NaCl may be KCl (commercially, "nosalt"), known as the mineral silvite. It has a distinctively bitter bite. (Another tongue taste option.) Maybe some folks like their salt on the bitter side, but most gourmets would probably cringe at the thought of tossing bitter salt on good food.
