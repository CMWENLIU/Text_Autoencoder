but unfortunately, it was, to me, really unpalatable. I'm generally not picky when it comes to sugar substitutes - I get that nothing is going to match sugar exactly in taste. But oh boy, the luo han just doesn't do it for me. If you are ok with that sweetener, then you might just find this to be a great syrup. But, to others, I recommend you try luo han first before ordering.
