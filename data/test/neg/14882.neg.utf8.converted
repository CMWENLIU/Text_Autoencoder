I wish I'd read the reviews more carefully, because like all of the other reviewers, I thought that this item might have more than just 16 bars, given that the price was at least twice or three times the regular cost of a box of larabars.  And it was a bunch of random bars thrown into a plastic bag, not even taped into a misleading factory box, as the other reviewer's had been.<br /><br />Bottom line, what you see in the picture, 16 bars of different flavors, is what you get.  In my mind that's a rip-off.  For that money, I could have gotten two boxes of 24, but I did have the convenience of being able to try all the different flavors and not being stuck with 23 of one variety that I wasn't fond of.
