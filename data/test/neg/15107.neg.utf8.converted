This product is marketed (see Nutella website) as 1. Healthy -- yet the first ingredient is SUGAR!  Also their FAQs say there are no peanuts -- seems more honest (and safe for peanut allergy sufferers) to say no peanuts BUT not safe if you have peanut allergies because it has peanut oil!  And with sugar, hydrogenated oil and artificial flavor, who in the world (except the marketers) would call this healthy?  Why would anyone buy a product marketed with such deceit?  Ingredients listed are Sugar, Peanut oil, Hazelnuts, Cocoa, Skim Milk, Reduced Minerals, Whey, Partially Hydrogenated Peanut Oil, Soy Lecithin: an Emulsifier, Vanillin, and Artificial Flavor.  This list is from Amazon, because I didn't find an ingredient list on Nutella's site.
