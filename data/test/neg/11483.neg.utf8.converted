ProFlowers are always wilted. They are very slow to respond to requests no matter how you try to get in touch with them. I would never recommend anyone use their service. If you try to get things straightened out with their company, it will not work because they have terrible customer service and an out of touch public relations department for that matter. If you are looking for flowers for a special person, they will not appreciate knowing you sent flowers from ProFlowers. Please use another company to insure the proper quality that we all expect from a professional company.
