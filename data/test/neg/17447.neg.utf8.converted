We ordered these Bully Sticks on 2 separate occasions. Our yellow Lab loves them and the quality is pretty good. Our first shipment that we tried went off without a hitch, so when we started to run low, we ordered another batch. Unfortunately the second batch only had 23 bully sticks in the package. the package looked less full then our first which is why I counted it to make sure there were 30 pieces. I didn't count my first order unfortunately... Though my dog loves these, I will probably try another vendor that had better quality control of the pieces in their packages.
