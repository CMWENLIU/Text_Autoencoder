i ordered these from wag.com not checking reviews first. wish i had.<br />i gave these to my 6 months old puppy, and he's had horrible diarrhea for a day and a half.<br />just came back home to a puppy with diarrhea AND BLEEDING. yes, bleeding. not 'some' bleeding, but significant bleeding (not a hemorrhage either).<br />my puppy is very healthy otherwise, and i haven't changed anything else on his diet, except for these new treats.<br /><br />i am typing this review from the vet's office.
