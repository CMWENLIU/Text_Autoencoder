I was interested in trying hemp protein, I've heard and read raving reviews of the protein.  When I got it I was excited to try it, directions say to mix 3 tbls with 8 oz milk, but they recommend almond milk.  I opened the tub and was briefly set back by the smell and green color.  But I trucked on anyway.  I mixed it up with my wand mixer, but it didn't fully blend.  It did not dissolve fully, even after extended blending.  Still gritty.  The taste, like the smell was like broccoli.  The drink was like milky broccoli... it was gross.  I would have givent it 1 star, but if you can get past the taste the nutriontal value is very good, just not for me.
