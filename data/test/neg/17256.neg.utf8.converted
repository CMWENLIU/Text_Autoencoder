There is no smoke or burger taste at all in this. This was a big let down.  There is an overwhelming bean taste. Reminds me of Hot dog chili without the chili powder. The texture is the same as chili. Not solid enough to cut and fry. I tried.  So the  only use for this is chili or no meat sauce.<br /><br />If you want a burger or burger sub, then do not buy.<br />Should call it redi ground.
