As the title says, please consider that this is more of a comment on the shipping cost, not the product itself.  For the record, I'd rate the product at 5 star, I don't know if it's just the use of sugar over corn syrup, or if the formula is a bit different, but these I feel taste much better then corn syruped based coca cola classing in the USA.<br /><br />Anyway, I was going to order these, since sugar based Coke and Pepsi both are sometimes hard to get in my area, and their price per bottle is a lot cheaper then the other resellers here.  Until I saw that the shipping was a good $26.00 or so, at least as of March 21, 2012.  So, the REAL price is about $37.00 or so.  Yes, I do understand that 12-12 ounce bottles is heavy.  BUT, one can get, including shipping, 24 bottles of the exact same product for only about 10 dollars more from one reseller here, albeit one has to be an amazon.com prime subscriber.  Still, with the shipping this goes from a decent deal for ordering soda pop online to a terrible one, even for mexican coke made with sugar IMO.
