There are no words sufficient to describe how horrible these taste, but I will try. There is NO chocolate taste, but rather, a burnt chemical-flavored filling that bears no resemblance to ANY chocolate I've ever eaten, and I've eaten a lot of chocolate. The shell is flavorless, with a slightly crispy but quickly evaporating dust-like consistency. That it also looks like cheap dog food only makes it worse. How Kellogg's could get this one past their tasting panels is beyond me, but if it's chocolate you're looking for, buy something else. If it's dust you want, look under your bed and save some money. If it's dog food you're after, consider your dog's happiness and buy dog food. And the one thing you will NOT be doing after you taste these God-awful little morsels is craving them.
