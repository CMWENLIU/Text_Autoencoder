I would give this company zero stars if I could. I purchased these flowers for my grandmother's birthday, but she never received them. When I contacted the company's cutomer service, I was told that the flowers were delivered, but no one was home, so they were left at the front door of the house (company doesn't have a receipt signature policy). I was also told that I cannot receive a refund or a delivery with signature. As far as I know any reputable company would leave a note to pick up their item from the local USPS if no one is home and would not leave it at the door. Hopefully Better Business Bureau resolves this issue.
