I am deeply saddened by the new "blend" which includes almonds. It tastes nothing like the original if you ask me- way to gritty and I can barely taste hazelnut. I am hoping that enough complaints will spark their interest to go Back to the original recipe- which was outstanding! Wish I stocked up on some original jars a while back... I shall try and make my own that comes close so I can get my fix in I suppose...
