The first ingredient is sugar, the second is nondairy creamer which is made of corn syrup solids, partially hydrogenated coconut oil, sodium casenate dipotassium phosphate etc. There isn't anything real about this product. In addition, these artificial ingredients are some of the worse for your health. The claim that it has 0 trans fat and so it's okay to ingest, doesn't tell the true story - that hydrogenated coconut oil is terrible for peoples health (cholesterol). What's even odder is that coffee (instant) is way down the list, and as far as pumpkin, well there isn't a drop of pumpkin or spice to be found!<br /><br />However, if you're one that doesn't sweat the ingredients list, I can say that as advertised this instant (just add boiling water or hot milk) coffee pumpkin spice drink does produce a frothy latte foam (reminds one of a chemical reaction in science class). The color is of a milky light tea. The taste is very sweet, and vaguely reminds one of cinnamon stick. Overall, not the best choice for a cold fall eve.
