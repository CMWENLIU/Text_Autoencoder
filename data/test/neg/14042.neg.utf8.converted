Who ever wrote the other reviews saying that this stuff was sour either<br />a) works for the company that produces this candy or<br />b) have not ate anything sour before and should get out of the sour candy review business.<br /><br />This candy is not bad, but it definitely is not very sour.  Do not buy if you are under the impression that this will be super sour candy.
