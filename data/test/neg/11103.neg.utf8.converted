Online it lists the ingredients as tea and "Yellow FD&C #6", which is a food grade dye.  On the bag I got it was listed as "Yellow FD&C #7" which can be poisonous.  I made a small glass of iced tea and within a short time was nauseous and had pain in my stomach - I felt like I was poisoned and came close to going to the hospital.  Fortunately, after taking a few charcoal supplements  and drinking lots of water it started to feel a bit better.  I looked up #7 and it is for topical testing not ingestion and ingestion can cause a number of severe reactions, fortunately mine wasn't worse.  I don't think other countries have the same regulations on dyes that we do - so be careful when you get the tea to read the bag and see which dye was used.
