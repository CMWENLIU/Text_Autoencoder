With all the high reviews maybe we just got a bad batch because I wasn't impressed at all. I have had tuna packed in water in the past and you could just crack the top open slightly and drain the water out leaving nice flake tuna. When I tried this with the first can nothing came out. I went ahead and opened the can all the way. The contents looked like mush loaded with white fatty grease. I tried scooping some of the fat off the top but it went well beyond the top. I gave it 2 stars rather than one since after making it into tuna salad with mayo and relish and such, it didn't taste bad. The initial look of it alone though made it difficult to enjoy. The cat doesn't seem to mind it. I won't buy it again.
