I knew nothing about Manuka honey but wanted to see what it would do about a burn on my hand so I bought a jar from Whole Foods that had no name on the label but on the side it said "packed by Arataki for Pacific Resources International." It did improve my burn very much and I was sold! So I read up about Manuka honey and went and bought Wedderspoon 16+. It was LESS effective than the non-name 5+ jar. However, then I tried some local raw wildflower honey and it was just as effective as the 5+, and tasted better, and was a lot cheaper...<br /><br />The NIH tested four types of raw honey. They found that Manuka did have a higher level of antibacterial properties, but it was not as high as something called mountain honey. They didn't specify which mountain and also didn't indicate the level of Manuka. Also, ALL honey clears skin blemishes. Manuka may be better for internal problems as stated - I don't know about that - but I'm sticking with the local raw stuff for $10 a jar. I think wildflower honey is the best because who knows where the manuka bees go anyway? They probably go all over the place unless they are confined.<br /><br />Also, the UMF stands for "Unique Manuka Factor" ??? Seriously?? Why is it that they have a scientific explanation for the benefits of other honeys but not for the "special" benefits of manuka? Maybe the anti bacterial effects don't break down but then why not just go with local honey? What's so difficult about doing a chemical analysis of manuka against other honeys and finding the difference?<br /><br />So I say that if you have money to burn, definitely support your favorite New Zealand honey farmer! Why not? Otherwise you can find a better deal LOL!
