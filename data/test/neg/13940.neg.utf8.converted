SUMMARY: If you're looking for a dark roast with full flavor for your Tassimo, keep looking. Hey -- it's Maxwell House after all. Check out the newer Gevalia Dark Roasts.<br /><br />DETAIL: After Starbucks severed its relationship with Kraft, I was looking for a decent brew for my Tassimo brewer. The Maxwell House French Roast was Kraft's early attempt at this, and it disappoints. It's OK if you stop the brew short, but it's a bit weak if you let it go full cycle. It's arguably the best Maxwell House offering, but it's no Starbucks.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: If you miss Starbucks, but want to keep the flexibility of the Tassimo, check out the three Gevalia Dark Roasts (Breakfast, House, and Italian), as these more closely resemble Starbuck's Breakfast, House, and Verona blends, respectively. These three form the core of my one-cup brewing, supplemented by a number of espressos and cremas available (Mastro Lorenzo being my fav).
