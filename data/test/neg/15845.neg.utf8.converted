I was thoroughly shocked by the price and contents of the Blue Buffalo Wilderness Dog Jerky Treats package.  $9.99 is too much for 3.5 ounces.  I opened the package and there were about 4 square pieces and the rest crumbs.  Not only that the description didn't indicate 3.5 ounces.  Needless to say I won't be buying this product for my ShihTzu again - way too expensive for what you get.
