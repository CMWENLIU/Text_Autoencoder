This is Hershey's "new" version of what they called "European Style Dutch Processed Cocoa," which was in a silver, white and red box.  They updated the ESDP Cocoa to European Style Dutch Processed Cocoa -- Special Dark.<br /><br />I used to buy the old version (silver box) by the case.  We LOVED it.  It made the BEST hot cocoa, mousse and icings.  It was rich, smooth and had a wonderful chocolate flavor. (The only way I can describe the difference is the old version was more like devil's food cake than dark chocolate cake.)  I called Hershey's this Christmas (2005) to see if I could order another case.  I was told they don't make it anymore, the updated version is the special dark.<br /><br />I bought the special dark and tried it in several recipes.  Even my kids didn't like the hot cocoa with the new Hersheys.  The special dark is too dark -- and I don't really mean bittersweet (which I like.)  It's not as rich as the old version and seems a little bland.  I don't know what Hersheys did, but I'll be going to another cocoa.  At one time I had a large tin of Guittard, which I will probably go back to.<br /><br />Lark
