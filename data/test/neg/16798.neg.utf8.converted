My dog is a very aggressive chewer, but when I bought this product in the store it lasted him a long time so i bought it again on line so save some money but for some reason the one I bought off line barely lasted 2 weeks and the one I had bought in the store lasted him about 6. I'm not sure what the problem was with durability the second time but I wouldn't buy it again.
