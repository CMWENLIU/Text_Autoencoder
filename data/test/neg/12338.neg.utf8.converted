After making hundreds if not thousands of purchases on amazon this is the first time I have left a review on a product.  This product had very good reviews so I bought it and I feel the good ratings were very misleading so I finaly decided to write a product review.<br />After eating a couple of these I thought they would be ok.  I have now taken about 20 of these and I can't stand them, they leave a greasy white substance on the roof of my mouth and don't taste that good either.  The packaging says that 5 of these chewables need to be taken a day to get the recommended 2 g of plant stanols/sterols.  I can hardly force myself to take one a day.  Do yourself a favor and find a pill form.
