I was very disappointed to discover when examining the box of cereal delivered to me that  Skinner's raisin bran contains SUGAR.  Skinner's (Attune) web site lists the Ingredients as:  "Whole wheat kernels, Raisins, Salt, Barley malt." This quote was cut from their site, they failed to inform that the product's third ingredient is SUGAR.  This failure to disclose constitutes a fraud - they should change their web site to accurately depict what is actually in their allegedly "healthy" product.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049D5L30">Skinner's Raisin Bran, Whole Grain Cereal, 15-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>
