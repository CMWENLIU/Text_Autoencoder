There is something odd with the product description. The description says "Taffy Town" by it also says it is manufactured by "Candy Crate Salt Water Taffy" not "Taffy Town."  Taffy Town makes very good stuff; the flavors taste natural and it is certainly not salty. I'm echoing the the previous review's one star because I'm assuming this product is actually not Taffy Town. Other vendors on amazon.com sell the Taffy Town product and it gets about four stars. Taffy Town is at least four stars in my book. Confusing.
