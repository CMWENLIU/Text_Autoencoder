I have used this bread and I like it very much.  The taste and texture are great and the bread is a little easier to make than Bob's Red Mill.<br /><br />When you add the shipping cost to the price of the bread, the result is an astonishing $6.61 per loaf!  I will continue to buy this mix from my local stores.
