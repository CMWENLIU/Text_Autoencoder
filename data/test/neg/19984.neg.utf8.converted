I couldn't wait to get these to use as a snack and also to use in recipes. I hope I can find other uses for them rather than as a snack, because they are bitter and really doesn't even taste like chocolate.  I am not a raw fooder, although I do have a couple of raw food cookbooks, so take that into consideration.  I have no idea what I'm going to do with $25 worth of raw cacao nibs now.  I even went to the web site to get recipes but there were none.  Geez.......
