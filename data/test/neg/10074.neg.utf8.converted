We bought these beans hoping to find a successor to the Brazilian Santos green beans we formerly purchased from the defunct Zach & Dani's. These beans are a far cry from what we expected. While roasting, the aroma seemed fine and the finished beans smelled pretty similar, although it was clear from the excessive husks produced that, in fact, they roasted very differently. However much these beans differed from Zach & Dani's Brazilian Santos in roasting pales to how they differ when brewed: the brew is irredeemably watery, the flavor virtually non existent--even the aroma is weak.  We suggest re-labeling these beans "Brazilian Postum."
