This product was awful.  The bars have a grainy hard texture.  I thought maybe they were old, but they don't expire for a couple years.  Maybe they have been stored improperly?  I don't know how anyone could like these.  I much prefer Yamate sugar free chocolate bars.  I am not affiliated in any way with Yamate - just a fan.  I'll go back to order their bars.
