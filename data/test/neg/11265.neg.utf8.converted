Corn meal has no place in a cat's diet! Cats are pure carnivores.  I think corn meal plays a role in the development of tartar, in the first place. It definitely plays a role in feline obesity - rich carbs like corn fatten up cows.  I'm going to try CET treats... or something else.  Corn is a cheap commodity and popular filler because it's a SUBSIDIZED commodity.  This is also why many food manufacturers use High Fructose Corn Syrup instead of real sugar - sugar is not subsidized.  Corn meal in cat food products is great for corporate profits but BAD for our cats.
