It's a box. The box looks nice, but it's not worth the purchase price. Don't do it. Because the tea, you probably won't use. It's really, really weak-flavored. I oversteeped a pot, used three teabags instead of my usual two, and still could barely taste (even using my imagination a bit to boost it) the "blueberry."<br /><br />After trying three types of tea (Blueberry, Mango and one other flavor I couldn't taste and can't recall,) I just dumped the last pot, threw the bags away, and gave the box to my son, who looked at it kinda funny, and muttered something about warhammer figures or something.<br /><br />Sigh.
