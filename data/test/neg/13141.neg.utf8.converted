I opened the snack cabinet in the office today and found something new: Sun Maid Vanilla Yogurt Raisins. I thought they might be a moderately healthy supplement to my boring lunch, so I opened a box and popped a few in my mouth.  The raisins were plumper than the normal desiccated Sun Maid product, but the yogurt coating was sweet but not distinctive tasting and had a weirdly slick texture after being chewed a couple times. Noting this, I idly checked the ingredients while I waited for my tea to warm up in the microwave. Natural California Raisins, check. Yogurt coating... with partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil. Hmm. The obverse of the box yielded the devilish Nutrition Fact I was looking for: One box of these demons contains 4 grams of saturated fat, or 20% of the recommended daily value.<br /><br />These things are moderately tasty, but for that amount of saturated fat, I want to cram something absolutely delicious in my cake hole (like cake?). I would not recommend these to anyone, and I would definitely never give them to my children thinking they were some kind of healthy snack.
