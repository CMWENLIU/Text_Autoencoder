I would not recommend this to anyone.  I didn't read the other reviews before I placed my order which I know was my fault.  The K-Cups arrived in a brown paper bag, stapled with a hot pink sticky-note on it.  And that in my opinion is pretty ghetto.  Some of them were dented so who knows where each of them has been and I am not even going to use them.  Wasted funds because you can't return them either.<br /><br />My friend ordered a sampler pack described just like this. His came in a box with each K-Cup individually seated and looked like an actual product.  Not something that someone is taking from their school or work and then reselling them on Amazon.
