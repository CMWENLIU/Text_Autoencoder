As a new Prime member I was looking forward to getting a lot if items from Amazon that i normally purchase locally.  My expectation was that I would get a better price from Amazon.  As a Diabetic, I love Dreamfields Pasta.  It's really the only way I get to eat pasta.  I was shocked to find if cost over $10.00 here.  I can purchase it locally for around $3.00.  They need to fix this.
