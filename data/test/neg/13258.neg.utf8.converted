I've been using Bob's coconut flour and am always surprised at how little you need.  Let's do Organic brand is not very flour-y.  It's quite fluffy and I always needed to double the amount to make my recipes work and they make things taste like they have shredded coconut in them instead of a smooth flour consistency.
