I'm a vegetarian, I don't eat sugar, and I have tried a lot of types of honey in the market, it's very difficult to find real raw and natural honey. I desided to try this one and was very dissapointed. It looks and tastes like Canadian creamy honey sold in the local stores for much less. And Canadian creamy honey is not natural and not raw, I know for sure. They say on the jar label this is a mix of Vermont honey with canadian honey.
