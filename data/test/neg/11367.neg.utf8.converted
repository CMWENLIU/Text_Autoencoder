I was shopping in my local grocery store and passed by an endcap with this coffee.  It smelled so good, and was strong in a good way.  I could smell it through the box.<br /><br />So...I ordered it here.  Much to my dismay, the coffee I thought was so great tastes terrible.  It has a burned flavor.  The beans used to make this coffee must have been over-roasted big time!  I won't be buying this flavor again.
