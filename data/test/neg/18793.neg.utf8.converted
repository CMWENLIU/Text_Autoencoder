I went ahead and ordered the cereal because I've tried the regular Special K(which tastes pretty good),<br />and figured this would be like that except with protein.<br />You can imagine my "if it sounds too good to be true.." moment when I had my first bowl.<br />Now I'm a pretty utilitarian kind of guy, I like good food, but I can eat just about anything edible just for survival.<br />This is what this cereal is all about.<br />Eating out of necessity.<br />The taste is almost non-existent, which I can live with, but the texture is what kills me.<br />All I can think about is cardboard boxes which were ripped into flakes and hardened. (The color of the cereal doesn't convince you otherwise either)<br />Now I don't care about high fructose corn syrup and all that, but if something tastes this bad.... it should at least be 100% good for you.<br />I don't think I will be ordering more.<br />Protein is good, but you know.. life can be rough... you don't need to start out each day with rough cereal
