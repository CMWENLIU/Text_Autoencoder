The old formula, which doesn't contain almonds, is oustanding; I would put a very thin layer on a slice of bread and I could say it is like heaven. The new formula tastes different, looks different....and I would simply not buy it again. I would try to see if Target has any left in stock though the last jar I bought there had an expiration of May. It is truly dissapointing for the company to go the cheap route and change the formula without surveying its customers first. Market share is hard to gain and easy to lose. There are a couple of other brands of chocolate hazelnut butter on the market and I am willing to give the Italian one a shot.
