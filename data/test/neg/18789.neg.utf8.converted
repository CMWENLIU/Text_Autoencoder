I just called Kellogg and told them how disappointed I am in the new formula for Special K Protein Plus. I also told them that the reviews on Amazon are horrible. The woman I talked to was very nice and she took down all my info and it will be forwarded to the Quality Control team. She said there has been many other complaints as well. She also mentioned about the taste testers liking this. And I pointed out that I would be interested in knowing how many of these people are health conscience and are not looking for sweeter food but healthier food. The taste testers preferred it because it is sweeter. I told her that most cereals are sweeter and that those people should just stick with those cereals and that Kellogg should have just left well enough alone. Now there are many people who have enjoyed this cereal for many years and have to go find another.
