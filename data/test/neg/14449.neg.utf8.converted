Updated Review: January 31, 2010<br />--------------------------------<br />The original review below was for black Jewel popcorn that I purchased about 6 months ago from Amazon.  After loving that one we bought a second case.<br /><br />In the second case, the popcorn kernels seems the same but the microwave bags are completely different.  The new bags are brown in color and say: "Being conscientious of our environment we have chosen to use unbleached natural paper microwave bags".  (The old bags were white and felt like all other microwave popcorn bags.)<br /><br />The problem is that the new bags are VERY inconsistent in how they pop the corn.  In the same microwave that we used with the previous bags, you now either get half unpopped kernels AND/OR burned popcorn.  This is with the same amount of cooking time and settings as before.  (We tried varying the time/wattage and it is even inconsistent between bags with the same settings.  i.e. It will burn at 2:10 on one bag and on the next bag won't be half-popped at 2:10.)<br /><br />I can't be 100% sure that it is the bags but:<br />1) We didn't have this issue before with the old case.<br />2) Of the kernels that pop without burning they taste the same as before.<br />3) Visually the bags appear to be the only change.<br /><br />We've almost ran thru all 18 microwave bags that come in the case...  (At least 15 of them.)  Getting half popped corn or having to throw the bag of burned corn the rest of the time.  This issue has happened for ALL of the bags we've tried to pop with the new brown bags.<br /><br />I guess we'll try just buying the loose kernels since they ruined the microwave version.<br /><br />NOTE:  Our microwave is not much more than 6 months old...  So I don't think it is that.<br /><br />Original Review (5 stars): January 10, 2010 (Before we opened the new case)<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />Simple Review:  This is the best microwave popcorn we've found.  My wife is a popcorn nut and she's tried everything you can get in the stores and many of the online brands...  (She even likes this better than the kind you pop on the stove.)<br /><br />Microwaving Tip:  If you have a 1200+ Watt microwave cut the power back to 80% or more.  You'll get better tasting and more consistent popcorn.  (An Inverter Microwave is better at this since it cleanly cuts to 80%.  It isn't on 80% then off 20% of the time like old microwaves.)<br /><br />We have a 1250 Watt Panasonic Inverter microwave.  At 100% power it will burn at around 2:10 or sometimes less.  (I won't put any other times in here.  You have to determine the best setting for your microwave.)<br /><br />So cut the power back and find the right time for your microwave...  It makes a significant difference in taste & consistency.
