I normally do not write reviews, but I decided to write one in this case to help fellow buyers. We recently bought 2 tins (1-ounce) of this item and I am VERY disappointed with the quality of the saffron. Despite its steep price, it is not pure saffron. We are seeing instant loss of color when dipped in water. The threads are breaking down almost instantly in water. Also, the taste and aroma are not very rich. I am quite disappointed with quality of the product and will never buy from this seller again.
