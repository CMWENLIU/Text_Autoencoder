I used to love these crackers, but they have recently reformulated them.  Now they're awful... like a Wheat Thin knockoff, but not even as good as Wheat Thins.  Why do they mess with something that works??  I complained to the company, and was told, "As you might imagine, we conduct extensive consumer tests to determine consumer acceptance before introducing a food into the national market. Reformulated products are of special concern to us, so we use panels of regular product users across the country to ensure acceptability. Tests on this reformulated product showed that most consumers preferred the new product to the old. However, we realize that taste preferences do differ and can certainly understand your feelings."<br /><br />Yeah, I am sure that Coca-Cola conducted extensive consumer tests of New Coke, too.<br /><br />Look, you might like this cracker.  But if you liked the previous formulation, don't expect anything at all similar.  And if you don't like it, please complain to the company.  Maybe they'll bring out a 7-grain "Classic" cracker.  :-)
