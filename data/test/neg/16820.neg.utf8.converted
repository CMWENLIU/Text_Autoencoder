When I first tried this product I loved it and used it in my baking (I run a small online bakery) and would have given it 5 stars for sure. Now in less than a month they've hiked the price up from just under $6 per package to $8.99, and no long offer Super Saver Shipping, and charge nearly another $8 for shipping? Save your money. This is just ridiculous.
