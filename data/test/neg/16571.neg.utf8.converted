Be careful, this isn't 100% pure cranberry juice. If this is indeed the same product as pictured, do not be fooled into believing this will help you with any urinary tract or bladder problems. The first ingredient is high fructose corn syrup, which is a corn sweetener and it has food dyes to make it look pretty. It is only a cranberry COCKTAIL, not pure fruit juice.
