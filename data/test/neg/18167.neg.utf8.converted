Beware that there are no Dora the Explorer animal crackers in this package.  We specificaly purchased it to get the Dora crackers.  It was mis-represented with the picture as what you get is the same box that is available at the local costco.  If you want Dora, don't buy.  Sounds petty, but to my 2 year old daughter it was all about the Dora crackers.  We do purchase the product at costco and will contiue to purchase it there.
