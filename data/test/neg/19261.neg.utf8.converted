Bought this one because there are some positive reveiws, but I got to say I really hate the ordor of this product. When you brew it, it smells like an old, musty carpet. Awuful, very very bad, and I can't even finish my first cup. this is definitely the worst tea I have ever tried. Pushes my bad experiences on horrible teas to a whole new level. Totally waste of money.
