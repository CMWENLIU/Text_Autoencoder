First of all, let me be clear that I really like this product. It's yummy and the price is good. The reason for the one star rating is that I have been reordering it for quite a while. I reorder from my shopping list, so I don't read the description carefully, since I am just re-ordering exactly the same thing I've gotten before (or so I thought). This time, the bottles were half the size, but the price was the same. I looked at an old bottle (actually, can) and noted that it was 16.9 oz. This time, the three cans were each 8.5 oz! Now, the description clearly says 8.5 oz., so I can't complain about that, but it came off my shopping list, which always before sent me three 16.9 oz cans. So, bottom line is just be careful if you've ordered this in the past and be aware of what you are getting. It's still a good value (just not a killer deal, as it was before!)
