Well...anything with jalapeno and I'm sure to love it.<br />Sorry, not the case here.<br />Right out of the bottle it has an almost sour taste to it.<br />Picture old mayo mixed with fake smoke with a dash of some kind of spice that doesn't even resemble jalapeno.<br />I put it on some chips and almost gagged.<br />I put it on some salad but the other dressing thankfully drowned it out.<br />Not recommended.<br />Yuck.
