This is not RAW ORGANIC KOMBUCHA! You need to buy true Kombucha at a health foods store. There is nothing on Amazon that states this is not the real thing. However, it isn't! It would not be this cheap either. You might as well go grab a can of coke. The point as stated in another review is to have the probiotics which this does not. This is coming out of a can also. The metal taste is just awful. True Kombucha comes from a glass. This shouldn't be called Kombucha!
