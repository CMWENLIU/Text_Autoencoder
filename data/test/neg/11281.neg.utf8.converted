I am a big fan of Pamela's Products. Their plain shortbread and pecan shortbread are incredible. So I was optimistic about the lemon shortbread cookies, since I'm a fan of everything lemon-flavored. These cookies were a) too sour, b) soggy, without the crumbly, buttery texture of real shortbread and c) they tasted like someone had sprayed Lemon Pledge furniture cleaner on regular shortbread, then sealed it in plastic while damp. Really, they were that gross. Not recommended.
