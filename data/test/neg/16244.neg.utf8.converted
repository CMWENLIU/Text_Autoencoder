I used this in one of my favorite recipes last week with disasterous results. It completely over powered all other ingedients and flavor elements in the dish and left my kitchen with the string, unmistakable aroma of vinegar. I could barely finish a small serving and sent the left-overs straight to the garbage disposal. Yuck.<br /><br />I gave it to my mohter who frequently drinks vinegar for medicinal purposes. For direct ingestion, she thought it was much more palatable than other vinegars she has tried.<br /><br />Rather a tale of two cities on this one. I guess one's opinoin of this product simply comes down to the capacity in which one plans to use it. It appears that this is good to drink. I will, however, never cook with it again.
