I know a lot of people don't want to hear this, but fructose is a major cause of metabolic syndrome, gout, and many other conditions. It doesn't go into your blood stream so it doesn't raise blood glucose, but it doesn't just go away; it goes to your liver and is turned to triglycerides.<br /><br />High fructose corn syrup is only about half fructose. Agave is almost pure fructose, so it is twice as bad. Fructose is fructose whether it comes from cactus or corn.
