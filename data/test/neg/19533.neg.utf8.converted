I'm a perfectly healthy individual with no allergies, etc., but these made me extremely sick. Unfortunately I was on an airplane (they sell these at airport kiosks) and had the worst flight of my life--extreme cramping, bloating, and vomiting--all on southwest airlines. No warning about this side effect on the bag. Thanks a lot, Jelly Belly.
