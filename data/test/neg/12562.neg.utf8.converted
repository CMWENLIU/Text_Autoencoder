I eagerly opened my package, expecting to see a delightful assortment of flavors. I took them out of the bag one by one. Hazelnut, hazelnut, hazelnut, french vanilla, hazelnut, french vanilla... All but 2 were either hazelnut or french vanilla. I do not even really like hazelnut! This was not what I hoped for at all.
