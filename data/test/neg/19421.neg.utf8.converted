I love genmaicha and thought I would try this out because of the high ratings.  Boy was I disappointed to learn that my local Chinese market sells the same exact product for about 60% of the price!  I also spent hours going through the tea to take out the woody stems which seem to be a sadly significant part of what is inside the bag.  If you can't get genmaicha from anywhere else, this still makes good tea, but look around your local Asian market first for a better deal and possibly better quality.  Specialty websites for tea likely have better quality, but for a higher price - may be worth it.
