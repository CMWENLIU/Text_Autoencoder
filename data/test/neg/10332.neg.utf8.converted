I love heath bars, and they agree with me quite well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I ordered this item and even without eating a whole one, I got sick from it and have been all night, and am still.<br /><br />The bar was "off" with a slightly odd taste and the center was a bit "chewy" rather than crisp. Odd enough that I set it aside after eating part of it.  Soon I was queasy and I slept badly, and now 12 hours later it feels like there are knives in my intestines and I'm having diarrhea.<br /><br />Amazon was good about it, gave me a full refund and told me to dispose of them, which I will do. Into the trash they go.<br /><br />The lot number is a bit smudged on the box, but appears to be<br /><br />40PR2<br />BB 01 2012<br /><br />I don't blame amazon, but I feel like I've been poisoned.  And no, I didn't eat anything else, it was utterly clear what has made me ill. Also, the same day I had some heath miniatures I also bought from amazon, and they were great!<br /><br />I suspect that I'm not the only person to get a bellyache from this batch.<br /><br />These should be recalled, IMO.
