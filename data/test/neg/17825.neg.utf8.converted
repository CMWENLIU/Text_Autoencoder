I am an avid (or more likely, the world's most loyal and enthusiastic) Tabasco hot sauce lover. I use Tabasco everyday, multiple times a day, and douse it on just about any consumable good. I bought these from the Tabasco Country Store expecting them to be real Tabasco-flavored lollipops (to satisfy my Tabasco cravings independent of food), only to be completely underwhelmed because these are NOT Tabasco-flavored! They are "hot" cinnamon flavored candy, and not only that, but the back of the packaging states that these lollipops may contain lead in them and so you should not consume them! What a let down. I wish there were real Tabasco-flavored Tabasco lollipops out there.
