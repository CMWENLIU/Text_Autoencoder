For starters this lid does not fit.  It is supposed to be held on by two little "bumps" on the edge of the lid but they are not flared out far enough.  The end result is that the lid easily falls off.<br /><br />Further, the quality of the ceramic glaze is terrible.  There are several spots on my piece where the glaze was missed and the raw porcelain shows through.<br /><br />Contrary to other reviewers, the water drips though WAY too fast.  When i make a single cup the water is fully through the cone in less than 30 seconds.  This is far too fast given that coffee should ideally steep in the water for 1.5 to 2 minutes.<br /><br />The handles are also thin and flimsy.  They look like they would easily snap off.  Lastly, this item is made in China so I'm concerned about the lead content of the glaze used.  Given the shoddy overall quality I would not be surprised if they were also careless about what went into the glaze materials.  Do yourself a favor and find something made in Japan.
