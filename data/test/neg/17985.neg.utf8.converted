Warning, mine has stopped pumping water inside the machine to be heated. The outer tank is seated properly and the drain switch is turned to the proper position. Worked fine for a month, now this junk is not working. Something to note. When this machine works it is noisy and vibrates quite a bit. Also, if you do not use the drain feature and take some time to pump the water out of the inner heating chamber you will NOT be making coffee with fresh water! So if you have not done the chore of draining the machine, the water will be as old as the last time you brewed! I am going back to my old Kitchenaid Spa brewer, it does a fantastic job, the water is ALWAYS fresh as I do not have to drain the thing then put in more water!The Keurig made great coffee when it worked, but if you take the price of the machine and the price of the 45 cups of coffee I made the last 38 days that comes to $3.64 per cup to own it. Also,be SURE that you do not forget to turn off the power to the machine AFTER EACH use. If yours stops pumping water as mine has and has no water in the inner heating tank, my question is does it have a safety device that keeps it from overheating and causing a fire? Just wanted to give my honest review and make sure that these things are safe. UPDATE: After contacting Keurig and waiting a MONTH. NOTHING. This is one disgusting Company. They make product that will not last, then when you ask for a fix or replacement you GET NOTHING. I WILL NEVER EVER OWN another one of these pieces of junk!
