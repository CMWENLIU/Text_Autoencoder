I haven't reviewed many products on here, but feel obligated for this one because in my opinion/experience, it's an expensive (in volume) dud.<br /><br />  I have seed/pantry moths that were introduced from bird seed for my macaw. The moths spread to the pantry, and are a major hassle to eradicate. It is very difficult to kill all cyles of moth production from eggs=>larvae=>moths. Most of the pantry moth traps help reduce the nuisance and volume of moths by attracting male moths to a sticky surface via a pheromone.<br /><br />  Several brands of moth traps I've tried have worked well... to date, Safer Brand has been the unfortunate exception. I bought 3 boxes of Safer Brand Pantry Pest Traps at Lowe's... 4 of the traps are seen in my video (totally empty).
