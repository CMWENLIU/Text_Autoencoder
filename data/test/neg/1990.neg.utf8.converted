The product description says $0.13 / oz, which is ~51 oz. I assumed 4 10 oz packs like the other offers at Amazon. FYI, one 10 oz package costs $2.99 at Whole Foods. Guess what? They sent one 10 oz package (67.4 cents an oz!!!) The Amazon web page is wrong. These folks have chosen a sweet spot on price to trick you. Don't buy from them. Use one of the other offers at ~$10 for 4 packs.
