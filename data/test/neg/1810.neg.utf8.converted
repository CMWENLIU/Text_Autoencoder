So if you read the reviews, you'll see that some people thing these things are great. Many otehres cant get over the texture, and the initial smell is ... bad. I was able to wash out the smell pretty well, leaving a very mild fishy mildewy aftertaste. The texture... awful. Nasty. Chewy fishy pasta. The only good thing I can say about this stuff is the individual bags it comes in are really small -- about single serving size. So I've got a bunch I can inflict on my friends if I can trick them into trying it.
