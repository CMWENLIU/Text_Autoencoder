This used to be one of the healthiest cereals available. As an almost vegetarian it was one of the only ways I could get enough iron and protein, plus it had loads of fiber. Now it has less fiber, way more sugar, and more carbs.<br /><br />After 7+ years of this being a staple in my diet I will no longer be purchasing this. Such a shame.<br /><br />I am SO disappointed and I know others are, as well. So, I created a petition in the hope that if enough people sign they might eventually return the original formula.<br /><br />That said, since I've found Hi-Lo cereal which is even better (carb, sugar, and fiber-wise) than the original formula of special k low carb I kind of don't care what Kellogg's does.
