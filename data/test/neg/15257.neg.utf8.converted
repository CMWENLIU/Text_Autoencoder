These are the nastiest things I have ever tried. I would rather do without than eat these noodles. I don't understand how anyone can think they are even a least bit good. When you open them they stink like fish, you have to rinse them well to get the smell off. Don't waste your money - They are miracle noodles all right - a miracle if you can eat them! really they are gross!
