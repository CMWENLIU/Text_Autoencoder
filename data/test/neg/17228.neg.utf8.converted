You pay for the Carapelli PREMIUM Extra Virgin Olive Oil and get their regular EVO instead.  The product description says 100% ITALIAN olives, and what you get is their regular EVO with olives from Spain and Tunisia.  Is it too much to ask that you get what you paid for???  UPDATE:  Amazon did provide refund.
