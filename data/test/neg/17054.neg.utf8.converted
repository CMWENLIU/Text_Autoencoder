No surprise here, they've simply repackaged their other "types" of soups into new wrapping, slapping "kettle style" on it along with a heftier $. I can't tell a flavor difference between this & their Chicken Tuscany (Chicken and White Beans with Herbs) Soup. The only differences are the packaging & price - oh & a little more sodium per serving. Misleading packaging too - I thought because it was plastic it was a microwavable soup until I reviewed the panel & realized I still needed to hunt up a microwavable bowl at work. Blah.
