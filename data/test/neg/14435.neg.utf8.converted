I bought these for my 3 month-old lab. I also bought some other treats (dehydrated liver, Kong biscuits, bully sticks). 1-2 days after feeding these to my lab she got violently ill -- vomiting and diarrhea. Took her to the vet and after an overnight stay and IV fluids, the vet had no idea what it was. They decided to x-ray her to see if something was blocking her intestines. Nothing. After antibiotics and rest she was back to her normal high energetic self. I gave her more of these sweet potato fries about a week after her first sickness episode.... and 24 hrs later she was vomiting again.  I was worried, but figured that it must be something I was feeding her. I then examined the package and saw these are made in China.  I threw them out and my puppy has been fine since. Logic points to these treats.... I will no longer buy food items for my dog from China. Nobody else has posted anything about ill reactions to these treats, but search around, lots of dog treats from China are making our dogs sick.
