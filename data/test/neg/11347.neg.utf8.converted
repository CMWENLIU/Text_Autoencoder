This is a ripoff on quantity.  Unfortunately Amazon has poor management on a numbe rof these grocery products.  I ordered the case, got only one can.  At least when I complained to customer service, Amazon was quick enough to issue a refund.  But this is not the first time this has happened with a grocery product.
