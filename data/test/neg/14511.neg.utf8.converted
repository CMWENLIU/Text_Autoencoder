One of the reasons people hate being healthy or trying to be fit is because of flavor. The old saying "If it tastes good, spit it out" referring to diets is how a lot of people view it. This beverage won't help this thought.  I have tried at least three of the Skinny girl alcohols, the most recent being the white peach margarita which sounded good in theory. The flavor is horrible....barely drinkable at best. You'll only finish it out of desperation not to waste your money. It smells like peaches and tastes like super bitter grapefruits. There are plenty of other options to turn to if you don't want to stray from your fit lifestyle and still have some flavor or enjoy a cocktail once in a while. I'm confused why these products are still being sold....must be the celebrity attachment. Bethenny probably doesn't drink her own products.
