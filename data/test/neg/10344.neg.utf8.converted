I was so looking forward to my dried fava beans.  When I opened the box, I was so disappointed.  The picture above shows nice whole fava beans with uniform color.  The ones I got were all different colors with lots to discard and way too many broken ones, and I don't mean just broken in half...broken in lots of tiny pieces.  I would never serve these to company unless I opened two or three bags and picked out the whole ones.<br /><br />The bags were packed nice and safe with plenty of bubble wrap.  I can only assume they were this way when they were packed.  I am very disappointed in the quality of these dried fava beans and wonder why Amazon even bothered to carry them.  It is far below their usual standard of quality.  You want fava beans?  Skip these.
