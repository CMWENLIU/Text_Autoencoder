I've been buying thus for my cat for about 6 months now.  She's always had a bit of a problem with throwing up so i didn't notice itr at first.  But now that I've had a few months of experience with it I can confirm that it makes her throw up.  I would say 7 out of 10 times she throws up not even after, but while she's eating it!  At first I didn't think anything about it, I thought she was just randomly throwing up.  But today I noticed she threw up while she was near finishing what I had put down for her.  So just as a test I decided to give her a little more and she threw up in less than a minute of eating it.<br /><br />So, I don't know what to tell you.  Maybe it's just my cat.  I can't imagine they sell this and it happens to every car!  My cat is 16 and in really good health considering her age.  But maybe it's age related, I don't know.  I just know i won't bed able to give her this anymore.  But I'm going to have to find a good substitute fast because she's so addicted to it, she starts yelling for more every day at the same time!!
