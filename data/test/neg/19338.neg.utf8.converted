If you previously bought the Chatfield Carob Chips pictured in the tan bag, you know they were delicious.  The carob chips are now in a different packaging with "NOW improved flavor" written on the bag.  The remake of these carob chips was a BIG mistate... they are horrible.  They have no carob or chocolately taste - really no flavor at all except for a waxy surgary taste.  I gave them to my husband because his sense of taste is much blander than mine, but he told me to throw them away because they are not worth the calories.  If he won't eat something sugary, then I know it is bad.  Please don't waste your money on these.  I wanted to leave zero stars, but you had to check at least one.
