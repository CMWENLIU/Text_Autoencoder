I loved the old Zico water in the square containers and couldn't wait for Amazon to get this in. I got the two cases I ordered today and it tastes terrible! It actually tastes like plastic or some sort of chemical/pesticide. Even after chilling it and pouring into a glass it is still not drinkable. Do not waste your money on this if you like real coconut water. Try the O.N.E. coconut water instead. It was my second favorite until now and I will never buy another bottle of ZICO.<br /><br />Who cares if you can recycle the bottle if the product is not fit to drink? What a waste of $60!
