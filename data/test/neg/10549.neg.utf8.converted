I was looking for a can of Dinty Moore's "Beef Stew", and found one with the original style label.  In checking the ingredients, I looked down the long list of names and found "beef" second from the bottom.  Not good in anyone's book.  Let alone a kitchen.  The main ingredient should be beef.  Not an afterthought.  Same here.  And there's always the big spoon with a large chunk of beef in it.  The beef gravy (keep in mind "gravy")here is made up of:<br />  "Beef Gravy (Water, Beef Broth, Beef, Tomatoes [Water, Tomato Paste], Corn Flour, Salt, Modified Food Starch, Caramel Coloring, Sugar, Flavoring), Beef, Potatoes, Carrots".  Gravy is only thick soupy stuff meant to hide what ever else is in the pot.<br />  Well, there it is again!  Beef at third from the bottom this time.  And the "Beef Gravy" is a joke!  Water is the first, then "Beef Broth, Beef".  This beef ingredient is nothing more than pureed pieces of beef to give the gravy some better flavor and maybe some substance.  And this stuff is much like the original.  Of course, everyone's taster is different.  And who knows what the formula changes have caused in the flavor?  One thing I do know.........My dog LOVES it!  He only got a taste and I threw the rest out.  Not good for him either.
