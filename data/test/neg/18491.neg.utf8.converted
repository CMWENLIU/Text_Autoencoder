As a kid that grew up on Li Hing Mui I can say that this product truly does fall short. This aint no "Yick Lung" Li Hing Mui thats to be sure....The artificial sweetener is just gross, there's not enough licorice and I can't taste any salt.<br />-<br />I guess it can be used as some other type of seasoning but as it stands, it's not Li Hing Mui in my book.
