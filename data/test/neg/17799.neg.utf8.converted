When I was growing up in the United States in the mid-1990s, the advent of Altoids from across the Atlantic was a fortuitous time, bringing me and my friends a peppermint that was "curiously strong" due to its high concentrate of peppermint oil, naturally flavored, and unlike anything that we had tasted before. After I moved abroad, Altoids became one of the brands I missed most. Recently, a relative sent me a pack of the fairly new Wintergreen flavor, and I find it very disappointing.<br /><br />The problem with the Wintergreen flavour Altoids is that they taste like toothpaste and bear little resemblance to the very natural and intense flavor of the original offerings. I can imagine that Callard & Bowser, now owned by Wrigley's, are trying to attract a buyer who is fond of Wrigley's Winterfresh gum, but who wants a dissolving mint instead. I imagine that your enjoyment of Wintergreen Altoids is going to be based entirely on what you think of Winterfresh.
