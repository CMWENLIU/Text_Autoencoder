I wish I could give this stuff zero stars.  It's bad enough that the label is deceptive and obviously meant to mislead consumers, but the product is also awful.  I recently was cooking with a friend and asked her to buy a can of San Marzano tomatoes for a recipe we were going to make.  Not knowing better, she bought a can of these and I was stunned by how awful they were:  small, round, pale, tasteless, mealy, and packed in a tomato-tinged watery liquid.  I repeat what others have written here:  buyer beware!
