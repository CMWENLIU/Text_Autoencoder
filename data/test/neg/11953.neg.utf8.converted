After buying this for 9$ per bottle from my local Asian supermarket in San Jose, CA and doing a blind taste test in which I just dip my finger blindly into two different kinds, I taste no difference.  I tried dipping other basic food in blind taste tests and the $3 Fish sauce "Flying Lion Phu Quoc" brand I usually use tastes better.  As a daily user of nuoc mam in everyday meals, I'm not sure what the hype for this is all about.  Sounds like a marketing gimmick to me.  Has a nice label, fascinating description that I had to try right when I got home from the store.  Try it for your self, but don't be fooled like I was.  I myself will always be searching for new types of authentic Phu Quoc myself, please do let me know if you find any worthwhile yourself.
