When I received this item, I noticed that the pop savor had leaned against the box.  I took it out of the box, and when I tried to close the lid, there was a big hole left.  (See customer pictures I've added).  I left the lid open for 2 days hoping it would realign itself, but it didn't.  I'm about to return it right now.
