I bought these because I have been making my own lattes for years now and prefer the cleanliness of pods vs ground espresso.  I really enjoy Lavazza coffee and was looking forward to receiving this purchase.  When the pods arrived at my home I was very disappointed to receive a large ziplock bag of loose (individually packaged) pods.  There were a few pods that weren't even Lavazza.  I looked at several of the individual pods to check for expiration dates (because they do go bad) and couldn't find any.  So for all I know I could have been preparing old and expired espresso.  What a bummer.  I feel like I wasted my money and in the future I will not buy this particular brand from this site due to the seller's choice in packaging.  But with that said - Lavazza is a great brand of coffee.
