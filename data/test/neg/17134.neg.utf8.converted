I have always bought and loved the clean "fresh tuna" tasting firm meat Polar Tuna when I bought it in my grocers.  But I purchased this product from Amazon in March 2010, and was very disappointed.  Although it looks firm and solid, (and the expiration date is for next November), it smells different, not that "fresh tuna" smell it used to have.  It also has that sharp bitter "bad tuna" aftertaste that most tuna seems to have for the last 5 or more years.  This bad aftertaste seems to coincide with the various preservatives they have added to tuna.  But on the can, this tuna says it only is "Albacore, water, salt. Product of Thailand".  If there is only water salt and tuna, then this tuna is bad. In the old days when I bought Polar tuna in the store, if I put the can in the trash, or left the dish on the counter for a few hours till I filled the dishwasher, it just smelled like fresh tuna smell.  But as soon as the can is opened from this 24 pack, the smell is bad, and it gets worse quickly.  As a last resort to see if something could remove the bad taste, I even tried cooking one can in tomato sauce, and I could still taste the bad tuna taste.<br /><br />I am disappointed, not only because of how it used to be so good, but also on the can it says: All Natural, NO ADDITIVES, NO RESIDUE, NO AFTERTASTE, and that is just not true.<br /><br />I have contacted them by email, and if they get back to me I will update this review.
