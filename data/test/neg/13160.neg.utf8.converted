The powder smells like Kool Aid. Adding water makes it foam for a minute. At that point it tastes a little creamy, which I actually liked. But it quickly subsides into a flat drink, both in texture and flavor. The good thing is that it's only slightly sweet, but the rest of the flavor is pretty awful. There is a moderate amount of sourness, finishing with a slight bitterness reminiscent of biting an aspirin. The flavors of acai and pomegranate are vague at best.<br /><br />As for claims of boosting energy and metabolism? I don't feel more energetic than I normally do. The ingredients read like a multivitamin with salts and acai/green tea/etc. The claims made on the manufacturer's website for each ingredient sound dubious, and pretty lazy at that with each ingredient described to do the same exact thing. I doubt any studies were conducted to verify their claims.<br /><br />I'm sticking to drinking real green tea.
