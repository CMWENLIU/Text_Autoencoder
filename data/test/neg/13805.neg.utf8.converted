Easy serve espresso pods, or ESE pods are supposed to be a consistent size, weight and tamp.  But as a machine manufacturer I can tell you first hand that the coffee brewers intentionally modify the ESE spec to make their pods more likely to work well in their machine. ( and not so well in a competitor's)  You see, in Italy, the coffee biz is like the cell biz here.  Buy a contract for two years of monthly pods and we will throw a machine in for free.  They don't want you using that machine with OPP (other people's pods).  So they take a perfectly good standard and tweak it so it is no longer a standard.  In the case of these pods, they are way too loosely packed to work in any of my pod only machines.  Water flows so fast it barely changes colors.  Oh well, I've only got 149 left.  Ughhh.
