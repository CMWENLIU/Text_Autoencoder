After baking 1 bread from the 12 boxes I noticed the date on the yeast is only good until April, 2 1/2 months away. No wonder the bread didn't rise very well. I'll be returning the rest. I called the company that makes this bread and they told me they didnt know it was being sold on Amazon. They have no control over how or where this product is being stored or if properly, so please don't buy it from amazon.
