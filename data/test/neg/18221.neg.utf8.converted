I've used Degree deodorant (not anti-perspirant) for many years because it was one of the few remaining products that does not contain aluminum. I came here to buy a 6-pack just to stock up but reading these reviews I had a revelation. For YEARS while using this product I have suffered from an occasional underarm rash that I actually chocked up to chafing due to a LACK of the product on my body. Rash=chafing so I must need more degree applied! Obviously I misread the symptoms and see that I too have suffered a rash caused by this product and have so for years. I found that Arm&Hammer has a new Essentials product that is also aluminum free (as well as silver free) that not only smells better but lasts longer and causes no rash. My eyes have been opened and I have made the switch. :-)
