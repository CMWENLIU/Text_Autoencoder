I bought this to replace my supply of coconut flour and was excited because I got this so cheap.  I am on a high fat/high protein "Primal" diet and I make waffles and tortilla/crepes with coconut flour.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I could tell something was amiss when I opened the product as the consistency of the flour was very....floury.  Real coconut flour is loaded with healthy fat and cannot take on such a consistency.<br /><br />I looked on the bag and saw that the produce is a Coconut Flour >>>BLEND&lt;&lt;&lt; with the #1 ingredient being Rice Flour!  This is why it can be sold for so cheap...because the majority of the product is made from cheap, powdered rice.  Coconut flour is more expensive.<br /><br />You should know that rice is a grain and thus is a carbohydrate.  It might be gluten free, yes, so you don't get those nasty effects, but it's not a "low carb" food which meshes with "Paleo" or "Primal" approaches to eating.<br /><br />I'm eating the stuff slowly, as I'm not going to throw it away and waste money, but I won't be buying it again.
