Let me start this review by saying that I ***LOVE*** my Keurig machine! I can get a great cup of coffee, any strength, any brew, any boldness, any flavor, without brewing up a whole pot. It is a brilliant concept for coffee, which has always lent itself to either mass-brewing or pathetic "instant-coffee".<br /><br />Tea and cocoa, however, typically cost anywhere from $1-$4 per box of 20-30 bags/packets. Tea and cocoa are inherantly single-shot items to begin with, so the idea of paying $10-14 for a box of 24 tea or cocoa K-cups is ludicrous. It offers no real extra convenience and costs about ten times the price. It would be like buying a Kia Rio for $8,000 or a Daewoo Leganza for $80,000... they are both basically the same car, so why pay ten times more for one? It just makes no sense.<br /><br />On a side note, I also have found that this cocoa is a bit watery at times and doesn't even hold up to a packet of Swiss Miss and some hot water.
