I'm a big hot cocoa kind of person, so I jumped on this when I saw it for cheap at Costco. However, I followed the instructions on the back perfectly, and I still felt like the cocoa was waaay too powdery. It felt thick and grainy no matter what I did. I literally spit it up. Ultimately, I veered away from the instructions and put less powder in (about 1 and 1/2 tbsp). Works alright that way. I also added cold half and half after I'd made the cocoa sometimes, which was nice (of course it diluted the flavor, but I didn't mind). I tried one reviewer's suggestion of adding salt--it was actually really nice that way! It's best mixed with coffee. Definitely not worth the price, though. My boyfriend absolutely will not drink it. He says it's the worst cocoa he's ever tasted because it's too bitter and grainy.
