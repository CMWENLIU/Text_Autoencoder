Quinn popcorn has the right idea.  Straight popcorn in a biodegradable bag with no chemicals, additives etc.  After popping the corn, flavor is added by adding oil and a flavor and shaking the bag.  It should be heavenly.  But in fact the parmesan had the consistency of flour and just coated my mouth.  And I shook that bag a lot.  I would recommend mixing everything in a bowl instead of the bag; that might help.  The idea is terrific.  However I think better results could be obtained by popping plain corn in a brown paper bag and adding fresh grated parmesan and a bit of oil.  Perhaps the other two flavors would be better but I just tried parmesan and rosemary.  It was disappointing and I so wanted to love it.
