There are several other Stash teas that I've tried and enjoyed. But this one is sort of feeble-tasting.  Up until now, I've gotten the Yogi Tea Egyptian Licorice <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3QL6">Yogi Tea Organic Egyptian Licorice, Tea Bags, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>and that one actually has a bold licorice taste.  And it is that one that is serving as the point of comparison to this Stash tea.  Keep in mind that I don't add honey or any sweetner to my teas, so they have to stand on their own.  This Stash Licorice Spice has a weak licorice taste and a weak spice taste.  I have to use TWO teabags at a time (which makes the seemingly low price not so much a good deal).
