If I'd known these were from France, I never would have ordered them. The mushrooms I received look nothing like the ones in the image on Amazon. In the image, there are a lot of golden/light brown mushrooms, all I got were very dark brown to black. The aroma and flavor seem fine, but the color indicates either they were dried at too high of a temperature, or they are very old. And there are a lot of woody stems. Either way, the flavor and nutritional value would not be what it should be. I had subscribed for regular deliveries of these, however, after getting my first jar, I'm cancelling and going to buy in bulk and mix my own in the future.
