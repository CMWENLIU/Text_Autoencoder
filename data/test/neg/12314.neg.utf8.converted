I bought a small bag of this brand from a local health co-op and really liked it, and it tasted like sugar to me.  So I was excited to get this same brand in bulk at a much lower price online.  What a disappointment to find it did not taste the same as the bag I purchased at the store.  The Emerald Forest product I received online has a strong aftertaste that stays in my mouth long after drinking my tea.  I don't know if this company sells an inferior quality in their bulk packages, but I don't like it.  I am going back to Stevia, which I find more palatable and without aftertaste.
