I think I must have ordered the wrong rabbit. The rabbit I supposedly ordered came with pearls. I looked all over for the battery compartment and only found one slot that would fit C batteries. Well, the rabbit never turned on and I couldn't get my batteries back out of the compartment without using extra lube. To make matters worse, judging by the smell of the rabbit, I think it's already been used. I have to say I'm disappointed in this product and I will be exchanging it at the Adult Megaplex for a new one.
