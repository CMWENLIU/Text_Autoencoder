These tomatoes are very dry when compared to store bought dried tomatoes. I tried to soften them by placing in a jar of olive oil but even after weeks they continue to have a very tough, leathery texture. The only way I can use them is to cut them into very fine pieces (a very tedious task without a blender).  Disappointing as I had plans for many dishes, now I have 3 pounds that will need to be ground up for any use.
