My dog did not like this at all, so I had to mix it with a brand she does like, Acana, so that it would not go to waste. After a few months after I purchased it, I got a notice for a recall.  I had to throw away all the food, which included an expensive bag of Acana since I keep the food in a big container and throw away the original bags. Amazon informed me that I had to deal with the seller on this issue even though I bought both products from Amazon.  So I informed Taste of the Wild of this in a letter with the refund request due to the recall and the cost of the Acana food, but they chose to ignore that.  I will not buy from them again.  Customer Service is not good.
