This tea isn't bad, it just made (to me) a weak cup.  I used the recommended "T Pod" holder and it didn't make a lot of difference either.<br /><br />You can save yourself some money and use a tea bag instead.  I tried it and wish I had thought of it in the first place!  I got the same result but at least I didn't pay extra for it.
