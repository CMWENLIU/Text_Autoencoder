I am a big fan of Crystal Light beverages in general.  I like the lemonade a lot and drink it all summer long.  Because of this I was excited  to try their new margarita flavor.  The container holds 5 powder packets with each packet making 2 quarts of beverage.  When mixed thoroughly, the resulting drink is an odd murky green color (almost as if it could glow in the dark).  I got past the weird color and poured it in a glass.  Bringing it up to my mouth I thought the odor was odd.  It smelled like a type of cleaner (ammonia like).  I ignored that and tasted it.  I didn't really taste any lime at first..I did get an instant taste of the artificial sweetener (aspartame) but the thing I really noticed was the texture was very soft and it left an unpleasant coating on my tongue.  I then put the pitcher in the fridge for several hours hoping it would taste better cold but it did not.  I was really disappointed because I like Margarita cocktails and I was hoping this would make a lowcal alternative to traditional mixers.  I guess I will stick with the original Crystal Light lemonade flavor.
