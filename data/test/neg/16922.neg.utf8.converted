I purchased the 5 pound bag of Bassets Licorice Allsorts as a Christmas gift for my mom.  Sadly to say, I am embarassed to give this as a gift. The inside of the bag is covered with smudges from the candy.  Each piece of candy is also covered with black smudges from the black licorice.  It looks like some serious melting took place along the line.  I am going to have to throw it out.  Does anyone know how I can get a refund??  I should have listened to what people said about this product in previous reviews!  Very disappointed about this purchase!!!!
