I too researched the best dog food for my dog.  I wanted her to have the best and EVO was listed as one, based on the composition of the food.  Hundreds of dollars later, and a dog who can't keep solid food in and has to take Gall Bladder and Liver medicine, I was forced to go back to research the food.  Finding that the composition has indeed changed, I've throw it all out.  Three hundred dollars in dog food and at least that much in Vet bills and medicine, I've switched to Eukanuba.<br /><br />I was forced to give this product one star, but if I had my way the product would be removed from Amazon's site completely.
