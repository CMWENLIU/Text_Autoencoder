The country of origin of all products (but especially food products) should be clearly listed!  Because the information was nowhere to be found in the amazon description, I emailed the company to find out where their products are manufactured, and I received this reply from Xlear:  "The xylitol in our products is derived from Non-GMO corn that is grown and manufactured in China."  I am going to buy the Health Garden Kosher Xylitol, which is made is the US and is derived from birch instead of corn.<br /><br />Please be careful what you eat -- many products from China are unsafe.  You can check the FDA website for details.
