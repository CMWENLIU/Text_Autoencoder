I put the tablet in my mouth and kept it in there for a long time until it dissolved, just like they said to do.  It didn't change the taste of any green vegetables or carrots like I was hoping it would do; but really, that was no surprise since they don't claim it will change the taste of those.  They claim it will change the taste of lemons and some other tart fruits.  It did make the lemon juice very sweet; but it was a yucky, cloying sort of sweetness that kind of reminded me of stevia or saccharin.  I tried mixing the lemon juice with water and it tasted even worse.  After a minute or two I just couldn't stand to eat any more.  All in all, I would say save your money and don't buy this.  It's another hyped-up marketing scam.
