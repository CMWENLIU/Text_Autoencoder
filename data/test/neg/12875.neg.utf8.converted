This review is intended to help buyers make an intelligent decision as to the reason for buying this product. I emailed Now Foods requesting information concerning the mercury content of their granulated fructose because I consume so much of it. Their response was "mercury is less than 400 parts per billion". For myself this is unacceptable because I eat fructose and mercury is poisonous. I wish they would bring it down to a reasonable level or better yet find a new way of distilling fructose that is as economical as the Castner-Kellner process.
