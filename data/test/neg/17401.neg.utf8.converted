Ok so I realize instant coffee is compromised out of the gate so I'm not some snob. I was getting Taster's Choice instant at Costco before they stopped selling it, while not tasting like fresh brewed it managed to satisfy my coffee craving in places where I couldnt brew it fresh. By contrast I found Folger's instant undrinkable. It had a strange chemical taste going down and gave me a stomach ache after I was finished. So I have a bunch of this stuff sitting and staring at me and I loathe wasting things but this stuff I cant stomach. I drink coffee black maybe this stuff is better with milk? I dont know but its not for me.
