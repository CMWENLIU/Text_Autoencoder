7 out of the 12 bags were completely open on the BOTTOM. Taking out the first bag, it was not damaged and I didn't see the issue until I pulled out the second bag. Over half of this purchase is completely unusable and of course, unreturnable. The oil from the bags also seeped through the cardboard box...<br /><br />This is a good product, don't get me wrong, or I wouldn't have purchased 12 bags at one time. But be very very careful and check every bag when the box arrives. I don't agree with rating products poorly for bad shipping, but this wasn't bad shipping. The bags never look like they sealed, but they might have popped open. The cardboard box they all came in was not damaged in any way, so this looks like a product packaging flaw.<br /><br />I will purchase these from the store in the future where I can check the bag, but never again online.
