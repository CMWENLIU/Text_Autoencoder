I was very disappointed to learn that the "centuries-old Belgian tradition" in this case included the use of palm kernel oil and other non-dairy fatteners instead of actual heavy cream.  I don't have the ingredient list in front of me, but it was NOT, for example, what you'd even find in a box of Lindt truffles.  It's highly processed junk chocolate, and a huge disappointment.  I gave one of the boxes away.  That being said, the flavor was decent, so I gave them two stars, but haven't been able to eat more than two of them at a time because of the greasy film in my mouth afterwards.  Even with a good flavor, though, selling these as "real" Belgian truffles is marketing bunk, and Donckels should be ashamed of themselves.  Better to charge a little more and use quality ingredients.
