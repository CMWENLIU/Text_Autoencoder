My 7 month old LOVES real food and the new organic foods on the market have been a god's send.  I bought a box of the Sweet Ginger Chicken w/ Bananas & Coconut based on the reviews and the overall appeal of the name.  We are now feeding them to our dog, which is appropriate because it looks, smells and tastes like dog's dinner.  Looks: Dark and mealy- so dark that it seems like it must be organ meats (which I have no problem with if it didnt taste awful).  Smells: the smell is so strong the second you open the pouch and VERY much like a can of cat or dog food. Tastes: I taste all of the baby food I give my daughter.  It was pungent and metallic, where the banana and coconut were, lord only knows.  If you must try it, I get it I would too, just buy a packet or two and see how it goes.  Do not buy a case.  On a side note, my dog loves it! So no a total loss.<br /><br />In general the sprout meals are delicious and the texture on the level 3's are chunkier than Plum or Happy Tot.  You can see bit of veg and grains.  Holiday Veg w/ Turkey is a big hit as is the Pumpkin Peach Graham (I serve together but not mixed).  Roasted Banana Mango is really yummy and she LOVES the Yukon Golds with Squash and Parmesan.<br /><br />Beyond Sprout, we prefer:<br /><br />Fruits and Veg: Ellas for a richer consistency and better flavor than Plum or Happy Tot.  Parsnip, Carrot, Apple is a surprise hit. Plum fruits are watery and water is even listed as first ingredient on some. However, the Plum Mish Mash line is much better and my daughter eats all of it.<br /><br />Breakfast: Happy Squeeze (tot) Organic Super Smoothies are awesome, in fact, I'm going to start having them for breakfast myself.  ALL of them taste excellent! Have 100% adult dv of vitamin C, 1/2 vitamin A. 6 grams or so of protein and under 100 cals.  They are thick, and creamy.<br /><br />Dinner: Plum Training Meals seem to be her favs along with the Sprout brand (other than the curry chicken) We have yet to try the salmon but have a case of it ready to go.  She likes the potato and turkey with rosemary (tastes like an herby mash potato) and the chicken pasta (not something an adult would like but I think she likes the texture of the visible chunks of pasta).  My girl has never been able tohave abottle more than 100ml but can eat a whole 4oz training meal.  GO figure!<br /><br />We have landed on plain cherrios vs the canisters which she lost interest in.  Straeberry mum mums NOT caramel or plain and teething bisuits above those.<br /><br />I cant beleieve how much baby food has evolved in a year.  I heat up breakfast and dinner and serve lunch icy cold.  She seems to like the changes.  I got the plum spoon that screws on for when we ar on the go but as a rule, the playtex spoons with silicone are THE BEST!!!! and I have a drawer full. I hope this helps, we really have tried all the snacks and foods we could get our hands on in store and online.
