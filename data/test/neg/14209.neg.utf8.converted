While this is decent for mass produced bagged tea, the cost is not at all justified.  I've had my fair share of Japanese greens, including many Tamaryokuchas, and this is not a good Tamaryokucha.<br /><br />Not only is the aroma and flavor lacking (this almost tastes and smells like a bad vegetal oolong more than a Japanese green), the color is completely off.  Instead of the emerald green you'd expect from a steamed Japanese green, it produces a muddy yellow color.  The lush mango aftertaste you'd expect from a Tamaryokucha is almost completely missing from this tea.<br /><br />If you want a true Japanese tea experience, go to a local tea shop and buy some high-grade Tamaryokucha, Gyokuro, Sencha or Matcha and a cheap kyusu to brew it in.  The initial cost will be higher, but you will save money over the long run brewing in this method, and the quality of your tea will be considerably better.
