Compared with about 20 other types of K-Cups I've test-driven in various samplers, this is one of the weakest.  Even making a "mug" size (medium setting, not large) in my Keurig produces a very weak cup of coffee.<br /><br />The hazelnut flavoring is superb as hazelnut flavorings go, and it's at the perfect taste level, but the coffee is substandard.<br /><br />If you want a hot cup of hazelnut, I'd suggest going with a better K-Cup coffee maker -- Timothy's, Diedrich's, Newman's, Coffee People, Green Mountain, etc. -- and then pouring in some Frangelico....  =)<br /><br />It's sad because Gloria Jeans has been around FOREVER and had tons of shops in the area I grew up in 30 years ago.  I hate to pan an old friend!
