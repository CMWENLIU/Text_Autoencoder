The product was cloudy and pale, not dark and clear like true sorghum syrup. The taste and mouthfeel was more reminiscent of gum acacia or gelatin. I was very dissapointed and discarded the material as unappetizing at best. I found another supplier who is a member of the sorghum syrup producers association and displays their logo.
