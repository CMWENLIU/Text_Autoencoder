While the boxes are lovely, the content isn't. Everything in them save for the hard candy was stale, melted together into one fist sized ball, or both. You can find all the items inside at your local grocery store for about fifteen dollars. Maybe even your local .99 cent store. I am not sure the boxes and ribbon are worth the additional thirty five dollars, even if the items inside the boxes were fresh.
