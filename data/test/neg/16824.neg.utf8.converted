This product is not really sugar free. If you check the calories from sugar, which I could not find disclosed here, you will see that the product has calories from sugar in it.  While it does not include regular sugar, it does include Maltitol which is a sugar alcohol.  Not really a good choice for someone looking for no sugar as there are better alternatives.  A 90% chocolate can get the sugar count down to 1 gram of sugar per serving.
