Pros: The taste is good, just like other Belgian chocolate.<br />Cons: They don't look like the one in the picture. The chocolate is in the shape of a  tiny and thin tea cups. There are only about 8 pieces of them, weighing less than 0.25 lbs total. I know there is very tiny fine print stating the pictures are only serving suggestions, but who the hell in the world sells chocolate with full blown misleading pictures like this?<br />Additionally, the quality control is so poor. I ordered 4 boxes of this. The first box, all of the cups were severely deformed with extreme color variation. The second box, the cups were in good shape, but the color is very grainy with white spots all over, looks like very old chocolate. I was too embarrassed to share the chocolates with anyone lol.. I can't wait for more surprises on the other two boxes..
