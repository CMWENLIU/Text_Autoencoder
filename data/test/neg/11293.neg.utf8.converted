I've been trying to give up sodas and switch to water but was just getting bored so decided to give Mio a try.  Peach Tea flavor is the first one I've purchased and it definitely didn't work for me.  When you open the small container, there is an immediate smell that I can only describe as bleach-like - sort of like an overly chlorinated indoor swimming pool on a hot day.  I thought it was probably just because it was concentrated and would be okay once diluted in water.  I added 2 squirts to my full bottle of water (20 oz.) and took a sip.  The flavor is actually pretty good, not Snapple tea good, but passable.  The smell, however, was just as strong as it was in the concentrate.  Every sip was like taking a big mouthful of pool water.  I couldn't finish it. I ended up tossing it out.  A couple of co-workers tried it and both said the same thing.  "It smells like bleach."<br />I don't know if I'll try other flavors after my experience with Peach Tea but definitely would not recommend this flavor to anyone.
