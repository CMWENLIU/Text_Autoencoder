We experienced the country shift that Native Forest went through last year. Since they are one of the few, if only, companies offering BPA-free coconut milk, we stuck with it, but the quality of the product is pretty poor now. It was actually BETTER when it would separate because it actually tasted like coconut milk. You just has to heat it in another container to get it to combine (come on - its an organic product - mother nature didn't produce things for long distance shipping in metal cans and THAT'S OK). Now that they've switched countries of origin, it stays more mixed, but it has NO COCONUT TASTE. It is just a can of guar gum. :(
