I bought these after reading all the good reviews.  I was not paying attention when I placed my order, because I did not realize that I would be getting only 8 pieces of candy for $15.00. Seems like a lot of money just for 8 pieces! I tried one of the candies today and if it wasn't for the pecans it wouldn't have any flavor at all.  I will never buy this product again.  Werthers has a far better tasteing product for way less the cost, and you get way more for your money.
