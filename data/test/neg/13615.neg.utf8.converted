What an aggravating product. The package label says "lightly sweet", which sounds perfect, and says that it makes 5 - 16 oz drinks. Checking the Nutrition Facts on the back of the package I see "11 gms of sugar"--sounds reasonable. But when I mix up a packet per directions (in 16 oz.) it was undrinkably sweet. Taking a closer look at the fine print, I discover that although the directions are for one 16 oz. drink per packet, the Nutrition Facts are for "SERVING SIZE 1/2 PACKET and 10 servings per package". My 16 oz. "lightly sweetened" drink contains 22 GRAMS of SUGAR. The packaging is misleading twice over. What could have been a good coffee drink is ruined by our culture's addiction to sugar and corporate labeling practices.
