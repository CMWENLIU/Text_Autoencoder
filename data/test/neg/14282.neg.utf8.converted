I've used the silver can dutch cocoa for years and have always loved it. This Special Dark version is darker and does not taste nearly as good as the silver can variety. I had to make two batches of chocolate icing, and I only had enough silver can cocoa for one, so I used the new stuff for the second batch. The colors were completely different. The Special Dark version was almost black and didn't taste nearly as good. I had to mix the two batches together so that my cake didn't look bad. I think that people in my area aren't so impressed with the Special Dark version -- I've noticed that it is no longer available at any of my local grocery stores.
