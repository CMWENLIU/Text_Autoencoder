I cannot believe what can be charged for the amount that is in a box.  I ordered this item for a rather expensive Christmas gift for a friend and I'm now ashamed to give it as a gift as it is so sleazy.  I opened this box to what I hope was what I had in mind for $97.90.  You almost have to have a magnifying glass to see the items enclosed.  For this price it had better be the dang cheese in the nation.  Soooooooooooo disappointed and disgusted!!! 'Tis the season to be ripped off and RIPPED OFF I am!  Ouch - won't make this mistake again!!  Buyer beware!!!<br /><br />L. Stevenson
