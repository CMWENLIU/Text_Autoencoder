Earth's Best is what I fed my baby after breastfeeding. I am a label reader and noticed they are sneaking 'organic glucose' into the formula. I don't care if the glucose is organic or not - it's CORN SYRUP! Addictive, cheap, non-nutritious corn syrup. The fourth ingredient, no less. In addition, the DHA/ARA is derived from a process that involves Hexane - a possible neurotoxin. Earth's Best claims that testing shows no traces of Hexane in the formula but that is not good enough for me or my baby. Why bother adding an ingredient that requires a process that uses poison when there are other alternatives? Not a good call, Earth's Best 'organic'. I am switching to Organic 'Baby's Only' formula.
