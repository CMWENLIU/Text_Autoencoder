Since being diagnosed with a gluten sensitivity I have been searching for a gluten-free product to take the place of my long time favorite side, Velveeta Shells and Cheese. This is not it. When we began cooking this product I was very hopeful due to the taste of the noodles, then we added the "Mac & Cheese seasoning". The title alone should have thrown up a red flag, however we felt obligated to try it anyways. I wish I had taken a picture of my face upon tasting this product. It may well have been the most disgusting attempt at a cheese sauce I have ever encountered. After tasting how foul this product was I offered it to my 70lb dog, whom has been known to eat anything; at which time he proceeded to sniff, taste, and walk away. In the almost 2 years I have owned this dog this is the first thing that he has turned down. I strongly suggest paying the extra money to have Annie's Homegrown Creamy Deluxe Macaroni Dinner.
