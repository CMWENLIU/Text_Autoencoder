Shame on you Hansen's. Your item description says "Country of Origin: USA" but the bottles are all stamped with a code that states that the apple juice concentrate is from China. If I had known that you import your juice concentrates, I'd have purchased another brand of juice. Perhaps you could update your product description to more accurately convey to the consumer just what it is you are trying to sell. I will be calling Amazon to try and return this juice and hope that I'm not stuck with this stuff because I'm certainly not going to give it to my kids. I'll stick with Knudesen's juice. Sure it's a little more expensive but it's an American product and it's the real deal; it's not made from a concentrate.
