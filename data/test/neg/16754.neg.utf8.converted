I have eaten restaurant quality bisque and this is not it. You can see the bits of minced crab, but the batch I received had no flavor. I added spices and a generous splash of half and half which improved it somewhat. I canceled my subscribe and save subscription. I also read the reviews for their other products and seems one either loves them or doesn't. Ending on a positive note, their label is made w/ certified green paper and vegetable inks and the cans are made from recycled steel which I thought was impressive.
