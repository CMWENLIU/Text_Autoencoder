I've had the pleasure of trying a couple different kinds of the Snikiddy snacks. This one, and the Southwest fries. This one wasn't so good. They may be a "healthier" snack, but this one definitely wasn't very tasty.<br /><br />Snikiddy boasts of an All Natural product. Which it is. They are gluten free, no msg, vegetarian, and they have less fat than a lot of other snacks. There's even some vitamins packed in there. A read through of the ingredients shows that they can all be pronounced without problems, which is always a positive. It even has real cheese, yay! But cornmeal is the first ingredient listed. Which isn't necessarily bad, but I wish corn wasn't the predominant ingredient. It would be nice to have a snack without corn.<br /><br />The taste, its kind of hard to describe. Worse than cheetos, definitely. It tasted cheesy I guess but not in a good way. I usually can get through a whole bag of snacks during a workday. This one though, is still sitting mostly full on my desk after about a week. I just can't make it through more than a fry or two at a time. The cheese is kind of cloying and the texture gluey once you get through the initial crunch. The taste never changes through the entire consumption but stays the same bland yuck the whole way through.<br /><br />Not a very good snack in my opinion. They need to revamp the taste to something different. A healthy snack that noone wants to eat doesn't help anyone at all.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012
