The place that sells and ships this for Amazon thinks nothing of sending<br />very badly dented cans.  I ordered a large amount of this and over half of the cans were dented very badly.  The type of dents a can gets from a high fall which tells me these people are not the least bit careful with the food we are supposed to eat.  I will not buy anything that this company has anything to do with.
