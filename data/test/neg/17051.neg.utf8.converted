Honestly, at first they tasted good, but after the second bag the taste was unbearable!  My buddy who eats just about anything couldn't even finish a bag! haha.  I don't know how these other people are eating these, but this product is not what I would want to eat.  Also, there are 1.5 servings per little bag FYI (i.e. not much protein and fairly caloric- much much better off buying protein powder or eating chicken).  I hate to bash this product, but I feel like I wasted my money on this one.
