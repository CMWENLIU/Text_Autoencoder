I was looking for a formula for my toddlers and was shocked to learn today that those made with organic brown rice syrup contain particularly high levels of arsenic, compared with products without this syrup.<br /><br />Seventeen baby formulas were tested in the Darmouth College study. According to the Today show, "Two of the infant formulas contained organic brown rice syrup as their primary ingredient. These products had arsenic levels 20 to 30 times that of the other infant formulas.. The amount of arsenic consumed by an infant could be significant depending on which formula they drank.. arsenic exposure early in life may increase the risk for health problems later on."<br /><br />The study, published in Environmental Health Perspectives, indicates that organic infant milk formula containing OBRS as the primary ingredient had total concentrations up to six times the EPA safe drinking water limit.<br /><br />The formulas tested were not named but a quick search turned up that Baby's Only organic toddler formula - both dairy and soy - uses brown rice syrup as its main source of carbohydrate. I for one will be passing on this product.
