I needed a filler item, so I figured I'd get some food as I'd be sure to use it.  Wrong.<br /><br />This "soup" is atrocious.  It has a sweet strangeness to its taste that is unbearable.  And it never quite shakes the underlying taste of water.  There are chunks of soup base that never get dissolved no matter how much you stir or heat it.  The pasta bits and beans have a powdery texture.  All in all, it's pretty bad.<br /><br />I don't know what I was expecting from 100 calorie ready-to-eat vegan soup, but... I was disappointed.
