I ordered these naively thinking they would taste the same as any other crystallized ginger.  I mean, they only have two ingredients, right?  Wrong, these were weirdly like gummy bears instead of chewy and they had very inconsistent flavor.  The whole first bag tasted like some one dumped a flowery cologne in it.  I much prefer the Reeds brand to this and am going back to them as soon as I finish my case-ugh!
