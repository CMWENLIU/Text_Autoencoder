I really don't know how this can be considered food. I love the original Velveeta Shells & Cheese and bought the 2% at the store by accident, so when I saw them in my pantry, I figured the accidental purchase would allow me to try this "healthier" option. My exact reaction when putting this stuff in my mouth: 1) Umm, okay not THAT bad, 2) WHAT IS THIS?! 3) Worst, most artificial/bitter after-taste ever. In this case, half the fat is simply not worth the pain when trying to swallow this stuff.
