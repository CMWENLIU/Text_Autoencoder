I bought and installed two of these traps 8 days ago.  Let me report on the results so far.  The traps have caught exactly ZERO food moths yet I killed 62 in that time myself.  I am willing to believe that the product I got was "expired"  or "defective" in manufacture... but it is disappointing to say the least.
