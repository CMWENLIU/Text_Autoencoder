When we're looking for invisible, that means clear.  Like the clear Invisible Raspberry, and clear Invisible Grape and clear Invisible watermelon-kiwi.  This product description says it's a green powder and that it turns BLUE in water.  Blue is not clear nor invisible.  The product described is Blue Raspberry not Invisible Raspberry.  Kool-aid made an Invisible Raspberry whem they introduced the Invisible Watermelon-Kiwi, and that's what I want.
