I fed my champion Shetland Sheepdogs this food for over six months.  A few of my dogs did alright on it but others had loose stools and lost on average 2 pounds from the previous year. Upon giving more food to gain weight the dog's got even looser stools.  I e-mailed the company about it and never got a reply. Coats were shiny but not good enough for show competition.  Since taking my dogs off this food they have gained weight and coats are coming in to the point I can show them again soon.  I do like the philosphies of this company with regards to ingredients but makes me wonder if no grain at all is such a great thing.
