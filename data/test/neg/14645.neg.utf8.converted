When I lived in Arizona, I used to buy dehydrated Refried Beans from the bulk section in New Frontiers, and it was great!<br /><br />I'm living in Chicago for the moment, and so I needed to find a good substitute for my New Frontier's refried bean mix.<br /><br />I am writing this review to WARN you that I DID NOT find a good substitute with this product.<br /><br />The consistency is good, thus the 2 stars, but that's about all that's good about it.<br /><br />First of all, the prepared beans have no taste.<br /><br />But the worst part is that Amazon and the product listing don't tell you that one of the ingredients is TBHQ.<br /><br />I only discovered this because I started to have a reaction about a half hour after eating the beans.<br /><br />I got itchy joints, waves of nausea, weak muscles, sleepiness, voracious thirst, cotton mouth...<br /><br />I thought I would find MSG on the side of the package, because those are symptoms I get after eating MSG.<br /><br />But then I saw that the preservative was TBHQ, which I had not heard of before.  I did some research and found out that many people have MSG-similar reactions to TBHQ.<br /><br />This product also contains soybean oil, and I do my best to avoid anything with soy.<br /><br />You may not be sensitive to these ingredients, but I wish someone had written a review mentioning this because if they had, I wouldn't have ordered the product.<br /><br />I am now stuck with 7 more allergy-inducing packages of this stuff.
