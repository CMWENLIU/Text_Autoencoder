I don't understand these good reviews. (Its like these reviewers never had real miso soup before.) I had the opposite feeling about this product. I followed the instructions closely and it had all the ingredients of miso soup, but it still didn't taste like miso soup! It looked like it (minus the dried tofu) but it tasted like nasty water. As I was drinking it, I kept wondering "why am I eating this? Why am I filling myself with this? I shouldn't be putting junk down my stomach." I should have punched myself for feeling obligated to finish it all. Fortunately, I ended up dumping it down the drain.<br /><br />If you want real miso soup, go to a Japanese restaurant. If you want something that doesn't taste like miso and is watered down, buy this product.
