This is the last time I will order pet food online. This product was recalled even though I do not live in a recall state. I dumped the bag and submitted all of my paperwork for refund 2 months ago and have received nothing...I am out $35+. Diamond Pet Foods has been subject to numerous pet food recalls and its hard to find their name directly on the bag...but they are behind this Taste of the Wild recall. I am disgusted by this slow refund response and the sloppy practices of our pet food manufacturers.
