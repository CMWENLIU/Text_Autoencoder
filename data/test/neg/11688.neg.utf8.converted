Didn't like this at all.  I have always used McCormick raspberry extract and love it.  The store I shop at regularly stopped carrying McCormick, so after reading the review I went for it and took a chance. This one tastes nothing like McCormick and to me has a medicinal  after taste to it.  It also has a funky brownish color.  This does not contain any alcohol just extract and glycerine.  I thought maybe alcohol would help reduce the medicinal taste.  I added Ciroc Berry flavored vodka to lighten the color and improve the flavor.  That didn't help either.  Won't be buying this one again.
