I used to love this stuff. I don't know if what I got was the real thing or not, but its nothing like what it used to be.<br />Stubbs Moppin Sauce used to have a clean, sharp, vinigar flavor with a hint of pepper.<br /> This stuff has an over spicy/peppery flavor with almost none of the vinigar flavor.<br /> I have only opened 1 bottle and I had to throw that out. It was pretty nasty. Could be out of date???<br /> Anyway, I can't find this stuff in the stores anymore and the Stubb's website only sells it in combination packs and I don't want to pay for the 2 bottles of stuff I don't want.
