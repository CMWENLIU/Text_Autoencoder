The wheat I received was either old or stored improperly. Weevils (bugs) are an unavoidable aspect of whole grains. All grains have weevil eggs in them. But when you buy grains, they should be free of mature, live bugs when they arrive, and they should stay that way for a long time. When you buy organic brown rice, do you expect to find bugs in it when you get home? No. With proper storage, it should remain bug-free for the shelf life of the grain. After sifting through several cups, the bug problem forced me to toss this wheat.<br /><br />Another complaint is that the wheat was not very well cleaned. I had to remove a lot of foreign seeds and the occasional small rock.
