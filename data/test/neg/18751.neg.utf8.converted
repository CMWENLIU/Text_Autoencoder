After received the shipment, I found that the seed is not the one I had from living whole food before.It's a smaller in size and lots of dead bugs inside! Even the packaging saying TODD SEED or something like that. I e-mailed them and this was the  reply was from them...... "It's the identical product, but we were getting too many complaints about the packaging from Living Whole Foods, so we went with an upgrade to the packaging from another company.  The seed itself is absolutely identical.  QAI certified, etc." So I thought,let me try and see.I made one tray and juiced but it's not the same taste and the grass is not dark green.I contacted them for refund since it's a wrong item they send me but they refused the do the full refund.I had to ship back out of my expense for $12 shipment and they refund me only $19 out of $23 .I guess,I used 1 pound which they deduct and refund $19.What a cheap company!!Why you are using LIVING WHOLE FOOD name and selling diffrent seed?Isn't that illegal to do?
