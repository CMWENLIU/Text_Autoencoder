I saw the negative reviews for this product, but decided the positive outweighed the negative and it was worth a chance. Think of it just like that - a bit of a gamble. Maybe you'll get a good mix, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll get 35 cups, maybe not. I got 31 cups and they were not all unique - some were duplicates. All that said, the cups that I did get included a nice variety and there are several flavors that I had wanted to try and I am now getting to do so. I wish my mix had included more coffee and a bit less cocoa, but I feel like I totally signed-on for that gamble. I did, however, expect to receive the number of cups advertised.<br /><br />I waited to do my review because I contacted the seller and was hoping the situation would be corrected, but it's been nearly two weeks and I've had no response.
