I love Nutella but these small packages turned out to be terrible. Out of the 96 small packets 21 of them were leaking all over the box. Some were perforated on the top but most of them actually had a broken seal around the edge of the foil indicating poor manufacturing. Top it off with the fact that they were all just clustered in a big box instead of in a neatly organized manner and this package was a nightmare!
