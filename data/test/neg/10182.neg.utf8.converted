I totally love Yerba Mate.  Too much probably.  But some studies have shown that there is a connection between regular mate use and several types of cancers.  Another study found that mate has high concentrations of molecules associated with smoke that are known carcinogens.  Inference: it's most likely the smoking process that causes mate to be carcinogenic.  I know the smoked version takes better, but the unsmoked version ain't bad at all if you like the mate taste.  So do yourself a favor and find an unsmoked mate (I don't want to advertise --they're easy enough to find).  After a couple of pounds of unsmoked mate, you won't miss it.  But to be more safe, alternate mate with strong green tea like I do.
