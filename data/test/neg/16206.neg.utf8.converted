I expected this to be a creamy taco topper, a bit spicy, a bit tangy, and a bit like Ranch. I wasn't sure I'd like it, so I didn't put it directly on my taco. I put a puddle of this sauce on the side of my plate, and thank god that's all I did! This was, in a word, disgusting. It was so bad, in fact, that after my first taste of it, I went back in the kitchen and WIPED IT OFF MY PLATE. I didn't want to look at it. I didn't want to smell it. I didn't want it anywhere near me. My dinner companions hated it just as much.<br /><br />You know what came to mind? Harry Potter. You know those jelly beans Harry Potter eats in the first or second book? The flavor of this sauce makes me think of the earwax jelly bean. Or the vomit one. It's just that bad!<br /><br />I absolutely love taco bell's restaurant sauce. It's a shame I didn't like this as well.
