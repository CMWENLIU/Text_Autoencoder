Don't be fooled by the slick graphic of a young green coconut with coconut water splashing out of it.  Also, don't let the "USDA Organic" stamp sway your purchase.  Not only is this coconut water from "concentrate", it also has "natural flavors" which is liberally used by companies who don't want you to know their products contain MSG.  For further information about this go to the excellent website Truth in Labeling where I had a re-education on reading labels.  MSG is a neurotoxin and it is something you don't want to be ingesting.
