I ordered this tea for a change and, indeed, it is! The tea is much stronger and not as smooth as I am accustomed to drinking. It takes barely a few seconds to steep before turning bitterly strong. I like the concept of the triangle bags but they have torn and leaked out tea a few times. It is a bargain tea and good for those who enjoy a strong, robust flavor...just a little too much for my tastes.
