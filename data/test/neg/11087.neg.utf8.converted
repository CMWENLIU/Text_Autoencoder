I would gladly review the item, if only I could get it. Thing is that the Einsteins working for Amazon figured that for 27 bucks they would send me one box of pop tarts containing 8 pairs, rather than 8 boxes containing 8 pairs and then to add insult to injury went on to argue with me that the (Pack of 8) in the description means 8 pairs of pop-tarts as opposed to 8 boxes of 16 pop tarts!!!<br />My advise to Amazon - dont quit your day jobs. Stay with the book business!!!
