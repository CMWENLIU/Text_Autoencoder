I probably would have been happy with the product, had i known that it came in different sizes. Mine does not fit the size jar i use and it is the 'only' size for that particular product. I must have thought that peanut butter or sunflower seed butter came in standard size jars.  Therefore mine is not very useful to me.  I'm sure its a good product other wise, just be sure to know what size to buy.
