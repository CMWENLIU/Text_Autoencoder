This treat did not have good reaction with my Jack Russell terrier mix, he ate it fine and even enjoyed it, but then he suddenly became quite hyper and nervous like he was having caffeine shakes.  I definitely will not be feeding this to him again.  It is too bad also since this looked to be a great treat, I looked at the ingredient list and did some research on all the ingredients and the only one that can cause an allergy is carrageenan, which is the vegetarian equivalent of casein, used as filler.  It is a natural ingredient derived from seaweed, but is said to cause digestive problems.  Most doggie treats do not contain carrageenan so this is the only ingredient that may have caused a reaction in my dog.  I am giving the treat two stars for the effort and intention, but there really should have been more research regarding the fillers.
