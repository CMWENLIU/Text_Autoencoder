I should start by saying that I eat the  Nugo Free Dark Chocolate Trail Mix bar daily, often twice a day.  A mini-meal with good protein that is edible and doesn't have soy is hard to find.  I go through 4 boxes at least of the Dark Chocolate Trail Mix bars a month. Everyone in my family eats them.<br /><br />SO...I ate one of these in the sampler 3-pack I got directly from the company's website (a good way to start).  The Dark Chocolate Crunch ones were OK, but as another reviewer described with these, there's definitely a stale cereal quality to them.  The "carrot" "cake" "flavor", though: teeth-rattlingly sweet, no carrot flavor that I could discern, and definitely a strange taste.  In short, not pleasurable.  I've eaten my share of gross protein bars, raw food bars, and other products, and so my tolerance for things that aren't really the texture or flavor that food should be is pretty high.  And I've certainly eaten worse.  But I've eaten better, and I actively like the Dark Chocolate Trail Mix flavor.  Certainly get a sampler 3-pack from the company directly if you're curious (I think they do free shipping, although the Amazon price is better for the cases).
