I loved the flowers, HOWEVER, there was an error in the order and I was unable to reach any live person to correct it, even though I wrote an email and left several voice mails an hour after the order was placed. I am still waiting for a refund for the order placed in error, and will soon have to battle for it I guess. I have used this company in the past and like their product, but not being able to contact anyone to change the order was most unsatisfying. If I do not get the promised refund I will not use this vendor again.
