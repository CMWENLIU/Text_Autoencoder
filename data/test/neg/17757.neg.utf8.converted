I have a cat and dog.  I had a flea infestation so bad that I got bitten during my sleep all over - hands, feet, neck, body.  I thought it was mosquitoes initially.  I got this flea trap and placed it under my bed, and near the dog and did everything they said.  My animals were itching a lot all the time as I had run out of flea meds and vet was out of supply temporarily.<br /><br />I DID NOT CATCH ONE SINGLE FLEA AT ANY TIME FOR 2 MONTHS OF USE IN VARIOUS ROOM, NEAR DOG, UNDER CABINET, UNDER BED - NADA, ZERO, NIZ, NYET, NON!!!  This manufacturer needs to be reported to FTC for making false claims on products.  Utterly useless, DO NOT BUY!<br /><br />Here is how to eliminate fleas:<br />do it myself pestcontrol Online - Order Talstar Pesticide and Ultracide for spraying your mattress.  Do not spray pet bedding - wash it instead.  Smell is too strong for animals.<br /><br />Vacuum your house as if your life depended on it!!  Vacuum floors, carpets, crevices, mattresses, under cabinets, etc.  Throw away vacuum bag at end of first vacuum, then weekly.  spray Ultracide inside vacuum bag to kill fleas as they hatch and store vacuum outside your house.<br /><br />Spray house and yard with Talstar using a 2-3 gal pump sprayer like Chapin.  Mix and spray.  Kills all bugs outside too!  Do not spray flowers or edibles.  Spray perimeter of house, driveway, cracks in concrete, ant hills, etc.  Avoid earthworms.  Repeat in one week to kill hatchling fleas.  Let dry before letting pets back in.  Has no smell.<br /><br />Spray your mattress with Ultracide and under cabinets.  This has a strong smell. Do not spray this near animals as they have sensitive noses!  Let dry and aerate house.<br /><br />Wash animals with Eqyss Microtek Shampoo and Eqyss Premiere Conditioner. Give dogs Comfortis orally once a month.  Give cats Revolution applied to skin once a month.<br /><br />On Amazon, buy Nitenpyram ($1 per tab) from Little City Dogs, which is generic for Capstar ($6 per tab).  This works for 24 hrs only and kills fleas instantly. Give animals orally (2 sizes) at the same time you are spraying house so all fleas die that day!  You can give them Nitenpyram same time as other flea meds, no problem.  Give animals another dose next day then after one week, so you keep zapping new hatchlings.<br /><br />This should eliminate fleas for 6 months till the next spraying.  I spray 2 times per year and keep my animals on monthly flea meds plus Nitenpyram as needed.
