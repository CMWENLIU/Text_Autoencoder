The original was much better than the blend.  Bought this, realized it tasted different, then looked at the jar. They added a little tiny blend to the labeling (it's not the same picture as shown).  I'm sure it was done to save money, but at $10 a jar I sincerely doubt they were losing cash on the product.  If I wanted chocolate almond butter, I would have simply bought it (they do sell it).  Disappointing that they changed the recipe then tried to slip it by everyone...
