These candies were bought and sent as a gift to a family member who loves chocolate straws.  When they were received by her, we realized that they were not "filled" with chocolate cream at all.  There was a "thread" of chocolate cream in this very hard candy.  Chocolate straws are crunchy and "filled" with chocolate.  Terrible, feel embaressed that I sent them. Now as far as packaging and shipping, great!  It was received when we were told it would be.
