the price says $1.21 an ounce....they ship you 2 ,15 ounce steaks for $72.75...same price as lobell's or allen brothers... relatively speaking...but amazon did give me complete refund....but be aware the price is $2.42 an ounce...the steak was well marblized but very inferior in taste to the prime steaks that i buy from my butcher in philadelphia...brian oppenheim in philadelphia
