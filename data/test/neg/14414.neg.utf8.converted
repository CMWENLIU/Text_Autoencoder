I have orderd these before and have given the a 5 star rating. Before this order I read some reviews that were not very good, but decided to try 1 pound just to see. Well, these are barely two star, still eating them but are sticky in the bag, my guess not completely dry, smell good so feel safe to eat. Still sold on Goji berries but will try another brand.<br /><br />Very Disapointed Goji Consumer
