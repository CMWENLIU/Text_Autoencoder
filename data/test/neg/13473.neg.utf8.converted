I gotta say I love the idea behind this product.<br /><br />That being said, this flavor was very disappointing.  I'd have preferred to try the unflavored plain one out first, but this was the only flavor they had.<br /><br />I'll start with the pros.<br /><br />1. It's cheap.<br />2. It's a better option than most packaged drinks.<br />3. There is a minimum of crap in it, as far as I can tell.<br />4. It has a low carbon footprint relative to other coconut waters.<br /><br />Now for the cons.<br /><br />1. It does not taste anything remotely like coconut water.  I would say it maybe has a slight bubble gum flavor to it, but not really.<br />2. Neon/florescent pink color.  It looks like I imagine a pink lemonade made by Crystal Lite to be.  Lose the color!<br />3. Not refreshing at all.<br />4. The zippy top on this package is a bit of a PITA.<br /><br />I would like to try the plain one before writing this product off entirely.  I really like what Big Tree Farms does, but until they make this a better product, I recommend staying away from this one.
