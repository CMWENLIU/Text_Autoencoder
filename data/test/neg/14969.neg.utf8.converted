Oh boy! It's Reese's Peanut Butter... in a jar!? Well golly gee willikers - sign me up!<br /><br />Pretty much the only people buying this item are people who like Reese's and believe deep down that a naked Reese's cup is a happy Reese's cup. Why go and sully such delicious peanut butter by covering it in milk, dark, and white chocolates? Enter this product, which had such huge potential to make me so very fat and happy. Alas, for it has gone and made me of a sadder type of person. When I opened the box, I wasted no time in unscrewing the lid and peeling off the safety film, and in I dove with a spoon fit for a king. Unfortunately that spoon had the gall not to warn me it wasn't true Reese's peanut butter, but standard peanut butter, and in it went.<br /><br />I frantically turned to the ingredients looking for that one special ingredient that would have made it all right... There's Roasted Peanuts, Sugar, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Salt, Peanut Oil, Monoglycerides, Molasses, Cornstarch, and ... um ... nothing else. -sigh- My taste buds were right; That one ingredient that I was looking for wasn't there: Magic.<br /><br />As peanut butter goes, it's average creamy peanut butter. Good on toast with grape preserves, on crackers with honey, and on thighs. That's about it. For its' averageness I will give it 1 stars where I would otherwise give it 0. But oh... how there was such wasted potential in that jar.
