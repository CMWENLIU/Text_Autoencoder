The taste is very sweet and nutty and the canned coconut water does not have any of the nutritional benefits found in tetra pak. Im guessing its the way they need to heat the coconut water in order to fill it in cans.<br />I gave it two stars because it does taste like coconut albeit a very sweet version. For the same price, I prefer a tetra pak brand like vita coco which has less sweet taste + nutritional components like potassium, magnesium.
