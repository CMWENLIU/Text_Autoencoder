Delivery fine. Kobe beef WAY short of expectations. Thought $32.50 a pound (delivered) was too good to be true.  Apparently, it is. Cooked 3 steaks thus far using 3 different methods found on the internet (no cooking suggestions included in shipment or on vendor's website).  All 3 attempts resulted in tough meat.(Seared 2 minutes per side and then cooked another 3 minutes turning often).  I've had more tender Choice ribeyes from Fry's in AZ at $4.88 a pound. Very disappointed. These steaks were graded 7-9 BMS (so I was told in response to my email inquiry). I find that hard to believe.
