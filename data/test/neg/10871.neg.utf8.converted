I purchased these and once home ate them and experienced a severe gluten reaction.  On the bag in small print at the bottom it said they were manufactured in a facility with wheat and dairy.  The label also stated that routine testing occurs only to maintain gluten free label status.  Our bag tested positive for gluten which caused severe bleeding.<br /><br />Please be careful when buying this brand as the statement is for CYA and labeling purposes only.  That way they can charge more for the product.
