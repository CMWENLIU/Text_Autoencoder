The product description stated "Cadbury Flake, 1.13-Ounce Units (Pack of 24)"  I only received 22 individually wrapped units.  I had expected to receive 24 individually wrap units, then wrapped in a larger Cadbury bag. Unfortunately I can't ship these back because they were a gift to a group of people for today so I am 2 short. :-/<br /><br />The shipping package included cool packs to ensure they would not melt which is great for the summer months! The individual flake bars were all intact.<br /><br />The wrappers are international marked with writing in lots of different languages, I've seen similar wrappers at airports around the world.  They say they were made by Cadbury Ireland.<br /><br />Expiration appears to be May 14th 2013<br /><br />The chocolate was delicious as always.
