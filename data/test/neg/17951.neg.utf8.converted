I love sugar-free Red Vines, and have ordered them from another company and received fresh ones - yummy!  These spoiled me for life - I cannot tolerate stale ones anymore because they are so much work to chew.  I had gotten a subscription from Amazon because I don't like to run out, but they seemed to get more stale with each delivery.  I finally gave up and cancelled my subscription.  Back to Twizzlers!
