Though this is sold as all-natural, it does not taste natural.  It leaves an unpleasant aftertaste and is almost soapy.  Ruined the cup of coffee I added it to.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is that my husband uses it on occasion.  I'm giving CE organics caramel a shot and hopefully it will live up to its stellar reputation!
