I have tried several brands of quinoa and this is my least favorite because of the bitter taste. The other brands (Bob's Red Mill, Nature's Harvest, NOW) are pre-rinsed, which helps remove the bitterness. Have you ever tried rinsing quinoa? The unboiled grains are tiny and slip through all but the tightest knit colander or sieve.  Even after rinsing, there was still a bitter taste. The price is more competitive, but the taste leaves much to be desired.
