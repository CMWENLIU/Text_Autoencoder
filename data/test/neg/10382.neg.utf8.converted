I don't know what "100% Sustainable Ground Coffee" is (and don't care); all I expect from any coffee is decent flavor & aroma & Lavazza Tierra! was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. Maybe the problem is the unusual fine (almost fluffy) grind, but when I opened the sealed can & didn't get the usual great aroma of fresh coffee, I knew there was trouble.<br />I hate to throw it away, so I guess I'll use the rest up by mixing it in small proportion with my regular coffee.<br />Stay away!
