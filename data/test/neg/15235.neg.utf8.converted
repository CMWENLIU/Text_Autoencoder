I love the taste of Mrs. May's products, but the Sesame Crunch gave me "Pine Mouth."  Sesame Crunch is made in China, and contains pine nuts.  Chinese pine nuts, as well as certain other pine nuts, can cause you to have a horrible taste in your mouth for up to two weeks after ingestion.  Everything you eat tastes bitter or soapy.  I've had it for five days now -- blech.  No more Sesame Crunch for me.
