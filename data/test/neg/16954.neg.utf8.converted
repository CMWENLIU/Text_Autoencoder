I have purchased many different items through Amazon.com over the years and never had a problem.  Never wrote a review. Until today.  I purchased the cherry jolly ranchers along with a box of green apple flavored ones as a gift for my husband who was remembering how much he liked these as a kid.  Never again!!  Both boxes of Jolly Ranchers had one broken candy after another.  I just threw away about ten of them because they are not just broken, but crushed to dust.  It looks like someone just kept pounding on them until they were nothing but slivereens of candy splinters.<br /><br />If I could give this seller a zero, I would.  There was NO care in the handling of these boxes.
