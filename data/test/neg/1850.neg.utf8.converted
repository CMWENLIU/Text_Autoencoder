We use a lot of coconut milk in our house. In addition to cooking with it, we use it in our coffee every morning. I've purchased this brand before (Native Forest Organic Classic) and the coconut milk was rich and creamy. The BPA-free can was also a strong selling point for me. However, I am VERY disappointed with this last shipment I received. There is a pronounced reduction in quality... watery milk with large gritty chunks of fat. No creaminess at all. I see from the other recent comments that other customers have experienced the same disappointment.<br /><br />The lower price and BPA-free cans become less attractive when you are receiving a sub-standard product... especially a case of it. I'd rather pay more for the other brand I purchase, Natural Value Organic Coconut Milk, and get a higher quality product.
