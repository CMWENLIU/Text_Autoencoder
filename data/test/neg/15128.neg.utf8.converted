I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE shelf stable milk.  Whoever made it so that milk could taste good and not have to be refrigerated is my personal hero.  And I love chocolate milk.  But the Horizon Organic Chocolate milk doesn't tast good to me.  The regular milk is great, and even the vanilla is OK, but the chocolate just doens't taste good to me.<br /><br />As far as the price goes, $[...] is outrageous when Costco carries the chocolate variety at like $[...] (or less).  Whole Foods has a great price, too, but the closest one to us is like 100 miles away.
