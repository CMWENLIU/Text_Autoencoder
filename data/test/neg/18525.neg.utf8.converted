I've been drinking coconut water for years and I've tried them all ONE, Vita Coco, Naked, etc.. Zico was my favorite until this recent change where they added a new ingredient called "natural flavor". It use to be be pure coco water but the new ingredient change the taste for me. This was one of the highest reviewed coco waters on Amazon before this change...what a pity...<br />I'm dropping Zico from my auto-ship and going back to something that doesn't have artificial "natural flavor" added to what should be pure coco water.
