The flax seeds I received are contaminated with grit,  dirt and rocks,  and other filth, possibly rat droppings or leavings of other vermin and extraneous seeds from unknown weeds.<br /><br />  Having read a previous review which described rocks in the Bob's Red Mill flax seeds,  I called up Bob's Red Mill and talked with a representative who said that this had been a problem but was now corrected.  I ordered with confidence that I would get  something that would be usable.  Didn't happen.  I called Bob's Red Mill and left a message requesting to speak with someone about the problem;  I was thinking that I might have gotten seeds from an earlier lot packaged before the problem had been addressed.  This was last week;  nothing so far from them.<br /><br />  I think Amazon should not sell Bob's Red Mill unless there is evidence that they are willing to provide safe and clean products.  You could easily scratch or split a tooth by chewing on rocks.  Even with tedious sorting out of Bob's Red Mill seeds,  there were still particles of grit and rock which were overlooked.  I'm throwing out what I received from Bob,s Red Mill.<br /><br />  In the meanwhile I've ordered and received golden flax seeds from Arrowhead Mills.  Absolutely delicious and clean and ready to use.  Superb ground up with a coffee mill.  These are available with a discount for subscribed delivery (subscribe & save) also from Amazon and can be found if you look around on the Amazon site.  I am also subscribed for automatic provision of the Arrowhead dark flax seeds which are also excellent,  with a somewhat different taste and texture and nutritional profile.
