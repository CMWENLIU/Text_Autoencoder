I chose this basket because I'm a major coffee lover and a gift basket filled with a variety of international coffees, cookies, etc. sounded perfect for me. Unfortunately, I was more than a little disappointed by overall presentation and quality of the items included. The basket itself is nice and even reusable, but the straw filler material makes a mess when you take items out of the basket. It looked like a box of shredded wheat exploded on my table. The coffees were just okay: an Arbuckle Mocha Java, an Arbuckle Breakfast Blend, an Arbuckle Amaretto Royale and a small can of Irish Cream Coffee. (There wasn't any Jamaican Blend included in the basket I received.) The European style cookies were fine, as were the stirrers, sugar and mints. The creamer was generic. The iGourmet ceramic mug is a nice touch, but I still think this basket is way overpriced considering the quality. While a basket for coffee lovers is a great idea for an individual or as a gift, without an exceptional selection of gourmet coffees and lots of high quality extras, I'd rather pick up a bag of some high quality coffee and a pack of cookies at the grocery store for a fraction of the price.
