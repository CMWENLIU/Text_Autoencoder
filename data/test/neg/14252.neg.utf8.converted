This almond milk tastes great! It has a great flavor that is similar to cow's milk with a nutty flavor. If I think the taste is so great then why don't I give it a better rating? Unfortunately, there is no calcium in this un-enriched version so I can't really use it as a milk substitute for my children. When I can find an enriched version on Amazon, I will definitely renew my Subscribe and Save for that one.
