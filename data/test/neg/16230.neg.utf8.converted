I received my popcorn on December 6, 2011.  The bag is dated Sept 10.  So, it was either packaged 15 months ago or it expired 15 months ago.  Either way, it is as chewy as the supermarket junk I was hoping to avoid.<br />I was fooled by all the great reviews, luckily it was only sixteen bucks.  Expensive for chicken feed, I know, but thats where its going.<br />I'll try the Great Northern brand next, but am not very hopeful after this huge bag of jaw exerciser.<br /><br />As always, Amazon's shipping and packaging were great. Just a lousy product.
