When this product first came out, it had no added oil and was actually healthful. But on the more recent packaging, you can see that it says, "New, bolder taste!" And what kind of chip do they consider to have a "bolder" taste? One that's more oily. The chips now have oil added (look at the ingredient list!), and it only takes 18 small chips to give you 3 grams of dietary fat. I've signaled my dissatisfaction with this (I now consider the labeling to be deceptive, because the chips are as fatty as many fried snacks) by no longer buying the product.
