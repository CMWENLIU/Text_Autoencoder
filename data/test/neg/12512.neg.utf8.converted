Having grown up in the Caribbean drinking coconut water from the source hundreds of times I can tell you unequivocally that this does not at all taste like coconut water. I got this today because earthfare was out of the brand I got last time, which was O.N.E. That tasted more like pure coconut water. This has a really odd taste to me and not in a good way. If the taste is so different, you have to wonder if the nutritional content is also not the same.<br /><br />On a side note, the O.N.E. brand coconut water was all gone but this brand was on the same shelf at earthfare right next to it fully stocked, so interpret that however you will.
