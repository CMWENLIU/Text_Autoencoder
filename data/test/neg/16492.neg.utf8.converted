This is the best I've tried.  It would be perfect if it were a bit thicker.  It gets kinda thin when heated.  I add a bit of shredded cheese to thicken it up.  Regardless, the flavor, heat, etc are excellent and far better than the Que Bueno that Costco sells (and is too thick).<br />---------------<br />Update 24 Dec 2011 - Right now the price is $36.  It used to be $24 (that's what I last paid for it according to my Amazon invoice).  A 50% increase is ridiculous.  It is good but not worth the current price.  I'm looking for an alternative.<br />---------------<br />Update 1 May 2012 - I found an excellent alternative for a bit less convenience (El Rio is still WAY overpriced at $36).  Try La Victoria Medium nacho cheese sauce.  I have only found it in 6 pound cans (at Cash and Carry in WA - probably also at Smart and Final in other places) for about $8.  La Victoria is at least as hot and the thickness does not change as it is heated.  Excellent flavor.  What I ended up doing is splitting it into freezer-type zip lock bags - roughly 14 oz each - and freezing them flat with no air inside.  They thaw in 10 minutes in the sink.  Then I clip one of the bottom corners off and squeeze out what I need and then fold the corner back up with no air and put a spring-loaded clip on it (a chip clip or binder clip works) and keep it in the fridge while I'm using it.  Opening and closing the zipper is asking for mold issues.<br /><br />I also tried vacuum sealing in glass mason jars and keeping them all in the fridge, but that didn't prevent mold.  The zip-lock bags work great and the flavor and consistency of this cheese is the best!  It is worth the repackaging effort.
