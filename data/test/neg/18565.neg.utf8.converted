This tea is an alright oolong, but it is nothing special. It is definitely not worth the price listed here. Maybe it is worth half that amount. There are much better oolongs out there for a cheaper price. This tea basically lacks character, being neither dark and rich, nor sweet and refreshing. As I have said before, better oolongs are available, even in teabag form, that are far better than this. I barely even touch this tin anymore, because I prefer other oolongs.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009UC09U">Foojoy China Classic Min-nan Oolong Tea - 100 Tea Bags</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JI4SD8">FooJoy Tie Guan Yin Tea - 100 Individually Wrapped Tea Bags (7.0 Oz)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W2VVZY">High Grade Famous Fujian Anxi Golden Oolong (Wu Long) Loose Leaf Tea - Huangjingui Oolong - 3.5 Oz</a>
