When I first heard about these cookies, I imagined they would be essentially be a sextuple-stuffed oreo.  Excessive, but why not?  They I saw the photo with the three cookie layers and two creme layers, so I revised a little and expected a quadruple-stuffed cookie, with a chocolate layer and a vanilla layer.<br /><br />But no.  This is three cookie layers, and two single creme layers.<br /><br />Is it an okay tasting cookie?  Sure.  Would I buy it again?  No.  Regular or double-stuffed Oreo's are both superior.<br /><br />Nabisco, you have missed an opportunity here.  People want more and thicker creme layers!  This cookie is far too healthy compared with what I want.<br /><br />Clog my arteries or give me death!
