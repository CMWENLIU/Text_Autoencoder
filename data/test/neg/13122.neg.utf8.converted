I bought this to try because of the RHONJ connection.  At first, it seemed as if the water wasn't black, but it was the label that was making the inside liquid color.<br /><br />It does seem like you are drinking murky water, even though the taste doesn't reflect that.  I am, however, cancelling my reoccurring shipments as I enjoy the Voss water a lot more.
