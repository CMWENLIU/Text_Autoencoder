Unlike the regular Campbell's Mushroom Soup, this has very little flavor. 4 cans are so badly dented that they may be unsafe to use, remaining 8 cans were also dented.  Outside box has no damage, so the cans were apparently dented prior to shipment.  Cancelling subscription to this disappointing purchase.
