This is not something i enjoyed chewing. It's like chewing on a candle that would be lit for relaxation. Or maybe a lotion used for aromatherapy. It's disgusting. If you wish to try it, it's best to just buy ONE PACK before you invest in this multipack. Trident Layers: wild strawberry + tangy citrus is my favorite. Green/apple + golden/pineapple is good too. I purchased both of those in the multipack and was very happy. Good luck to you if you buy this flavor.
