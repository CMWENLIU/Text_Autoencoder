I am writing this review from the hospital... A couple of weeks ago I ordered the "Whole Rabbit" from Amazon in hopes of having my wife cook it up nice and good.<br /><br />The problem started when I opened the box. Of course I had been wearing my 3 Wolf Moon T-shirt for about 3 weeks (Still had another week before it needed to be washed) and the pack was hungry. They proceeded to claw and bite at the Whole Rabbit. I was an innocent bystander as the wolves mauled at my own torso trying to get to that waskally wabbit torso I held in my hands.<br /><br />There was no way I wanted to give it up as my wife has a great recipe she found on Amazon. The ingredients, to name a few, are; Tuscan Milk (naturally), Uranium Ore, and Twinkies. Anyways, the Whole Rabbit never got cooked, I ended up with scars about the head, neck, chest, back, stomach, and face. But worst of all, my beloved 3WM t-shirt is in utter ruins (at least they got fed).<br /><br />I can't afford to buy another one because of all the hospital bills, does anyone want to donate a 3WM to me? I will never buy rabbit from the internet again, I will stick to the live ones at the pet shop. I just need to make sure my Burmese python isn't roaming the house free when I bring the live one home... wish me luck!
