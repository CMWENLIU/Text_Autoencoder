I ordered these given the reviews and given they're organic..but they have a cough medicine taste, like a cherry throat lozenge. They also have a strange consistency when you bite into them, not at all like a normal fruit snack. Luckily amazon is awesome and refunded me. Good lesson to stick to what you know!
