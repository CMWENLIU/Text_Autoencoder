I had been using these bags for a few years but just cancelled my next delivery because the quality has really gone down. The seam at the bottom gives out, and I have found myself unintentionally flinging poo like a bad monkey. It's not like I've got a large dog either. I buy the regular sized bags for my 20lb dog, and even when he makes a smaller than usual dump, there's a good chance that the bag might not hold up for the 100 feet to the next garbage receptacle.
