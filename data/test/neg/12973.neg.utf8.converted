Ok, these are not really that healthy. They are made with fruit juice which is better than corn syrup BUT they still have canuba wax and the electrolytes are added not natural and no complex carbs( you need brown rice syrup to be a complex carb and has the natural electrolytes- like in Sharkies). These leave a coating in my mouth(from the wax). These are really glorified jelly beans. I feel no energyboost and they mess up my blood sugar. If you want the real deal get sharkies.
