I agree that the new French Vanilla Cafe's new Maxwell House Blend is not as good as the original.  I don't know if you have changed your recipe, but I use to drink it and feel "ummm".  Now I have to add sugar or some other sweetener and it isn't the same,it is too bitter without it though. I would order this if the original taste was back.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E52WQA">General Foods International Coffee, French Vanilla Cafe Coffee Drink Mix, 9-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a>
