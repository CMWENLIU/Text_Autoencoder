all I can taste is the dry cocoa powder. Really disappointing. Are you familiar with the Hershey's Cocoa powder you buy in the can for baking? Well if you have some, open the can and smell it. That's what these taste like. I don't know what you would use these for. I thought about maybe in a dry pie crust like the cookie crusts but the after taste is bitter so I wouldn't use it that way either. This item, to me anyway, is a bust...
