Worst experience I've ever had with bread. I usually LOVE Bob's Red Mill products. I've used everything from the low carb baking mix to their almond flour. Fabulous! But the low-carb bread mix? Awful. I bought 2 mixes. I followed instructions carefully and ended up with a mass of strawlike fingers criss-crossing over a misshapen loaf the first time. And it tastes awful! Strangely gluely, spongy, and bits of straw or cardboard. You've got to be kidding! So I try again. This time I follow instructions carefully and put my bread machine on "rapid rise" instead of standard (like the bread mix product stated). This time it's slightly better--not as many odd fingers of straw stretching across the loaf. Still, misshapen and tastes horrible. I've re-read the instructions a thousand times. I've read my bread machine instruction booklet a thousand times. No reason that this bread should come out this way, but it does. By the way, I've tried other recipes that have vital wheat gluten and other ingredients in the Bob's Red Mill low-carb bread mix. Same outcome. Horrible tasting. Could not cut the loaf (the Bob's or the homemade) at all. Was able to twist off a misshapen lump from the loaf. Ugh! I'll stick with other Bob's Red Mill products, but this one? Never again!
