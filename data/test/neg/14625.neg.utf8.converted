I normally use the diluted stevia from trader joes which I love but I thought using two level teaspoons for my coffee was quite a bit and with all the coffee and teas I drink working from home the bottle would only last me 3 weeks. I saw the reviews for this stuff on Amazon and thought I'd give it a try. People were saying a few drops well it is more like a few dropper fulls. To give you an idea about my level of sweetness, if I were a Starbucks fan which I'm not I would like something around a mocha. To make my coffee in the morning with this stuff and chocolate soymilk I need to use 5 full dropper-fulls not 5 drops to sweeten it. Needless to say the bottle doesn't last any longer than my Trader Joes powder and one bottle of SweetLeaf is twice the price. On top of all that the diluted Trader Joes powder doesn't have any aftertaste whatsoever. Even in mild teas it only sweetens and doesn't change the taste. This SweetLeaf stevia does change the taste not necessarily bad but noticeable with the amount I use and I'd rather just taste my drink.
