I was so excited to get it because I am on a diet and I knew wha cht it taste like and was waiting to make some cheesecake. I opened it and it smelled like moth balls. I decided it just might be the outside that smelled. When I took a bit of my cheesecake all I could taste was moth balls. It ruined the whole cake. Wont by from this company again.
