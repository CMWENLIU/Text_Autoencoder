We received a free sample of Feline Greenies in the mail today from PETCO. Our 13 indoor cats gobbled the entire 1-oz. package in less than 10 minutes. Even our finicky eaters loved them. We are very careful pet owners, double-checking every ingredient in anything that they eat (in the same way that we watch our own food). Unfortunately, I fed first and checked later (something that I have NEVER done before and will never do again)!<br /><br />Imagine my dismay when I found menadione sodium bisulfite in this product. This toxic, unapproved ingredient has no business in our pet food. Its use is prohibited in many European countries, and our own FDA won't approve it.<br /><br />We have requested that PETCO discontinue the sale of this product immediately, until the manufacturer removes this poison.<br /><br />If you love your cats, you will not feed this product to them. Just do a web search for "menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB)". You'll be a better cat owner, that's for sure . . .
