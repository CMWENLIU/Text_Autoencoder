I just open my baby cook, I read very quickly the instructions, because I was very exited to make my baby food, So everything was OK, I put some carrots and potatoes in dices. they cooked perfect, then I mixed them using the water that i got from the steam. the mixed was fine and creamy, so i started to give the food to my baby, she made a funny face for the 2 first spoons and then she eat everything, almost by the end of her food, I tried a bit of the foood, AND  OH MY GOD!!!!! the flavor was BITTER, so I was very concern and worry,  I started to look after this bitter flavor,.....I FOUND THAT THE STEAMER MADE A FUNNY SMELL, so I decided to stream only some water, after the cycle stop, I TASTED THE WATER AND FLAVOR WAS BITTER!!!!!!!!!! I TRIED ALMOST 5 TIMES, I PUT SOME VINEGAR AS THE INSTRUCTIONS SAID FOR CLEANING, BUY THE BITTER FLAVOR IS STILL THERE, SO ANY TIME THAT YOU WILL MAKE OUR FOOD, YOU WILL GET THIS FLAVOR; IS THAT HEALTY?,  PLEASE.....DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT, THERE ARE MANY OTHER WAYS TO MAKE HEALTY FOOD FOR YOUR BABY. I BELIVE THE STEAM RESERVOIR HAD A VERY BIG PROBLEM:::::::............BE SERIUS CARFUL
