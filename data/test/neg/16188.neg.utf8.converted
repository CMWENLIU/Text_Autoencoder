I thought this was a poor assortment as I was looking for coffee, not tea or hot chocolate.  Perhaps I should have read the details a little closer.  However, this assortment is way over priced.  You can get 4 boxes of 24 count K Cups from Green Mountain for $45.00 +/-.  Perhaps it is a good assortment to get started but I was disappointed in the mix.
