I strongly urge Amazon.com to pull this product. My employer has a yorkie, and she almost lost her pet because of this very product. Xylitol, the third item on the Breathalyser ingredient list, has been proven to be a toxic chemical to animals. It's been shown that as little as three grams can be fatal to a medium-sized dog. It causes precipitous hypoglycemia, liver damage, blood-clotting problems, and dehydration. Google "xylitol pet health" for more info, and check it out on snopes.com. Also check out avma.org (american veterinary medical association) and do a search on xylitol.
