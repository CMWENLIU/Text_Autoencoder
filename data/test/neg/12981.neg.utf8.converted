I googled these treats - as I now do for all pet snack products - and learned that these, too, have made the dreaded list of dog products made in China. Other reviewers who have taken the time to write about this spoiled, rancid garbage that has made their dogs ill are completely right. Sure, the imported treats are very cheap, but ones that are stamped A Product of China or Made In China, Taiwan, etc., should be avoided at any and all cost. The spoiled meats cause liver and kidney failure and are deadly because they are poison. Period.
