I bought these for my niece and nephew (3 and 6) who are ADHD.  The 6 year old would take them without too much of a fuss but the 3 year old refused to eat them.  She took one bite and spit it out.  This is a child who eats EVERYTHING and rarely dislikes food.  I decided to try one and they are fishy tasting.  Like another reviewer, I was disappointed and felt it was a waste of money.  I am going to try the Coromega brand next and hopefully I will have better luck!
