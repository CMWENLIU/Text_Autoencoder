My wife and I were thrilled when we heard that there was a soda with Stevia used for a sweetner, instead of dangerous Aspartame or other artificial sweetners.  We went down to our local health food store, where we purchased several different flavors of 'Zevia', including their cola.  Imagine our surprise when we read one of the ingredients listed as erythritol, a sugar alcohol!  And then we learned that it very well could be made from GMO (genetically modified) corn!  Our quest for a truly natural, non GMO, stevia only soda continues!
