The spices were accurate if a little cheap tasting. The tea type is wrong, thai iced tea is not made with green tea. The orange food dye seemed a little much. When I brewed the tea it made my entire house smell terrible for the entire day. It is cheap but I dont think I will even brew another batch. I would rather pay 2.50 at the thai restaurant nearby.
