bought 4 large boxes (pack of 2) in all flavors. when we received them they were very light. Upon opening them there were no grounds, or paper filters.  They were competely empty.  When we brewed them, the coffee was first dark, then appeared to be clear.  This was a very disleading coffee.  We were expecting real coffee not instant.  When you read the label you think it is ground coffee not something else. It also left a sediment in the bottom of the cup.
