I ordered this for my Dad for Christmas.  While I knew he wouldn't get it in time, I didn't expect it to take 4 weeks.  When it did arrive, I was really disappointed with the selection of candy....much of which you can still buy in most stores. In addition, some of the "chewable" items were like rocks.  Fun idea...poor execution.
