I like Seaweed soup and just love the same product from San-J (also available from Amazon -- get it, it's 5-star!).<br /><br />This Miso-cup brand is terrible. I can't tell you more than this is just yicky. Wish there was a zero-star rating.<br /><br />I didn't finish the first cup even (but did give it a second try the next day with same result). Therefore, I only used one 2-serving envelope before giving away the rest. Oh, why did I stray from San-J? Actually, I thought it might be worth trying Miso-cup's different flavors to add variety to my afternoon broth experience. But ALL the Miso-cup were equally dreadful!!!<br /><br />I gave these and the other Miso-cup boxes to a Food Pantry BUT I told them first why to warn others it might not suit them. Get the San-J brand!!!
