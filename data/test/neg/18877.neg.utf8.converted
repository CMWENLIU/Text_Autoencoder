These candies fall far short of their glowing Amazon reviews.  They contain licorice but taste mostly of corn syrup and anise (the "natural flavor" in the ingredients list, presumably) and they stick to my teeth like no other candy.  My nephew, who likes Panda licorice and Haribo licorice wheels, and who will eat candy until told to stop, hasn't touched these since his first disappointed taste.  I would not buy this product again.
