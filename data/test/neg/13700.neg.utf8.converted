As others have said, the labeling is, at the very least, misleading, although I'd suggest that it's intentionally deceptive.  There's been a lot of interest in San Marzano tomatoes lately, and this is just one of the products that's attempting to cash in on that interest.  Fortunately, I always read labels, so i wasn't fooled by this product, still, I bought a can just to see what they were like.  Terrible!  Don't waste your money on these tomatoes.  There are many other canned tomatoes on the market, real San Marzanos as well as other types that are more flavorful and sometimes even less expensive.<br /><br />I wanted to rate this product with zero stars, but the posting format requires that it get at least one.
