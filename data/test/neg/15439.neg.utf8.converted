Actually, I feed my cat wet food and the chicken pieces in that looked significantly higher quality. I suppose if there was some kind of apocalypse and you're futilely hiding from our new alien overlords in some attic inside a blownout dilapidated building and you couldn't find any rats to kill and cook over a trash can fire, this might suffice to technically keep you alive. I imagine this must be close to the quality and taste of Russian prison food or perhaps the porridge in Oliver Twist. The entropy grey color of this slop is quite unappetizing and makes me feel as though I should have my head stuck through a gate and eating it out of a trough like a pig. Probably the only positive thing I can yield from this is that it allowed me to exist for 6 more hours without feeling hungry.
