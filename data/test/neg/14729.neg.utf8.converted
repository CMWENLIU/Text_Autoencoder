Bought at Costco but just recently came across an article about Waggin Train products where dogs have died or become seriously ill. Grateful that I had other treats and my dogs did not get alot of these...bag going in the garbage ASAP as I'd rather lose my money than my dogs.<br /><br />I won't buy any dog products made in china anymore considering their lack of environmental rules/laws and care and their attitudes towards dogs in general (they don't value dogs so why would they take care that the treats are not toxic?)<br /><br />Would not recommend.
