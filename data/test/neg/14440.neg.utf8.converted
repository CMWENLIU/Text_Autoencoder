I really thought that I could make a sugar-free chocolate milk or have something to have in my cocoa since I'm trying to reduce my sugar intake. This product is horrible. It doesn't dissolve into solution (hot or cold) and tastes chalky and not at all sweet. Just breakdown and use the extra calories with the agave nectar. It has calories but is much better than wasting your money on this low-cal alternative.
