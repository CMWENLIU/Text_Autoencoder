It doesn't say ANYWHERE on the package that these bags are biodegradable--which is the whole reason I ordered them.  To avoid literally hundreds of plastic bags (nearly 1,000 per year, since we have 2 dogs) going into the environment annually from this household alone!  If they were biodegradable, then manufacturer would say so.  Don't be mislead.  I'm returning mine.
