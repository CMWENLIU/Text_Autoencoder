I bought 4 dozen eggs from this company, after the farmer I was buying pastured eggs from went out of business.  When you crack the eggs the yolk is all watery and falls flat.  The second dozen was rotten and had a bad smell.  Apparently these chickens are fed a diet of cocofeed which is the left over remains after pressing coconut oil from the coconut.  Did one ever think that maybe waste is just waste?  What separates them from factory farming?  They say the chickens are free range but that doesn't really say anything. All it means is they are not in cages but it doesn't guarantee that they are outside of a barn.<br /><br />Fortunate for me the eggs I had ordered from another farmer finally came and they are so beautiful.  The yolks are deep orange against the pure white.  The taste is sensational.  I just can't bear to eat these eggs from tropical traditions.<br /><br />All I can say is buyer beware.  Maybe some of them were rotten because they are old?  Not sure.  It is hard to get eggs grown on pasture shipped but it is truly worth every penny.<br /><br />If you are thinking of having these eggs just get the ones at the store they are surely better.<br />db
