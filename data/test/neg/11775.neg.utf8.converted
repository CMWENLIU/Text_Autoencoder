If the cup isn't perfectly set in the coffee-maker and you try to close the lid, you will make a hole in the bottom of the cup, rendering it useless. Disappointed that it didn't come with this information written anywhere in the package and we lost 2 of the 3 we purchased before we figured this out. We'll be looking for another alternative.
