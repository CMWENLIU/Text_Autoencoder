I can't believe a positive review of this item exists!  We got one of these for our dog when the store was out of Merrick's "The Sarge" beef bones.  It was terrible.<br /><br />Our dog is a big, healthy, tough Labrador and loves her "Sarge" bones.  After chewing on the "Twin Hoofers" for just about 20 minutes, I noticed that they were coming apart into large, sharp pieces.  The women at the shop had said dogs can digest every part of the hooves, but I took them away because I wasn't comfortable with what was happening.<br /><br />By the next day, our dog was having horrible diarrhea and there were pieces of the hoof in it.  The morning after that, she vomited up several large, jagged pieces and then had so much blood in her stool that my boyfriend and I considered taking her to the vet.  We're waiting to see if she recovers on her own.<br /><br />Apparently, some dogs can handle it, but why take the chance that yours will have as much trouble as ours did?
