Lucini Grand Riserva Balsamico is not real balsamic at all.  There is no ingredient list on the label, which makes it suspect immediately. It is far too acidic, and tastes like any cheap vinegar in salad dressing.  This is the worst 'cheap' imitation balsamic I have ever tried.  The four dollar Trader Joe's 'balsamic' is better than this.  At least they have the honesty to put the ingredients on the label.
