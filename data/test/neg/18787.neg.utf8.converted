I just spent the past 90 minutes scouring the shelves of my local grocers with the original Protein Plus formula.  What on earth were they thinking with changing the formula? Caloric load went up 20%, sugar content when up 350%!!, carb content went up 36%, and fiber content decreased 40%.. Yes, fat content decreased, but it's better to have some fat with those carbs. This product, as originally formulated, was good for people on isocaloric (kinda like Zone: roughly balanced macronutrient ratios). It no longer is.<br /><br />I am furious.
