After reading the many glowing reviews for this tea, I just have to come forward and voice my support for JS's review. Almost completely devoid of aroma and flavor, the only thing letting me know I wasn't drinking plain hot water is the dark golden color of the liquor. So, clearly, there's SOMETHING there, but not a heck of a lot. Gunpowder green tea is one of the most intense and aromatic Chinese green teas; it should have an aroma of burnt wood and a charred flavor that is lightly vegetal. I expected much more based on the price of the tea, the fact that it's full leaf, and all these positive reviews.
