I've been looking for a natural cheese puff that did not have all the additives and preservatives in it to make one's stomach upset.<br /><br />I thought I found the right product with "Snikiddy Snacks Grilled Cheese Puff".<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was wrong.<br /><br />When you eat one, they do taste good. However after eating a few in a row, there is a bad after taste that can upset your stomach.<br /><br />They are also not very cheesy and the product does not resemble the taste of a grilled cheese in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />I'm still looking for the perfect cheese puff, but these will not be on my list.
