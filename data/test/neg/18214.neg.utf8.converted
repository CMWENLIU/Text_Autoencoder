The title says it all, this has got to be one of the worst (if not the worst) "foods" on the market right now.<br />Byproducts, corn syrup, grits, dyes, carcinogenic preservatives? You bet. I wouldnt even give this poison to wildlife (maybe to exterminate rats). I noticed a lot of small dog owners feed this to their dogs because they are stubborn and spoiled. That happens when you let them walk all over you. Buy them a good quality food, something meat based, grain free like taste of the wild, blue buffalo, nutrisca, etc, mix in some good quality canned food or add chicken stock and let soak and serve. If they're hungry, they'll eat it.
