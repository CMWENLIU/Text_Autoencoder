These are tasty, tangy-sweet classic hard candies with nice berry flavors; I like them very much.  The low rating is for the accompanying description.  THESE CANDIES ARE NOT SUGAR FREE.<br /><br />Diabetics and others with health concerns could be misled into purchasing these not-inexpensive candies thinking them appropriate for their needs.  Either the seller or Amazon needs to correct this error!<br /><br />Ingredients:  Glucose syrup (a SUGAR), SUGAR, citric acid, flavors and colors.
