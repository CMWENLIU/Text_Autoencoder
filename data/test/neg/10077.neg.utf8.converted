I bought this item after reading a previous reviewer who claimed this product was a good as Green Mountain Coffee's seasonal pumpkin spice blend.  This version was terrible!  It did not taste anywhere near my favorite from Green Mountain.  It was so disappointing.  And it was one of the weakest, most watery tasting coffees I've had yet in a k-cup.  I would not recommend this product at all.  You are better off finding a different flavor, and waiting for the next offering of pumpkin spice from Green Mountain.
