I understand that these items are fragile but my experience was horrible. The box was surrounded on only one side with bubble protection. 70 out of 80 sticks were broken. I got these instead of the better-tasting Bob's Original Candy Canes based on the reviews of mostly-successful, or at least mixed, shipping results. Won't do that again. I have had unbreakable items wrapped far better.
