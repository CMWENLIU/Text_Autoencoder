The beans are fine... nothing exceptional.  One of the reasons I selected this item as a gift was because of the attractive jar in which the beans are presented.  As you have guessed by now, the jar is NOT included.  In the end, you get a small plastic bag (as also pictured...) with chocolate-covered beans.  It is okay, but not worth the price nor the additional shipping costs.
