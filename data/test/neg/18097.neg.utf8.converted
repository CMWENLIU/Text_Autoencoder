I picked up a box of those at Target, eager to try it on our office Keurig machine.<br /><br />It is dreadful.<br /><br />It tastes like heated Hersheys syrup mixed with water, with a good spoonful of sucralose. It tastes nothing like a hot chocolate. In comparison, the Swiss Miss hot chocolate mix is leaps and bounds better in terms of taste and texture. Hell, even my Costco whey protein tastes better than that.
