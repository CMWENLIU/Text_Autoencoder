I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00161DVFS">Tony Chachere's More Spice Creole Seasoning - 7 oz.</a> and so gave this a try.  It's has a very salt-like taste due to the KCl (potassium chloride) used instead of NaCl (sodium chloride, real table salt).<br /><br />I used it to flavor some Ramen for a test.  The first taste was more or less like regular salt with a tiny dash of mild pepper.  I noticed an odd aftertaste, which I assumed was due to the salt being KCl instead of NaCl.  Unfortunately, the more I ate, the worse the aftertaste became until I felt like I was licking muck dredged from a Louisiana bayou.<br /><br />I'd recommend tasting this before you buy it, if possible.  Definitely try it on food you won't mind perhaps ruining and be wary of serving food up to guests that has been pre-spiced with this.<br /><br />I was going to throw mine out, but on reflection, I decided it would be fun to ask my friends to try it, "OMG, this is awful .. here, tell me what you think!"  ^^<br /><br />--<br /><br />Hotness: extremely mild, almost bland (nb. I consider Tobasco to be mild)<br />Salty: very salty, with an unpleasant aftertaste
