The package and description of this coffee fools me. From the look of it, I would imagine that it tastes like European coffe like aromatic strong dark but not sour or bitter like French roast. Well, this coffee tasted very bad base on my opinion, it is sour with no pure fresh coffee taste and it is a little stinky! My aunt visited us from France several months back where she brought over some instant coffe which I forgot the name, but this coffee is awsome tasting very close to fresh French roast slow drip brew. I'll post the brand when I remember the name. Tell me if I am wrong if you've had this Bustelo supreme before.
