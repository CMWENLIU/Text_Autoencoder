We did not like these at all.  The water was so thick, and it was too hard to get the noodles to cook properly.  They wanted to stick together.  If you have already purchased these, plan to eat right after cooking and try to use a much larger pot than you would expect. I've used the brown rice pasta before, and would recommend those instead.
