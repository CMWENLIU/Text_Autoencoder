I was really disappointed in this product. I eat Pho a lot, and good Pho (I travel extensively, Internationally). While I did not expect this "Pho in a box" to match that of my previous culinary experiences, I did have hope that it would at least taste "ok". This tasted disgusting, reminiscent of bad tasting medicine. As other reviewers have mentioned, the box includes the noodles, and the spice packet. Everything else needs to be purchased. So based on that premise, you are better of buying everything from the store (Asian specialty if you have one), since you will need to go there anyway.<br /><br />Update:<br />I also find it interesting that almost all of the 5 star reviews come from persons who only have 1 single review, and it is for this soup. Coincidence? I doubt it.
