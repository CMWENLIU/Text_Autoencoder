What a waste of money. All four cats (three indoor and one feral outdoor cat) won't eat the wet food. They like the juice and will lick that up, but they leave the meaty bits behind. I tried each flavor and not one cat will eat this stuff! I was hoping to save some money with Friskies, but it is what it is. And what it is is food that a hungry wild cat won't eat; she'd rather catch and eat mice. :\ My suggestion is to go to the store and buy a couple different cans and try that out first. If your cat doesn't eat it, it'll save you from having 2 dozen paper weights.
