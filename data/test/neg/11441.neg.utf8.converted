Barn Burner is rather warm, taste is pretty mundane, nothing to write home about....Raspberry Chipotle is pretty good and makes a great vinagerette for a salad.....the Queso Blanco is the best of all, great on chips or other mexican foods.  I would rate the trio a 3 1/2 for taste, but the lower rating is for the piss-poor packing & delivery.  The first order arrived from Houston, TX 10 days after I ordered ( I live 200 miles from Houston & have PRIME )  One of the bottles had broken, ruining the order, Amazon emailed a replacement (and to their credit made it a "RUSH" order) Fed Ex was trans both orders, this time it took eleven days, same flimsy packing (thin cordboard) nothing broken, but package was torn, & beat up.....
