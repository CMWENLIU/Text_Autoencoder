When I recieved the Breakfast cookies they were covered in white hairy mold. I assume that this was due to trapped condensation in the packages. BUT EH GROSS! I have ordered these cookies from here before and had no issues, and Amazon was quick about refunding the item, but I don't think I'll purchase them again.
