I was excited to get these noodles, as I am on a low carb diet, but was sadly disappointed when I opened the package, to find that the supposedly 8 oz. of "product" was actually half water, with half noodles. One bag is just enough for one adult portion size, so that equals to $3.00 per serving...for NOODLES!If it were packaged differently, with less water and more noodles, I might be tempted to buy these again, but I feel like I got scammed....big time!<br /><br />As for taste, it tastes like nothing, and is kind of like the Asian Tapioca balls that you get in drinks! They are tiny, though.<br /><br />In addition, one of the bags was leaking and smelled horrendous, so I was unable to eat it!
