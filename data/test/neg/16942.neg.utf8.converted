For those who are concerned about where their doggie treats are made - Dingo's are China made. It's too bad. My dog was given a  Dingo and liked it but I didn't realize until now, that they're not made in the US, and I'm more concerned about the quality and health of products. China's quality control is sub par and has caused too many problems in recent years. I'd rather not risk my dogs life, or health.
