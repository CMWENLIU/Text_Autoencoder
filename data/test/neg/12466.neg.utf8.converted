This is the worst product I've tried yet for my Tassimo: it uses the small size disk to produce a 'full' [by Tassimo standards] cup of coffee. If you could burn water, this is what it would taste like: the smell and flavor of ashes, with no real taste of coffee at all.<br /><br />If you are looking for a REALLY bold, flavorful coffee with no burnt taste, go for the Starbucks Kitamu instead. It uses the larger disks for the same amount of water, definetly worth the extra money.
