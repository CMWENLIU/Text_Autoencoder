I had never tried preparing bulgar wheat before, had no idea how to season it, so I purchased the box of 6 oz bags (pk of 12 with herbs)of Melissa's Tabbouleh.  The seasonings in it were too strong and I didn't know how to prepare it either, but going by the instructions that came with it I couldn't eat it.<br />  Unless a person really really likes to eat lemon rinds, I doubt if they'd be able to eat it.  We weren't.  The problem is I got an oversupply of it and ended up tossing it all.  Next time, if I try eating bulgar again (which I might because I'm trying to make more healthy food choices and I don't doubt the value of bulgar) I would instead buy it plain and season with our personal favorite seasonings and use that as a starting place.<br /><br /> This is not the fault of the company that made this product, it is entirely my fault for not knowing what I was purchasing.
