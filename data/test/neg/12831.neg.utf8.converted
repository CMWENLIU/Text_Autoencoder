This stuff was a disappointment to me after reading all the glowing reviews here. The texture was OK; I didn't have any problems with getting the crust to brown, or it being soggy in the middle. The problem was the taste, which I found somewhat reminiscent of bisquick. This stuff just doesn't taste like pizzeria pizza crust, not even close. Looking at the ingredient list I guess it should come as no surprise, since it contains egg, soy, and milk!<br /><br />My suggestion if you want a quick and easy homemade pizza crust without having to make the dough a day in advance, get some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004136MDG">Fleischmann's Pizza Yeast</a> and follow the recipe on the packet (Amazon's price is ridiculously high, check your local supermarket instead). It's almost as fast to make as the Betty Crocker mix (a few minutes of kneading is required), but the resulting crust is much better. I made one of each on the same night, and the Fleischmann's crust was the unanimous winner.
