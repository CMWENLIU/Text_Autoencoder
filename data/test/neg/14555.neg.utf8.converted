I bought this at my local grocery store. I now have it bagged to go back for a refund of my money. It has a horrible flavor - sort of how you would expect a pine tree and cinnamon to taste if they were ground together. I smelled it after I had decided to take it back, and it doesn't even smell like normal cinnamon. It has a medicinal smell. You can smell the cinnamon, but there is something else there that is not pleasant.<br /><br />I will never by this product again, and I wouldn't advise anyone else to buy it.
