I bought this tub expecting the nostalgic Dubble Bubble smell and taste I loved as a kid. That gum was packed in the old Fleer Baseball Card wax-packs. Concord Confections bought the rights to the name from Fleer. (Subsequently Tootsie Roll bought Concord.) Anyway, The flavor formula was changed by Concord. It's now just generic bubblegum. Not only that, the size of the gum has been reduced. With clever packaging, it looks about the same size wrapped, but the gum is no longer a solid "barrel" shape. It is now a smaller barrel with gear-like teeth around it which holds the packaging out so it seems like a more substantial piece than it is. The logo is misleading too. It says, "America's Original". The name is the same but the product is very different. Looks like we have lost a sweet bit of Americana.
