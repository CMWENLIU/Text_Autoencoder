I was initially disappointed on opening the package because the packages are so tiny.  Then I was more disappointed because they are less than half full.  There were maybe 20 small cheese straws in each package.  A four pack of Paula Deen has about the same amount of cheese straws as a single package of Geraldine's (the best packaged cheese straws, in my opinion, which sell for less than $5 a package).<br />But I suppose it's not a terrible thing that there are so few cheese straws because these taste terrible.  They use oil instead of butter, and I think that's the primary problem.  They're greasy instead of rich. They are also not nearly cheesy enough somehow.  Very disappointing on the whole.
