I bought this product thinking that it would be good for a rainy (or snowy) day. But actually I would rather have cereal than this. It is salty and has no taste at all. Perhaps since I am of Indian origin, I expected something more suited to my palate as I see that most of the others have given this a good rating (and that is what made me buy it in the first place). I have purchased similar stuff from grocery stores and they taste much better so it has to be this product. Definitely, will not buy in the future and not recommend either. Bon Appetit, folks!
