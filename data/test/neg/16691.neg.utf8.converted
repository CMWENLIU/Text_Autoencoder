Please stay away from this product. I bought 3 of them, first one broke while it was hunging the first night i put it out.<br />Second one, lasted 2 weeks and trapped about 20 flies.<br />Material looks and feels cheap. Why did i ever buy this thing. Can't return the 3rd one because shipping will be more that the actual unit.<br />What a waist of time and money!
