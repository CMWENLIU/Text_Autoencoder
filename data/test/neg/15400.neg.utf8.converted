WARNING!<br /><br />I have gluten intolerance (Celiac disease) and it says it is gluten free.  I was eating this hemp for a while and could not figure out what was wrong and why I was sick.  I was rotating hemp protein with other gluten free protein and noticed that I felt very sick on days I had hemp protein.  I have a baby and toddler who has the same condition.  You had to hear my baby SCREAMING in pain and throwing up my breast milk.  We called Nutiva directly and they told us that it is not gluten free.  They just switched to gluten free facility, but this bags of hemp protein are old and were produced in facility with gluten.  This is a serious problem.  I have to contact customer service to resolve this.
