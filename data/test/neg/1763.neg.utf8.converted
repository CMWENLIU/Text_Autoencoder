some company must have bought out the Clark name because i used to absolutely LOVE these candy bars and remember them very well.  i was so anxious to get them and when i did and bit into one, I could not believe it! they were absolutely horrible! i mean, even for a candy bar, they were bad!  i felt robbed. and could not return them to get my money back.  i felt cheated and, as i said, robbed. but even more than that, i really wanted those wonderful candy bars.  one star really doesn't say it, it really deserved NO stars!
