I bought these after reading all the reviews on Amazon.com and they sounded really good and were offered for a great price.  I just tried my first one and it was OK.  First impression is that they are soft and chewy (a plus) but the flavor is so-so.  I honestly do not taste any of the chocolate chips although I can feel them but the overall flavor is kind of, hard to explain except to say, perfumy. It's hard to describe but its not an oatmeal flavor like an oatmeal cookie.  It's that artificial sweet, kinda malty flavor I find in many processed energy bars.  I was looking for a substitute for the oatmeal/flax bars that I buy at Costco and these are not it.  I am eating my second one as I type and again, the first flavor that pops in my mind is something in the order of perfumy but not oaty or chocolaty. Overall the Costco ones (round tub) are a 5 star in flavor compared to these bars.  Big let down....
