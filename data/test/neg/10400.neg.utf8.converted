It may taste great, but Colavita's "White Balsamic Vinegar" isn't real balsamic vinegar. Neither is their regular. Check the ingredients. Both list first "wine vinegar." Balsamic vinegars are not made with wine vinegars. Real balsamic vinegar, and there is a white balsamic vinegar version, is made from white Trebbiano grapes in the Modena and Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. Regular balsamic vinegar is cooked down 30%-50% and concentrated to produce a dark color and deep, rich flavor. Then it's aged in various wood barrels that are switched-out each year. White balsamic vinegar is cooked at high pressure to prevent caramelization, which gives the vinegar a golden color and gentler flavor. The white balsamic vinegar is then aged for one year; yielding the light color and flavor. I hope you find the real stuff - it's great!
