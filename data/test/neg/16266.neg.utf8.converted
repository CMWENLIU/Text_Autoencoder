After the first buy, this became a subscribe and save item for our household. We started with Amy and Brian (and still receive that), but my wife wanted something with pulp, and I wanted to try a different brand. The first shipment was awesome. Our second shipment was not.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it's a storage or a QC issue, but of the twelve cans in the case:<br /><br />3 had their contents totally congeal into a slimy, mostly clear gel that was inedible.<br />1 had a pinhole at the base.<br /><br />There were also obvious signs that something had pupated in the packaging (i'm guessing fruit flies, but who knows).<br /><br />This was extremely disappointing, as the product itself is really good.<br /><br />Amazon: please stop denting your packages and keep them in the right temperature range!!
