I was disappointed with the gift basket. Dinner for two? My husband could eat the contents of this basket as a snack.  The pasta is enough for one person (6 oz) and there wasn't a jar of sauce to go with it.  The basket should be advertised more as an antipasto than a dinner basket since most of the items would typically be served before dinner, (olives, crackers, cheese, bread sticks, etc).
