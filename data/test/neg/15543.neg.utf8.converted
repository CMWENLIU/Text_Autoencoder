I hate to be the only one with 1 star review here, but I have to warn - I ordered Justin's Chocolate Hazelnut Butter because I loved the original. However, they recently (Sept. 2011) changed the formula which now includes almonds in addition to hazelnuts. The new label says "Justin's Chocolate Hazelnut Blend". The added word "blend" is tiny, but the taste difference is huge and and I don't like this new version. Justin's customer support team confirmed they changed the recipe and that they are now only making the "Blend" version.<br /><br />We'll see what other customers say about this new concoction. As for me - I'm not liking it. Justin, the original "Chocolate Hazelnut Butter" without almonds was WAAAAAAY better.
