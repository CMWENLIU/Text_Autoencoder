This is first time Ive gotten K cups that are made so cheap that the GLUE holding the top onto the k cup comes losse from the steam of the machine, and makes coffee grounds pour out and into my coffee and all over my machine.  I Bought 50 Of these and I Cant return them, and I Cant find anywhere to contact the seller , because the seller is AMAZON itself.  Im so upset, because I love my keriug machine, and now its all messed up, taking me over 30 Minutes after each of trying these particular K-cups.  So I Just have to throw them out.  DONT ORDER THESE!  I dont know if its TIMOTHY's MAking them, and they are so cheaply made, or if it's AMAZOn who makes them and uses Timothy;s Name, but either way they will ruin your MACHINE and RUIN your morning cup of Coffee!  This is The first Time its happened with any k-cups, but I will not order Timothys anymore because of it.  If I could return them, and get another batch, would be cool, but they wont let me return!  WHY? I only used about 5 , and 3 Of the 5 RUINED my coffee. I started looking closely at foil overlay and almost everyone, is loose and not sealed securely.  Now I Got 45 Of them to toss Out.  DONT BUY!
