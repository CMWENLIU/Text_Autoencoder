I am sad to say that I ordered these berries from Amazon and when the first shipment came they were rotten. The berries were all stuck together, very soft, sprouting and moldy.I called Amazon who then sent out a new batch. The next batch was also rotten, more so than the first. Amazon was great about giving me a refund - but it still leaves me without berries.
