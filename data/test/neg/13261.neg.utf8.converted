When these are floating around wherever I am, I often eat other chocolates, even candies first.  Even in cases where these are all that's available - come on it happens! - here's how it goes down<br /><br />Someone: hey I've got some of these ferrero rochers, these things are sooooo good<br />Me: (pretending to be excited for them), oh that's great!<br />Someone: I'm having one I frickin love these!<br />Me: Yeah, they're pretty good<br />Someone: Want one?<br />Me: ehhhhhh, I don't know I just ate<br />Someone: How can you not eat one? Come on you know you want one, here just take it<br />Me: (reluctantly) Ok I guess I'll have one<br />I take a bite and yeah I pretty much enjoy it, but the whole time I'm wishing i was eating something better...even a twix bar would be better, but i guess this is good.  I start thinking is it really worth the fat intake for the mediocre amount of enjoyment I'm getting? Answer is "no" but hey I'm eating it so I might as well make the most of it....<br /><br />Someone: See aren't you glad you took one?<br />Me: (politely) Yeah totally, thanks<br />Someone: I'm having one more, come on cheers (hands me another one)!<br />Me: ...sigh....
