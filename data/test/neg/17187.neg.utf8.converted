My dog almost died from this product. The bone splinters and the company knows it. They have a liability statement on their product because I am sure I am not the first dog owner to have gone through the hell that I went through. I bought a smoked bone from the grocery store because I thought it was big looking, met the size required for my dog and I thought since it was American made it was a quality product. It is far less than quality. Would anyone give arsenic to their dog, absolutely not. So don't spend your money on this killer product. After 3,500 dollars in gastronomy surgery, emergency care,I spent a sad and scared Christmas tending to a poor puppy whining and whelping in pain from their defective junk. Please take this review to heart, I want to spare you what I went through.
