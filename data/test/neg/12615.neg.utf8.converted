I have always loved Yogi Teas and have many flavors in my cupboard as I write this. I have never tried the Green Tea Kombucha flavor and would normally not write a review on an untried product, but think it's important to set the record straight for anyone who purchases this product with the intent of gaining the benefits derived from kombucha. The beneficial bacteria, yeasts and enzymes that make kombucha so healthful can only do so if they are alive. Heat kills them, so pouring boiling water on a tea bag is going to obliterate those benefits. If you are drinking this tea for the taste or the other beneficial ingredients, then it probably doesn't matter to you. However, it is extremely disappointing that Yogi Teas is using deceptive marketing to influence consumers of their tea in this way. If you want to derive the therapeutic benefits of kombucha, it is necessary to either brew it yourself using a kombucha "mushroom" or buy the raw bottled version in the store.
