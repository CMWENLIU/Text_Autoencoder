As another buyer mentioned here on Amazon, all four cans arrived with major dents. It seems they are getting rid of dented cans by shipping them sight-unseen to internet consumers. Bad tactic. I'll never buy from these guys again. I could have bought a large sack of 10 lbs of steel-cut oats for about half-price ($11) but the reason I bought this product for $22 is I WANTED TO HAVE THE CANS.
