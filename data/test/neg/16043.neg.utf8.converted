are glucose syrup and evaporated cane juice? Just because these ingredients are organic doesn't mean they're healthy. I worry that we are giving our kids the implied message that sugar is good. We already eat a ton of sugar, as a nation, and I don't have to mention what our obesity rates for kids are.<br /><br />Why can't we get a wholesome alternative that doesn't have a ton of sugar in it?
