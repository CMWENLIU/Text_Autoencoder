I bought the crackers for my baby son and he LOVED them. I liked very much that the ingredient list is so short. But then I discovered that the crackers are made in China - stopped giving them to my son and threw them all out. After all the lead in toys for children and melanin in baby milk, I just try to buy as little as possible that is made in China - and definitely nothing that my son will eat! If these crackers were made in the USA, I would totally recommend and buy them again.
