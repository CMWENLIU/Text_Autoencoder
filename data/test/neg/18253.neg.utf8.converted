We could go on, but you get the idea. Our 100% Juice products are just that. 100% juice.<br />This is as real as it gets. No sugar added. No artificial colors. No preservatives or flavors. Just all natural fruit goodness<br />There's so much fruit, just one serving meets half of your daily fruit requirements. And of course, they taste as sweet and fruity as only 100% juice can"<br /><br />Taken from the label on a bottle of the "JUICE" I purchased ...<br />o "Cranberry Pomegranate Juice Drink blended with another juice from concentrate"<br />o "15% Actual Fruit Juice"...<br />o "Ingredients: Filtered water, cane or beet sugar, grape juice from concentrate, cranberry juice from concentrate, pomegranate juice from concentrate, natural flavors, fumaric acid, malic acid, sodium citrate, ascorbic acid (vitamin c)."
