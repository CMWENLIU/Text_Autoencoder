Earth's Best makes good baby food that my child likes. However, I am rating their product here as it is available through Amazon. I'm very disappointed, like the other reviewer said, about the very short expiration date.<br /><br />A few days before I ordered this, the page said it wasn't in stock and that it would be available Sept. 15th. I ordered on the 15th, and it arrived on the 17th as promised with the free 2-day shipping. My case was supposedly the restocked pears, but the expiration date is Nov 09. New stock shouldn't have an expiration date that is only 2 months away, even if it is on sale! In the grocery store, the expiration date usually is 1 or 2 years away.
