At its weight, the huge bag of Nishiki Quick Cooking Brown Rice (10 pounds) isn't worth the hassle of returning. No way does this have a retail value of more than $60, by the way, but I bought it for just over $20, because I thought I could make brown and white seasoned rice blends whereby the rice would cook in the same amount of time. Brown rice takes much longer to steam or cook up than long grain white rice, and my family isn't fond of the flavor of brown rice by itself. I can get regular brown rice for much less cost at the grocery store than this package from Amazon, and when it arrived (very quickly - 5 stars for delivery) I read the package to discover the rice must be soaked for 20 minutes in water before cooking for an additional 25 minutes! Yikes! Nothing quick about a 45 minute process for rice. While I hadn't expected Minute Rice, I did expect a label stating "Quick Cooking" meant it actually cooks up quickly.<br /><br />For those who might not have cooked plain, brown rice, it steams or cooks up in the same 45 minutes or less that this "Quick Cooking" rice requires. I didn't even open the bag and will pass it on to someone who cooks brown rice on a regular basis. IF YOU LIKE BROWN RICE and you don't have many local grocery stores, it might be worth buying from Amazon, but don't expect this brand/type to save time in the kitchen.
