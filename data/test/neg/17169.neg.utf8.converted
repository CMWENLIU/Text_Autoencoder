I was very excited to find a quality green tea extract. Unfortunately, every time I take it, I get very nauseous. I felt this way for 5 days straight after I began taking it so I stopped taking it for 4 days during which I had absolutely no nausea at all. The very first time I tried taking it again, I was extremely nauseous within the hour. I've even tried taking directly with food, doesn't help. I have read that polyphenols can cause nausea so I'm guessing it is the high percentage that is to blame.
