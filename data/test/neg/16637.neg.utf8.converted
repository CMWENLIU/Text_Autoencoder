Been taking Stevia in the Raw for over 3 months believing it would be healthier for me considering diabetes runs in my family.  Well foolish me got sucker by Stevia in the Raw.  In small print the word DEXTROSE.  What is Dextrose?  Is a HIGH Glycemic Index, fast absorbing carbohydrate derived from corn.  Percentage of Corn - Genetically Modified. And how about the HIGH GLYCEMIC INDEX, not good for diabetics.  Definately not purchasing this again.  Also from what've read Truvia is no better - alcohol sugars.  Guess back to the drawing board.  Hopefully I can find a product that only has STEVIA and no other ingredrients.
