This product is advertised as Himalayan Goji berries. I understand that the Himalayas border on China. These berries are a product of CHINA. In view of the numerous food safety concerns around food production in China I would never had purchased this product had I known its origin. The product itself I had no problems with. Product of China should be in the description of these berries.
