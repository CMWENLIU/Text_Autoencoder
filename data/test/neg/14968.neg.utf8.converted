This gum and its very pink color ended up costing me $549.00 In dental work.  It turned the front tooth pink and the dentist worked on it for 2 hours first getting the pink out of the tooth then working on the material that he had to use to fill the tooth back in to return it to it's orginal color.  The was no cavity and brushing was done.  Just be careful unless you don't mind the dental bill.
