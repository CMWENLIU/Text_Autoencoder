Bought the item thru 9GreenBox and arrived on time and in good condition. This item has a nice, modern look to it. However, the vase and plant looks smaller than what the picture potrays. After having visited my local Ralphs, I found that these bamboo plants are sold at $3.99 and are bigger and more mature than the one sold by 9GreenBox. As price comparison, if Ralphs has the plant at $3.99 that would leave the vase at around $10 from this seller, which is a little steep in my opinion. Throw in a shipping charge of $6.99 that sums up to a total of about $21 and you have yourself an overpriced item; hence, cost you more than if you were just to buy the Ralphs plant and find a cheaper vase alternative.  As for the listing price of $59.99, that is just absurd.
