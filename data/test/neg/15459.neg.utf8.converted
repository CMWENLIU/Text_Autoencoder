I've always used the regular "litter tray with the scooper" procedure but when I saw this type, it seemed too good to be true. It was. When you pour the litter on top of the strainer tray, some of the clean litter sifts through and the cats end up with half of the clean litter originally put in. The clumping litter makes solids adhere to the underside of the strainer tray. You have to bang it against something to get the dirty litter off. As you do this, litter sprays around the floor -- no matter how hard you try to be neat, adding an additional "sweeping step" to the whole procedure. Also, the litter you have "strained" weighs in pretty hefty when you're crouched on the floor lifting and sifting the entire tray of litter daily! So, I say, if you just scoop it daily with a regular scoop, you will get the job done in half the time, with half the mess and half the trouble. I'm going back to the old method.
