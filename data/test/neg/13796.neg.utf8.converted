Unfortunately, this product has a couple of ingredients that are really just monosodium glutamate.  I always wondered why my dog chewed on it for awhile and then abandoned the bone...and went crazy wanting another.  His skin turned pink after chewing on them and he was agitated.  He's "addicted" as are humans to glutamates, yet they are excitotoxins, and scientific literature shows that the tons of free glutamates being added to our food supply (a website called "truthinlabeling" gives you the many names manufacturers hide the poison behind) are contributing to or even causing loss of vision, taste, hearing and more (neurons are needed to see, hear, touch, taste, etc. and that's what free glutamates "overexictes" and destroys).  Of course neurons are even more plentiful in the brain and muscles, and free glutamates destroy neurons there as well.  Many years ago a dog was injected with glutamates and it convulsed wildly and then died.  If I eat even a "molecule" of free glutamates I get a migraine, so I fully understand its nasty power. So, I'm sorry to say, I'll never purchase these again.  I thought they really did "taste good" to my little guy because of the "tender juicy middle"...but no such luck.
