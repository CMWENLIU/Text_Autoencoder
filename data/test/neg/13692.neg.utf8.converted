I can't imagine how, in 2010, Nestle might think that their slogan, "it's not for girls" is acceptable.  Implying it's only for manly men, who can reinforce their manliness by buying this candy bar, is boggling. This brand marketing is not just tasteless, sexist and weird, it's not funny.<br /><br />If it was some kind of mocha or coffee thing with lots of caffeine, and it said not for kids, that would be fine.  But it's MILK CHOCOLATE.
