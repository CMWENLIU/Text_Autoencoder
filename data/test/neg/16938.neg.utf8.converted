I grew up on Loma Linda products and was excited to see them available on Amazon.  The bad news is that these low fat big franks are way different than the normal ones.  I was excited to have my newly vegetarian girlfriend try them out, but then I was embarrassed because they weren't nearly as good.  They actually made us both a little sick.  They're just too dense and strange.<br /><br />Stick with the linketts or find normal big franks somewhere else.  I don't think they are on Amazon.
