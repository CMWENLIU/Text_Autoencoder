Zico used to be my coconut water of choice. When I first saw the new packaging I was excited that it would be easier to close and store. I was shocked when I tasted it - it is NOT the same product! The taste really turned me off. I've since switched to O.N.E. coconut water.<br /><br />I also determined that the new bottle size is too big of a serving. I like to drink coconut water before going to the gym because I've found it helps with endurance. It is not as convenient for me to carry the larger (by about 3 oz.) bottle, especially since I can't finish the entire thing in one sitting.
