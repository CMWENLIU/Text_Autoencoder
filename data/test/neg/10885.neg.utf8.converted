Got these as a Christmas gift for a friend. I bought the package in "Medium" not large. Later, as part of the Christmas ceremony, I went to visit him and was able to snack on the gift I had sent. The items, with the exception of apricots, were darned near tasteless. I was embarrased and mentioned my finding to my host. He agree: the worst I have ever given him. Only the apricots redeemed this as a two star.
