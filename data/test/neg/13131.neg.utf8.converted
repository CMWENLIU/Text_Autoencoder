Anyone who's well-versed in sugar-free products probably knows what "sugar alcohols" are.  Products like this mix put "Splenda" prominently on the label, but if you read the ingredients, that is not the only artificial sweetener.  This mix contains maltitol, which just does not agree with me at all.  If I eat even a small brownie for lunch, there's no living with me for the next several hours (and my belly gets bloated, too).  If I eat one at dinner, I wake up in the middle of the night with horrendous gas pains.  If maltitol doesn't bother you, you're lucky.  But I won't buy these again, even though they taste great.
