I generally like all of Newman's Own food products, particularly their salad dressings, so was surprised to find these ginger snaps completely inedible. It doesn't matter how healthy a snack might or might not be - if it doesn't taste good, the healthy question is a moot point. And Newman's Own simply got something wrong with this recipe because these little cookies are just no good. I let various members of my family try them just to make sure it wasn't just me who found them tasteless, and there was a unanimous thumbs down. I'll go for other brands of ginger snaps and stick with salad dressing, pasta sauces and such from Newman's.
