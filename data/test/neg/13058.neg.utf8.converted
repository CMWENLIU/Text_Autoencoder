For years, I used the generic store brand canned tomatoes. And for years, I thought if you went canned instead of fresh it was acceptable for the canned tomatoes to taste like a mixture of crushed red bricks in lemon soap water and to smell like absolutely nothing, no matter how far you stuck your nose inside the can. I never dreamed the possibility that one day I might open a can of tomatoes that would smell and taste like fresh sun kissed tomatoes. I wanted so bad to open a can of tomatoes and smell the tomato smell that anybody whose ever grown tomatoes experiences everyday as they water and brush up against their plants. I wanted so bad to taste the fruity sweet taste of real tomatoes that makes you come to understand why tomatoes are fruits not vegetables.<br /><br />It was because of all my disappointments and expectations above that I started my search for a great canned tomato brand. After much disagreement and uncertainty among canned tomato users, I found my way to Carmelina Italian Peeled Tomatoes in Puree. The reviews on Amazon were great and consistent. The fact that Carmelina does not use preservatives or any other flavors to disguise the true taste of their tomatoes was perfect. I thought I finally found the one great canned tomato that would finally let me create great pizza and pasta sauces. With that last thought, I quickly ordered them with 2day shipping.<br /><br />They arrived about two days prior to making this review. I checked every single can and they were all in perfect condition. Two days later with a recipe and all my ingredients in hand I was ready to make an amazing Neapolitan ragu. I'm sure every one of you looking for a great can of tomatoes ALSO has great recipe that requires great canned tomatoes! Well this amazing ragu was going to be my great recipe. The Ragu uses fresh pork and italian sausages that are simmered in tomato sauce for 8-10 hours and then when the red sauce has absorbed every once of flavor from the meat it is slowly poured over perfectly cooked pasta and then topped with parmesan cheese. Sounds like heaven doesn't it?<br /><br />Today, the date of this review, I got all my ingredients ready and made sure to wake up nice and early to give this ragu plenty of time to make its magic happen. I prepped my meat, olive oil, fresh garlic, and thinly sliced onion. I took out three of the cans. I slowly opened the first one with a huge grin on my face. Just days before my whole family called me crazy for ordering canned tomatoes over the internet and paying $35 bucks plus shipping/handling. Whatever, I would have the last laugh when they are stuffing their faces and asking for seconds. I pushed the lid open with the last twist of the can opener and for a second I was hit with mild disappointment. NO SMELL. But I kicked that thought out of my head and plunged my fingers in the can, picking out a soft peeled tomato. I popped it in my mouth and let a big sigh of disappointment.<br /><br />I opened all three cans to make sure I wasn't going crazy. They all tasted the same. Watery. Tinny. Bitter. All three cans tasted exactly the same. I kept on tasting and tasting hoping that I would have one bite that would prove me wrong. Nope. There is absolutely nothing special about this brand of canned tomatoes. For three out of twelve cans to taste exactly the same means only one thing. I could cross off one more name in my search for a great brand of canned tomatoes.
