I have used sugar-free Da Vinci syrups in coffee, protein shakes, and cheesecakes without much of a problem, but for some reason the Sugar-Free Pumpkin Pie Syrup had a horrible aftertaste. Very Splenda-y. The pumpkin pie flavor didn't really shine through, either. I could sort of tastes the spices, but they weren't very rich or appetizing. If you want to make pumpkin pie coffee, use a Da Vinci sugar-free syrup of another flavor, like plain, vanilla, French vanilla, hazelnut, etc., and then add a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice (usually sold at grocery stores all year round), as well as a splash of heavy cream. I make a no-sugar-added pumpkin pie-inspired cheesecake with pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spice only and the taste is much more reminiscent of a real pumpkin pie than this syrup.
