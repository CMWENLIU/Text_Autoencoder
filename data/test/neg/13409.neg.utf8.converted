I am totally embarrassed by this product. I sent to a friend back in the states, was a Christmas/thank you present for all his help while I am currently in Iraq.  Imagine my horror when I am informed by my friend that the cheese was moldy, the items were expired, 2008 date, that he could not even eat anything in the gift.  There were no nuts, just crackers.  So I would not recommend this, or any other product from this seller.  I am disappointed and embarrassed.  And if you try to call you will just get voice mail, over and over.<br /><br />SR<br />Al Asad Iraq<br /><br />The seller did refund this item for me, and are sending another basket, which I am hopeful will be better than the 1st one sent.  I appreciate that they did this.
