I've been buying these cherries for years, and they used to be absolutely wonderful.  They had just the right amount of tartness, not too much sweetness, etc.  I don't know what they've done (I even tried to contact the company regarding my complaint - they didn't respond), but they are now really bad.  They are overly sweet, and taste like the cherries are "bad".  I even tried buying the cherries at two different places, same result, terrible.  I won't be buying these again.
