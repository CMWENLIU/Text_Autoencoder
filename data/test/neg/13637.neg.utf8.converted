Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Graham Crackers are an okay cracker. Nothing special, and far from the best graham cracker I've ever had.<br /><br />The box says there is a "hint of cinnamon". I couldn't really detect any cinnamon flavor, so it must be a pretty small hint. Cinnamon is the next to last ingredient on the label.<br /><br />Here's my real complaint. And this is something I've seen more and more often in foods that are labelled "natural" and "organic". The box says there is "No High Fructose Corn Syrup". That's a good thing. I'm diabetic, so I always check the ingredient list for sugar. And there is none listed on this box! Yay!<br /><br />But wait ... what's the second ingredient on the list? "Evaporated Cane Juice". Excuse me, but isn't that SUGAR???<br /><br />I think it's deceptive of the natural/organic food industry to disguise the fact that there is sugar in their products by calling it something else. Calling sugar "evaporated cane juice" is misleading, and it's wrong.<br /><br />I would have given the product three stars, but they lost one for that.
