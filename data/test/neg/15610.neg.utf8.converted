I thought these would just add flavor rather than such a sweet taste.  I don't like sugar in my coffee.  Now I have 6 containers that I have to throw away.  There used to be a product just like this that just added flavor and did not have all of the artificial sweetners.  Not a good thing for someone who does not like sugar in their coffee but if you do it is good.
