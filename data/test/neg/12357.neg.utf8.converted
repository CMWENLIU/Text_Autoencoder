The product arrived several days after the date I had been told it would arrive. The outer packing box was damaged. The inner box, the Mini Moos box looked as though it had been opened and taped back shut with clear packing tape. When looking in the box, it was obvious that several of the Mini Moos has had been opened, or broke in transit as the inside of the box was sticky and rather messy. The count on the box read 188 but in reality there were only 160 and that was including the empty containers. While checking it out, we also discovered the sell by date was more than three months ago.he inner box with the product looked as though it had been opened, the sell by date had already passed and many of the Mini Moos had either been opened or broke open in transit and spilled all over the box. Although we like Land-o-Lakes products this was a disappointing mess.
