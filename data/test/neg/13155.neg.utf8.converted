This powder is nasty gross!  The color is like pepto bismol, and it tastes about as bad as that too!  The fizz factor in the powder is way too strong and it fizzes up so much that you need a tall glass that holds at least two-three cups.  I tried to mix it in a medium size glass and added under a cup of water.  The fizz was so strong it overflowed the glass even with little water added.  It is way to sugary tasting and has a really nasty cough syrup like taste.  The ingredients include great stuff like green tea extract, acai berry and other anti-oxidants, so I was disappointed that I couldn't even stomach drinking it.  Emergen-C is infinitely better.
