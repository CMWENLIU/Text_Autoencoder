I got a can in the mail. Open the can and saw that the calories are from 35 grams of sugar (fruit juice) and nothing else, I thought to myself, this is all sugar melted in water and carbonated, I drank a sip and could already feel sticky in my mouth on the teeth. It's going to rot my teeth for sure and leave a sticky mouth feel. Carbonated just not like what I would call a good carbonation like soda or mountain dew. It's less carbonation than those but has as much sugar or more than a can of soda. This is just sugar water.
