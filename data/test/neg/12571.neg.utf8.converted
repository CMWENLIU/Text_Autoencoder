Very disappointed in this vendor.  I ordered what I thought would be flavored gourmet coffees......what I received was mostly UNFLAVORED coffee and a few pumpkin spike and gingerbread flavor.  AND, I received UNFLAVORED FOLGERS COFFEE! I thought I was ordering all flavored coffees, and what I received what not even close.  I can buy Folgers K-cups at the grocery store. Probably 2/3 of my order was unflavored coffee.  Will never order from them again.  It's definitely overpriced for what you receive.  And, they just throw 24 K-cups in a shipping box and they are loose in the box and with no packing materials to keep them from banging around. Just disgusted.......
