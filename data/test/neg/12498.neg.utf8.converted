This item deserves no stars (it forced me to give at least one, which I only did so I could write this review and warn people away from this product).<br /><br />The box is embarrassingly cheap; the tea is old and flavorless.<br /><br />I wouldn't present this tea to the stray dog down the street, for fear of offending his sensibilities (even he has his standards; something Bentley's clearly lacks).<br /><br />I have been taken advantage of with this purchase.  Fool me once shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. No more Bentley's for me.
