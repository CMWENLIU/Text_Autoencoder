I'm actually a big fan of the 17.5 ounce Amy & Brian coconut juices.  I was ecstatic when I found them cheaper here on Amazon (shipped, no less!) than from my local Whole Foods.  I ordered a case of both the 17.5 ounce cans and these 10 ounce cans (which I've never seen before), thinking they'd be the same, except in a better size for a single serving.<br /><br />But nope!<br /><br />They are either produced by a difference producer for the same brand or I got a bad batch (although from reading other reviews, I doubt this is the case as there seems to multiple reports of this) -- it has this weird burnt, cotton candy flavor to the water.  It definitely does NOT taste like the clean, sweet flavor of coconut in the bigger cans.<br /><br />I would avoid these!
