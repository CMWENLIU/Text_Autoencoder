I am very disappointed and scared.  I love this rice, I love the flavor and the convenience of this product.  However, the forth bowl I cooked in the microwave had a piece of "GLASS" in it!!!  Now I am afraid to eat the rest.  I am lucky I did not swallow it!!!  I heard a crunch when I was chewing and spit it out.  To my dismay it was a piece of clear glass!!!  How the **** did a piece of glass get into the rice.  I would really like someone to cantact me regarding this.  I would contact the product maker, but am not sure how to go about doing that.
