This rice milk mix is not particularly soluble in water -- you have to use a blender, or a wire whisk and very hot water. Which makes extra work. It's also got a gumminess to it -- guar gum is one of the (many) ingredients. This especially becomes apparent if you make a batch and keep it in the fridge for a couple of days. It becomes more gummy, even if it's restirred/shaken.<br /><br />It just doesn't have the clean flavor and texture that Rice Dream or Trader Joe's brand has. I'll go back to buying TJ's rice milk.
