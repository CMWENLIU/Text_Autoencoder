Not sure what to think -- they sounded soooo good, but they turned out to be surprisingly bland.  Not waxy, not unpleasant, just not very tasty.  I gave them to my Dad for Christmas, and he generously shared them, and where I had assumed they'd be rather irresistable, (they were quite expensive, so I figured a splurge, plus a captivating product name, would mean they'd be utterly delicious), they were decidedly so-so.
