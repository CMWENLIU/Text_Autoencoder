If your desire is to relive childhood memories through your taste buds, this underwhelming substitute will make you feel like crying.<br /><br />Candy cigarettes I bought in the mid to late 1960s had a wonderfully subtle (still can't name it) flavor that was so enjoyable I'd suck on one end of a candy cigarette to try to make it last as long as I could, and would innevitably be unable to resist biting into it. The old/original candy cigarettes crunched when you bit into one, and only with biting it did you discover the mild grit and the slightly chalky taste.<br /><br />The only similarities between the candy cigarettes of the 1960s and the product being sold here is the shape of the candy, and maybe the packaging. There's no flavor in this product (and I really do mean no flavor) and the texture is all wrong. Biting into one = no crunch, no grit, no chalky flavor. It just melts into a glob in your molars that feels (but doesn't taste like) confectioners sugar.
