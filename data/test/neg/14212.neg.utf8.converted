I bought this not even 3 weeks ago from Pepper Palace for around $10.  Although it seemed like a good idea at the time...it's a waste.  Within 1 week, 2 sprouts came up and everything seemed okay.  I took care of them and everything...Now...they're both dead.  You're better off purchasing seeds from an independent grower for WAY less than what this thing is worth, or purchase the peppers themselves, take out the seeds and store them in your freezer in a plastic bag until planting season.
