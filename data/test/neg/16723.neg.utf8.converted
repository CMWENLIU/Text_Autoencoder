Yuck! Melting cheese is not that hard, just make your own. There are good recipes everywhere. Try 1/2 pound gruyere, grated, 1/2 pound emmenthaler grated, tossed w/2 tbsp of corn starch. Simmer 1 cup wine, slowly add the grated cheese, stirring in a figure 8, adding more when the last batch is incorperated. Add 2 tbsp Kirsch. Not hard!<br /><br />And yes, I have tried this specific fondue, it does not taste right.
