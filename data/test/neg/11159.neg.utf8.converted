We were looking for a 100% meat treat for our dog, sourced and also made in the USA; this particular Smokehouse USA treat fit the bill (though others under the same label do not).  Initially, we were excited that our dog seemed to love the taste of these treats (she ate the two strips we gave her with gusto), especially since she's very picky about most "healthy" stuff for dogs.<br /><br />However, not long after ingesting these, she became violently ill with gastrointestinal symptoms continuing for days.  Non-stop diarrhea was the worst part of it.  Aside from these treats, nothing else in her diet was different than usual.  Her appetite is still not back to normal, and it's been a month now.  She's listless and just doesn't seem like herself yet, though the GI issues are OK now.<br /><br />I wanted to warn people that these treats are irradiated, since the listing here on Amazon doesn't indicate it.  There's a seal on the back of the package stating, "Treated with radiation for your safety".  Since a number of foods are irradiated for human and pet consumption and thought to be safe, I'm not sure if unsafe levels of radiation was the issue in our case, or if it was simple food poisoning.<br /><br />Either way, I wish I'd known the treats were irradiated before I bought them, especially since the irradiated Orijen cat food imported to Australia in 2008 ended up being the cause of death and illness for many cats.  It's getting harder and harder to stay healthy in this world, but being forewarned of potential issues is better than lack of awareness at all.  And I won't be buying more Smokehouse USA products, regardless of what the source of our issue was.<br /><br />(See article re: feline deaths/illnesses from Orijen cat food irradiated at entry into Australia (2008), here:[...]
