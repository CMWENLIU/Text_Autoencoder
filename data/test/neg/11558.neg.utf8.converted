A couple years ago I bought a case each of the chicken and beef. I came to Amazon today to refill my supplies and was just shocked at the price. Come off it, already! It's MORE than twice what I'd pay at any grocery store in town.<br /><br />It's a great product. I use it all the time. I would not buy it Amazon though - the price is so inflated that I'm just flabbergasted. What a rip off.
