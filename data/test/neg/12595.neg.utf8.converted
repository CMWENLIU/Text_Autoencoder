I really don't understand, the ingredients are everything i want, it's really only pure organic corn flour and sea salt.  but it's completely, simply, tasteless.  i've tried adding all different kinds of fruit, dried and fresh, cinnamon, and sugar.  nothing helps.  my husband refuses to eat any more and i'm left with 5 boxes.  i've thought of grounding it up and using it as a recipe for something.  otherwise i suppose i'll donate it.
