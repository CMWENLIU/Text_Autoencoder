After reading so much good review, I purchase this product. I expected like Cransins that is my girl's favorite snack. I would like to give her something else. However, the cherry is so sour. No on can take it!I thought maybe they forgot to add sugar. I am not a sweet person. But it is sour, no cherry flavor at all. Really disppointed.
