As a longtime licorice connoisseur who has seen the quality of Haribo black licorice wheels fall off a cliff about five years ago, I was recently very upset to learn that the same thing had happened with Panda black licorice bars, which I used to enjoy on a daily basis. They no longer taste even vaguely like licorice, but rather like solid molasses, which is listed as one of the ingredients. Have shot Panda an irate online comment and predictably have not heard back. So, I have stopped eating Panda bars. (The upside: I've lost two pounds in a couple of weeks.) Licorice connoisseurs, let these penny pinchers know you notice the reduction/elimination of licorice extract from their products!
