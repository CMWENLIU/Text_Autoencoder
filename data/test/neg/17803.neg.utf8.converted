As a broke college student, I ordered this product in an effort to save my boyfriend and me the money of going out to dinner on Valentine's Day.  I was going to cook with the lobster meat I ordered.  When it came in I was surprised by how small the can was, but I figured though small for 30 dollars it would still be very tasty.  When I got online to find the perfect recipe I found some bad reviews, so I decided to open one of the cans to see for myself.  I almost gagged as I pulled back the parchment paper because it smelt disgusting and the meat looked grayish and nasty.  Out of curiosity, I poked the meat and it was mush.  I felt like crying.  I cannot believe I wasted my money on this rancid product.  Please don't waste your money on this item, I would rather eat pigs feat than that smelly gray mush.  Now it's two days before my fancy home cooked dinner and no lobster :(
