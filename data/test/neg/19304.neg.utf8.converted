This product has almost no flavor and aroma, contrary to the product's description.<br /><br />I have read that some companies use Chinese instead of European black truffles. The Chinese are supposedly cheaper because they lack the flavor and aroma of the French and Italian black truffles.<br /><br />This product is certainly not worth the price.  You basically get a tube full of what may well have been a paste made from black colored cardboard and oil.
