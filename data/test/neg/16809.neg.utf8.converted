I bought this to feed a few feral cats.  They absolutely dislike it.  Before buying this food, I'd have to refill their bowls with their usual brand at least twice a day.  I now fill the bowls in the morning and there is still food there at night.  The ingredients look decent, it doesn't have a bad odor but for some reason they just won't eat it.  I gave it two stars instead of one because it also temporarily solved a problem I had with racoons.  The racoons didn't like it either and stopped coming around to make a mess on my back porch.
