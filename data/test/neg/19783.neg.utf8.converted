As per instructions, I cleaned up the cat waste in the area, then sprinkled Scram Cat.  In 2 days the feral cats in my neighborhood were using the area as a litterbox again!  If it rains, you need to reapply.  The stuff has a decent odor.  The bag doesn't go that far. I'd love to give the bill for this bag and all the other methods I've tried to the neighbor who started feeding a couple of stray cats.  The population is probably at least 30 now.
