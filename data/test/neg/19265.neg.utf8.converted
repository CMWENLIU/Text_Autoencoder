I ordered this because of the positive reviews here, and the description touting it as an almost 100% substitute for wheat flour.  It is not.  It is great for breading chicken breasts before sauteing, but has utterly failed in other applications.  I tried making crepe batter, which with wheat flour is very liquidy.  With this, I got a goopy mix resembling bread dough.  Even after doubling the liquid in the recipe the batter remained thick and doughy.  I also tried using this to make the dough for samosas, and again ended up with a thick goop, even after adding more water.<br /><br />It's possible this is a good batter for baking, as I haven't used the oven with it, but it definitely not a 100% substitute.
