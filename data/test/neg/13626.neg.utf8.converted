I've been waiting to try these eggs for a couple of years but hadn't been able to find them in a store locally, though they are produced in our area (Pacific Northwest).  The rave reviews made them sound great, and I thought they were going to be just the thing for an emergency food, like for breakfast or to add protein to Top Ramen.  They were fairly easy to prepare, but I was so disappointed once I tasted them.  They were almost flavorless, and tasted more like cardboard than anything else.  They wern't bad, just not good.  I was so surprised because they got such rave reviews.  The only thing I can say is that they are better than the Mountain House freeze dried eggs, which, when I tried them, caused me to gag (probably from their freaky texture).
