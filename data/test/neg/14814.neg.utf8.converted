I bought a book about home brewing soda pop. Several of the recipes call for this.  We tried them out.  The flavor is new to us and we still don't know if we like it.  We will try a few more batches to see if we get use to the flavor.  We don't drink regular soda very often.  I usually drink seltzer water with a splash of lemon in it so soda drinking isn't really on our menu.  We thought we would try home brew soda because we like the idea that soda originated healthful "tonics".  This made the batch of root beer taste medicinal.  I am not saying it is "bad" just not what we imagined.
