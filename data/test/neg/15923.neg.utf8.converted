I bought two jars of this blood orange marmalade based on the great review. However, this marmalade does tast great and in fact, is not one of the better blood orange marmalades on the market. The jar was a small 8 oz. for $9.50 plus shipping==$13.00 per 8oz jar...CRAZY----I did not see that jar was only that small when ordering. The taste of this marmalade is really not good..It does not have a good taste  of citrus..The other reviewer must not have tasted SARABETH blood orange marmalade or JUNE TAYLOR blood orange marmalade..These two have the terrific citrus taste and SARBETH jar is 18oz FOR $11.00..
