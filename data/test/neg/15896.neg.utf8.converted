I ordered this variety pack thinking that i was about to get all the many different chips that i been dreaming about while im in afghanistan but when my variety pack came in(which it was about a week & a half later) i open the box to find that the company sent me the wrong variety pack. The company sent me the frito lay count variety pack, which i didnt ask for and which it only cost $14.57, now even though that is only a $1.03 difference, the reason for me ordering this particular package was because it has 7 different kinds of chips in it. Now the one the company sent me only has 5 different kinds. I was very upset about this. I was so upset that i didnt even try to return the chips back because i knew that would be an even longer process. I dont think ill be buying these chips again.
