I have been ordering this brand of cherry juice for about 8 months.  I have always gotten the 32-oz. size, but due to the huge price increase, I ordered the 16-oz. size because it was a slightly better deal.  When the bottles arrived, they were sitting in a sticky, red puddle due to leakage.  The 32-oz. size has an airtight safety seal (I'm pretty sure) but the 16-oz. bottles definitely do not.  I decided to clean up the bottles and use them anyway (not wanting to cause a problem) but as they sat on the counter, the bottles started to bulge and the labels ripped open!  I do not think they are safe to drink, and Amazon stated that they will return my money, thankfully.  Tart is Smart Cherry Juice Concentrate has always been a good product that has helped decrease the inflammation and pain in my back.  I'm not sure why the company does not put a safety seal on the 16-oz. size.  I will pay the extra money for the bigger size with the safety seal so my juice will be SAFE to drink!
