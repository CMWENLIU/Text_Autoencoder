it looks like grechka, but it is not the same. It smells differently and it has a weird taste - it tastes nothing like the real thing. I do not know what they have done to the grain, but it is like cheweing on paper - no taste whatsoever! I Love Amazon, b/c I can get all kinds of stuff from them that I cannot find anywhere else, but with this, I recommend you to find a Russian store online and order from them the good stuff.
