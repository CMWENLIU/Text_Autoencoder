There should be a warning label on this product making people aware of potential allergic reactions. I tried this for the first ( and last ) time a few days ago. I had to go to the Emergency Room as my eyes were swelling shut, my sinuses & ears were rapidly closing up & my throat was feeling tight. I had hives & a red rash all over my body plus my hands were completely red .  I have never had anaphylactic shock before & have eaten celery without incident.
