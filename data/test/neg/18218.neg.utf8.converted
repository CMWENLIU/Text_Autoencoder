1) The beans don't come in the fancy pants jar.<br />2) The beans are super small, most of the "energy" would be a sugar rush if any at all.<br />3) They are not bad tasting, but I have had much better.<br />4) Yeah, I am aware that they help or encourage a certain cause, but if you're gonna charge me 5 bucks and change for a small bag of something you better make sure it's the best I've ever had!<br />5) I will give them this, I did not received them all melted, but then again, I did order them during the winter.<br />***Overall, I would not buy them again, too costly, for low quality and deceiving presentation.
