I bought the product and several flavor extracts from their actual website.  I don't want anyone else to have to go through the same frustrations for lack of information.  The extracts I received are so far off from the intended flavors that I doubt the solution's even edible.  The site claims natural flavors.  These were destroying all my senses.  Let's start with the vanilla, probably the most common extract people use.  Their excuse was every company has different flavors.  I've shopped for vanilla extracts from so many<br />different companies, natural, imitation, etc.  The faerie finest one I got was WORSE than the WORST POSSIBLE IMITATION vanilla.  I<br />called them to explain and ask for a refund.  I can understand where shipping cannot be reimbursed for those who mis-<br />ordered.  Unfortunately the INFLATED shipping costs cannot be reimbursed even if you're extremely unsatisfied with the<br />products, even though I was willing to ship it back to them out of my own pocket.  So the products I got will be going<br />into the garbage.  This has destroyed my confidence in shopping with them.  BE VERY WARY!! I don't want someone else to<br />have to go through the same frustrations I did.  I know it's cheap and very tempting, but for me, it was still a WASTE OF MONEY because the products I received are COMPLETELY UNUSABLE.
