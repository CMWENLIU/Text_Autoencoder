I love mushrooms. I been eating them all my life. From fresh to dried to brined. I wouldn't call these mushrooms, but rather a mess. This is a 3rd different roland brand mushrooms I bought and all 3 been mediocre at best. I think the problem is 2 fold. 1, the mushroom come in this flavorless goo that it suffocates it. 2 preboiling them kills the flavor and makes it taste like cardboard. I have had these dried and brined before and all the time they had texture to them. These do not have any flavor or texture. Dissapointed. You are better off buying fresh button mushrooms than these!
