I'm not sure what qualifies this as "gourmet".  They make it sound like a pure product and I really didn't read the ingredient list (which I usually do) and when it arrived, I did.  I don't like to use products that contain sugar as one of it's main ingredients, not to mention the preservatives!  Maybe others won't care about that.  I did.  I'm not saying that they didn't say what was in it.  I take responsibility for not paying enough attention.  I guess I got used to buying coconut products that actually WERE pure, without added sugars and preservatives.
