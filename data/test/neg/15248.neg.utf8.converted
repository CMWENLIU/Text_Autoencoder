the item was ordered on august 2nd, arrived on the 11th with a best by date of august 30th!! i had ordered to stock up on a healthy snack but instead got a case of chips that are already stale , and tasteless. amazon made it right but i am disappointed to receive old product. I imagine these would taste great if they were fresh!!
