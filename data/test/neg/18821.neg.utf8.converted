We are disappointed with the Great Northern popcorn for our new machine.<br />It seems stale.....and 'chewy'.<br />We have a popcorn machine up north and it pops beautifully and tastes like theater popcorn.<br />However, the popcorn we have just received seems old.  We're very disappointed....and wind up not making popcorn very often.
