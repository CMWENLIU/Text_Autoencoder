I typically make my own hummus at home, but this past week for lack of time I bought some Yehuda Hummus in the grocery store here in Panama. The picture on the front of the can looks a lot like what I call Hummus, thick and creamy, full of healthy ingredients.  When I opened the can to eat it I was quite surprised that the "Hummus" was really really watery and looked like it was better suited for drinking than for dipping.  It wouldn't stick on my carrots and you certainly couldn't spread it as nothing would stay on a knife.  I'm not sure if I just received an off batch or if they are trying to get more profits by watering down their hummus, but that was a big disappointment and I would never buy this brand again or recommend it to anyone!
