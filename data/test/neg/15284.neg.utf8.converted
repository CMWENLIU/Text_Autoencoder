We were purchasing this food regularly for our four cats, mainly because one cat has a sensitive stomach and this was the only grocery store brand that sat well with him.  Last year we got a bag of food that looked darker than usual.  The cats wouldn't eat it.  We purchased another bag and it was fine.  The next bag again looked darker; the cats ate it, but all four vomited it up immediately after eating it.  Again, we purchased a new bag where the food was the same color we were used to and the cats were fine.  I hesitate to admit this, but I did test the bag of darker food and, again, it made the cat who tried it sick.<br /><br />It was obvious that the food was bad, so I called Purina.  They insisted that nothing was wrong with their food.  They wanted to send me coupons for free food instead.  I asked to please make a record of this food being bad -- I offered to send the leftover kibble to them, I tried to give the customer service woman the bag code, but she refused to do anything. She flat out said she would not take the batch code down because nothing was ever wrong with their food.  When I got off the phone, I made a copy of the code from the bag and sent a letter, but never received a response.<br /><br />When I called the grocery store, I got the manager who said they had already removed the food from the shelves because of so many complaints.  He said they would send the food back to Purina.  Because of the cat with the sensitive stomach, I kept buying Purina Sensitive Systems and spent 6 months checking the batch codes to make sure we didn't get another bad bag.  Figuring that the situation had resolved, I stopped checking bag codes, only to find out the hard way the grocery store had not sent the food back to Purina but instead quietly put the bad food back on the shelves.  That time only one cat ate the food, but he vomited so much there was blood in it.  We took him to the vet and while there realized it was probably the food again, and sure enough, the batch code matched the previous bag that had made all the cats sick. (As far as I know, the cats did not have permanent health problems because of this food.)<br /><br />I highly recommend avoiding this brand.  We have had cats for 20 years and have used 3 brands regularly during that time; Purina is the only one that has caused this kind of problem.
