When I think "dark roast" I think full bodied and DARK.  Melitta pods are the worst I've tried.  I've tried Senseo pods too which are only mediocre.  I did find the Target brand "Archer Farms" pods to be the BEST.  The French Roast really does rival Starbucks home brewed.  Its cheap too...3.99 for 18 pods.  If you like a full bodied, rich, dark and strong cup of cofee, don't do Melitta.  I found Senseo and Archer Farms pods fit in my Melitta pod brewer just fine.
