Well to start I don't know why this is under toys when it's a drink.  The bottle is pretty and coll looking but the smell and taste is terrible. Also the horrible taste will stay in your mouth for quite a while. I don't recommend this is you intend to drink it. But I resealed mine and put in on a shelf with the rest of my collectors stuff. Same thing goes for the mana drink, very pretty and cool but the grossest thing you can imagine.
