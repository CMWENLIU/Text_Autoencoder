This might be a good coffee if purchaced fresh, but due to poor packaging I was unable to properly judge that assumption.<br /><br />This coffee is packaged in unsealed (not airtight) bags.  By the time I received it, all aromatics had evaporated off, yeilding an aromaless (and subsequently, flavorless) cup of medium-bodied warm water.<br /><br />Until Camano Island can come up with airtight packaging, it should be avoided.
