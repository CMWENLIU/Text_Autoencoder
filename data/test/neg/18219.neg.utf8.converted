I am been using the "standard" Degree Deodorant for years and have been really happy with it. Recently I tried the Silver Ion version and found that it caused some burning on my skin. I needed to wash it off. I experienced this some years ago when the Old Spice deordorant that I was using changed to a "new and improved" version. Back then I needed to switch to another brand. I hope that Degree keeps their "standard" deodorant on the store shelves. For reference, there seems to be a product warning:<br /><br />"For external use only. Do not use on broken skin. Stop use if rash or irritation occurs."<br /><br />For Silver Ion this applies to me. Hopefully not to you
