I have purchased Gevalia flavored coffees for years, so I was looking forward to trying this Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle Coffee.<br /><br />Chocolate is my favorite food, period, and I love chocolate truffles.  I am also a big coffee drinker.<br /><br />Upon opening the package, I took a few sniffs, but could detect no chocolate scent at all.<br /><br />I like my coffee on the milder side, so I put one slightly heaping scoop of coffee for a large coffee mug into my automatic coffeemaker.<br /><br />All I tasted was a bitter taste.  Now I know dark chocolate tends to be somewhat bitter, especially compared to other kinds of chocolate.<br /><br />On the front of the box of coffee it does say it's artificially flavored.<br /><br />For a more high end company I expected better.  Even tho the package was sealed, even when I first opened the package, it did not smell really fresh like it should have.<br /><br />To me, the only things that really ring true about this coffee is indeed it is coffee, and it is somewhat dark, especially compared to regular coffee.  I tasted no chocolate taste at all.
