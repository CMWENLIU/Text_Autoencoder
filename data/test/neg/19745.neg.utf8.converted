This is the worst tasting tea I have EVER had ..... it was very dry and flaked into powder when you but it in between your fingers.  Had a taste of come chemical that had to have been used in it's drying or production.  I have drank teas for many many years and after one cup through this way ... I also tried their earl gray style.... again way too dry and chemical taste in the tea ... DO NOT BUY THIS TEA .... thank goodness for Amazon's customer service department ... they sent me two new bags which were also bad and then refunded my moneis.....Again, Do Not Buy this product.  I wish there was a zero starts because this item earned it....
