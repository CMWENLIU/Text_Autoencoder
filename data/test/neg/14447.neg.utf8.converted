I've been eating Candy Corn all my life, and I can tell you there are a lot of companies out there packaging little yellow, red and white cone-shaped candies, but there is only one candy that is worthy of being called Candy Corn, and that's the Brach's variety.  All others are posers, wannabes, johny-come-latelies.  Amazon!  Give me the good stuff!
