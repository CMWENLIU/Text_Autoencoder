Since this type of yeast is no longer available at any of our local grocery stores, we decided to load up on this find by purchasing (3) packs worth which ends up being (45) individual yeast packets.  Problem is they arrived on 4/13/11 and the yeast expiration date is July 2011!  When we were able to get this product in our local stores, the expiration was minimally a year or more.  Since these packs cost double what the stores charge, this is ridiculous.  I guess we'll be eating pizza for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the next 3 months before the yeast is useless!
