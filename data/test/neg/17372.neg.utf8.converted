I ordered this product from Amazon becuase I wanted it delivered to my home.  I have been using this product for a couple of years and my husband and I like it a lot.  When I opened the package it was a small bottle; about half the size of the regular bottle I buy from William Sonoma.  The price at Williams Sonoma is $26.95 for 17.6 oz and through Amazon I paid $25.00 for a little over 8 oz.  The description of the product does not specify the amount.
