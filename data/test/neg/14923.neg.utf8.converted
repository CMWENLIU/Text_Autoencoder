as the other reviews have noted, this is NOT the same flavor (or even coloring - the color is a pinkish color, not the deep red I remember). it's not bad as such, but don't tell me you've brought something back when you've really just recreated the look of the original.  I don't remember Danish licorice in black, and the black licorice from this company is actually pretty good, but these red ones are NOT what you remember.  I'm just glad that i found them at a bulk store so that I only bought one roll and not a whole box like I intended to here.
