I knew I was rolling the dice with this mixed grab bag.  Based on some of the positive reviews, I took a chance.  Couldn't be more disappointed.  One third of the k cups are the cheap Grove Square  brand...some of which I immediately through away because they shook like a rattle with a dried up "chunk" of coffee in them.  The others sound like they have about a teaspoon of dried up indtant coffee grounds in them.  No comparison to any of the other k cup brands. Grove Square sells for approximately half the price of other k cup brands in retail stores. That is because it is instant coffee designed to look like a k cup.  Makes the purchase price of this mix really steep since one third of my k cups were these cheapies!  I tried them once before and to me they are absolutely undrinkable. Should note that the product picture and written description does not show or mention Grove Square as one of the possible brands in the mix.  I also got 4 teas, 4 decafs and about 10 flavored coffees.  Overall, a horrible mix that was not worth the price I paid.  Won't risk it again. Unless you like the taste of instant coffee or are willing to overpay per cup to get to try some other actual k cup brands in different flavors...don't buy this.
