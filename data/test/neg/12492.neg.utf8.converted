I purchased this item because I wanted the tea chest.  The item description is completely inaccurate.  It states that it is a "Wood Grain" tea chest.  The chest is a cheap box that is very poorly covered with a wood grain contact paper.  I say poorly because the faux wood contact paper has ripples and bubbles all over it.  Please don't waste your money or time on this item like I did.
