Rice noodles taste pretty much alike, but this is the second time I have ordered rice noodles from Amazon in the last two weeks only to discover they are not as advertised on the website. In this case the website states that these noodles are made in the US. They are not. The box states they are a product of Thailand. I do not appreciate this misrepresentation at all.
