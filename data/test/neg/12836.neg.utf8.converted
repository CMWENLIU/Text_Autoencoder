Our family received the EUROPEAN COOKIES with Belgian Chocolate (Item 181679)as a holiday gift.  They were left in the tin and served to our guest at a family dinner party. The guest trying them noted that they were extremely rich and some commented favorably on the taste.  My daughter, who has severe allergies wanted to try<br />one, but knowing that she is allergic to nuts, carefully read the label on the inside of the tin top that<br />displayed all the varieties.  She chose the "Creme Melody" because it was described as white chocolate over creme wafer.  After taking a test bite, she was okay, so she ate the entire cookie.  Minutes later she became<br />extremely ill and had to be rushed to the hospital by ambulance.  The trama it caused our family is unbelievable, but we thank God she lived and would not want anyone else who has nut allergies to try this product.
