Ick! I planned to add two cans of quartered artichoke hearts to a fancy tortellini and shrimp salad I am bringing to a party in a few hours. What a bummer to open the can and find limp, pale yellow (brown in some spots) soggy artichoke hearts, all with leaves and a portion of the artichoke bottom so tough I couldn't bite through them. Horrible. I threw them out, and will have to carry my dish to the party sans artichoke hearts.
