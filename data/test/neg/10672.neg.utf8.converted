About six months ago I switched to drinking low-acid coffee because of some acid reflux problems I was having. Trader Joe's low acid French roast is probably the best tasting low-acid coffee I've tried, but unfortunately Trader Joe's doesn't make a decaf version and I'm trying to cut down on my caffeine. For decaf low-acid coffee I've tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P28DHY">HealthWise 100% Colombian Supremo, Decaffeinated, Swiss Water Process Low Acid Ground Coffee, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)</a> and Puroast (both purchased off Amazon). Neither one is great, but HeathWise is better. HealthWise is bland, so you have to use more coffee to get a good-tasting cup (I usually mix a scoop of decaf with a scoop of the Trader Joe's, and that helps), but the Puroast decaf smells and tastes off. I can't describe what's off about it--it's just not pleasant. It certainly doesn't have that rich coffee aroma and flavor we coffee-lovers love. Perhaps the non-decaf version is better. If you need low-acid decaf and you're desperate, this will do--hence the three stars. But I would never serve this to a guest in my home, and I really can't recommend it.<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW<br />After drinking this coffee on and off for a couple weeks, I've come to the conclusion that it's actually causing me intestinal distress. So not only is it unpleasant tasting, it's upsetting my stomach in a way that completely negates the only reason I bought it. I wish I could return my unopened bag, but unfortunately Amazon has a "no returns" policy on groceries. Disappointing all around.
