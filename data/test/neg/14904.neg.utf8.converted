The label says "organic" but it isn't fresh.  It is from concentrate and has "flavoring" added to it.<br />The taste is not good, in my opinion.  The flavor packs are added to concentrates because the concentrates are usually stored in drums for years and are devoid of flavor.  This may explain why the taste is "off".  Also, you wonder how do they concentrate the liquid and how much degradation occurs?  Do they dilute it with tap water?<br />If authentic taste is a priority, there are other brands that are better.
