This mix produces pancakes that have a great taste and texture. Although "Nutra Rich" makes the product sound very healthy, it actually contains one ingredient that is dangerous: partially hydrogenated oil. Partially hydrogenated oil contains trans fat, which greatly increases the risk of coronary heart disease for anyone who consumes it. It is estimated that between 30,000 and 100,000 cardiac deaths per year in the United States can be attributed to the consumption of trans fat. In addition, the consumption of trans fat has been linked to obesity, Alzheimer's Disease, liver dysfunction, infertility, and depression. Don't assume that a product is healthy just because it is marketed as such. Read the ingredient list carefully. If the manufacturer would omit the partially hydrogenated oil, I would definitely be a repeat customer. Until that happens, I'll never buy the product again.
