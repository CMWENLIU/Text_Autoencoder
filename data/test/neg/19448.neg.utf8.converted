I won't get into the back and forth between those who are upset about this not being vegan despite it's being listed as such, and those who think they have no right to complain.  I'm neither vegan nor anti-msg, and was actually looking for a real chicken broth powder.<br /><br />At [...] , their own website, the picture of the product shows a different ingredient list than the description. Chicken fat, MSG are shown while they explicitly advertise vegan and NO MSG.  I was hoping that they did not intend to mislead, with either the photo or description was for an older version. I emailed them multiple times over the last few weeks (literally resending my questions over and over), without a single reply.  All I wanted was a final answer as to the ingredients! Not much to ask before I consume a food product of theirs.<br /><br />As I have not received any reply, I can assume they do not care, are intentionally misleading, or do not ever read customer emails. None of these is acceptable. It's a shame because I had planned on buying alot of dried vegetable products, but cannot support such shoddy company behavior.
