I bought a case after reading such great reviews. UGH!! I spit it out. Was VERY VERY strong tasting, but not a pleasant taste at all. I thought well maybe its just me, so I have a few friends that are celiac so I shared with them. Same reaction, this 1 used it in her turkey thinking well its strong but maybe with a big turkey, oh my no 1 could eat it. I really don't know how people can say these are good, I only got the original flavor, it really was terrible, I threw them away. I know some people get paid to leave a review on here, I don't know if that is the reason for the good review or what. Usually the reviews help me decide what products to try with Celiac, but wow you guys were WAY OFF for me anyway. I threw the whole case away. IT was the only thing in the trash that the raccoons didnt get into for real. buyer beware~~!!!
