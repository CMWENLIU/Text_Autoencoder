I became a fan of dried shiitake mushrooms upon buying them at Costco. Since the Costco does not always have it in stock, I tried these. The taste is OK, but worse than the Costco one. The biggest problem is they are too tough and some seemed uncooked even after long time boiling, I am disappointed.
