So the first thing I noticed when I tried these was that the candy is covered by a layer of wax that does not melt after being in your mouth for 30 seconds. This is relatively unpleasant. I don't really like to chew chocolate. I like to leave it in my mouth so that it can melt and become all gooey. Well, with this candy I had to chew it first and then let it melt. I would have rather it have no shell at all than a shell of wax. Ick.
