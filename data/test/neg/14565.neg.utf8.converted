This is a very poor grade of vanilla and quite a waste, given the price per bottle.  Like other reviewers said, the amount of alcohol in the product is so overwhelming that the vanilla doesn't come through.  The residual flavor is not that of the true Mexican vanilla you can get in Mexico. VERY dissatisfied with the purchase.  If you've ever tried good Mexican vanilla, you'll be disappointed with this!
