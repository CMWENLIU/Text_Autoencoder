As a marathoner, century cyclist, and half-ironman triathlete, I've used my fair share of sports mixes.  I've been a faithful Cytomax user for several years and find that it helps me feel less sore after hard training and is easy on my stomach.  However, I noticed that my most recent bottle of Cytomax states that it includes "Stevia".  Stevia has only recently been approved by the FDA and is still not approved in Europe, and is not, as it is frequently marketed, always a natural product.  The plant itself is natural, but when used as a sweetener it needs to be treated and "messed with" to make it sweet and mask it's bitterness.  It's safety has also been debated, and given the large quantities of sports drink that I consume, that's enough for me to switch products.
