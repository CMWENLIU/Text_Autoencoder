Since 93% of soy is GMO(genetically modified organism), this probably contains GMO soy.  GMOs (genetically modified organisms) pose a danger to our environment and to human and animal health.  According to a newsletter article I recently received from Dr. Joseph Mercola (some of his stuff has to be taken with a grain of salt) Monsanto infiltrated the U.S. government in order to gain approval for its GMOs.  GMOs have never been studied for safety in humans.  They are banned in many European countries. Dr. Andrew Weil has come out against them.  In animal studies, they have been shown to cause organ damage and infertility.  Dr. Mercola said that theoretically they could cause the good bacteria in your intestines to produce pesticides.  Most of the soy, corn, zucchini, squash, canola and Hawaiian papaya are GMO. Honey can also contain GMOs. You have to carefully read labels as a lot of vitamins and supplements contain soy lecithin or soybean oil. Yesterday I went to Whole Foods Market in Paradise Valley and stopped at the adjacent yogurt shop called Zoyogurt.  I should have asked to see an ingredient list, but it didn't occur to me.  On my way home, I got the worst stomach ache.  When I got home I went to the yogurt shop's website and read the list of ingredients.  Corn syrup is the main sweetener. Most corn is GMO. Well, I won't be getting yogurt there again.  Also, Whole Foods Market is supposed to be GMO free, but the Cornucopia Institute did a study on breakfast cereals and found that Whole Foods 365 brand corn cereal contained 51% GMO corn.  Trader Joes has also said that its brand does not contain GMOs, but if there were GMOs in Whole Foods corn cereal, I wonder if I can trust what Trader Joes is saying.  Organic food cannot contain GMOs.  Farmers who do not want to plant these poison seeds on their land often have their crops contaminated by adjacent fields where GMOs are being grown.  Monsanto has sued and ruined many of these farmers for patent infringement.  We need legislation requiring the labeling of any product that contains GMOs.  Even honey should be bought organic as the bees that are allowed to feed on GMO crops transfer them to the honey.  The Environmental Working Group  has a link to a petition against them on their website.
