This was an X-mas gift for my dog and he loved it.  Then a couple days later he stopped eating, threw up bile everywhere, and became very lethargic.  I took him to the vet and there in his intestine was a nice chunk of the bone.  The medical bills cost two and a half times the dog but he recovered after quite a bit of worrying on my part.<br /><br />This product is purchased for the express purpose of a dog chewing on it, but unlike rawhide it is not digestible and can cause serious problems including the need for surgery. I'm sure this is very rare, but do you really want to risk it? Babies tend to chew on things, would you give a baby something that you knew might cause it to choke?<br /><br />If you buy this product, at the very least, watch your dog like a hawk or you could be dealing with a very sick and expensive pet.
