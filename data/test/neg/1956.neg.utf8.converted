I recently ran out of our home-prepared blend of Berbere spices, and hoping to find a fairly good blend pre-pared, I ordered this based on the list of ingredients and the fact that it's pictured in a spice container.<br /><br />Although I received my order quickly, my first disappointment was that the spice blend (I hesitate to refer to it as "Berbere") arrived in a plastic, resealable pouch. Ugh! Everyone knows that "resealable" pouches are seldom resealable after one or two openings - especially with a powdered product. I'll have to find an alternative way of storing it - perhaps when I have some other spice container that is empty.<br /><br />My greater disappointment was over the fact that the ingredient list on the package did not match the ingredient list on amazon AT ALL!!!<br /><br />The ingredients on the site are listed as including: "nutmeg, cloves, fenugreek, ginger, ajowan seeds, coriander, cumin, black pepper, allspice, cardamom, Ethiopian chili peppers..."<br /><br />The ingredients on the label of the package I received reads as follows: "cumin, paprika, New Mexico chili peppers, cayenne pepper, de arbol chili peppers, nutmeg, ancho chili peppers, Ajwan seeds, cardamom, turmeric, garlic, salt and other spices".<br /><br />I'm sure I'll get some use out of this spice blend - it should go great in chili, but it barely resembles authentic Ethiopian Berbere seasoning. I'm an amazon prime customer so was snookered into purchasing this over another product that showed up in my search b/c this one was sent w/ free shipping.<br /><br />I may order the Ethiopian Berbere seasoning (also known as "Berber Spice" from Nirmala's Kitchen here on amazon, even though I'll have to pay for shipping. For those interested, there are many other exotic spice blends and recipes available at nirmalaskitchen dot com
