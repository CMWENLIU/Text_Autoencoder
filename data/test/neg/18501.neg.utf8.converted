Very very disappointed in this product.<br />Straight out of the bottle this 'extract' has a strong alcohol odor with a hint of Rose. Sadly it appears that they diluted what might be a very nice product with massive quantities of alcohol in order to make it look like you are getting much more then you really are.<br />Once the large amount of alcohol liquid evaporates it has a nice Rose smell but does not last long.
