I have already sorted through this with customer service.  The product is wonderful, but I received the plain pumpkin (not the pie mix), and 6 of the 12 cans were very badly dented.  Amazon packaged them and sent them anyway.  There is no way the cans could have been dented after packaging because of where they were located in the case.
