Mine must have come from a different lot than the other reviewers.  This is just plain nasty.  When you open the bag you are indeed aware of a smoky flavor, but a burned smoky flavor.  When I ground the beans, I was assaulted by the smell of a recently burned out building put out with water, with the added bonus of burned animal carcasses inside.<br /><br />It tastes worse than it smells, from what I could tell of the few sips I dared to take.<br /><br />After that first pressing, the remainder of the bag went into the trash.
