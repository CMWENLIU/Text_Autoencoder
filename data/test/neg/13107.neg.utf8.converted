I should have known that there was something fishy when the product details said that the product dimensions are 13 x 10.5 x 2.5 inches and 3.8 pounds when the shipping weight said 2.15 pounds.  In actuality it is 12 X 10 X 2.5 and comes in a CHEAP (do not even know if it IS wood) box AND it weighs 1.14 pounds on my postal scale.  However, to be fair, I have not taken the plastic wrapper off because it is a gift so it could be very, VERY thin wood.  In addition, the container opens like a box rather than a chest.  There are no hinges on the back.  I am very disappointed with this tea "chest" AND it's price!
