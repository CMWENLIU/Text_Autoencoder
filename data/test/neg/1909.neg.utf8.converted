This is not like any traditional English pudding.  In fact, it is unlike anything I've ever attempted to put in my mouth.  It is pumpkin in color, springy in texture, with globs of stretchy substance which I suppose is the treacle.  I am at a loss to describe the flavor - a sweetness lingers in the background, but what the prevalent taste is I don't know.  It's not buttery, salty, caramelized...it's 'misc.' flavor.  My husband and I each took a bite or two, had a good laugh, and tossed the rest.  We're not fussy food snobs, nor are we unsophisticated eaters.  My husband's best contribution to my attempt at analysis was "if someone told me that was monkey brains, I'd seriously believe them."
