Let me first start off by saying it doesn't, NOT ONE OUNCE, taste like espresso, coffee, or anything similar. It tastes like tea, PERIOD.<br /><br />Now with that out of the way on to the rest of the review.<br /><br />When you first open the package you are hit with this odd, earthy smell... not something that most people would find pleasant. I've had a lot of teas, but this one takes the prize for the oddest smelling.<br /><br />After trying to figure out whether or not I wanted to drink something that smelled that odd I went ahead and added a fair amount (three tablespoons) to my four cup Mr. Coffee. The last thing I wanted to do was make a large pot of the stuff and end up throwing it out. A few minutes (about eight) pass and I hear the distinct "slurping" noise indicating that the coffee maker was at the end of its cycle and go to get me a cup of Red Espresso. Odd thing was the coffee carafe was only half filled up... odd, right? So I carefully pull out the coffee basket and to my surprise it still had two cups of water/tea in it literally 1/8" away from spilling out everywhere. So be VERY careful when using this in an drip coffee machine as the tea seems to clog the filters more then coffee ever would.<br /><br />As for taste, it's not great, but it isn't awful. The taste I get out of it is very similar to a good black tea without the bitterness. And that is one thing this tea has over some of the others, doesn't matter how strong you make it, it doesn't get bitter.<br /><br />Personally, I wouldn't buy it. The taste is nowhere near espresso, thus you are left with nothing more then expensive loose tea that smells odd.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Comes in a resealable pouch.<br />Doesn't get bitter.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Doesn't taste like espresso.<br />Very odd smell, before, during, and after the steeping process.<br />Kinda spendy, I would hope that it would at least taste like mediocre coffee for this price.<br />Seems to backup drip coffee makers really easily, so be careful!
