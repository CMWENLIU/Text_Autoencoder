I saw a package of these while standing in the grocery line, thought they might be good, and added it to my cart. On the way home, I opened the package and ate a few. They tasted okay, (chocolate is always good right?) with a coconut(ish) flavor, but I noticed a weird after-taste. I looked at the ingredient list and saw that coconut was nowhere to be found. I looked at the front of the package and realized that I had missed the cleverly placed "artificial flavor" right below the word coconut. I ate a couple more, couldn't stomach any more and threw the rest in the garbage when I got home. These things do not taste good and the folks at Mars should be ashamed of selling such artificial junk.
