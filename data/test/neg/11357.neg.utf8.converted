This coffee does not taste like Kahlua, it only tastes marginal.  It's drinkable with enough sugar, but it's not very good.  Maybe it's not my style of coffee, for example Gloria Jean's pumpkin spice is excellent and Green Mountain Nantucket Blend, and for decaf I like Green Mountain French Roast decaf and GM Hazelnut decaf.  Bellacino French Vanilla was fabulous but it is discontinued.
