I have a bit of a pantry pest infestation and ordered this product with high hopes.  I received the package and quickly set the trap up with the pheromone luer.<br />Next day I eagerly went to check on the trap and there was one little moth stuck to the inside of the trap.  I then realized I had left out a bowl with water 3 feet away from the trap and there were TWO dead moths floating on the water.<br />A couple of weeks later and the trap has that only moth inside and there are numerous other moths flying around the kitchen.<br />Very disappointed!
