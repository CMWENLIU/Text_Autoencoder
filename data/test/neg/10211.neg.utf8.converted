I found the taste to be OK but certainly not "wild." The teriyaki flavor wasn't unique and didn't provide the spicy "kick" I was expecting. My main disappointment was with the consistency of the jerky. I'm not exaggerating when I say that it went down like cardboard and left a chalky taste in my mouth. Not a fan.
