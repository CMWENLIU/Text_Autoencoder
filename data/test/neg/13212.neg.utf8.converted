Item is advertised as Kona Hawaiian Blend Coffee with 20% Kona beans.  I believe they're streaching the percentage!  Only a very slight hint of Kona flavor.  If you're looking for Kona Coffee, stay away... Other blends on the market provide more flavor.  Of course, you may always buy 100% Kona and not worry.  You only get what you pay for in the world, and in this case, you don't even get that!
