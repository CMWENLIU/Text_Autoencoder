I tried the beef, turkey, and chicken compleats and didn't like any of them. I had bought double of each compleat so I tried to get my brother and sister to try them and they didn't like them either. I bought so many because I really love the Hormel refrigerated entrees; the roast beef, beef roast, aus jus, and pot roast are really tasty and better then any other brand you can buy. The Compleats just don't have any taste. If you are making a doomsday zombie apocalypse stockpile and want items that don't need to be refrigerated then Compleats are much better then MRE's but these have a one year expiration date so you would have to eat them occasionally to keep a fresh rotation.
