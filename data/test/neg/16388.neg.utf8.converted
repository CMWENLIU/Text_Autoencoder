I looked everwhere to change my daughter's birthday cake frosting black when the frosting was white.  This product sprays on and says it will give it a black color.  I followed the instructions perfectly and it gave it a grayish color only if you sprayed a bunch on.  The smell was awful and it looked awful.  Realizing it wasn't going to work I stopped and tried to scrape it off.  The entire cake absorbed the flavor - it was horrible and the cake ended up in the garbage.
