This was my first experience with goji berries so I was excited to try them.  I actually spit them out they were so bad.  Tasteless except for a moldy/salty taste!  Thinking that maybe this is how they are supposed to taste, I asked a coworker about them.  He had a bag and let me try his...they taste NOTHING like what I got.  HIs actually had a flavor that was berry like.  I looked at the product I received closer and can see mold growing on the berries.  Also the berries in the bag are mostly just hacked up pieces-not a lot of whole berries.  I will steer clear of Navitas brand from now on!
