Taste.. 3<br />stars.Yes, strong with a kick, but to my taste buds very, very bitter.  Might be the guarana but the bitterness is very difficult to overcome regardless of brew cup size (I've tried 5,7 and 9 ounces so far).<br /><br />I like the smoothness and strength of Kona and the strength of Revv does equal that of the Kona but it is not smooth.  I occasionaly add hazelnut non-dairy creamer as a sweet treat to my coffee and the bitterness still comes through over the hazelnut creamer.<br /><br />My latest on the go experiment that seems to make it more palate tolerant, is brewing 7 ounces of Revv and adding 5 ounces of a milder medium roast coffee to it in the travel cup.  It still has the bite, but with a reasonable amount of sweetner the bitterness seems to be dulled to an acceptable level.<br /><br />K-cup container 1 star if not less.<br />I've made 5 cups of this coffee,  The  5 K-cups I've used today have had the lids come unsealed during brewing, resulting in a god awful mess of coffee flowing around the K-cup holder, out all gaps in the brewer itself and coffee grounds all over the place, in the coffee, in the brewer, in the K-cup holder.  I've used lots of K-cups from every one (haven't tried Wolfgang Puck's products yet) and have never had a K-cup unseal like this before.  I'll not be ordering more of these.
