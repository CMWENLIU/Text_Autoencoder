I have many bonsai trees and am a true lover of the art of bonsai.  First things first, when I ordered this tree it arrived quickly but was literally frozen.  Needless to say the tree died within 2 days of arrival since frozen roots are bad for plants.  Amazon was fairly quick in sending out a new tree and thankfully the new tree arrived UNfrozen.<br /><br />However the disappointment didn't quite end.  I'd like to point out that the second tree is completely healthy and still thriving after 3 months of my care, so kudos to shipping a healthy tree.  However, anybody with an appreciation of the art of bonsai will be very disappointed by the training this tree received.  It looks more like it was completely untrained and just allowed to grow naturally.  This is antithetical to good bonsai and leads to a pretty ugly (read: normal/average) tree.  It's just way too ORDINARY.<br /><br />Another nice note, since I hate to leave on a sour note, is the pot the tree comes in.  This is a very nice pot and would probably retail by itself for $15 or $20.  Nice quality and aesthetic that would compliment a properly trained tree if only it were..<br /><br />Cheers
