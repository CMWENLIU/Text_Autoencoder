I don't know how this seller got these, in Italy every box and every single sealed package inside the box has a clearly printed expiration date and these don't. The Plasmon biscuits are the best you can find in the world but not from this seller!! I thought selling babyfood with no expiration date was inlegal and honestly these taste as already expired. Amazon should take action! Stay away
