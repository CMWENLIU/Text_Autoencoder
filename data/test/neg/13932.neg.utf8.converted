This item sold and shipped by [...] is nothing like what is pictured, they mentioned x oz/jar, more like 5oz/can.  The first can I opened the pull tab came right off.  I'm no stranger to pull tabs I feed my cat from cans that are pull tabs.<br /><br />I recommend going to their site [...].  Their picture is more accurate of the product. The title of the site is "russian caviar since 2004, shipped from the USA".  Notice that this product title starts with "Alaskan Salmon", minor quib, but ...<br /><br />My order consists of 4 cans of "Grained Salmon Caviar"  looks and smells nothing like the sushi restaurant roe.  A lot of the eggs were crushed I'd say around 80% to 90%.  The ones I get from the sushi restaurants are all intact little bubbles.  It might be because its concentrate, but I don't remember the Roe in the restaurants smelling like olives. I don't like olives<br /><br />The can labels are russian but I can see "made in USA" and made on March 28, 2011.  This contradicts with description of 2 week shelf life.  So this product has already been expired, possibly they mean when its opened.  It was September when I received it.  I was a bit turned off by the large difference in ship and made date.<br /><br />The order arrived a day later than expected.  That is fine however it was only shipped after I inquired its status.  The shipper said he/she was "sorry I was out of town".  The product was pack tightly, but the ice pack that was packed with has already melted by the time I got it (I opened the package immediately upon receiving, knowing it was perishable).<br /><br />This is the first time I ordered Salmon Roe, perhaps they all come like this.  However there are still inconsistencies with this product's page, that needs to be pointed out.
