Good Earth made the very bad decision to alter their perfectly formulated Caffeine Free Original Sweet & Spicy Herbal Tea and the new formula is not even as good as the average Decaf Chai Black Tea from Celestial Seasonings. This used to be the best tea on the market for quality and flavor but is now not even in the top twenty. I can no longer recommend this product. I wrote to the company and received no response. The complaint is as follows.<br /><br />Dear Good Earth Representative, I am certain you have received hundreds of this precise complaint but I felt the need, after so many times checking back in stores and purchasing a box of your Original Sweet and Spicy Herbal Tea only to find that the taste is well below the average taste of any cheap store brand chai, to ask that your company, please, reconsider the decision to switch to this newer formula/recipe for the Herbal Sweet and Spicy tea. It has been so long since I or anyone I know has had your wonderful tea because you replaced it, a year ago or more at this point, with a tea that no one, and I mean no one, that I know was willing to continue drinking. At least 8 women at work stopped drinking it right along with me and the reviews on Amazon of your new recipe are consistently terrible. I used to have great appreciation for your company and a great love for your product. If you wanted to offer a separate Ginseng-free formula, your company could have simply introduced a night-time ginseng-free herbal. The orgininal formula did not have to be retired in order to facilitate this change. Please pass this sentiment along to your superiors on behalf of myself and many of my relatives, coworkers and companions. None of us purchase your products anymore and we would come back to your company as loyal and daily drinkers of the old formula of the Good Earth Sweet and Spicy Herbal Tea if you would only revive the old formula and resume manufacture and sale of this lost and missed product. Thank you for your time.
