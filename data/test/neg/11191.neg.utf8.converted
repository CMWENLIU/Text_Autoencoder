Bought the SS525CS Light Duty Fence energizer to keep our minpins from digging out from underneath our fence.  It was our last resort since they broke through every other barrier we set up.  It did the trick!  We set it up at our new house so it surrounds the fence all the way around, and also set a single strand on the outside of the back of the fence, which butts up to vacant land where coyotes and stray animals run around.  We didn't want coyotes coming to our yard and digging in to get at the dogs, so this was a great idea.  We've heard loose dogs get shocked out back there, and that keeps our animals safe.  Well, unfortunately yesterday I heard the energizer making a louder than usual buzzing sound and knew that something was wrong.  We previously had a kitten get stuck on it on the inside of our yard (poor thing was scared half to death by the fence and the dogs!), and bit the wire.  It fried it's poor little mouth to the wire and his legs were stuck straight out. We turned the fence off but the poor little guy had been shocked terribly.  He ended up being "ok" and we found him a home.<br /><br />Yesterday when I heard the noise I freaked out and went looking around the perimeter, and found another stray kitten, with one of its rear paws stuck to the outer perimeter's line.  I couldn't save this one. The fence killed him.  The side of his body that was touching the ground was smouldering and burnt. I had to pick up the body and dispose of it.  I cried a LOT yesterday about this.  We have a cat and a kitten in our home and it devastated me that we were responsible for the death of this precious little life.<br /><br />But today, after thinking more about it and then going online to research, it turns out that the manufacturer knows that the energizers with "CS" in the model number (means "Continuous Shock") DO KILL small animals.  Despite thier knowledge of this, the company still advertises that "No commercially made charger when installed properly will harm a pet or human."  The problem isn't improper installation here; it's that the shock in this model is continuous and doesn't give a smaller animal the chance to pull away. Cats and kittens are notorious for biting at things that hurt them, and once they clamp down, there's no getting loose unless someone happens to see what is going on.  If you are considering an electric fence, be sure it is an Intermittent Shock energizer.  This means it pulsates and allows the animal to get off the wire.  As far as I'm concerned, the item I'm reviewing, SS525CS, is a death trap for small animals (and birds & frogs too).
