I feed my German Shepherd mackerel as part of her diet.  We go through so much that I decided to order in bulk.  Big mistake.  I was used to large pieces of Mackerel from Bumble Bee.  Instead, I got shredded nastiness.  I do not recommend this product.  Though I love my puppy with all my heart, I would not say that I'm being overly sensitive to the condition of mackerel coming out of the can.  This product was shocking though....  Anyone want to buy some mackerel?  I've got 20 cans for sale!
