While these are tasty snacks, there is virtually no nutritional value in them.  A quick check of the label shows insignificant amounts of and vitamins, even vitamin C, in any of the varieties.  By insignificant, I mean less than 10% RDA.  That is far below what one might find in the claimed 1-1/2 apples or pears per package.  I will add that under ingredients, the only thing listed is the freeze-dried fruit on the label; there appear to be no additives, not even sugar, of any kind.  While they are not strictly bad for you, this snack certainly qualifies as empty calories.  Frankly you get more vitamins from a bag of potato chips.<br /><br />In addition, these are made in China, this is stated on each envelope.  Draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />Finally, the package counts are deceptive.  The subtexts often says "24 count".  Then in Amazon inset says "2 pack".  This leads a reasonable person to believe they are getting 2 24 packs for a total of 48 individual snack envelopes.  In fact these are sold in packs of 12 (TWELVE) and you get two of them for a total of 24.  I find this deceptive, or at best, confusing.<br /><br />[Update, May 2012:  It appears that the description of the item has been changed to avoid the confusion as to how many you are actually getting.]<br /><br />To conclude, these are tasty, the texture is good, there seems to be no odd ingredients, refined sugar or artificial stuff and the serving size is reasonable.  However, the utter absence of any nutritional value tells me that the process used to "freeze-dry" these seems different from other freeze-dry methods in that it is particularly destructive to nutrients.  I find the fact that they are made in China troubling.  Finally, the deceptive package counts found here in the product descriptions lead me not to purchase this again.  [Note my previous acknowledgement of the improved product count description.]
