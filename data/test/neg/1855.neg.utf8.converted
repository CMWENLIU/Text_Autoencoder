I previously purchased this product at Whole Foods.  The coconut milk was delicious and had a nice head of custard when it was left to sit for awhile.  I did not take notice of the country of origin of the previously purchased product, but the one I received from Amazon was from Sri Lanka.  I have to echo everybody else's review that the product was of poor quality.  There was no head of custard, half the cans were dented and battered and the product was thin and not as good tasting.  I am going to find another brand, because this product is now clearly inferior.
