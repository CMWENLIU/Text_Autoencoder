This product is interesting and well priced... but there is a significant gotcha...<br /><br />this small chew size is pressed together out of small rawhide chips and treated....  if your dogs are energetic chewers, they will crunch these things down very quickly...  which is potentially dangerous as the chips come apart in hard sharp pieces that remind me of small chicken bones.<br /><br />I have two small chihuahua / terrier mixes who ate these things in literally about 30 seconds....  they broke apart into said sharp pieces and got swallowed whole before I walked across the room... who wants to give a dental treat to their dog and be worrying about stomach / throat punctures and the like?<br /><br />It's very surprising to me that other reviewers haven't seen this... I guess they are just giving them to the dog and not paying attention about HOW they get eaten and how they break apart.  Bad pet owners.<br /><br />so, while the idea is nice, it's a dangerous product in my view.<br /><br />not happy about this one.
