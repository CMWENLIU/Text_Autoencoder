Pros:  none!  Cons:  small pops and lots of unpopped kernels...  I accidentally bought this after buying it last year and was disappointed then.  I could not remember if this was the brand that was so good.  I was horrified when I realized my error.  This popcorn is only good for the mulch pile.  I say this twice over.  I do not know how anyone can give it a good review.  We use a stove-top popper.  When we tried Orvil's brand it was perfect, but expensive.  I was looking for a cheaper brand and got burned!!
