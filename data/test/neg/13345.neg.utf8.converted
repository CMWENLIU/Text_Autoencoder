I was looking for a second Nespresso machine when I ran across this and similar ads for capsules. I couldn't figure out if I was missing something in the description...perhaps 100 capsules for $55? No, 50 capsules for this price. Why would anyone in their right mind pay TWICE as much for the same thing you can get directly from Nespresso? Oh by the way, the coffee arrives the next day without having to pay for premium shipping. I have been buying directly from them for almost four years and have never had a problem. Amazon you really need to take these people off of your store! Some unsuspecting person will buy a machine on this site and buy coffee at a 100% mark up. They won't be happy when they find out how they got ripped off on the capsules.
