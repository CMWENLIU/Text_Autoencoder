this is the worst.  i was looking for a way to make a pumpkin spice latte at home, without all the carbs.  this syrup is awful.  it smells nothing like pumpkin - at all.  and tastes like cough medicine.  i couldn't recommend this product if i wanted to.  i took a chance on it because i couldn't find it locally.  you win some.  you lose some.  i lost.<br /><br />i will say, however, that the vendor was wonderful.  it was safely packaged and shipped quickly.<br /><br />if anyone has any recommendations as to how to use this product, please feel free to leave a comment on this review.  i would love to be able to use it.  unfortunately, between the smell and the taste, i see no way to do so.
