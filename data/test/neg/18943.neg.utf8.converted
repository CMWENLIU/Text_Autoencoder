I bought this expecting to not like it very much, but instead I was surprised that I hated it with a passion. And let me just say, I happen to enjoy certain fakely sweetened things. I prefer Diet Pepsi to Pepsi, for instance. I wasn't expecting the taste of a fine chocolate bar or even hershey's syrup.<br /><br />But what I got was such an intensely awful experience that I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth for 15 minutes. If I were a diabetic, and some sadistic serial killer of diabetics were holding a gun to my head forcing me to choose either this, or to risk my life and eat the real thing at the expense of sending my blood sugar sky high I would choose the latter. I would rather lose a foot to diabetes than consume this product.
