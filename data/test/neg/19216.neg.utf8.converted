PLEASE, please do not feed these treats to your dogs/cats. The company has not publicized the risk of blockage and choking, and 13 dogs have died as a result of ingesting Greenies. Try googling "Greenies" and "blockage" or "death." This product is not safe for dogs.<br /><br />I was sent a free sample of the "reformulated" Greenie in the mail. The package claims the treat is "easier to digest", so I gave the treat to my dog, a 100 pound weimaraner. I watched my dog chew the treat, and he chewed it appropriately, taking his time to chew the pieces into small, digestible chunks.<br /><br />The next day, my dog refused to eat or drink anything and vomited at least three times. He acted listless and lethargic all day, so that evening we called our vet. We told the vet that the last thing our dog ate was a Greenie. The vet informed us that Greenies are known to cause intestinal blockage in some cases. He suggested that we take him to the emergency vet clinic for advanced treatment.<br /><br />We took him to the emergency clinic for x-rays and diagnosis. The vet treated him with an anti-vomiting medication and told us to return if he continued to vomit. The cost of this visit was approximately $400.<br /><br />The next day, we woke up to find our dog covered in bloody soft stool. He has had three bouts of diarreha in two hours, all of it soft and bloody. We called our vet and he told us that the dog was experiencing severe intestinal distress, which was causing the bloody stool. He suggested we give him water and return to the clinic in the early a.m.<br /><br />Thankfully, our dog passed the Greenie through his body. Had he not passed the Greenie, he would have required exploratory surgery, which my vet estimates will cost approximately $3,000, depending on the nature of the blockage.<br /><br />The representation that the new, reformulated Greenie is "easier to digest" is patently false. Our dog properly chewed the Greenie, but yet the treat was still insoluble and indigestible. His ingestion of the Greenie caused serious health issues. These things aren't safe -- please don't support this company or put your dog's health at risk.
