Having ordered two of this item, they were shipped in one small box losely packed with only air pillows.  One had leaked and the other had the seal broken.  I ordered only one replacement, explaining how all the other jugs of maple syrup were packed to prevent damage.  The replacement arrived undamaged, but again loosely packed in a small box with only air pillows.  As there are other alternatives on amazon that are shipped properly and the seals are more substantial, I recommend ordering one of them.
