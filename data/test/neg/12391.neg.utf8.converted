... in fact it might just be the exact same formula as your closest local/national grocery store brand but with the added bonus of costing about 30% more. We had recently been using this formula until we ran out and I had to make an emergency run to the local grocery store for a quick replacement. The closest thing they had was their organic store brand. Funny thing is, when I got home to compare the two I noticed the ingredients are EXACTLY the same as well as some of the machine writing on the bottom of the cans where you can find the sell by date. From what I can gather after doing a bit of research the formula ingredients used to be different but have recently changed without letting customers know. Virtually all store brand organic formulas come from one manufacturing plant whether you buy it at store X or Y and it seems that Earth's Best is now being produced in this same facility but charging a premium price. I suggest checking this out for yourself, you might be able to save some money.
