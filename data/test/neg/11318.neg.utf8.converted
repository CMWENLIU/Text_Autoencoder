I bought some Naked coconut water from Whole Foods, loved it, and looked to Amazon to buy more. I read the reviews on O.N.E. and ordered a case. First off, I received a case that suspiciously did not have a USDA organic symbol that somehow is on the product image on amazon. Secondly, the product was way sweeter than Naked, which leads me to believe that they somehow add sugar to the product, because there can't be such a variation from one coconut water to another, if both claim to be all natural, blah, blah, blah. To be specific, O.N.E. has 3 more grams of sugar than Naked per 11.2 ounce serving. Because of the sugary taste, it makes the water less crisp and refreshing (and healthy) than Naked. Overall, feeling disenchanted and bamboozled by this purchase.
