I bought this thinking it would be yummy cheesy goodness on a cold winter's day.  It was not.  It was more soupy than I thought it would be, thinking it would be more pasta like- and the tortellini was absolutely disgusting.  The shells were rubbery with a weird taste (consistency SQUID) and I didn't ever taste any cheese.  If that was supposed to be cheese in there, someone has some explaining to do.  Obviously, I was pretty disappointed.  More so for the rest of the day as well, because I couldn't get the taste of the rubber noodles and fake cheese out of my mouth.  All day I kept thinking about it and it just kept making me feel sick.  I will NEVER buy this product again.
