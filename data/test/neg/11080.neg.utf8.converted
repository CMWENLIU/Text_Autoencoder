My son is 6 months old and I was so happy to find this product. I thought it would be like farley's rusks but it's more like a wafer. I tried it before giving it to him. It does not melt in the mouth on contact. This 'rusk' can easily break or be squished by a 6 month old. Thinking that my baby will have a better experience I gave it to him and he was biting on it like a teether and a small piece broke in his mouth. I quickly took it out as I could see that it was a hard piece and it failed to melt in the mouth on contact. I will return this so called rusk and get Farley's rusks instead.
