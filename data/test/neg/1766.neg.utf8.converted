First  If I could have rated this ZERO STARS.. I would hav<br /><br />I would like to say I am a regular eater of protein bars. This is NOTHING like that rather a cut down version of a crunchy candy bar..<br />  1. it is extremely SMALL.. it didn't even fill the modest size package that is was wrapped in. Approx 2/3 of the size of a usual bar<br />  2. it is Thin as well as short...<br />  3. Extremely sweet and modest crunch<br />  4. It might only measure 90 calories but most of those come from simple Sugar- the first 3 ingredients are SUGAR...<br /><br />So if you want a sugar high fine but if your  are looking for a  healthy low cal mid meal snack that is healthy find another bar there are loads of them out there.<br /><br />So inconclusion this is a cut down candy bar faking it as a healthy low calorie item. Kellogg You can do way better than this !!!
