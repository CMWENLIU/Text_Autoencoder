We tried to switch to a less expensive brand, so we tried Felidae. All 3 of my cats literally ate around it when I tried to blend it into their normal brand for transition.  Out of curiosity, I put only the Felidae in their bowls- they sniffed it, ignored it, and began their "meowing for food" ritual.  It ended up in the bin and we have since gone back to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CJYCO">Taste of the Wild</a>.<br /><br />Cat breeds: 1) Male British Shorthair, 2) Female Russian Blue, 3) Male Ocelot mix
