I thought I was ordering candied lemon peels that can be eaten on their own. These are horrible for that purpose. I just read another review that said you can bake it into things and put them in coffee. That sounds like a bad idea, but I could be wrong. FYI - it is sweetened with corn syrup. Shipping is expensive because they send it priority, which to me seems like a waste and you have to sign for your package. So, if you miss the mail man, you have to visit the post office.
