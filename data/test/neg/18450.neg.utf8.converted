The ingredients listed "canola and/or safflower and/or sunflower oil," and I gotta assume there was a problem with canola oil since the smell of the chips gave me a Proustian flashback to my days as an aspiring artist working with oil paints. Such flashbacks can occur because of the close family ties among rapeseed, canola and linseed oils. So I guess the lesson here is don't buy these chips within, say, 5 months of the "best by" date unless you're an artist, because if you're truly an artist, then you're starving, and if you're starving, whaddaya care if the chips smell bad.
