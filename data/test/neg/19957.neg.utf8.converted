I was so excited to get this mix. That being said this does NOT taste like any like french bread it might be alright as pizza crust.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- baked up nicely<br />- nice crust<br />- nice looking loaf/slices<br />- was palatable after a good dose of garlic butter and then toasted<br /><br />Cons:<br />- does NOT taste like French bread<br />- funny aftertaste (when plain)<br />- did not smell good baking up
