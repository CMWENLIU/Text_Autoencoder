I have tried and reviewed a few Jasmine Teas and still have not found one current tea that has a jasmine fragrance.  When I was in China I had a great tea that when you brewed it, would fill the air with the smell of Jamsine.  You could smell it when you brought your nose to the cup. It was aromatherapy!<br /><br />I had seen people complain Rishi had too much jasmine smell so figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />Teance, Chaa by Te and Whole Tea version of Jasmine Dragon Pearl Fujian, All have about the same taste and smell  as the Rishi.  No need to spend more on this tea.  I would say Teance is the closer one as it is not as pungent.<br /><br />Sadly I do not smell any jasmine.  I have a jasmine plant so know what this should smell like if true jasmine.<br /><br />Rishi Pearls  I got do not have any jasmine smell. Not in the cup, not in the air.  It is more pungent when smelling in the bag but I can not place the odor.<br /><br />My only thought, after speaking to Rishi, is that maybe I am smelling the type of tea plant and they suggested trying their white tea and jasmine.<br />It is possible, since what I had overseas was a a loose tea, that I was not not drinking a silver tip tea.<br /><br />For the extra cost I did not get a better flavor. The other brands mentioned will give you the same results for a better cost per pound.
