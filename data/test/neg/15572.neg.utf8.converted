I purchased 3 of the black sea salts as gifts for Christmas. I got a confirmation email stating my order would arrive in time for Christmas. In fact it said it would get here on the 23rd of December. Today, on the 23rd I received an email stating they were out of stock. Couldn't they have told me that when I placed my order, not when I was supposed to receive the items?
