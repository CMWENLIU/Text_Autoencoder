These had an almost crumbly dry texture to them.  Very gross.  My hang up about low carb foods are textures and this one ended up being pricey dog food as that was the only one who would eat it.  I had it with garlic and olive oil on it so I cannot tell you if the pasta had a good taste or not.<br /><br />  I suggest dreamfields if it does not spike your sugar as it is dead on perfect.  I am thinking of giving carb-nada a try.  I really like a lot of Dixie's products (even their faux potatoes) but not this one!
