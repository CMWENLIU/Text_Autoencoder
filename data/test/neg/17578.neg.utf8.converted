I can hardly eat this for all of the salt, it leaves you thirsty it's so bad. The ingredients list reads, literally, "100% organic sweet corn, sea salt, and nothing else". They need to make it "100% organic sweet corn and nothing else", and they'd probably have something really great. As it is I'm stuck with 23 1/2 bags of salty corn that I'll have to give away.
