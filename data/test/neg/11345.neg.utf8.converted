About half the cans in my case were dented, and it certainly looks to me that they must have been dented before being packaged together into my case (cans in the middle of the pack have side dents, for example).  I had intended to include a can or two into care packages destined for American soldiers (a little taste of Thanksgiving, and the cans are pretty enough to be decorative).  But, I can't be sending dented cans to our troops -- and I don't want to eat from dented cans myself, so I'm vexed.  For purposes of this review, I opened a good can to taste the product, and the product tastes good.  It certainly costs enough.  I would have been quite happy with this if I didn't find half the goods were damaged (I consider them unusable), and I didn't think that I was intentionally bamboozled by someone trying to dump dented cans.
