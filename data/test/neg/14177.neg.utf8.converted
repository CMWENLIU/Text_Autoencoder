Please read the packaging carefully if you are sensitive to MSG... it reads "No MSG Added" - 'Added' is the operative word.  One of the ingredients is Hydrolized Wheat Protein.  According to some sources I found online, including the "Truth in Labeling Campaign", anything "hydrolyzed, or any "hydrolyzed protein" contains processed free glutamic acid (aka MSG).
