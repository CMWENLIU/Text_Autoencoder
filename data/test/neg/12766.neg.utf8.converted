You will definitely need good teeth to eat these cookies!  They are not just crispy.....they are almost like trying to bite into concrete.  I love Newman's products & wanted to love these organic ginger snaps, mainly because they are organic,  but they leave a lot to be desired.  I don't know if it was just the batch I received  or if they are supposed to be this way, but they are almost burnt.  The bottoms are very dark, almost black.  They also left a bad after taste that both my husband and & I noticed.  They just did not taste good.  They taste nothing like the flat ginger snaps of other brands.  I will not be buying these.......but still love other Newman products.
