If you like garbanzo beans, you will like the flour. If not, try to find a flour without this ingredient. It tends to overpower some baked foods. For example, cookie dough made with this tastes awful; when you bake the cookies, they are almost tolerable. Sorry, since I love the other products by this company, but this one isnt on my reorder list.
