I have been going crazy looking for the traditional candies from my youth and was excited to find this.  There is a very thin fine line of chocolate with no taste of it.  I had to actually look at the candy to see if there was chocolate in it.  Very disappointed.  Definitely not the chocolate filled straws I remember.
