My son enjoys this product, and I don't blame him.  It is SWEET.  Not surprisingly, since the first ingredient is JUICE, which is basically adding just empty calories for sweetness (as my pediatrician confirmed).  I won't be buying this product again.  Babies need whole fruit ingredients - juice is not considered an ideal food for them.  I also saw that Sprout's pack with cinnamon apple oatmeal also has juice listed as the first ingredient.
