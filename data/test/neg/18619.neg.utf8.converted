I tried this bread - TWICE! - because the first loaf I bought seemed stale and tasteless.  Thinking that maybe I had bought a "bad" loaf or something, threw it away and bought another.  SAME THING!!  It was horrible!  This time, I took the bread back to the store and asked for my money back.  The salesgirl said that a lot of people don't like this, but there's not much else to choose from when it comes to buying gluten-free bread that does taste good.  Great, huh?
