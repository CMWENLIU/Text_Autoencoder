Want to add my voice to the negative reviews here. My family brought home some moths in store-brand brown rice and have been battling a minor infestation ever since. Minor in that we've kept them down to only one or two living moths visible at any given time; less minor in that the larvae get into /everything/ before we find them.<br />Before Safer, I had used another brand, which was reasonably effective, catching several moths in a two-week period. When I returned to the hardware store for another box, they were all out, but had LOTS of Safer brand traps. Now I know why.<br />The sticky patches are small and not very sticky. I'd take the trap down and see black smudges on the stickum that said a moth had landed on it and then flown away again. In a couple of weeks it had caught one moth, and there were obviously others flying around elsewhere.<br />I returned to the hardware store for another package of the first brand (I am not remembering the name) and informed the manager of the store that this worked very badly. I hope he will watch out for his business and cease to stock these money-wasters. Sadly, they seem to be the only brand stocked in most places.
