I used this formula for my baby from 6 weeks old to 1 year after trying to nurse unsuccessfully.  He tolerated it well and I thought this was a terrific product while using it.  I am now horrified to learn about the extremely high arsenic levels found in organic brown rice syrup in a very recent Darmouth College study.  Nature's One conducted a study to test the arsenic levels, but the company has stated it will not release the results of the study to the public, which is very troubling.  Nature's One states its formula is safe under FDA guidelines, but the FDA has no guidelines for arsenic in food, let alone baby formula.  So, please do your research before using this for your baby.
