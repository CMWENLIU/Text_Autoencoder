I can't believe this vendor is charging over a hundred bucks for guarana syrup! You can get the same exact syrup in Brazilian grocery stores for 9 or 10 dollars! In San Francisco you can get it at Mercado Brazil, 1 Liter for $9, or you can buy it online at a Los Angeles store--brazilianshop.com--for $8.49. Shame!
