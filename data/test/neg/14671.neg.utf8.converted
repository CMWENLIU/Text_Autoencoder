Okay, I know this is instant but come on. It is not drinkable! I've tried the Italian and the Colombian in the VIA and they are superior to this garbage. I think they need to go back to the drawing board on this one.  It is just gross.  I was expecting something closer to the previous coffees that they came out with in the VIA.  This is not close. All I can say is YUCK.
