I was very dissapointed in this product.  It was no more than 30% lean.  It shrunk.  It was so thinly sliced on some pieces that I couldn't even peel it away in tact.  Its flavor was unremarkable other than extreme bursts of salt here and there.  My wife dosen't want to use it for an ingredient in other dishes she uses bacon for.  I did give what was left to my dog and she seemd OK with it, but then she has been known to eat poop as well.<br />Sorry, just being honest.  I consume many brands and pounds of bacon.
