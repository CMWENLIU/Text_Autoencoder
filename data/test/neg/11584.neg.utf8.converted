I am a chocoholic. so, to see this new cereal that was all about chocolate got me really excited!  The first bite was "Oooooh, so chocolatey!" The second bite was "hmmmm....chocolatey" and the third was, "is this cereal stale????".  Seriously, after three bites, it tasted like stale cardboard, plain and simple.  And I never thought I would say this, but the chocolate-ness was almost overpowering.  Save yourself some time and just eat the box, it'll taste much better.<br /><br />Nope, not a fan.  At...all...
