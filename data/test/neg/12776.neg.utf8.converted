I'm not a huge cookie fan.  I like my desserts fruity, cheesy or frozen with chocolate fudge on top, the one exception is ginger snaps.  I like them even when I'm not in the mood for something cookie'ish, I like them with tea, I like them with coffee, I like them with pepper jack cheese (everything goes with pepper jack). Also because they usually aren't terribly sweet and when I go to the trouble of baking them, they seem to last longer than other cookies (I mean they still taste good the next day, not that I can resist eating them all straight from the baking sheet).<br /><br />But these ginger snaps are not right.<br /><br />They are chewy and gritty.  Stale but burnt in places.  I know, it sounds like a manufacturing problem and I thought perhaps the unburnt, not stale ones would be okay if they were rebaked.  Nope.  I picked through the bag to find the snaps that weren't burnt, I put them in the oven to 're-crisp' at a low temp (250F) for about five minutes, in the end they still tasted bitter, gitty, stale and overly sweet.<br /><br />The price is right at around $3 a bag, but I think you'd be better off buying an old tried and true brand, such as Nabisco Ginger Snaps (sweetish, super crispy, reliably cooked for an even crisp texture) or Anna's Ginger Thins, my new favorite store brand of Ginger Snaps (they are wafer thin, spicy and go well with ice cream).
