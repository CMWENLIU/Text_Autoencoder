I was really excited to try this flour after so many great reviews.  I've been baking gluten-free for over 2 years now and am at the point where I can make most things taste exactly like gluten items, but find that many recipes take quite a bit of adjustment and almost all get dry quickly.  I've gotten a bit tired of mixing flours and wanted to try a quick solution.  Anyway, as soon as my sample came in I made vegan cinnamon rolls from the recipe on the Better Batter website.  I immediately noticed a funky smell to the flour, which I think is from all the tapioca.  Now, the recipe came together beautifully, the consistency of the dough was perfect and I've never before gotten quite such perfect texture and rise in gluten-free breads.  That said, the tapioca taste is overwhelming!  Even my husband, who is not picky at all, had to force the first few bites.  After that the cinnamon does cover up the funky flour taste, but I could never feel confident serving something I made with this product to guests.  It has what I consider to be the distinctive "gluten-free taste" that you find in most processed gluten free foods.  This taste has always bothered me way more than texture issues.  I guess it's back to mixing my own mixes using Authentic Foods superfine flours.
