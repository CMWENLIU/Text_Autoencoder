If you're looking for a quality cold-pressed coconut oil, this is NOT the one!!! Stay away! When I first opened it, it looked fine and smelled nice and 'coconutty'. Upon melting it to pour into another container, I was appalled at the nasty bacon grease smell and the yellow color. This is a heat-processed oil, likely using poor quality coconut. I will never ever buy this brand again.
