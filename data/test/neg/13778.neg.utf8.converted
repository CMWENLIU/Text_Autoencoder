I bought this with high hopes of being able to grow a plant for my younger cousin. I am a gardner myself so I was pretty excited. However the plant NEVER grew no matter what I did. To me it was a waste of money time and resources. DO NOT BUY. Get a plant from a florist or even from Home Depot- it'll be better than this piece of crap.
