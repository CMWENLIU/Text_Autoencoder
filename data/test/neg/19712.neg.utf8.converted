This container was delivered about an hour ago in a cardboard box with other food items. So far no problem, but after taking this 24 oz container out of the box I noticed it had no tight plastic wrapping around it that could protect it from tampering.<br />After opening the cover i noticed there was a round paper right under the cover that is supposed to be glued completely around the top of the container. This paper was only glued half way around the container.... in other words, there is the possibility of tampering with this product. I cannot trust it, so even though the parmesan cheese smells good i would rather not take chances on that one.
