I had my whole family hooked on Orgain. I made my kids drink one every morning with their breakfast. It was my breakfast every morning as well as my husbands. We loved Orgain so much that we had several cases auto shipped to us every month. Then a couple months ago, we thought we got a bad batch of the iced mocha and so we returned them and tried getting them locally in a store by us. Same horrific taste. At the same time, we were dropped from the auto ship program and it was getting harder to find it in the local stores in that flavor so we assumed they changed the formula but the Vitamin Shoppe had no idea and there was no indication on the packaging saying that there were any changes made. So, we tried switching to the chocolate fudge. It was delicious so we just changed our auto ship to the new flavor and for a couple months got by with the chocolate fudge. Then, we got dropped from the auto ship again and had a harder time finding it in the stores. Apparently, they changed the chocolate fudge formula also. I just got 2 new cases and they have that same DISGUSTING taste that the iced mocha had. Needless to say we can't drink it anymore, will be returning what we have and actively trying to find a replacement drink. I can't tell you how disappointed we are. All I can say is that unless they change the formula back, I'll never buy it again. It isn't even drinkable. It's absolutely revolting!
