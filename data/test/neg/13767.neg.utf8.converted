I have tried both the Green Mountain Hot Cocoa k-cups and the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa and the biggest difference I find is that the Cafe Escapes brand tastes like it has an artificial flavor, perhaps it's the sweetener. The flavor is not as rich or creamy and it is much sweeter than the Green Mountain brand. I would recommend the Green Mountain brand if you are having trouble deciding between the two.
