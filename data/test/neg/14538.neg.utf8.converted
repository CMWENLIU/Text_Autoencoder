The price was low, so it was an acceptable risk to try it out.  I like Jalepeno, Cheese, and Popcorn.  I like many kinds of flavored popcorn.  I like Yaya's other cheese popcorn.  This Jalapeno Cheddar popcorn arrived a few days past the expiration date.  Bummer!  Okay, so maybe it will be stale, but who cares I'll eat it.  I put a small handful of this popcorn in my mouth and it tasted terrible!  I kept chewing, I had to give it a chance.  Swallowed a little.  Put a little more in my mouth and couldn't stand it any longer.  Get it out of my mouth!  Spit everything out!  It is the worst popcorn I ever tried.  The after taste kept coming back hours later and grossing me out.  My friend tried some too and said it was horrible.  The whole case went into the trash.  I was afraid to feed it to animals.
