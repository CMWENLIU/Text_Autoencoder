I can tell you from experience that it is not hard to make healthy, low calorie, low sodium soup that tastes good.<br /><br />Calories for this soup are OK, and it has a few carrot pieces in it for a little extra nutrition. However, the taste was totally bland. It is commendable that they used less salt. However, they could have added a little rosemary and/or garlic, for example, and produced an enjoyable taste without one bit of extra calories or sodium. I also found the chicken to be overcooked and rubbery, as were the pasta curls that they think are "noodles".<br /><br />Yesterday I had a can of Progresso Classics Vegatable that was the same calories, more nutricious, and full of flavor. Even the old fashioned small can of Campbell's Chicken Noodle is a better bowl of soup than this. No more "Healthy Choice" in our pantry.
