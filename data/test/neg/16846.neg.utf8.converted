I have purchased these K-Cups for some time now.  Initially the coffee was great and the K-Cups worked flawlessly.  However I've had issues with the last 2 cases that I've purchased.  When they work the coffee is still great.  The problem is Timothy's quality control as it pertains to the manufacturing of the K-Cup itself has become extremely poor.  The filter inside the K-Cup is not secured properly resulting in a tremendous amount of grounds in your cup.  This also serves to clog my Keurig as well.  I use to think that this was the best K-Cup bargain around. Not any more.  Looks like I will be changing brands.  Buyer beware.
