Earl Grey is one of my favorite teas, but I am totally disappointed with this one. It tastes of fake lime to me, like they added some lime jello or something.  FYI the tea pods ( 2.25") are smaller than the coffee pods (2.75"), hence the different T-pod holder, which also has a chamber on the underside, perhaps to channel the tea so it has less contact with surfaces that the coffee may have flavored?<br />Anyway, the only way I could get the t-pod holder for the base model was the senseo website. No local stores had the tea either so I also spent a lot for the case and now I'm saddled with 119 pods I don't want. Too bad I didn't get them from Amazon, who might take them back...<br />I discovered that I can perfectly well make tea in my Senseo by carefully tucking any tea bag in the pod holder, smoothing it and folding back any edges that extend where they might break the seal. It has worked for me in both the single coffee and tea holders.
