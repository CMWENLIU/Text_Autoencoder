I'm a big fan of stevia -- in its un-messed-with form, that is.  I use the liquid type from my local health food store.  I try to avoid the other types that have been mixed with various powders and crystals and so on.  Stevia in liquid form is so sweet it only takes two drops to sweeten a glass of iced tea and leaves no aftertaste.<br /><br />I tried several cans of Zevia on different occasions, really trying to like it.  But it has an awful aftertaste, no matter how cold it is.<br /><br />It's over-priced and bad tasting.  That it gets so many good reviews may be more because people are so desperate to find an alternative to HFCS-laden drinks they'll like anything.  But to each their own.<br /><br />I won't buy any more Zevia or recommend it to anyone.
