I love peanut M&M's and buy it all the time.  I thought that I could just buy a big bag so I didn't run out but it was not worth it.  It's more expensive (and I don't have to pay for shipping b/c I'm Prime), which is okay with b/c it's hard for me to get to the store and I wanted it fast.  The 1 star rating is b/c 25% of the candy came crushed and left a mess when I opened the bag.  I think that there were melting issues and with the weight, some pieces just cracked.  I will not buy again.
