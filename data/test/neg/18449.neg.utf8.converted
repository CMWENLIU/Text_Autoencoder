Like other reviewers, our chips were rancid.  We received our chips only a month before the expiration date and they were already going bad.  We made it through a bag and a half before we had to throw them all away.  It may have just been the box we received, but other reviewers have commented on it, too, so it may not be isolated.  In any case, I don't think we'll be buying this brand again.
