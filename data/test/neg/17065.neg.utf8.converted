We love linguini and clams and have always used Doxsee (Snow's) canned minced clams. The juice has a pleasant and very "clammy" taste. But the price went way up so I tried ordering Chicken of the Sea on a subscription. Big disappointment! As soon as I opened the cans I could see that the color was "off" and the smell was stale and tinny. I could hardly smell clams at all. The taste was just as disappointing. I have cancelled my subscription.
