For a long time I thought there were two kinds of soda: the big brands like Pepsi and Coca Cola, and then all the terrible tasting small brands. However, after purchasing a SodaStream I learned that there's a 3rd category that's even worse than the terrible small brand sodas: SodaStream flavors.<br /><br />These things taste absolutely horrible. Not a single one tastes anything like the flavor it's trying to imitate. Every flavor tastes like it came straight out of a New Jersey chemical factory. There wasn't a single flavor that I could trick myself into drinking.<br /><br />Bottom line: SodaStream makes carbonated water real well, but that's it. They completely fail at flavor additives.
