Tastes good, convenient, and gluten free. Purchased for $2/box at my local WholeFoods.<br /><br />The big problem is the oxygen-absorbing packets. I don't like these things in my food. I like the packaging otherwise, but I am a little disturbed after pulling multiple packets that say "do not eat" from my food. Yes, multiple "freshness packets" in a single box.<br /><br />Real food spoils, goes stale, etc., and we should not fear that fact. When I encounter too many chemical agents and artificial ingredients, I tend to stay away from the product and make my own instead. Sorry about the negative review, but little plastic packets should not be in boxes of food. I sliced open one of these packets, and what came out was fine black powder and brown granules.<br /><br />I am pleased that the Amazon product info page currently warns about these packets. The warning is also printed in tiny white letters on the tops of the boxes, although it should probably be listed near the ingredients for the benefit of consumers.
