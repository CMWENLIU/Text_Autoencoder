Confirmed Goji Berry causing severe nausia cramping and intestinal pain.<br /><br />I was introduced to goji berries during the summer as a friend I met had just opened a raw food cafe. His food NEVER (I mean never) gave me any problems it was all delicious and much of it was cacao and goji berries. He has very selective about his sources and does not trust many companies out there.(His Goji comes from Sunfood)<br /><br />When I returned home from Alaska I decided to try more superfoods and bought a trail mix by Navitas that was Goji, Cacao Nibs, and Cashews. That day I had a green shake for breakfast and a banana for a snack then just a pinch of Goji Berries afterwards. Within the hour I was writhing in pain and couldn't imagine what it was.<br /><br />This pain is severe. I wanted to die. It lasted about twelve hours. Including vomiting and diarrhea<br /><br />Next day I had a big green salad for lunch and then feeling better grabbed another SMALL pinch of goji and within 20 minutes I was in the exact same pain. I knew then it was the goji and instantly typed "goji stomach ache" into google and found threads verifying it.<br /><br />I called my friend and told him about my reaction and he asked me if it was Navitas.  I didn't recall and didn't have the bag on me but he said he bet 100% it was them.  He had similar reaction to their product and did hydrogen peroxide tests and found them to be rancid.  Got home and verified his assertion.<br /><br />Again, I never had this problem before eating Goji from Sunfood, but this Navitas is killing me.<br /><br />BEWARE: Detox can be painful enough even on a quality Goji berry.  You should start with very small amounts and I would recommend trying alternate brands NOT navitas.
