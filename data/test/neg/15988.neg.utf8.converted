I love Pamela's cookies so this review is not about the cookie but about Amazon.  There are supposed to be 6 packs in 1 order, but I only received 1 pack.  I have ordered other Pamela's cookies from Amazon many times and never had a problem.  This was the most expensive pack of cookies ever purchased!!!  I am trying to send them back and will see how Amazon responds.
