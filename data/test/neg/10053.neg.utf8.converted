I was delighted to have dried mushrooms that I could use for cooking. They tasted like rubber...tough and awful. This is the first bad review I've ever written. But wanted to save the consumer. (It was too much trouble to find more packaging and pay to ship them back.<br />I guess we learn as we go. Good luck to all!
