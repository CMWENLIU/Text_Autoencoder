This used to be my favorite lunch but recently Simply Asia reformulated this into an entirely different product.  The old product has a slightly sweet and spicy peanut sauce and a peanut topping.  The new product has a spicy chili-based sauce (and no peanuts.)<br />Hopefully the new version will not sell and they will move back to the old.  Bad call on the part of Simply Asia.
