Much too salty, despite the claim otherwise.  It says on the package, "When it is salty enough, it's seasoned to perfection."  For me, if it's "seasoned to perfection", the salt is absolutely choking.  If I sprinkle it with the right amount of salt, I can't taste the seasoning flavors.<br /><br />If this is supposed to be lower in salt, just imagine what the regular stuff will be!<br /><br />I won't be buying this again.
