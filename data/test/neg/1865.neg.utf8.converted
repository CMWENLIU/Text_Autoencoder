Like the other reviewers, I fell in love with Native Forest coconut milk (from Thailand) - rich, creamy, and oh so delicious!  But then... I got a shipment with cans sourced from Sri Lanka:  thin and runny, slightly brown, and smelling like old sneakers.  I've requested a replacement order from Amazon and my fingers are crossed that I receive a shipment from Thailand!  If anyone knows the secret to getting only Thai-sourced product, please leave me a comment!  Thanks!
