Most ghirardelli chocolates are good, especially the dark chocolate. But read the nutrition facts on the side of the bag. The dark caramel has trans fat in it. For those who don't know what trans fat is, guess what? Neither does your body. The stuff is man made as a cheap replacement for certain ingredients. It was originally created as a replacement for candle wax. So think about melting candle wax down, eating it, and having it harden in your body. Your body doesn't know what trans fat is so it sends it straight to your arteries, which clogs your arteries. That is what is called Heart Disease (clogged arteries). So having 1 or 2 of these candies probably won't kill you, but they are kinda addicting. Also think about other food you eat and whether or not they had a little bit trans fat in them. Quickly a little will turn into a lot, and not even a little bit of this stuff is ok. Think about your heart and the potential health risk. Ghirardelli needs to stop using cheap ingredients and go back to the drawing board on this one. FYI: Another term for trans fat is hydrogenated oil.
