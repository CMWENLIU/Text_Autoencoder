I know they don't claim to be "soy-free," however, it seems completely unnecessary for them to buy corn that has SOY in it...for the price of this cereal, and the healthy image Barbara's is trying to project (especially with their new packaging push), they should take the extra step to ensure that the product is SOY FREE.  Cater to your many, many food allergy customers instead of going the cheap route and buying contaminated corn.<br />(From Barbara's website: INGREDIENTS: ORGANIC WHOLE OAT FLOUR, ORGANIC CORN FLOUR, ORGANIC OAT BRAN, ORGANIC FRUIT JUICE CONCENTRATE (APPLE, PINEAPPLE, PEAR, OR PEACH), SEA SALT, BAKING SODA. CONTAINS SOY (IN CORN).<br /><br />MANUFACTURED IN A FACILITY THAT ALSO PROCESSES MILK, HAZELNUTS, ALMONDS, COCONUT, AND WHEAT. *AMOUNT IN CEREAL.)<br />I am saddened that Barbara's supports and enables the disgusting farm subsidies that allow soy, a top 8 allergen in the US, to contaminate our food supply.
