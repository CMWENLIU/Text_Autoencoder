I bought these on sale through amazon and was so excited that they were Fair Trade.  I thought GREAT!  Everyone is being paid fairly for their labors and its not coming out of MY pocket!  I felt it was win win for the sugar workers and for me...  Until I started feeling like something was weird.  Every morning when I would make my coffee, it would never taste the same even though I always put 3 sugar packs in.  It slowly dawned on me that every single pack has a totally different amount of sugar in it!!!!!!!!  Some packs had about 20 grains (literally!!!) and some were so full, they burst when I tore them open.  WHat the (*&@!#(*!&@?!??!  Who does this? I started thinking that maybe the people who made the sugar were OVERPAID for their efforts and smoking a little too much hashish.  Although the taste of the sugar was great...
