The Turkey Sticks and Pepperoni , and the Hummis are wonderful. However, I feed stray cats every morning at the high school where I teach and they walked, no ran, away from the Salmon and Tuna. This was after I tried each one and decided I could not consume either. The eleven feral cats confirmed the shock to my taste buds.
