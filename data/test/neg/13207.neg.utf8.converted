I thought this was pretty decent. I found the scent pleasing without being over-powering and the scent did not linger in an obnoxious way. The body wash lathered nicely and when rinsed off, did not leave my skin as dry, flaky and scratchy as some other products I've used in the past.<br /><br />What is disappointing is that this product contains Petrolatum which is a by-product of petroleum (also known as petroleum jelly.) Petrolatum has been linked to causing or inflaming acne, it can actually clog your pores and of most concern is that it has been recognized as being a possible cancer risk. A bit of Googling will reveal all of this and more.<br /><br />Bottom line for me is that there are plenty of other skin care products that do not contain Petrolatum. I would not buy this again.
