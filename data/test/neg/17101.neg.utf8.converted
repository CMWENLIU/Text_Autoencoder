Don't waste your money on this product.  I just ordered 12 boxes of Casbah Tabouli and I will not make it according to their directions again!  Number 1, all of the spices are mixed with the bulgar wheat....don't like that.  Number 2, follow the directions on the box and they will have you put 1/3 of a cup of olive oil in the mix....way too much olive oil.  Next time I will try only a couple of tablespoons of olive oil.  Best bet is to buy Near East Taboule....much better!
