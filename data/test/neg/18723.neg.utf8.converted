I ordered this in multiple colors. It's not that glittery, and it becomes gummy upon contact with moisture... I think this stuff only works if you sprinkle it on and then immediately serve the dish. I used it as a decoration on top of a cheesecake, and within 30 minutes it had "melted" into a gooey substance - and the cheesecake had just come out of the refrigerator. Cute idea, poor execution.<br /><br />Plus, for this silver color, the package came WITHOUT a safety seal of any kind - just unscrew the white top and the stuff comes pouring out. So I never even used the silver one - and it would have cost way more than the cost of the glitter to return it, so I just "ate" the cost.
