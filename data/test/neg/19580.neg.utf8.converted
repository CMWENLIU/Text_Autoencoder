I AM LOWERING THIS REVIEW SINCE THEIR HUGH 25% JACK UP IN PRICE. $1.25 A QUART IS WAY TO HIGH TO BUY ANYMORE.<br /><br />I am pretty much disabled and hate it when I run out of milk. I'm buying this so I have reserve on hand when it's to hard to go to the store when I run out of milk. The 12 3qt bags is a little more expensive but I figure it will stay fresher longer and I will probably only need one bag a month or so. I have heard Saco is a good brand. I will add to this review after I have tried it.<br /><br />--Update: IT WAS GOOD AT $36 A CASE BUT NOW IS A RIP-OFF AT $44. THE 40 QT BOX ALSO JUMPED TO $44 PLUS $13 STINKING SHIPPING. NOW YOU HAVE A HUGE HIGH PRICE. IT'S NOW WORTH BUYING THIS CRAP ANYMORE.
