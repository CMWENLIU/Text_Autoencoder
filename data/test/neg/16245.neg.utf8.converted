Dont get deceived by cute advertisement for this food its horrible quality, primarily made of corn and byproducts(waste from human manufacturing), it also contains meat and bone meal from unidendified animals which can include roadkill and euthanized cats and dogs. Spend $5 more and get something better, few other options include diamond naturals, costcos kirkland signature, 4health(tractor supply), healthwise, canidae and whole earth farms.
