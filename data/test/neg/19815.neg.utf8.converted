We love Tete de Moine cheese.  The best way to serve it is to cut it using a girolle.  A full wheel of Tete de Moine is round which is why it works on a girolle. I ordered half a wheel and expected to get one cut horizontally so that it could be cut on a girolle.  This company cut it vertically so it can't be cut on a girolle.  I complained in an e-mail 2 weeks ago and haven't had a reply.
