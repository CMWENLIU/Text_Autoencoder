I am not sure how the price per ounce calculation works but it seems to be incorrect (I am trying to find inexpensive honey). Currently it says .25 cents per oz. The product is 32 ounces. This should be an $8 product. Instead it is a $12+ product (not counting shipping). So that is closer to .38/ounce.
