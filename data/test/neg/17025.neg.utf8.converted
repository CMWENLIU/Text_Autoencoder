Very disappointed in the chocolate Raw Meal.  I have used the original flavor for about a year in place of breakfast and while I can't say I love the flavor, I don't mind it, I think its pleasant, and I think it tastes like food not chemicals.  So, I expected the same taste, but chocolate.  I'm sad to say the flavor is weird and plain old yucky.  I think the flavor is more stale baking cocoa than chocolate and the stevia makes it too sweet with that weird, bitter aftertaste.  I thought the original was sweet enough and I think the chocoalte flavor didn't need to be so sweet.  I  wish there had been the single serving packets to try first.  I made it again today but put it into the blender with kale and carrot juice, thinking I could disguise the flavor (nope!) but I still got that stevia bitterness.  I'll finish it, but I'll be back to the original next time.  I gave it 2 stars cause it still contains a lot of good stuff and I feel good after having it.
