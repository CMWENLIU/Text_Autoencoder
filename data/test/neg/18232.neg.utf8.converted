I ordered these steaks only to have them arrive very bloody, wrapped in freezer wrap with no labeling present at all.  I am thankful that I did not<br />send them to someone else!  This proves that every meat company selling on the internet should be required to be USDA inspected. This package had absolutely no<br />food safety precautions at all. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DTMLTK">New York Prime Meat USDA Prime 21 Day Aged Beef Loin Filet Mignon Steak, 1-1/2-inch thick, 2-Count, 10-Ounce Packaged in Film & Freezer Paper</a>
