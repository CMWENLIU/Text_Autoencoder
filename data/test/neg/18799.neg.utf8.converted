If these worked at all, it was for less than two months.  I have my doubts about even that, as I watched a couple of small roaches completely ignore the baits before I gave up and killed them.  In any case, it's been about two months, and I just killed the first large roach I've seen since I put these down.  (I've seen plenty of small ones, though.)<br /><br />I previously used Combat baits and was more convinced they actually did something for the three months mentioned on the box.
