I agree with the Lady that explains the not-so-sweet taste! There is little to-no taste. I rated so low because theese are So Hard, you cant eat them! And I love Bannana Chips! My Rating says it all. This is the only low rating I have givin. But I dont want anyone to get Stuck with a box of theese, Like me. (Anyone have any ideas on 'cooking' with my hard chips??...They are going to waste!)
