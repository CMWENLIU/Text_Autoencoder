I bought this Marzipan to use at my daughters' wedding.  It was so dry and hard that it took me a long time to get it out of the can.  I tried to knead it, but was only able to knead the very center portion as the rest was so dry and hard that I could not move it. I tasted it and had to spit it out. It was horrible. I had a friend, who is a professional baker, look at it and taste it.  She had to spit it out, as well.  It just was not edible and I was not able to use it. I had to throw the entire can in the garbage and come up with a replacement at the last minute.  I would never waste my money on this again. I do not recommend anyone buy this product. I love marzipan, but this was horrible.
