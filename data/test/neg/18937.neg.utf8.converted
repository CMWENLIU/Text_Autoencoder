I like Dogswell products and have purchased the "Vitality" Chicken Chews before (which are actually chewy). But these sweet potato chews are hard as a rock! I seriously couldn't even chew them, it was like biting a lolipop or jawbreaker - way too hard.  My dog and my roomie's dog didn't care for them one bit.  I purchased them because they were on sale (deeply discounted) and now I know why....<br /><br />Buy other Dogswell Chews, just not these sweet potato ones...
