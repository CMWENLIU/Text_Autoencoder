Do not buy this salt if you're planning on putting it in a grinder. I wish I had listened to other reviews.  This salt is wet, wet, wet.  It gummed up my grinder and would not go through it at all.  I don't know if the grinder will ever work again or if I'll be able to get this mush out of it.<br /><br />This is not rock salt.  It is a slightly coarse ground, wet mess.  It would be suitable for snail prevention or other such tasks.  The flavor is above average, but it is simply not useable for grinders or cooking.
