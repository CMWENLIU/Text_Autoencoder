They smell HORRIBLE!  I bought a bag of these, expecting them to smell like chicken but instead I got a huge whiff of some gross chemical smell.  I didn't even give them to my dogs because I felt like the smell was just too wrong.  Call me crazy but "natural" dog treats shouldn't smell like chemicals at all.  Plus, what the heck are all of the chemical names at the end of the ingredients list?  Doesn't sound very natural to me.<br /><br />I think I'll be sticking with Natural Pups since their treats actually smell like the flavors they're supposed to be and they're way healthier.
