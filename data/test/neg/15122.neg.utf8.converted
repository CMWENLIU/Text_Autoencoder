My kids have been drinking this milk for years in their lunches and loved it.  We bought it by the 18-pack in both chocolate and vanilla.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the most recent shipment was flatly refused by my kids who are not horribly picky.  They wanted me to throw 2 cases out!<br /><br />The worse news is that after checking with Horizon Dairy to see if we got a bad batch, we found out they CHANGED THE FORMULA!  After confirming our UPC numbers, etc. this is the response we received in March of 2011:<br /><br />"Thank you for your recent e-mail to Horizon Organic
