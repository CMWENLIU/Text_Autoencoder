I really like the flavor of this coffee.  In fact it is one of my favorite varieties for the Keurig brewer.  It really is bold without being bitter.  Unfortunately, the quality of the K-Cups that this coffee arrived in are unacceptable. Having brewed about 30 cups of this coffee, we have had 9 cups that backed up and overflowed.  About half way through the brewing process, the flow of coffee out the bottom slows down, then stops, then the coffee starts "erupting" out the sides of the K-cup holder.  This machine is located in an office and is used by many people with many different brands/varieties of K-cups.  This is the only kind of K-cup that clogs like this. I really love the flavor, but the lack of quality with regard to the K-cup is unacceptable.
