This used to be the only cat food my 2 cats would eat.  I ordered this from Amazon, because I was having trouble finding it in the supermarket.  Harmony must have changed the ingredients.  Now my cats won't eat it.  I would check with harmony to see what has changed before ordering this.  The old cans had a goldtone top, and that is the formula my cats loved.  The new cans which I am convinced has been changed, has a silvertone top.  Very disappointing.
