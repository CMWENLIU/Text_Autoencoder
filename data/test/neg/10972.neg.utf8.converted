It arrived quickly, despite the fact that I live in an apartment and UPS won't leave the package... The plant was in good shape, and I gave it as a gift to my grandma who loves plants.<br /><br />However, though she followed the care directions the tree died quickly. So at least she has a pretty pot to grow something else in. The grass sprout thing is still alive.<br /><br />Bottom line: I wouldn't buy it again.
