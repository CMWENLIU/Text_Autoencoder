These tomatoes are domestically grown in CA. To the person who said that they didn't know how anyone can tell where they're from, read the product description written by the manufacturer. It says "these are domestically grown tomatoes...", it also says "grown in California" right on the label.<br /><br />To the person who said he had tasted them, and referred to another reviewers comments and said that person had not tasted them, please reread the review. He clearly states that he had tasted them.<br /><br />As for me, I have cooked with these many times, because they were on sale at my local Safeway. They are definitely NOT the real deal! They do not look like, nor taste like real San Marzano tomatoes grown in Italy- which I have tasted and cooked with many times. They taste like any other run of the mill American grocery store brand. I agree with the 1st reviewer that their labels are false advertising, and the price they charge on Amazon is highway robbery! $4.50 + shipping- ouch! I paid about $1 per 28 oz. can (on sale) at my local market. Save your time and money- if you are looking for the real deal, this is not it. There are websites that sell nothing but real Italian products, grown in Italy, and stamped with the official Italian DOP seal.<br /><br />Nancy
