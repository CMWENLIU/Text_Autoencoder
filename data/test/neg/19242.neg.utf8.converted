This product itself is fabulous; creamy  with a good taste. However, the price plus shipping is greed, pure and simple. Shame on the seller and shame on Amazon for not policing the retailers who chose to take advantage of the consumer. BTW this comes in a plastic bag that you can seal, The problem is that the bag can split at the seams. The box was a much better package.
