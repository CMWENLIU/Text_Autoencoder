What a disappointment! BUYERS BEWARE!!!!<br /><br />I just got this product and it's definitely not HARISSA!<br /><br />I am Moroccan, born and raised and I know a thing or two about Moroccan food.<br /><br />HARISSA is a Tunisian hot chili sauce commonly eaten in North Africa.<br />Main ingredients are bird's eye chili peppers, Serrano peppers and other hot peppers , garlic, olive oil and SPICES such as coriander, cumin or caraway.<br />HARISSA is a very popular and standard condiment of North African cuisine (mostly Algeria and Tunisia) and only recently made inroads into Morocco according to Morocco food expert Paula Wolfert.<br /><br />Moroccan cuisine has been subject to Berber, Moorish, Mediterranean, and Arab influences and a wide variety of SPICES  are used by Moroccans to create delicious dishes.<br /><br />Here are the most important spices you will frequently encounter in Moroccan cooking:<br /><br />- karfa (cinnamon)<br /><br />- kamoun (cumin)<br /><br />- kharkoum (turmeric)<br /><br />- skinjbir (ginger)<br /><br />- libzar (pepper)<br /><br />- tahmira (paprika)<br /><br />- anise seeds<br /><br />- sesame seeds<br /><br />- qesbour (coriander)<br /><br />- zaafran beldi (saffron)<br /><br />- ras el hanout<br /><br />That said,  WHAT MAKES THIS HOT PEPPER SAUCE MOROCCAN? WHAT MAKES IT TRADITIONAL?<br /><br />Let's look at the ingredients list, shall we?<br /><br />`'Red Chili Pepper, Red Bell Pepper, Garlic, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Vinegar, Salt''.<br /><br />I don't see anything that says `'Moroccan'', do you?<br /><br />And what about the `'traditional'' part?!!!<br />Very confusing and misleading.<br /><br /> I can't say that a lot of thought was put in the recipe.<br /><br />Dear fellow foodies and/or avid cooks, If you want to prepare foods with AUTHENTIC MOROCCAN flavors please do yourself a favor: look ELSEWHERE!<br /><br />This is a plain, ordinary hot pepper sauce. And not that cheap.<br /><br />Shame on this company for selling this hot pepper sauce under the name Harissa. Shame shame shame.
