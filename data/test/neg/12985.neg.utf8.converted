These are complete crap.  They are not the beef tendons they used to be, or that shown in the picture on amazon.  What I received is some kind of dried out, pressed flat, jerky like wafers.  Also the label in the picture on amazon says "100 percent natural" but the label on the package I received says "premium quality".  What I received is junk that I'm afraid to even feed my dog.
