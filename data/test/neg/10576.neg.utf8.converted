These individual nutella packets are going to be great for school lunches, but I was very disappointed with how they arrived.  I expected them to come in a case like the one pictured, and instead received them crammed into a flat rate mailing envelope, with several of the packets squashed.  I was charged 10.88 in shipping fees.  Not cool.
