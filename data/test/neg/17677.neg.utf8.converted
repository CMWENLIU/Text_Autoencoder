Nope, do not let this picture -- baby tears plant, 4" pot Helxine -- seduce you into buying it.  I got a plant whose growth was parallel to the rim of the planter, perhaps 1/16 of an inch in height, definitely  not healthily overflowing as in the picture, but I will not return the plant and pay another $6.00 in postage to get rid of it. I ot burnt and I have learned, and maybe you can learn from my mistake.
