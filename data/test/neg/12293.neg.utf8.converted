Dabur Amla Hair Oil 300ml<br />I do NOT recommend this product at all.  It smells AWFUL and I didn't notice any difference in the feeling or behavior of my hair after leaving it on overnight and then conditioning the next day.  I'm not even sure that it's all that authentic because the ingredients on the bottle don't list any that are compelling.<br />Since trying this item, I have switched to Extra Virgin Olive Oil from my kitchen cabinet, used the same protocol for treating my hair and have noticed a softer quality in my hair as a result.<br />Don't waste the time or money ordering this product.  Go to an Indian market and choose from more authentic products.
