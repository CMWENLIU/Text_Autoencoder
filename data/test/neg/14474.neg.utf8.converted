the chocolate arrives fast enough, regretably this is the only thing good about this purchase.<br /><br />condition is bad.  pieces are smallish and many look chipped and rough, probably due to the transportation process.  some are wrapped in cheap looking red and green foils.  they also taste a bit stale.  i don't know how long they have stayed in the warehouse.<br /><br />taste is disappointing.  predominate taste is sugar--with a gritty texture, not the smooth, rich taste expected of a luxury chocolate.<br /><br />two thumbs down.  not worth the money at all.
