Okay, actually, half this product isn't bad. The mild beef sausages are tasty little pencils, if greasy. The "cheese", on the other hand, is like pastel crayons, having the magical property of being a stick of wax that powders and crumbles when you have the misfortune to bite it. It's really disgusting and tastes a little like ear wax.
