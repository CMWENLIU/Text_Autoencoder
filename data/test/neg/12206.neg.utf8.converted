This product states 100% Natural. Which it's not, because it has Wheat Flour and Salt as a additive, or preservative. It's not hydrated but slow-baked/roasted and when product like this is cooked like this it looses all it's nutrients. It's also made in China, which should tell you something. If you also look on the label it has a stamp on it that this product has been treated with "Irradiation!"...yikes, you want to feed this to your pet?...I think not.
