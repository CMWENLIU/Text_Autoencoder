I didn't expect this cereal to taste very good, so I wasn't surprised when it didn't. If you want that extra kick of protein, I suggest mixing it half and half with a better tasting cereal. The protein did leave me feeling more full throughout the morning, but I took no pleasure in eating it. To make matters worse, the flakes are very thick and large, which makes them even harder to swallow. If you're going to make a bad tasting flake cereal, please have the courtesy to make the flakes smaller so they don't scrape my throat while I'm gagging on them. For some people, the ends justify the means. If you are one of these people, go ahead and buy it. I like a little more flavor in the morning, so I don't think I'll be buying it again.
