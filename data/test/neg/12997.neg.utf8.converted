My wife is from the Philippines and loves to cook the foods that she grew up with (see for example <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9625932453">Food of the Philippines</a>). It is often difficult to get certain raw ingredients here in the U.S., even from specialty stores. Recently when she was planning to bake some sweets that use casava flour, we could not find the flour locally and so we went to Amazon to see if it was available. We found it and immediately ordered two pounds of the flour from this supplier, because we needed it quickly.<br /><br />This flour is not equivalent to what she is used to using from her hometown. The particular recipe that she used it for was "kutsinta", which in the above cookbook has been adapted to use rice flour and is translated as "brown rice cake". The recipe that my wife uses is the one that she grew up with and is used locally in the Philippines, which requires casava flour.<br /><br />When cooked using this casava flour, the kutsinta sweets turned out "cloudy" rather than "clear", and the texture was also not correct. So unfortunately this casava flour is not equivalent to what is needed in order to make her authentic recipe come out correct, at least not for this example. My wife was sceptical about this flour being suitable as soon as she saw it, because the color and texture was also not the same as what she was used to, but she did give it a try.<br /><br />Additionally and with respect to the price being charged here on Amazon, I have since done some further checking, which I should have done before purchasing it in the first place. I easily determined that the producer of this flour, Barry Farms, has this same exact product available for sale from their own website. Their price is about one third of the price we paid on Amazon from the seller who is distributing it here.<br /><br />So if you want to try this for yourself, I really recommend that at least you go to Barry Farms website and purchase it directly from them, and save yourself some money.<br /><br />Since the flour is not suitable for what we needed, and since the price for it is also unreasonable, I do not see how I could in good conscience recommend purchasing this product on Amazon.<br /><br />We will continue to look for a good source of casava flour here in the U.S. If we do find someplace better, I will amend this review to provide that information as well.<br /><br />UPDATE September, 2012: I noticed that the seller here on Amazon has reduced their price slightly from what it was when I purchased this flour in February. It is still over twice what you will pay if you purchase directly from Barry Farms, though!<br /><br />Caveat emptor!
