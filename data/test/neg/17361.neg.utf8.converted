I was training my maltese puppies, using chicken liver treats, every time i would throw the ball, they would bring he ball back for a chicken liver treat. I ran out of the chicken liver, so i opened the salmon.  They got he ball  and i gave hm salmon. They ate it the first time after smelling it or a while, the second time they got the ball they did not touch thebtreat. I have tried 3 othr times, and they hate this stuff.<br />I will not buy or recommend this product for Maltese
