I bought this case of Gluten-Free Pantry Country French Bread mix because I have not had french bread in a long, long time.  I know french bread and this, ladies and gentlemen, is not french bread.  If made per the instructions it is a lot more like a loaf of biscuit.<br /><br />The bad part is that it is nothing remotely like french bread.  The good part is that if formed right, it makes pretty good biscuits.  Really, they are pretty good biscuits.  I make drop biscuits and put an egg ring around them to keep them from spreading too much.  Then I bake them on a pan (I only make a quarter of the mix at a time...the biscuits do not store well once cooked) and presto, biscuits.<br /><br />Calling it french bread is like calling a cat a dog.<br /><br />Richard
