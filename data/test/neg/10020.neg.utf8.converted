After much anticipation I ordered the three main Jamon Ham products:  Iberico de Bellota, Iberico de Bellota Paleta, & Jamon Serrano.<br /><br />Being used to Proscuitto (Parma) and loving it by itself and in many dishes, I had high expectations.  If you haven't had good proscuitto, then there isn't really anything to compare the Jamon product to.  The chopped stuff at your everyday grocery store is good for a little salty proscuitto like flavor in dishes but not for slices just to enjoy.<br /><br />I understand why people think Jamon is awesome, but the melting in your mouth with extreme grease/fat over your lips and fingers really sets home the fat content more than that Kobe Beef flavor burst and easier swallow.<br /><br />In the high end Jamon, you can really taste the acorns in the meat.  The nuttiness really comes through and it is very good.  The Iberico Paleta -> you don't get the nuttiness and it's a little tougher.  The Serrano really has much more meat and I preferred the flavor profile on it more than the other two.<br /><br />While I would rate the Iberico Bellato around 4 out of 5 stars (minus 1 for the heavy greasy feeling and fat), the price is ridiculous.  I would say it would be appropriately priced around $15-25/pound.  Given that is 4-6x lower than it's actual price, I had to take at least 2 stars from the product.<br /><br />You're better off with the SM Proscuitto.  It's delicious and you get 4x the amount without the heavy grease.
