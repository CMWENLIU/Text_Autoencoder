I received this K cup as part of an introductory sampler and I'm genuinely grateful. Having tried it, I am inoculated against spending actual money on this brand.<br /><br />The promotional materials for this brand bruit that Timothy's is sold all over Canada. Never having been there, I cannot speak for the veracity of the assertion. I can, however, suggest that if it IS true, and if decaf is any substantial part of Timothy's sales, then they are purveying decaf to people who don't much like coffee. This stuff is, in a word, awful. It bears only the most meager resemblance to actual coffee such as one might brew for oneself at home or get at a decent fast food chain on the road.<br /><br />Since my K cup coffeemaker came with a do-it-yourself insert, I can attest the fact that a good cup of decaf IS possible. I don't know if the failure of this module is because of the roast itself, or because the boys in Accounting convinced the folks in Production that they could save .000001 cents per unit by shorting on the amount of grind. Either way, this Timothy's World K cup is a profound failure, not even yielding the aroma of coffee, let alone anything even taxonomically resembling the flavor of it.<br /><br />Purchase this awful stuff only if the flavor profile you seek is that of "faintly tinted hot tap water."
