The description of this product is misleading - this fructose does NOT come from fruit but from a vegetable -CORN!  If you are following the Sugarbusters diet or diabetic in general - this will cause a sugar level issue - from the corn (starch converting to sugar) and the fructose together! Big problem!  There is nothing in online description to indicate this difference.  Found it on side panel of product when received.  The "100% granules" is misleading too - making it look like a natural product - it is not derived from 100% fruit sugar.  Do not buy if you are following a low-glycemic index diet.  Coordinating with Amazon to return.
