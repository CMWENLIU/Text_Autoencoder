I thought this would be an interesting drink, but it tasted too much like a Jolly Rancher candy. It's very sweet, and the 8.3 oz can contains 140 calories. Everything is natural in this beverage, and yet it somehow didn't taste natural to me. I think this is due to its sweetness. If you like a sweeter beverage, you might like this product much more than I did. I was thinking the flavor would have been more subtle, but this was pretty assertive for my tastes.
