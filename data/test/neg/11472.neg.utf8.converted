I have never had a worse experience with delivered flowers.<br /><br />It started out when placing the order...  The previous times I ordered flowers through Amazon, I was given options to select the delivery date, as well as what to say on the card.  This vendor had no such options.  During the order process I was informed it would take 1 to 3 business days.  Since I was ordering in advance, 1 to 3 days was enough.  3 days would be on-time, and one day would make my wife happy as she would get to enjoy them for the whole week...<br /><br />4 days after placing the order, the tracking status shows that the delivery estimate was changed to 2 to 10 days.  Worse, the tracking info indicated the shipper (fedex) was holding the order back, but I could go pick it up if I wanted.  Keep in mind that I'm shipping it to an office building that gets fed-ex shipments daily.  Apparently they shipped with a super-low-priority option allowing the shipper to delay the shipment.<br /><br />Sure, I could go pick them up 35 miles away at the FedEx warehouse, and drive to the opposite side of town to deliver them myself...  Of course the reason I ordered delivered flowers was because I wanted to pay someone else to deliver them for me.  I wouldn't mail-order flowers that I can buy at the grocery store, if I planned to deliver them myself.<br /><br />So here I sit, a week after I placed the order, wondering if they might be delivered soon...  With amazon telling me that, for sure, they will be there by next week.<br /><br />So what kind of condition will roses be in after a week and a half being tossed around in a cardboard box?  And I paid for this?<br /><br />There are 123 florists in this town, and they all are affiliated with 1 or more florist delivery networks.  So getting flowers delivered fresh from a florist should never need to involve Fed-ex.  But I guess I get what I paid for, if I wanted real service, I should have paid a real florist for real florist service (or do it myself).<br /><br />I'm sure that my bad experience is partially because of my own high expectations from having used flower services for the last 20 years, always getting next day (or same day) delivery of my orders.  The last time Amazon forced me into 2-day delivery expectations, which was ok as that was explained up-front and I got exactly that.<br /><br />But this time I was promised 1-3 days before I was charged, then promised 2-10 days after it was too late to make a different choice.  That is called bait and switch.  Perhaps the delivery estimate provided by Amazon is not based on the original representation in the shopping card, but that wouldn't matter if the item had arrived on time.  Perhaps it is all FedEx's fault...  But that is what is being sold, so the delivery service is part of what is being sold...  So even if the seller is blame-free for my poor experience, it is the sum of my experience<br />with the vendor AND the delivery service that counts toward my ability to enjoy my purchase.<br /><br />I would suggest avoiding this vendor.  Use vendors that are part of a reputable florist network.
