I keep getting Amazon emails with these coins listed - presumably because I was recently searching for Chocolate Gold Coins to use in my wedding. The problem I have is that the title blatantly states that these coins are "Only $0.09 Each!" which is a blatant lie no matter how you swing it. Let's do the math, currently a bag of 465 coins is listed at about $70.00. Assuming that is the gross cost of the product, $70.00 divided by 465 coins is just a fraction of a cent over $0.15/coin. But wait - the seller also charges a grossly inappropriate $18.95 to ship the coins. This brings the total for the entire bag to $88.95 or a fraction of a cent over $0.19/coin - which is MORE THAN DOUBLE THE PRICE that "Honest Foods" is advertising in the product's title and description.<br /><br />Honest? I think not. I'll buy my coins from someone who doesn't lie to my face.
