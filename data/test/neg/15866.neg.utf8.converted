I received a large gift basket directly from this company. The basket is filled with large unsealed boxes filled with very little food.  This is disappointing but pales incomparision to the box I opened only to find a half filled open bag.  I wrote to the company asking if they reship returns or could it just have been a hungary employee.  They did not answer and just offered to send the single box that I found the opened package.  They advised us to discard the product as if the entire basket did not go into the garbage as soon as we discovered the tampered product.  This company is unsafe beware!
