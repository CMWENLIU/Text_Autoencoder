Even though Senseo states on each package these pods can be used on all pod coffee makers, this is false. These pods are made for 70 mm diameter pod coffee makers.  My coffee maker takes 50 mm diameter pods so the Senseo pods cannot be used on my machine.  The best pods that I can use are the ones made by Starbucks.<br /><br />Amazon will not allow these to be returned because I had to open one of the packages to find out the diameter was too large to be used in my pod coffeemaker. Nowhere in the description of the Sensio pods did it mention their diameter.<br /><br />On all of the coffee pod products, Amazon should require the diameter of the pods to be specified.
