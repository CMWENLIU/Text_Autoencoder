Bella is not a really picky eater. She loves and eats Soulstic canned foods in gelee' and also loves Weruva Marbella Paella. The Tiki cat she walked away from and I could not say I blamed her. The tuna (all of them) was a nasty red dead color and like mash. I guess she is not used to food that looks like or smells like that. Soulstic foods have mostly white meat tuna in chunks not mush, and Weruva is also chunks. Sorry Tiki cat Bella gives you a paws down!<br />Tiki cat King Kamehameha although says it is a variety, however it is mostly tuna flavors, they are juicy and mushy, not chunky and gelled. They do not look appealing.
