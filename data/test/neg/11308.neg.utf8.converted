I guess I need to chalk this one up to buyer beware.<br /><br />I was pretty upset when these steaks arrived at what was an unsafe handling temperature.<br /><br />I had no idea how long they had been in this state, so they were unsafe to eat. In the trash can with em.<br /><br />I also thought the description was worded rather poorly. It is only 18 ounces / 3/4" thick if you stack them together (maybe not even then.)<br /><br />I weighed one for fun on the food scale own and it rang in at 7.5 ounces. I would say they were 1/4" thick each, if that,<br /><br />It's back to Whole Foods with me
