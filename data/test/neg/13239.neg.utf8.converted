I purchased 6 pounds of these peanuts based upon reviews here on Amazon. I guess I was one of the unlucky customers because our bags were full of stale peanuts that even the heavy glaze of butter toffee could not disguise. Some were so bad, I had to spit them out; and that was a regular experience, sorry to say. To Amazon's credit, my purchase money was quickly refunded, so at least I didn't suffer a monetary loss on top of the bitter experience. If you order them, I wish you better luck than I had. I won't be trying them again.
