I *really* don't like saying negative things about ANYthing, let alone products made by a mfr that's been around for a long time- like Hershey's.  But, I honestly must say I have found this product virtually unusable.<br /><br />I work for a company where some of the folks add chocolate squirts to their coffee.  So, we go thru a fair amt of chocolate syrup- and thus I have purchased, over 6-9 months, about 3 of the 6-bottle cases of this.  Regrettably, each has been the same- i.e. I'm not just judging the product based on one possibly bad case, or batch.<br /><br />I *do* get a sense of chocolate from this-  !!BUT!! the accompanying odd taste- and the persistent aftertaste, is quite bad.  I've literally mixed this with milk- which has been GOOD milk, and several times not been able to force myself to drink the whole glass- I've had to pour it out- the non-chocolate odd chemical taste of the syrup- EVEN when mixed with milk- was THAT bad.<br /><br />Apparently if you only use a little bit- like maybe a small shot in a cup of coffee- you MIGHT not notice anything different.  But, if you try to taste this directly, or mix it with a reasonably lightly flavored substance- like milk, or water, or, perhaps, cake or cookie mix, I can virtually *guarantee* it will not taste the same to you- it has a VERY odd chemical, sour, bitter, or SOMEthing taste, IMO.<br /><br />Perhaps, if this is the ONLY type of syrup you can use, due to diabetes requirements, or something, you might try it.  However, I would strongly recommend that you look through & try OTHER products first- and use this particular "sugar-free" one as a last resort.  Or, if you're determined to try it, go out & find a single bottle in your local store- and try that.  Then, if you *still* like it, perhaps go ahead and buy a case.<br /><br />However, apart from a very special need, I can't imagine why someone would use this.<br /><br />I do *not* think, for example, that even an average person who's concerned about calories, would use THIS.  In fact, *I* am concerned about calories- which is why I tried using this, and stuck with it for so long.  I almost *always* use the low-calorie varieties of foods.  And, in ten-plus years, I have rarely found any problems in doing that- I'm a pretty tolerant person, taste-wise.<br /><br />However, this is one product that I simply can NOT force myself to use anymore- I'm shifting to Hershey's "low-fat" version of the syrup.<br /><br />This is DEFINITELY not the product for me- AND, looking at other reviews, it looks like I'm not the ONLY one who thinks this has a VERY unusual side-taste & aftertaste.
