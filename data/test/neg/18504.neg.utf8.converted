I realy wish I had been able to read the entire ingredients before purchasing. I was so excited to get the no-stir sunbutter, however I was upset when I recived them and learned that it contains palm oil to prevent separation. The use of palm oil is distroying forests all over world, mainly in Indonisia. This is displacing people and killing wild animals. One such animal is the Orangutan, which is facing extinction due to the destruction of habitat for palm oil plantations. I should have gone to the sunbutter home page and found out the ingredients, as I am not able to return this product. I am sure it tastes great, I love the regular stuff. However I will not be albe to eat this knowing what is happening on the other side of the earth.
