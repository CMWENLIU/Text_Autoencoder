I have to disagree that this is the "#1 hot sauce in the South".<br /><br />Maybe certain parts of the south...<br /><br />I have lived my whole life in Texas and had never even heard of "Texas Pete's" until I travelled to D.C. (I think it's made in New Hampshire or something)<br /><br />In Texas, sauces like that are referred to as "Louisiana-sauce" because it's fairly mild, vinegar-based, and uses the cayenne pepper. In Texas we prefer spicier, more chili-based sauces and instead of the cayenne, we tend to favor the Ancho for flavor, the serrano or even habanero for heat and of course the ubiquitous jalapeno.<br /><br />I had a good laugh when I encountered this stuff.<br /><br />For some good hot sauce, try:<br /><br />Valentina<br /><br />Melinda<br /><br />Yucateca (XXX)<br /><br />Herdez<br /><br />in Houston, we have an enormous Vietnamese population, so Sriracha is also very common, even at Mexican Restaurants. We call it "Ketchup"
