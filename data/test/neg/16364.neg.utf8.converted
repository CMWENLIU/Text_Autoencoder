My wife introduced me to this drink.  My favorite are lime and black raspberry flavors.  We bought them at Sam's Club and enjoyed them a lot.  However after about a week consuming 2 per day I noticed that I had begun to feel very depressed and had suicidal thoughts.  I do not take any medication at all and I started to see what is it that I have been consuming lately outside of my routine.  The only thing different was the Sparkling Ice drink.  So, I did not share this with my wife but I stopped consuming it to see if these feeling would go away.  WOW. They stopped.  I have not had another since.  It has been 2 months and no depression here.  I feel great.  So, out of the blue I shared with the wife about my weird feelings.  To my surprise she told me that she has been feeling the same since she started to drink this beverage.  I feel weird about sharing, but I wanted to see if any other people felt the same.  My wife cannot quit them.  They are good indeed however for me did not work right.  I shared my story with a local distributor and he laughed at me.  Okay maybe I am crazy.
