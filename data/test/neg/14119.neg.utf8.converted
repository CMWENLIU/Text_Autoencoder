These were okay. I didn't like that they weren't presliced. They were VERY thick & heavy. My daughter liked them for the novelty of eating a bun again... but finished the hotdog by itsself after trying half of this.. (She threw the rest away.) You have to microwave or cook these first. They were more trouble than they were worth.<br /><br />I wish they'd make them with the same recipe as their "light" white rice bread loaf... they'd probably be really good...
