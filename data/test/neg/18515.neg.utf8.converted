I love the Zico coconut water in the little Tetra Pak boxes. It's my favorite drink. I should have read the reviews for the Zico in the plastic bottles, but it never occurred to me that the same brand could be so different. This isn't even close to the same taste. It's disgusting. I can't even describe how bad it is. Something like liquid plastic flavor with slight fermentation. AWFUL! Please do not order this product if you think you like Zico coconut water in the Tetra Paks. If anyone tried this they would think coconut water is the most vile substance on earth.
