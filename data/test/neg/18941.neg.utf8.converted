I had been looking for a low carb chocolate sauce for dipping fruit but was under no illusion that a no calorie chocolate sauce would be as good as a homemade ganache. I decided to keep an open mind.<br /><br />I wish I hadn't. This was the most disgusting stuff known to mankind. It actually took me back to high school chemistry lab when we created the fake banana scent out of something that smelled like sweaty feet and baby vomit (butyric acid). The previous reviewer mentioned a chemical taste and this is it. It tastes like it was manufactured in a lab, which it very likely is.<br /><br />Next time I will take the time, chocolate, stevia and cream and make my own. At least I know what I am eating and it will really taste like chocolate.
