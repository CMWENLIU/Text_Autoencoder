The hemp bag is well constructed and easy to use. The problem I had was that my sprouts (Mung Bean) stayed incredibly small.  I am sprouting beans from the same batch in a mason jar and by day two, their size is more than twice that of day seven in the bag.  Both batches were rinsed on the same schedule.  The jar is harder to drain, but given the difference in the end product, I think it is worth the extra work.  I haven't tried the lentils or the peas yet.
