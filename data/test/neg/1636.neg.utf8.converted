These are NOT true Cross-Pack sardines, and they are Scottish, not Norwegian.<br />These are very large sardines with the front 1/3 cut-off, so they'd fit in the tin cross-wise.<br />I have eaten hundreds of 2-layer tins from Season and King Oscar, and these are clearly inferior.<br />Cross-Pack is supposed to be the finest, rarest grade - these aren't that.<br />If you see these in a store, read the back label carefully!<br />Season used to be a good brand - what a shame.
