There is no comparison to the real thing.  I purchased a Kaiffir Lime Tree online.  Sorry, but I don't know the web address; however, you can Google it.  The tree cost me about $40.  When I got the tree in the mail, it was only about six inches tall.  I put it in a sunny corner about two years ago and it grew like crazy.  Now, it's almost four feet tall.  Get yourself a big container and plenty of potting soil, and tou'll will have Kaffir lime leaves for a lifetime.
