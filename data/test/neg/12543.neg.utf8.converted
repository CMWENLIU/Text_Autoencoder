I originally bought these at costco and loved that they were fresh and big pieces and my puppy ate them up, but when I got my package from you, the bag had a cut in it and the treats were not only puny, they were dry. It was disappointing. The price was good, but I thought I would be getting the same product.<br />The reason I ended up ordering was because I had moved to a new state and this costco didn't have them...
