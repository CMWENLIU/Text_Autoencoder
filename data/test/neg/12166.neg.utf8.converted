I used the thermometer about 7 or 8 times and it stopped working.  I have seen several reviews complaining that the probe fails so I'm hoping that's the problem.<br /><br />Update 2/27/08: I ordered a new probe from Brookstone for $25 (incl. shipping) and it is a much sturdier design than the original.  I assume they were getting a lot of complaints and returns so they redesigned it.  So far the new probe is working fine.  Interesting to note, I gave a negative review of this product on their web site and they never published it, although they sent me a thank you note for my review.
