We, too, are using more and more veggie broth and bouillon these days, so, when several reviewers commented it was nice to have the 8-oz size to drink right out of the box, we thought, hey, portion-control, great idea!  Not really so great, as it turns out.  We probably WILL use the remainder as reviewers also suggested to flavor rices, couscous etc. where you don't need a whole quart and the smaller size is convenient.  But the taste, on its own, just isn't too pleasant.  My husband and I tried them  separately on the same day.  I was surprised how awful mine tasted but resolved not to say anything in case he liked his.  When he got home, I asked how was the wonderful new broth, and he said "AWFUL!".  So that was that.<br /><br />Incidentally, if you are looking for two absolutely great-tasting vegetable broths (both of which my husband will drink up all by himself, right from the box, all 32-oz.!), try these:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029TJRE0">Wolfgang Puck All Natural Vegetable Cooking Stock, 32-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> -- fabulous for drinking and cooking -- use in place of beef or chicken broth, too (and just available again on subscribe-and-save).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTE08G">Pacific Natural Foods Mushroom, 32-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a> -- extraordinary -- the broth par excellence for mushroom soup, but great for absolutely anything -- world class (though currently out of stock -- should be available again soon).<br /><br />Hope this helps.  So sorry to have to give a poor report about the 8-oz. organic vegetable product from Pacific Natural Foods, which makes the other product we love so much...  :(
