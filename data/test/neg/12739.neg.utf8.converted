I was hoping to use this as a lightweight substitute for some of the cheddar cheese I carry on backpacking trips. It turns out to be poorly suited for that purpose--didn't mix into the food easily, didn't taste like cheese, and didn't feel satisfying to eat like a slice of cheese. Unless I find someone to give it to, I'll end up throwing it away.
