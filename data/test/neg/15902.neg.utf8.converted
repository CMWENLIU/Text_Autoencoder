I have been subscribing to this and other Kind products for over a year now, and have noticed that the bars are getting smaller and smaller, but the price keeps creeping up.<br /><br />It have become almost a game when the bars arrive: How much smaller are the bars going to be since the previous consignment of 3 months ago?  Maybe I should keep one from each shipment and compare its length when the next arrives.<br /><br />Of course the wrapper remains the same size, and that just adds to the fun.  I wonder if the bar will ever reduce to half the wrapper size.<br /><br />Apart from all this, the quality of the bars themselves has remained consistent, but the freshness varies from shipment to shipment.
