I though since this was "50%" of the regular price, that I was getting a good deal...  Such a joke for $15.00 plus shipping.  They send things like one (literally 1) small tootsie roll, and one smartie...  nothing in the the tiny box is at all special, and all is available at any CVS or Walgreens...  So MAD ! ! !
