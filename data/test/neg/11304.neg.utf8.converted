My pug gnawed through half a piece in 20 minutes and I pulled the rest of it away from him to save for another day.  It would not last all that long in my opinion, but I can live with that.  However, this stuff made him really sick.  The morning after he ate this chew, he wasn't all that interested in his regular food, but he ate it.  He then refused to eat his afternoon meal.  By the evening he still seemed uneasy about eating, but he ate because he was hungry I presume.  3AM that night, he threw up the entire day's food, completely undigested.  That scare resulted in $350 in vet bills as I had visions of Pancreatitis and what not.  Thankfully it wasn't something that serious and I nursed him back to health on a bland diet.  But this chew clearly did not sit well with him.  It might work for other dogs, but do keep in mind this is a dairy product and not a meat product.
