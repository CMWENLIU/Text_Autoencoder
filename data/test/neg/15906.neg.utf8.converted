For those on a restricted diet or concerned about what you are ingesting, be aware that egg replacer contains both corn-derived ingredients as well as Carboxymethylcellulose, a chemical thickener that is indigestible and can cause diarrhea, constipation and bloating.  Those concerned about your intake of random chemical compounds should reconsider this particular thickener/rising agent in your baking and cooking.
