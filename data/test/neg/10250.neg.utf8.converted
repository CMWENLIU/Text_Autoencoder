Maybe it's just me , but I have not yet found a powder margarita mix I like . This stuff taste as bad as Margarita shack mix which I had great hopes for too . This stuff taste very very bitter artifical lemon flavored . I don't want lemon flavor , I want a (slightly) sweet lime flavor . I love the Jose Cuervo margarita mix . Island Oasis is wonderful too . The powdered margarita mixes I tasted were all bad . Good design with a good package but bad on my taste buds....yuck !
