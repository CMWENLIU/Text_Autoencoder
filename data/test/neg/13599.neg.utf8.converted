These are about the size of a small rounded lima bean. They have a shocking 3 calories each, twice as many as a lima bean which has about 1 1/2 calories. No, I am not suggesting that you feed your dog lima beans - just making a comparison based on size. I have a Dobie so it would be insulting to offer him just one of these tiny treats. However, because each of these tiny treats has 3 calories I can't give him very many or he would gain too much weight. If you have a teeny tiny dog that would be satisfied with just one of these teeny tiny treats then go for them. If you have a big dog as I do then you can find a much better treat without all the comparable calories.
