For Lapsang Souchong, Twinings' version really isn't that good. The smokey essence is very artificial smelling. There are no ingredients listed on the box or any indication as to what they have used, but it smells like "artificial smoke flavor". VERY pungent odor before even opening the box, almost intolerable when steeping. Should be a softer smoke. Not as strong on the tongue but artificial smoke scent was unbearable. Sorry Twinings. I'd say spend a few bucks more and get a looseleaf variety instead. It'll be a much more "real" Lapsang Souchong experience.
