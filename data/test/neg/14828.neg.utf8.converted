These bars are normally good but the shipment we got was moldy and inedible.  Amazon's customer service was very helpful, agreeing to send a replacement box without requiring us to send the bad bars back.  Unfortunately the second shipment was every bit as moldy as the first.<br /><br />I would not order from this vendor again until they get their act together.
