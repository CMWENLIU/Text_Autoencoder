This product is supposed to help you manage your weight loss by allowing you to eat "noodles" without the carbs and calories in real pasta. The idea is that it fills you up with zero calories because it is made only from plant fiber. I was excited about the idea and didn't mind paying over $2.00 a bag since it's cheaper on Amazon than on the company website. When the noodles got here I followed the cooking directions and seasoned them using my favorite sauce. Then I took the first big bite. This was a mistake! The noodles have a slimey, rubbery texture that kind of pops when you bite into it. All I could imagine was that this is what eating worms must feel like. I managed to choke down the first bite and tried one more time just to be sure, but I just couldn't finish another bite. I was so disappointed. I guess maybe it's my fault for expecting these "noodles" to taste like real pasta. Now I have the other 5 bags just sitting in my pantry. I won't be buying these again.
