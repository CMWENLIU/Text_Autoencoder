I love flavored coffee so thought I would try this.  This has to be the worst tasting coffee I have ever had.  I can't say it even tasted like coffee at all not much less having any type of flavor. Maybe the one I tried had something wrong but now stuck with having to toss out the rest of the box!<br />Very disappointed!  I will stay with my Hazelnut and French Vanilla
