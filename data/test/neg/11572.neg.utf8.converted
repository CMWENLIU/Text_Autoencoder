Since Amazon didn't post the nutritional value of this product, here it is, straight from the back of the label:<br /><br />Serving size - one teaspoon (6 gm):<br />Calories - 10<br />Total fat - 0.5 gm<br />Sodium - 710 mg<br />Total carbohydrate - 1 gm<br />Protein - 1 gm<br /><br />The numbers do not begin to give you an idea of just how salty this stuff is!  If you put a small sample in your mouth, you can feel and taste the individual salt grains.<br /><br />I looked on the back of a can of Morton salt  - 1.5 gm of Morton iodized salt has 590 mg of Sodium, which comes down to 393.33 mg of Sodium per 1 gm of table salt.<br /><br />Which means that this "Better than Bouillon" Beef flavor has 1.8 gm of table salt per 6 gm (teaspoon) serving size,  which means that SALT is the single largest ingredient in this product.<br /><br />The beef flavor is pretty decent, but it is just overwhelmed by the salt.<br /><br />Sorry, but for people that can't take or don't like so much salt in their diet, this stuff won't work.
