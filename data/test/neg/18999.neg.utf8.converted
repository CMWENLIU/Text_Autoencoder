I expected the product to be something entirely different from what I received. The minute I opened the seal to see what it looked like, the smell slapped me dead in my face. The smell was so bad that I ran to wash my hands and I refused to put that in my hair or on my skin. It melted into basically water, as for that part maybe that was expected to happen because it's an oil. On the other hand, the smell I doubt was supposed to be that potent and bad. I will be throwing it away because I cannot use it or give it away to anyone.
