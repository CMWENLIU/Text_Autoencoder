I was sent a small jar of Vegemite by my Australian friend, who was eager for me to experience one of her favorite foods.  If you don't like salty things--which I don't--then this is definitely not a product for you!  A few people tried it--very little of it--and everyone pronounced it disgusting.  Everyone except 86 yr old Gr'ma, who spread it on a cracker, ate it, and proclaimed it "not too tasty but edible".  I think that about sums it up.
