I have ordered countless things from Amazon that say "Pack of 6" in the description.  This time I received one package of applesauce and they told me that since it contains 6 cups that that is the pack of 6.  The only reason that I am not giving this product 0 stars is because Amazon was kind enough to say they would refund my money (who in their right mind would pay over $10 for 1 package of applesauce???).  Buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
