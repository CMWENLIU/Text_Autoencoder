I started to make this last night, I ordered it awhile back, and I read the instructions. Add pumpkin? This is a mix. I bought a mix so I could make pumpkin bread without having to have pumpkin. If I'm going to add pumpkin I may as well use plain flour and make it from scratch. Waste of money for me. If you're the kind of person who hires a maid and then cleans up yourself, or if you buy a dog and then do your own barking, you might like it. I'd rather have a mix that's ready to go with the usual mix-liike ingredients of egg, oil and water.
