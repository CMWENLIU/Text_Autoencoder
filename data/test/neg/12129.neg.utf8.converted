We bought a new bread machine to use this mix. Threw out the old one years ago. I gave this bread a bad review after the 1st loaf. Just made the 4th batch, and this bread is worth at least three and a half stars. Here's what we've learned: All ingredients must be at room temperature. The water and milk should be a bit warmer. Follow the directions carefully. It'll actually smell like you're baking bread in the last hour of the process. On second taste, the bread is pretty good. Most bread depends on what you put on it, and this bread is no different. I like the whipped peanut spread. Another favorite: spreadable butter with cinnamon and a sweetener. I'm coming back for a 2nd order. I'm a bread person, and this fits the bill.
