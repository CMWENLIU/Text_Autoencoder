This product tastes so bad I can't keep it down! Even a half scoop in my smoothies makes them undrinkable. I've tried and tried, can't do it. I don't think Human's are supposed to eat hemp, this is my conclusion. Next they'll make protein out of tree bark or something and tell you how great for you it is. Unfortunately I have to toss the entire thing in the garbage now!
