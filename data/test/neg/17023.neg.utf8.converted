In buying organic canned corn I am making a tradeoff.  I prefer fresh but that means trucking the corn in form where ever and then it would not have that sweet tasting fresh picked.  So this corn is the next best thing, with a clean taste that really suggests fresh.  I put this in with some root vegetables and I taste late summer all over again.
