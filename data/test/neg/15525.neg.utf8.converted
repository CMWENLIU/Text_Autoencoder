I love these chocolate oranges, they have been a tradional stocking stuffer treat in my family for as long as I remember. I ordered 6 of them through Amazon to give as gifts this holiday season. I couldn't help myself, and decided to eat one. I am glad I did, it would have been very embarassing to give the ruined, melted and rehardened mold covered chocolates as a gift. All 6 of them were ruined. I threw a few in the trash in complete disgust before realizing I should try to return them. These were delivered directly from Amazon, not from any of their other suppliers. You could not tell from looking at the packaging that contents were disgusting.
