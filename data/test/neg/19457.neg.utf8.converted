I was pleasantly surprised to see this in the organic section of my local grocer. Bought 2 cans, got home, and was ready to tear my new discovery up!<br /><br />After 1 bite I was ready to throw my bowl in the sink, it was wretched. I took a 2nd bite to make sure I wasn't hallucinating on how the potato taste took over the entire soup. By the 3rd bite, I was done. It was as if the potato sucked up all the spices and left the entire soup bland, its all I could taste besides a hint of the coconut. For a second I thought I was dining at a Luby's restaurant it was so bland.<br /><br />This is not a good substitute to what you can get in a Thai restaurant. I would suggest the following products, of which I would give 4 or 5 stars:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDL1J4">Thai Kitchen Coconut Ginger Soup, 14 Ounces (Pack of 12)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E7WM3W">A Taste of Thai Coconut Ginger Soup Base, 2.1-Ounce Packets (Pack of 12)</a><br />They are more on par with the authentic taste.<br /><br />I would stay clear of this soup. If you still want to try it, I would suggest going to your local grocer and pick up 1 can only and go from there.
