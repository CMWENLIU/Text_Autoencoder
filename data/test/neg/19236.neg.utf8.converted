I used this once. It works.  My hair is stronger, slightly darker and softer.  My concern is what is in this product?  What types of chemicals or pesticides were sprayed on the herbs?  How pure is the oil?  The product does not have an herbal scent but rather a chemical smell.  What is in this?  I worry because the scalp absorbs products readily and these things end up in your bloodstream....that includes any hair dye and shampoos you use.  The ingredients are especially important here because we are supposed to leave this on overnight  thus giving the scalp a lot of exposure to some unknown ingredients.  Keep in mind that the chemicals and pesticides that were banned in the US years ago are shipped to third world nations and frequently re-imported into this country via these types of products.  I don't know what is in this and it may be great but I am concerned about the smell...it is not a natural scent.
