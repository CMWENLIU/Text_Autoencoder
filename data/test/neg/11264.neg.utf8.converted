I really wish Amazon would list ingredients for the food products they sell, whether it's for human or animal consumption.  For some reason I assumed Greenies were natural and it's completely my fault for not looking for the ingredients on another site before buying, but yeah... these are corn-based and thus not very different from the junk you can get in the supermarket.  Oh, except these cost more.  So why should I buy them??  Sure my cat likes them but she seems to like 95% of the treats I give her, plus simply liking them doesn't make them good/healthy for her - much like inhaling a box of Cheez-Its is deliciously naughty for me.<br /><br />Here's the list of ingredients in the salmon Greenies for anyone who cares:<br /><br />Chicken Meal, Ground Brewers Rice, Ground Wheat, Corn Gluten Meal, Poultry Fat (Preserved With Mixed Tocopherols), Sprayed Dried Hydrolyzed Chicken Protein Concentrate, Oat Fiber, Salmon Meal, Natural Chicken Flavor, Vegetable Oil (Preserved With Mixed Tocopherols), Natural Poultry and Fish Flavor, Sodium Gluconate, Brewer's Dried Yeast, Calcium Carbonate, Potassium Chloride, Glucono-delta-lactone, Citric Acid, Choline Chloride, Taurine, Vitamins: [Vitamin A Supplement, D-Activated Animal Sterol (Source of Vitamin D3 Supplement), dl-Alpha Tocopherol Acetate (Source of Vitamin E), Niacin Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Thiamine Mononitrate (Vitamin B1), Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6), Riboflavin Supplement, Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (Source of Vitamin K Activity), Folic Acid, Biotin, Vitamin B12 Supplement], Minerals: [Zinc Proteinate; Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Iron Sulfate, Sodium Selenite, Cobalt Carbonate, Ethylenediamine Dihydriodide], Mixed Tocopherols, Rosemary Extract, DL Methionine, Chlorophyll.
