When we tried Carbons Malted Pancake and Waffle mix, we were pleasantly surprised. The waffles are great, crisp and tasty just like the reviews stated. We always keep the waffle mix in stock. We tried making pancakes with the waffle mix and didn't like the results.<br /><br />That led us to try Robby's buttermilk pancake mix. What a disappointment. Now it could be us as we are used to Aunt Jemima and those are hard to beat. Robby's was definitely saltier, flat and had a strange taste. They seemed to be oily too, which the 1/4 cup of oil might be the cause I guess. We used real buttermilk but milk can be substituted. On the can, it's not recommended.<br /><br />I wouldn't steer anyone away from giving Robby's a try but I wouldn't order a 3-pack just in case.
