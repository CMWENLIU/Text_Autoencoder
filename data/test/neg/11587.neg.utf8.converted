I sent this as a gift and am embarrassed. For $24 I was expecting a full size basket, this thing is tiny and doesn't include more than a few bucks worth of bath products. I could have put this basket together myself for less than $10. It doesn't come with 75% of the pictured items. It is not overstuffed as you see in the picture. I am disappointed  in this purchase and would not recommend this to friends.
