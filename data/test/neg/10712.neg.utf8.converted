Though I wasn't expecting a lot from a soft toy, I was hoping that this would be able to provide a little more relief for my teething pup.  While the bone is easy to use and freeze, the actual 'enjoyment' time is limited and not worth the time it takes to refreeze.  After about 5 minutes, the bone was thawed to the point it was dripping and could easily have holes chewed in the fabric.  When I went to refreeze it, my poor pup didn't understand why I was taking her toy and ended up becoming disinterested very quickly the next time I brought it out.<br /><br />Another issue I hadn't thought about until after freezing is how hard and heavy the bone becomes.  If you have a puppy that likes to 'throw' their toys or pounce on them, this can become a flying projectile.<br /><br />Though it did seem to help with the soreness of teething, and provide a cool treat, the overall experience left a lot to be desired.
