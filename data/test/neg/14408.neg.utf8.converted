I have been ordering these same Navitas Goji Berries for probably 4-5 years on Subscribe and Save, going through a pound every month or two.  I use Goji berries for cooking, snack and tea, and they are great for everything.  The quality and price from Navitas have been very good until the most recent shipment I got.  In the past, the berries are relatively dry but still a little chewy, which I really like.  The most recent batch (shipped to me in March 2012) seemed very damp, and the berries were stuck together in clumps.  When I made tea with it, some berries, which I usually chew and eat, had distinct moldy taste to them.  I examine the bag and found some berries with MOLD growing on them.<br /><br />Very disappointed to the recent QC on this item.  I will not order this item again.
