I don't know how the product can be both too sweet and too watery, but it is!  I bought these on a whim, thinking they would be good for guests and the occasional time I wanted something a little different.  After trying them, I won't even offer these to a guest in my home.<br /><br />Let me preface a little.  I have the original Keurig, with only one cup size, which is about 7 ounces.<br /><br />The consistency is watery.  There is no richness, no creaminess.  At the same time, the resultant brew is extremely sweet.  It doesn't really taste like white chocolate, more like fake vanilla flavoring.  The only way I can describe this is: non-fat milk, mixed with a LOT of hot water and sugar, with a touch vanilla.<br /><br />I am normally a fan of the Timothy's products, but I definitely won't buy this again.  I hate to waste anything, so I've started mixing one cup of this with a cup of Extra Bold coffee.  That way, at least I'm saving some money on coffee creamer.
