Amy and Brians like all canned coco water it is "cooked" coconut water. Unlike tetra paked coco water which is only flash pasteurized for 3 seconds, canned coco water is heated at extremely high temp for long time which cooks out all the vitamins and minerals and electrolytes. So there is no potassium left. Its basically like cheap canned coco water without the added sugar  I like Vita coco best.. ONE is pretty good also.. Zico not so tasty..those are the only ones I have tried.
