I've been waiting 18 days for this to arrive a finally it did. So I immediately check the ingredients on the back to find that the Main Ingredient is NOT Monk Fruit Concentrate, but INULIN (a cheap starchy filler that IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU and can have severe side effects including anaphylactic shock). I urge you to do your homework on inulin.<br /><br />INULIN has shown to not only feed good bacteria in your stomach, but ALSO bad bacteria such as Klebsiella. Recent studies have shown that inulin encourages the growth of Klebsiella, a bacteria implicated in Ankylosing Spondylitis and in increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut). Although Klebsiella is present in the colon of most people, it is held in check by beneficial bacteria and is harmless WITHIN the colon. But once it gets to other areas of the body, Klebsiella becomes a major cause of pneumonia, infections in the urinary tract and in wounds...and sometimes death.<br /><br />This "Lo Han" product also contains silica. Who wants to eat silica...you know, the stuff they also use to make those DO NOT EAT dessicate packets.  Swanson ought to list the ingredients in each of their products, cause Purelo IS FAR FROM PURE. This is deceptive marketing at its worst.<br /><br />Yes, i can return it. But I'm ought my time, the shipping and handling and now the hassle to return it.
