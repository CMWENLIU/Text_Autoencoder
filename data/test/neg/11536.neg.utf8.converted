I squinted on the product picture and made out that sugar was the first ingredient as one would hope in a non-diet drink flavoring. Imagine my frustration when I discovered Splenda and acesulfame potassium among other chemicals I choose not to ingest! Why offer a diet version and non-diet version if everything has nasty artificial sweeteners?
