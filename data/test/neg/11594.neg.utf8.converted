I had the opportunity to try this product when an error was made in my order for Patak's Hot Mango pickles and several jars of these Hot Lime pickles arrived instead.  (The design on the jars is almost identical.)  Since I absolutely love the Patak's hot mangos so much, I opened up one of the jars of hot lime.<br /><br />I wished I hadn't.  The closest thing I can compare the experience of eating spicy pickled lime rinds was eating a chili-dipped citrus wet wipe.  UGH!<br /><br />I suppose that if you have already developed a taste for eating lime rinds AND for really hot stuff, then this may appeal to you.  Otherwise, steer clear.
