I signed up for this item under subscribe and save, and it was offered at a very reasonalbe price.  I first experienced delays with the product that were very annoying.  Then after I received a few shipments the price went up considerably, for the quantity I get, it rose over $20.00.  I have done other subscribe and save items, and have experienced the same problem.  It's very disappointing that Amazon can justify a price increase like this all at one time.
