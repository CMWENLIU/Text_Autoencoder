This product is really good for you healthy wise. But if you cant swallow it, its a waste of fricken money!! it tastes like a tangy spoiled milk to me. I bought this for my sister. She and I have heard its really good for you and did the research to follow it up. I know not everything good for you tastes/smells pleasant, so you just put it down the hatch because you know its what your body needs to run at a optimal level. But I cant do it with this. And Ive drank all sorts of nasty smelling health stuff. I just cant get over the connection to spoiling milk. My sister is drinking the rest of our package. But Ive noticed that shes been drinking hers with lots of ice and she doesnt do it every day because its so awful. We will not be buying this again. I hope this helps some of the customers looking at this product (even if my opinion is of the miniority).
