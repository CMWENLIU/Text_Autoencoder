I've been taking these for over a year, and possibly my chol. has been lowered a little, but who knows really?  I hate taking them, but the alternative is statins. (Another alternative is to ignore cholesterol levels, which may well have nothing to do with heart disease risk if there are no other risk factors, particularly in women.) The new product is greasy, even on the outside, and takes soap to wash off my hands.  It could be the glycerin, but why?  I called the company (there is a toll-free number on the box) to complain about the taste and consistency and ingredients!  They confirmed the reformulation.  They "noted" my comments and sent me a refund for one of the boxes.  It's unlikely anything will change because they just reformulated. The sugar content is the same, but they taste even sweeter than before.  They are granular now, where before they were smooth.  The shape is different but who cares (except they were interested in what I thought about that!).  Mostly why do they have to put all that corn syrup and sugar in (I told them adults were taking this, not children), and why any dye (yellow #5). I urge you to call and complain, they said all the calls had to do with help in finding the product.  When I asked why it was only available online the answer was it's always been that way.
