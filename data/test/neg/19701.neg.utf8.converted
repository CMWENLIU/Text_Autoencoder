Compared to Scarpetta's Puttanesca sauce, and even compared to ordinary supermarket brands, this Pink Pesto is sadly lacking in flavor.  Just because it contains cream is no reason to expect it to be bland.  There is absolutely no hint of the basil flavor which should be front-and-center in a product labeled "pesto".<br />After voting it merely edible the first time, we were able to enjoy it a second time by adding in wine and additional chopped tomatoes.  That turned out delicious.  But hardly acceptable paying a premium price for this sauce, and then having to doctor it up - too bad.
