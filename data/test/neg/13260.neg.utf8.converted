We spent a few weeks in Morocco last year and bought ras el hanout in six different places--in Fez, Marrakesh, Rabat, and Meknes, at spice stands and supermarkets. The name means "head of the shop"--it's a blend of up to 100 spices and every place has a slightly different formula. With all six, we got a mild, aromatic, subtly perfumy seasoning with a tremendous depth of flavor. We love it on steamed lamb shanks. It has an outstanding affinity for whole roast chicken: brush melted butter all over the chicken, then coat generously with ras el hanout and a little salt and pepper. Roast at 365
