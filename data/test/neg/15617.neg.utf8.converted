What a disappointment.  Our crackers just arrived and are not the Wasa sourdough rye crispbread that we loved for decades.  They were fresh and probably wholesome, but they are yeasty and without the tang of sourdough.  They changed the ingredients, according to the list on the package, from whole rye flour, sourdough starter, water, and salt, to "whole grain rye flour, rye flour, water, yeast, dry sourdough, salt."  This is NOT an improvement.
