I was horrified to find I was feeding my twins Corn Maltodextrin* and sugar.  Unless your child is lactose intolerant, consider using Similac Advance or another formula that is made primarily with **milk**.  This product did seem to create less fussiness in our baby, but honestly I think the Dr Brown bottles made a bigger impact.  Make your own trade-off between fussiness vs. nutrition, just be aware of which formulas are made with corn sweeteners and which are truly milk-based.<br /><br />* Definition of MALTODEXTRIN (From Merriam Webster):  any of various carbohydrates derived from the partial hydrolysis of starch (as of corn or potatoes) and used in prepared foods especially as a filler and to enhance texture and flavor.<br /><br />It's misleading for the company to label the product as "milk-based" when it has minor ingredients "derived from" milk.
