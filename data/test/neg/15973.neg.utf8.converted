Overall it's not a bad product however I wouldn't have ordered it if it was properly described. It is incorrectly described as organic, it's NOT. It also is not pure Goji juice, it's a blend with water, cherry juice, apple, and pear. If you're looking for the really good stuff stick with the Goji Gold.
