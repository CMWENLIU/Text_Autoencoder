We have two cats, one of which needs a pill per day, and the other which will usually eat anything put in front of her.<br /><br />The first time I gave our cat the pill-pocket, she ate it without a trace of hesitation.  The next time, she sniffed it and would not eat it.  We tried several times after that, but even when she is very hungry, she will not eat it.  Our other cat won't eat them either, even as a treat, so it was a total waste of money.<br /><br />I'm not saying these don't work for any cats, but my rating reflects the fact that we have had zero success with two different cats.
