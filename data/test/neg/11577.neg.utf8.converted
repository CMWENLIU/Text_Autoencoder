I read all the positive reviews and was very confident when I got this 15 pound bag for my cats. Big mistake! Both of them started having wicked diarrhea the next morning. I figured they need a few days to adjust. Three days and about 30 clean-ups all over the house later we went back to overpriced Science Diet and lived happily ever after.
