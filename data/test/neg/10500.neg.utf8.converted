Unfortunately Amazon sent me a Fresh Whole Rabbit that was not in the Kindle format. When I tried to load the Fresh Whole Rabbit into my Kindle for some nice, relaxing, late-night reading... well, it's kind of gross now and my Kindle won't power up at all. Wouldn't have this problem if I'd gotten the Sony...
