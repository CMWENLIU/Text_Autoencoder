I was looking for an egg powder to use in protein shakes and stumbled across this. Upon examining the ingredients, I realized this product was not for me--nor probably many others. This product contains soy, which, in the last 20 years, has been added to virtually everything because it is a cheap filler. At one time, we were told soy had a long list of wonderful benefits and people were gobbling up soy milk and everything else soy they could get their hands on thinking it was a real health benefit.<br /><br />However, the tide has turned and the medical community now realizes that all this excess soy (which soy contains ALOT of phytoestrogens!) is not good for everyone. Estrogens increase many kinds of cancers and if you are overweight, body fat produces and stores excess estrogen on its own, so this is only adding to the problem for both men and women. Perimenopausal women also often suffer from estrogen dominance (you know if you have fibroids) and, therefore, make soy a poor choice.<br /><br />Some people believe phytoestrogens can "balance out" cyclic changes of low and high estrogens, but this has not been proven (while the effects of too much soy has) and for me, I'd rather err on the side of caution. Especially considering there is hidden soy in almost everything we buy prepackaged, as well as naturally occurring phytoestrogens from other plant sources.<br /><br />While I love Bob's Red Mill products, basically soy anything should only be consumed in small doses and using products like this regularly should be carefully considered.
