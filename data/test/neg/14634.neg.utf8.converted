I was skeptical to give my yorkie rawhides but my vet said it would be okay.  These were the only treats that would keep him entertained since he doesn't care much for toys and they were very easy to find.  Unfortunately my dog seemed to swallow a large piece of the mini dingo rawhides yesterday.  At 2 am I heard my dog let out a loud howl that I have never heard before, I went to check on him and found him gagging and obviously trying to throw something up.  Right as I was about to take him to the animal hospital he threw up the rawhide and he's all better now.  I'm NEVER giving him a rawhide treat, they swell in the dog's stomach and can kill them.  I rather not take that risk with my dog.
