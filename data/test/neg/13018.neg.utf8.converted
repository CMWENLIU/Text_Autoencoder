My son is allergic to this formula, similac in general. He broke out in a terrible rash all over his entire body. He was on enfamil before that and had no problems and we switched to nestle good start and have had no problems as well. It has been shown that parents choice (walmart) is exactly the same as similac. I didn't know that. I tried out the parents choice because it was cheaper and yup, my son is allergic to parents choice too. So if your baby isn't allergic to this, go ahead and switch to parents choice as it is identical to similac and much cheaper.
