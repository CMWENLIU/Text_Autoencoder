If you like this coffee that's fine and good. I didn't.<br />Pumpkin Spice Limited Edition on the box it states "A delicious coffee enhanced by the creamy pumpkin spice flavors of autumn."<br />"Where's the Pumpkin"<br />"Where's the Creamy"<br />"Where's the Spice Flavors of Autumn"<br />All I found was a very weak, cup of  "coffee"??<br />I tried 8oz then 6oz. It wasn't a good cup of coffee.<br />My wife didn't like it at all either<br />I tried cream,..... sugar,..... and cream and sugar.<br />I love most of my K cups and some not so much, but this one not at all<br />I had Pumpkin Spice at Hyatt Place in Hendersonville, TN and WOW it was so good,<br />so I order this thinking, just a little like Hyatt would be great. The closest it came to Hyatt's was Hyatt's water fountain<br />If GMC feels that I may have got a bad box - I would try a sample cup of what they feel is a good one.<br />I love Amazon just not this item
