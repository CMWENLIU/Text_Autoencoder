I ordered this sauce because I love the smokey delicate taste that the Chipotle chile is known for. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. This sauce didn't have much to offer. For starters it wasn't very hot. It's flavor was saturated with way too much vinegar and its was to sweet making it difficult to mix well with any Mexican food. Now I grew up with at least 5 home-made sauces and salsa on the table at all times so I've had my sure of hot sauces and I place this sauce right below "Tapatio". Let this be a Warning to all Mexicans your moms sauce is probably better! Or If you want the real stuff gets some Chipotles and eat them right out of a can.... If you can handle it.
