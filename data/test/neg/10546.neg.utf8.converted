I have a one year old Labrador mix and I decided to give her premium dog food to better her over all health. She has been eating it for the past 5 days.... Every day she would have diarrhea and then the 5th day she actually started puking it up. I don't know if this is a recalled bag that amazon sent out by accident or what... But I can promise you that I will not be buying this EVER again. The only time my dog puked was after she had gotten fixed and was in the car for the ride home.
