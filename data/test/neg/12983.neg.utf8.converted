This is the second time I bought these beef tendons. The first time they were fine - the shape was long, the way they are supposed to be, and they were easy for my dog to chew.  But this last time, the shapes were bulky and awkward and resulted in my dog's choking on one of these irregular and strange-shaped pieces that she tried to swallow and that got stuck in her throat. The choking episode went on for 15 minutes and ended only when she vomited her entire stomach contents. it was very frightening.
