This may be exactly what hot Kosher Horseradish is suppose to be. But compared with other horseradishes it is not at all hot, it is very vinegery. I opened two jars and three of us all agreed, Not Hot, too vinegary. Amazon gave a refund, I will take the other ten jars to a food bank. The two I opened if someone wants mild vinegary horseradish they get them. I am buying a jar of Beaver brand at the grocer.
