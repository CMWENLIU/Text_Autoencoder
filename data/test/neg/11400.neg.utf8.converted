I was in the same room with my schnauzer when he suddenly went nuts and there was blood everywhere!  the middle insert came out and he got his teeth caught in the cube trying to get to the food.  NOT SAFE!  he was hitting everything in his path and it took a few minutes to calm him enough to lower his head and get his teeth out of it.  We won't use THAT again EVER<br /><br />It is also VERY difficult to put the food into, you need good finger dexterity to accomplish that feat.  This was truly a waste of money.<br /><br />This deserves a ZERO star.
