This product is far more expensive than just buying fresh eggs and throwing away the yolk.  They are hard to mix well, which makes them unsuitable for direct cooking, as in an omlette, or in situations where the whites must be well beaten before using.<br /><br />In addition, the extremely "fluffy" nature of the powder as it is packed makes it very difficult to measure properly.  Do you measure it packed or loose?  The extreme imprecision of the lousy volume-based directions makes it a tough sell for tricky baked goods, like airy cakes.<br /><br />There are other egg white powders out there that do a far better job for far less money.
