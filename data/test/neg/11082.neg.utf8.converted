I tried the applewood smoked bacon flavor salt to see if it was better than their standard bacon salt.<br /><br />I love bacon. I like it well done and crispy. I often add the fake bacon bits to salads or pasta. The flavor is okay, bacon like but not as good as the real thing. I have started using the packaged crumpled bacon by Plumrose, or Oscar-myer. That gives a very nice real bacon flavor to anything you put it on.<br /><br />So when I received the package, I couldn't wait to open it and try it on some food. What a disappointment ! It tastes like salt and MSG with a slight smoky applewood yeast flavoring... not close to a nice bacon experience. I tried it on a sandwich, veggies, etc.... still a far cry from a nice bacon taste. Just salt, MSG and a little smoke flavor ...
