NOTE:<br />Below is my original review.  Since this review I have bought another bag and they were TERRIBLE QUALITY.  The sticks, many of them, were skinny as twigs.  Many of the other sticks stank and were weird shapes.  This was a "seconds" batch.  It's tough because I know bestbullysticks.com sells perfect sticks from their own website---but when they sell to Amazon customers---I dunno---I think the ship Amazon the ones that cannot sell from their own site due to poor quality.  I will NOT be ordering from them again.  I will spend more--there are some that are about $10 more---but at least I won't feel annoyed that I got "seconds."  Read my original review too--it is still helpful in making your decision.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />I've ordered three packs of this exact item from Best Bully Sticks/Amazon.  When I ordered from their own branded Website, the sticks were immaculate and had a branded label.  They were all the same size and color and seemed uniform.  I got them on sale from the brand Website and so paid what I do currently from Amazon.  When I went to order more, the sale was no longer on and they were significantly more expensive.  Amazon had the same Best Bully Sticks (odor free) and the same product count for the sale price I paid.  Excellent.  However, when I received the bag it wasn't labeled, the sticks were splintered and the sizes were not uniform and seemed dryer than my original purchase.  They seemed like seconds.  But, because of the price, and the fact that my dog didn't seem to mind--I bought them again from Amazon.  This time, though the bag was again unlabeled, the sticks were uniform and of the same quality as my first batch.  These sticks do get gooey---a good thing---when your dog starts to chew them.  So, if they do appear dry or brittle, this does soften almost immediately.  I have an 8 month old sheepdog puppy and this size seems to last him about 20mins!  If your dog is a heavy chewer and a Bully Stick addict, don't expect these or really any 6" sticks to last more than an hour--MAX!  Again, great deal as one bully stick from Petco can be 4-5 bucks!
