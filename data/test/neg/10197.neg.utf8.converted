I love coffee and coffee drinks and have been a Starbucks customer for years. (I don't think that Starbucks is as good as serious espresso bars, but we don't have any nearby.) So I was excited when Starbucks announced VIA, and I tried both flavors as soon as I could get my hands on them*. I was surprised to find that not only did both of them taste harsh and acidic, but they gave me a stomachache.<br /><br />After confirming several times that I wasn't just imagining the stomachache, I stopped buying VIA. Luckily a relative introduced me to Taster's Choice Colombian instant coffee, and it is not only better-tasting in my opinion but it doesn't bother my stomach. As a bonus, it is about one third the cost of VIA.<br /><br />*Rather than mixing instant coffee with water, I add it to a cup of hot milk and stir in a bit of sugar.
