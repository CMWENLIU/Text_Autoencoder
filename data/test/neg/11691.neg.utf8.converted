Bought 10-15 packages of Merrick patties in various flavors.  Unwrapped 1/2 and placed in airtight container... the other half, I kept wrapped and stored in another airtight container.  Both containers hatched small, segmented worms within 5-7 days, albeit many more in the container holding the unwrapped patties.  NOTE:  The shrink wrap does not provide a secure seal, i.e., often small tears & holes in some. This has occurred both times that I bought these (2 different purchases, 2 different retailers) in the last 2 months.  I have purchased before without issue, but I did not use to buy more than a couple at a time and likely my dog ate them before they had a chance to hatch.  I typically buy treats in minor bulk and keep in airtight containers... various rawhide and non-rawhide treats over many years of dog(s) ownership. This is the only dog treat I've encountered that hatches these worms.  I did send an email to Merrick customer service notifying of larvae. No response. Vet says probably not harmful in small doses.
