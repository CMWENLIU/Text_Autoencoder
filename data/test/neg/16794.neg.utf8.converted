Tony Luke has made a name for himself here in Philadelphia with his sandwiches. The Roast Pork sandwiches are a favorite of many. Now his company is marketing a frozen version of the Pork Sandwich, which I recently tried. (1) the meat tasted oldish--not quite bad, but not fresh. (2) The method of heating the pork (boiling bag in jus) means the pork does not have a "roasted" flavor, and the "Italian seasoned jus" does not hide the off flavor of the pork. (3) The bun is cheap, nothing special. (4) There were actually two pieces of bone in my sandwich. My impression was that big bucks became more important than quality.<br /><br />His fresh made sandwiches are probably better, but the frozen variety is a rip off.
