I am a diehard Mentos fan, specifically the fruit Mentos, but these are just gross. The strawberry and orange are good as usual, but the grape ones are disgusting and the watermelon flavor tastes like vomit. The pineapple ones aren't must better. I appreciate the fact that Mentos tried to expand their flavor collection, but it just didn't work here. I'll stick to the regular fruit Mentos.
