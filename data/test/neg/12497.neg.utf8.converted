I'm very disappointed in the quality of the box, so much so that I haven't even tasted the tea.  The product description says it is "wooden with full velvet lining", when in truth it is cheap pressed cardboard with wood grain contact paper (or something similar).  Very flimsy (cheap) hinges and clasp.  I considered giving it to someone as a gift but I would be embarrassed doing so.  Don't waste our money, especially since Amazon won't let you return it.
