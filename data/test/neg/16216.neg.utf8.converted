If I had known this cat food was manufactured in Thailand I would not have ordered it. I can't imagine there's much oversight of pet food production there. There is no mention of Thailand in Amazon's description, but it's stamped in big red letters on the box.<br />I fed one can without knowing - it made my cat sick and there were whole fish vertebra in the vomit.
