So this is sea salt, with added activated charcoal.<br /><br />Now I have nothing against activated charcoal -- it is indeed a miracle product and one of the few 'medicines' I have in the house.<br /><br />But, it will leach minerals and nutrients from what ever it is added to.  That is why it is part of the 'universal antidote'. (google this for more info).<br /><br />So, I use it topically for poisons  (insect bites ) and internally for some sicknesses, but never as part of my daily diet.<br /><br />This could be a poster product for the 'style over substance' culture...
