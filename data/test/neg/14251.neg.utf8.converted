Wow... talk about false and misleading advertising. Anyone in the know, knows carrageenan is considered carcinogenic... aka a cancer causing substance. And what about this "natural" flavor? Hey, arsenic is also "all natural" as is cyanide. In other words, simply because something is called "natural" does not mean it's good for your body.<br /><br />Sorry Pacific Natural... your products are anything but. And it's a statement about how you try to fool your customers with your misleading labeling. I'll pass.
