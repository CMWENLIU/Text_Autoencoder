Bought several 18 oz bags at Costco.  The taste is superb and no one should buy this product until they fix the quality control problems.  Popcorn is one of the top causes of broken teeth so Angie's may cost you a root canal and crown becasue of the excessive amount of unpopped corn that you may accidentally chomp down on.<br /><br />The unpops are throughout the bag - not just at the bottom.  The 'sweet' is added to the popped corn before all the unpops are shaken, strained, seived or whatever to get them to fall away to be discarded.  The uppopped are then glued via the sweet sticky to the popped corn.  Even shaking the bag will not dislodge the unpops throughout the bag.<br /><br />When you get to the bottom of a large bag, there is more than 1/2 of small pieces and unpops (I measured).<br /><br />Every handful of Angie's that you pick up, you need to transfer to your other hand and remove the stuck on unpops... or throw the bag out... or risk expensive dental work.<br /><br />This is not a commercially viable product As Is.  Sorry.
