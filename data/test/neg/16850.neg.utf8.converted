First of all, my favorite K Cup is the Timothy's Colombian Decaffeinated.  If you are looking for an excellent cup of coffee, I highly recommend Timothy's.  Secondly, it is my understanding that Timothy's is packaged by Green Mountain Coffee. Again, I have never been disappointed by Green Mountain products.  Unfortunately, there comes a time that something goes wrong in the process and you just have to get it off your chest.<br />This package of 50 was not typical.  I have had others in the past and they were neatly packaged in a Timothy's box.  In this case, the package was simply a cardboard box with 50 K cups inside.  What's really different about this order is the incredible poor quality of the K Cups.  It's like they bundled all of the bad production products and stuck then in box to sell on Amazon.<br />We've all heard of the exploding K Cups, but what's really happening is that the small filter inside the K Cup is not bonded properly to the side of the K Cup, and the coffee flows into the bottom of the K Cup and into your cup.  The coffee is not drinkable and you have to pour it out and waste another K Cup.  At today's prices, that's a problem.  I have had a few of these in the past, but this batch is particularly bad.  I have gone through 20 of the 50 K Cups now, and 10 have been defective. Every time, I carefully remove the foil top to find the filters are not properly attached to the side of the plastic K Cup.  What's really bad, is I have 30 of these left.<br />My advice to you is stay away from these 50 packs if you can.  I have not had any real problems when purchasing 2 24 count boxes, but I think these are factory rejects, which are costing me double the price I had expected to pay.
