Fed my Great Dane+Rottweiler mix dog this food for 1 year. During that time, she would eat grass all the time, fart a lot, be hungry all the time, beg a lot, poop a lot and have diahorrea occasionally. My dog is a very high energy dog that plays fetch everyday for an hour and a walk for an hour. She started urinating in the house involuntarily and I took her to the vet. Vet said the protein levels are too high in the blood, kidneys are under a lot of pressure and asked me to stop feeding this food. My rationale: If 42% protein in this food is not for a high energy and athletic dog like mine, then what kind of a dog is this suitable for! Although the ingredients are good, protein levels are too high for any dog and most of it is not digestible. So this food is not good. Reviews from people who fed their dogs this food for more than 8 months have not been good. So please use the brain cells you got and analyse and stay away from this food.
