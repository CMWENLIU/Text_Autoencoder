I purchased this beautiful waiters corkscrew a few years ago. I used it perhaps once a month. It fell apart, the metal strip in between the two pieces of olive wood broke.  I contacted Laguiole directly, I no longer had the receipt. Their very curt reply was that the only warranty was through wherever I had purchased it. They would not even allow me to ship it to them to look at.  I have purchased many things in my life, and when something breaks after a month or two, it has always been the manufacturer I have had to deal with.<br />With a company manufacturing and selling such supposed quality items as these, they should work with customers that have had one fall apart. I was told they would not accept it if I mailed it to them. They claim to have a lifetime warranty, but won't accept me sending them back a broken item? Fine, there are other top quality manufactures I will use for top quality corkscrews, cutlery and other such items. I'm done with Laguiole, its not acceptable at this price.
