I really wanted to like this mix and have tried several different ways to help the taste of the mix.  My daughter and neighbor kids do not like this for pancakes.  Had several other friends and family try the pancakes but all did not like the taste at all. I really had high hopes for the mix due to the great reviews but I do want to be fair for other shoppers and explain that the taste of this mix may not be for everyone.
