This milk powder is too fine. With your average supermaket dry milk, you can just sprinkle the powder into your oatmeal and it will dissolve. This stuff, on the other hand, turns into chewy clumps unless you reconstitute it separately with a whisk. As a result, there are still three bags of this milk powder sitting in my cupboard, unused.<br /><br />This milk tastes fine. It's just too much of a pain to use.
