Remember "Raw Bits", that cereal sponsor for the "Prairie Home Companion"?  The one made from "oat hulls and wheat shafts"? By George I think I've found it! YES!!! This is  the number one most crunchy thing on the planet, which is edible. I've not broken a tooth yet, but my ears still ring from eating it. And I tried to like it. At first I thought I liked it. Later I thought I hated it. Then I decided that I was missing the point; "Raw Bits" is not about flavor, it's about commitment, it's about doing the right thing, it's about put up and shut up. Think about your Norwegian Bachelor Farmer ancestors, for gosh sakes! Do you suppose that they whined about their cereal not "tasting good enough"?  Of course not!<br /><br />Eating Heritage O's/Raw Bits gives shy people the courage to get up and do what needs to be done!<br /><br />(Now could someone please help me find those tasty and expeditious "Powder Milk Biscuits"?)
