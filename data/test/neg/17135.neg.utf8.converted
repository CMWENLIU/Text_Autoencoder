The seller did not package with care, had cool pack that melted (cool pack had no plastic , was cloth).This sogged up one of the donut boxes ,had to throw out.Also  both boxes had broken donuts as well as both donut boxes plastic top had ripps as though someone deliberatly damaged the donuts.I would of returned my order but figured after reading the sellers profile with complaints of the same problem  and the the seller giving the run around , and the people still waiting for their money back that I would just worn you , order at your own risk.
