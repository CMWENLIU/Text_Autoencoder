I won't go all the way to 1-star since this is probably more about me and not the foodstuff but, despite the claim that hemp seeds are not known to contain allergens, I did experience *some kind* of reaction to 4 tbsp of this stuff this past Monday, about 4 hours after ingesting it. I passed out, was shaking uncontrollably when I came to, felt tingling followed by a loss of sensation, nausea, pain, and shortness of breath. I realize correlation does not prove causation, but the health professionals whom I've consulted so far (which includes my primary) agree that there's a strong possibility that the episode was caused by something in the hemp seed, especially since I do not have a history of these kinds of incidents. I'm going for tests anyhow, and if it turns out that the hemp seed was not implicated, I'll update my review.<br /><br />Still, the moral of the story is, try just a little bit of this and any novel food or remedy before you take a full serving of it, lest you wind up at the ER like I did.
