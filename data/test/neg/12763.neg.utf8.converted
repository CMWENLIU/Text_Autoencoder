I like ginger in baked goods like gingerbread, but I don't care for the taste of fresh grated ginger root, and these cookies tasted too much like fresh ginger for my taste. My husband likes fresh ginger, but didn't care for the texture of the chunks of candied ginger in the cookies. I love Paul, and we eat many of his products, but these cookies are a miss for us.
