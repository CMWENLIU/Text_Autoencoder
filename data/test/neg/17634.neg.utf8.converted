I really wanted to use and like these traps for my gopher problem, but the fact is they aren't strong enough to pierce dirt that is even marginally packed, and the tunnel has to be no more than 3-4" deep.  Basically, they're useless unless you have VERY shallow gopher tunnels, very loose dirt, and very stupid rodents.  This trapping concept can only work with a foot long spike and a very powerful spring in my opinion... I ended up having to flood the gophers out instead.  And to top it off I bought 3 of these stupid things, what a waste of money.<br /><br />Grade: F-
