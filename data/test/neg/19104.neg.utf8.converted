While the roses themselves were of decent quality, they were not "Lavish Long stem" more like gas station medium stem length. The "Diamonds" were not spread out by the floral arranger as shown in the sellers picture but rather seemed to be recklessly thrown in with the roses with a focus on speed and not detail.<br />The roses lasted six days before they wilted and turned black.<br />A word of warning: Proflowers took it upon themselves to substitute something completely different and of considerably less value on the first shipment (24 short stem roses)without asking my permission. I eventually got it sorted out and received the correct product, but this was not a "Red carpet" experience.
