Clusters? I didn't get any clusters. A couple of residual clumps, but thanks to insufficient packaging, all I got was essentially a bag of powder.<br /><br />I'd attribute part of that to Amazon choosing to send me the single bag in nothing more substantial than a bubble mailer, but the factory packaging should be air-tight, and have enough air (well, nitrogen to keep it fresh) to survive a trip from Seattle to northwest Oregon. I could mail a bag of potato chips (of most major brands) and the chips ought to survive the trip intact.<br /><br />The powder tastes okay. But crushed that much, I can't really consider this a snack anymore. I am very disappointed.<br /><br />Maybe I'll try some from the grocery store where I can make sure it's not already crushed, and then transport it myself in a suitable fashion, but even if it turns out to be good, I can't recommend buying it from Amazon unless they find a better way to ship it than a bubble mailer. I can't believe anyone could have thought that was a good idea!
