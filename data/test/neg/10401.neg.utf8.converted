We use Amazon prime for EVERYTHING. I've ordered this cat food many times but this time didn't realize this was the 2.5 pound bag and not the 6 pound bag. Granted this was my fault, who charges $22.50 for a 2 pound bag??? The 6 pounder was even cheaper!  Needless to say I was pretty upset to be charged this much for a tiny bag. Be sure to read the weight!!!!
