I am a registered dietitian who ordered these for my black lab who has a sensitive stomach. I am a big fan of this line's other treats. They usually have very few ingredients and so I ordered these for our pup thinking they would be fine. BIG mistake!! When the package arrived I read the ingredients list and it has sorbitol in it...which is a sugar alcohol. This gives humans diarrhea very often but I tried giving her one just to see anyways. Huge huge huge mistake. She had diarrhea for 2 days straight every 20-40 minutes. I would not recommend these to any dog owner.
