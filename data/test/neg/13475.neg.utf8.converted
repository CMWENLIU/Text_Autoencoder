Bacon pop doesn't really taste much like bacon at all, as the previous review mentioned. It seems like VERY lightly buttered popcorn, with a very light sprinkling of Bacon Salt. In fact, sprinkling it with some more Bacon Salt, or even just sea salt, does improve the taste. What it doesn't improve is the fact that it makes the whole house smell like a mixture of burnt popcorn, and something else unpleasant that I can't quite place.<br /><br />I'll stick to regular buttered popcorn sprinkled with Bacon Salt next time. Cheaper, tastier, and doesn't always smell burnt.
