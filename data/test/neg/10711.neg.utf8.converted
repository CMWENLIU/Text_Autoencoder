I ordered these from Frito Lay India, they were stale. They also didnt taste that great otherwise. If your a fan of Indian food as I am, you may like these, but I guess I just expected more. My Indian buddy also broke the news to me that you can get these at certain Indian stores anyway, and ordering them online isnt necessary.
