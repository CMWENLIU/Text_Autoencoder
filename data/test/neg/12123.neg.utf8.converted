I am rather disappointed in Knorr's three new additions to the noodle line. I am a huge fan of Knorr and have been eating their noodles since I was a child. This one really is lacking in the flavor department. The bag advertises "lemon" flavor. As hard as I may try, I can not detect even a hint of lemon. Overall, these noodles are rather bland. I would stick to the other flavors in their Italian line which are much better (although somewhat hard to find).
