These are not as described which did not make me happy.  They are NOT individually wrapped.  They are wrapped together in a bag inside the box.  I am the only one that eats them.  Therefore they will probably go bad before I eat the box which means I wasted money....Not really happy about that.  Tastewise they are ok...
