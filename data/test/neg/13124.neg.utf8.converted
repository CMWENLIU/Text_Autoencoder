I heard about the product and read the information online about the supposed health benefits, so I tried it at a friend's house. They bought a case, tried 1 bottle and were trying to get rid of the rest of the remaining bottles because they thought it was disgusting.<br /><br />I agree, disgusting. Metallic after-taste. What a waste of money and I imagine once authentic scientists test the stuff, they'll figure out it's not healthy and detoxifying as advertised. Beware of vague "I lost weight" claims also.<br /><br />Snake oil, circa 2012. BLEECCCHHH water.
