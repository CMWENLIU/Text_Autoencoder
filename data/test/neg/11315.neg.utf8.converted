I love coconut water and having been trying any and every brand i can get my hands on.  I had high hopes for this O.N.E. based on the positive reviews on here, but my case is absolutely gross! It has a very "off" taste.. not metallic - but, not pleasant.<br />Other people have mentioned that sometimes you can get a "good" case and sometimes you get a "bad" case - but, if that's the case, i think they should do a little quality control before the product is sent out!  I'm definetely going back to the Taste Nirvana brand - it is sweet tasting and is the best BY FAR!
