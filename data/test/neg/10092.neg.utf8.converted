I've had these noodles many, many times. From grocery stores, and even a small convenience store on my college campus. They are always SUPERB- some of the best microwavable cuisine I've eaten. The noodles are soft, the sauce is like a syrup, and the flavor is just unbelievable.<br /><br />Not from amazon. I purchased these noodles with high hopes. I've ordered food items before from Amazon and NEVER have they arrived to my satisfaction or expectations. With these, I figured- "Hey, how could they possibly screw up vacuum sealed microwavable noodles?" I still couldn't tell you how, but it definitely happened.<br /><br />The noodles were clumpy, and broke even after microwaving , even if a small bit of water was added- nothing. There was no life to them, and when your noodles are off- it's tough to enjoy a noodle dish. If that had been the end of it, though, I still would have tolerated the rest of my 6-pack, if vowing to never order them from Amazon again. But no, somehow the SAUCE managed to be terrible in this product! Rather than the viscous syrup-texture of the store-bought Annie Chun's, the packet included in this item was watery with clumps. The sauce itself was watery, yet the "clumps" were all the more noticable for lack of syrup around them. These "clumps" that do not exist in the grocery-store version refused to leave the packet without me opening it up and adding water, swirling, and then dumping out whatever one would call the ungodly mixture I had at that point.<br /><br />Even still- I had hope for the finished product. Surely Annie will pull through for me, regardless of where I got this particular package from! No. What emerged from my microwave took me by complete surprise. In sharp contrast to the delicious noodles resulting from the store-bought Annie Chun's was what can only be described as a disaster. The noodles, already rubbery rather than soft- dried and shriveled over their 60 seconds in the microwave. The sauce, rather than permeating through the noodles as it usually does- had slipped past and collected in a small pool at the bottom of the container. Vegetable chunks and the mysterious "clumps" shriveled and died as well, without the sauce buoying their transformation from freeze-dried to fresh.<br /><br />Three trials later, modifying this and that part of the instructions: soaking the noodles in warm water first, including water in the container before microwaving, mixing a bit of water and corn starch into the sauce, none of this could save what Amazon shipped to me as "Annie Chun's Chinese Chow Mein" noodles. In the end, I decided against leaving the remaining two bowls in the common room for "someone" to eat. I wouldn't want to turn them off this great product just because I made the mistake of ordering food off of Amazon. Instead, they made their way to the trash, where they belonged.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, this isn't the first time I've ordered food off of amazon- Emerald Nuts that were "off", peanut butter that was "strange", a pack of 6 jars of Nutella one of which was opened, another of which was just "different". Scooby-Doo gummies that arrived with a crusty/crunchy exterior, and now this pack of noodles. It's not the first time, but I can safely say that it will be the last. Amazon's cheap prices are great for some things, but for groceries- it's just not worth it to this buyer any longer.
