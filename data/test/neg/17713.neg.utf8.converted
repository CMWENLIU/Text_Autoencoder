I have hit several of what must be shells of some sort, which are like biting into small rocks. I am also fairly certain one of the things I did encounter was a small rock as when I removed it from my mouth and washed it off that was the only thing I could identify it as. The taste and texture of the nibs are OK but I won't be ordering more in the future as there are too many "landmines" in the batch I got.
