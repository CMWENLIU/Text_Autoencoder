When this coffee was delivered it was one month from the expiration date. I kept the coffee but after brewing a pot I realized it was stale. I'm a fan of Community Coffee but any coffee will taste bad if it's stale. I will not be buying Community coffee on Amazon again. I was very disappointed in condition of the product as delivered.
