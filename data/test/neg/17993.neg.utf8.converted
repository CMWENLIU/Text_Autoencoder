OK...They kinda grew on me but you can only have so many...(I don't eat much<br />greasy snack food, Thats problly why) They kinda taste like a bland "Cheeto"<br />with a slight PEA kick to them. They are puffed like a "Cheeto" as well.<br />I havn't tried them in a salad as a substitute for Croutons. That might be good!
