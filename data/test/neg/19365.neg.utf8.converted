While the product is certainly easy to use (once you have figured out the awful instructions) you quickly realize that you can only make food in incredibly small amounts. As any mother knows there is no time for that. It is much simpler and quicker to simply steam your food then use a regular food processor. Please save your money and skip this product!!!!
