I have bought Truvia for a very long time, and I love the produce. My issue is with the suppler of the produce. I was given a day that I was to receive my Truvia, and as of today which is now 20 days later I still have not gotten my Truvia, and no response from the supplier, who I did contact, nor have they credited my account for the amount of the purchase either. All around bad experience with this supplier.  I still buy Truvia, but only at my local retail supplier.
