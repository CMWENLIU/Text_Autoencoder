I bought this product at Fred Meyer some months ago because it looked interesting.  It was not.  I was really disappointed in the cooked result.  Worse than that, I now find out that the company that makes it is directly benefiting from the Occupation of Palestinian lands by the Israeli armed forces and radical fundamentalists.  So for at least 2 reasons, I won't buy it again.
