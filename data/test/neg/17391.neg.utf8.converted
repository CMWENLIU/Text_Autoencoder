Although I have heard and read many positive things about this product it didn't seem to have any effect on my shihtzu.  It was difficult to get her to take the product because of the strong taste.  I tried it with cream cheese, tried straight into her mouth, and ended up putting some in the water dish that all of my dogs share.
