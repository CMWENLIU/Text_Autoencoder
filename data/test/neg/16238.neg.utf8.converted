There are some plus sides to this drink, its all natural and no added sugar.  I love my drinks to have a kick to them, and what I mean by that is I need my drink to have lots of fizz, in that department this drink is seriously lacking.  Its more of a weak tasting juice then a sparkling fruit juice in my opinion.  It is not worth the price, I rather stick to izze sparkling juices, they have so much more kick to them, strong flavor, and lots of fizz.  Each one contains two servings of fruit, which is awesome.  So this is ok, but I wouldnt waste my money on it again.  To be honest with you, it tastes like a sweet version of V8 juice :D lol
