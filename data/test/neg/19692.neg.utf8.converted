I bought this butternut squash to make pies and squash soup for the Holidays. Sadly, out of the case of 12, only 2 cans were useable. The others were dented beyond belief, and the two that I used had "puree" as thick as playdough. It did not mix well with the half & half, sugar & spices, although I was using the soup recipe provided on the side of the can, omitting the onion. So, I made 1 pie & 1 batch of soup. Both tasted very metallic and left a bad, twangy aftertaste in your mouth. No one could finish their slice of pie because of the metallic taste. What a waste of money this was. This is a shame, too, because canned squash is so hard to find. Next time, I'll read the reviews before purchasing a food product. I will not buy this product again and I cannot recommend it to others.
