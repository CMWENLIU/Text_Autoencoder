I received less than half of the unique flavors listed in the product description.  Most of the flavors were normal flavors I could get in any random sampler.  I did not receive any of these: Folgers Vanilla Biscotti... Gloria jeans Macadamia Cookie... GMC Donut House Chocolate Glazed Donut...  Green Mountain Caramel Vanilla Cream...  Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry... Timothy's German Chocolate Cake...  Van Houtte Butterscotch... Van Houtte Creme Brulee... Van Houtte White Chocolate Mint...
