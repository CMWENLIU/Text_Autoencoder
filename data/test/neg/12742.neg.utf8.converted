This box of toothpicks is made in china.  Why is it so hard to find toothpicks made in the USA?  I have shopped all my local stores and cannot find any.  Do we not have sustainably grown birch trees in this country anymore?  While at work, I like to suck on toothpicks and read an article about contaminants on toothpicks from China.  I have found article after article about the mills that used to produce toothpicks in Maine have all closed.  Are we going to send all of our jobs overseas???
