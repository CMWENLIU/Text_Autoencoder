I love my SodaStream seltzer maker.  I purchased the syrup mixes to give my drinks a little flavor.  I was very disappointed with the ingredient list: artificial flavors, sodium benzoate, acesulfame potassium, and Red #40 and Yellow #6.<br /><br />I drink seltzer instead of soda because I want to avoid these artificial ingredients.  These syrup mixes were not worth the money.
