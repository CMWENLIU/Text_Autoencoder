It took forever for fruit to flower - two of the three plants fruited, grew nice-sized tomatoes, but the weight caused them to topple.  Next, the leaves all rotted off but the remaining fruit ripened...bland, ugh, no taste.  The remaining plant finally grew fruit and they ripened red with tons of tape, etc. to support it (that's where all the extra work came in - trying to keep the plant upright).  Taste on these was a little better but far from worth the effort.  Back to herbs!!!  (I do love the aerogarden for the herbs!)
