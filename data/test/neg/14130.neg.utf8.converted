if you know what your getting yourself into then,you might like it. however,if your gulable(like i guess i was) you will be very dissapointed. i bought these chocolates thinking that i would get some type of a buzz of of them. even if it was only a small one,i would have been pleased. however these are just chocolates with a liquor tease.(underline tease) i don't buy liquor for the taste and if i wanted to buy chocolate i could have purchased some hershey kisses. i bought it hope that i would get something that not only taste good but gave me a buzz. this product..failed!!..big time!! now like i said for those of you who don't expect it to give you a buz(and are laughing at me for even thinking that my expectations should be such)i guess,you all probably will get what your bargaining for. as far as all others go..pass!
