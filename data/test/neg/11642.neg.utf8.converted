I really wanted to like this flavor of K-Cups but it's just not that good. It smells incredible when it's brewing but I think that because this isnt a true flavored coffee you come in thinking its going to taste sweet. Its bitter to me and even the undertones of the chocolate seem a little tart. I tried even putting creamer and sugar and still found it to be way too bitter. Ive even tried to drink it over ice and still a no-go. The chocolate flavor is too artificial tasting. I love the regular and deacaff versions(unflavored) of Donut House coffee but this is not good.
