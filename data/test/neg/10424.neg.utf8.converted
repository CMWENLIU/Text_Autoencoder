I purchased this for my cat who lost a lot of weight after a serious illness. He became a finicky eater and only seemed to want to lick the gravy from his canned foods. I was desperate to get him to eat and to get nutrients in him. I heard of this product and thought a gravy with vitamins in it was a win-win. I paid almost twice the value of the product in shipping, but figured since it was my cat's health, it was worth it (and no local pet store sold it). My cat was not having it. He wouldn't lick it alone on a plate. When he was done eating the gravy from around the canned food bits, I added some of the Vita Gravy to the meat bits and he wasn't even remotely interested. I figured he was still being finicky and he would eat it when he fully recovered and was back to himself. Well, that time came and went, and he still won't eat it. In fact, I tried it with my other cats and every single one of them (even the ones who inhale anything you put in front of them) would not even touch it. They retracted instantly upon smelling it and looked at me with this odd expression. I threw the whole thing away. What a waste!
