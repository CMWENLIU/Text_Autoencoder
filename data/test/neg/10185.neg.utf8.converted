I had to try another box before I wrote this review because it seems hard to believe that I'm the only reviewer who didn't enjoy these.  Particularly when someone specifically said "they're not too salty". I'm not sure if we got an overly-salted batch, but I'm definitely not on board.<br /><br />My wife and I both felt they were very salty.  We were hoping to give them to our baby who's starting on biscuits now but we also want to avoid too much salt.<br /><br />I have a hard time telling if the strong flavor is from the salt or the cheddar.<br /><br />Out of the 5 people who tried it here, only my brother said "Mmmmmm Cheddar".  I gave him the remaining 11 boxes and hope I have better luck with the Chocolate flavored ones.
