Let me just say up front that if I am hungry i will eat about anything.  This Pesto (without any pine nuts) is terrible.  Save you money.  It had good reviews and since I live in the Baja I thought i would try it since it had such good reviews and we can not buy this sort of stuff here where I live.<br /><br />Honestly, save you money.  There is not really a "Pesto flavor" with this product and it has a rancid sort of "off" taste to it.  Six very small (3 oz) jars are over $20.00.  It is fairly "pricey" to start with and since it has a terrible taste then it is ridiculously priced in my opinion.<br /><br />I am so irritated i bought this crapola and of course Amazon will not accept a return on it.  My reccomendation is the Classico brand "Traditional Basil Pesto sauce and spread".  I paid, i believe $2.00 a jar for the Classico brand of pesto on sale at a WalMart.  The jar size is 8.1 oz and i had five large meals with the Classico pesto sauce which has a wonderful flavor.  I boiled some Johnsonville sausage in a pan and afterwards boiled my pasta in the same pan of sausage water.  Had the Classico Brand of pesto with my pasta and the flavor was wonderful!  The Classico Pesto sauce was incredible on the sliced sausage.  So i tried to duplicte the same meal with the Roland Petso sauce and i barely ate half of it and tossed the rest.  I won't be eating the remainder of this RolandPestoCrapola.  I realize that individual tastes vary greatly but I can NOT imagine anyone choosing the Roland Pesto.
