But it's just as well as they aren't good for you.<br />But I sure used to love them. They used to have a delicious taste and texture. They used to be really oily. When you bit them they had a unique crystally magic crunch texture. When you bit it it came apart in flaky layers.<br /><br />Today when I bought one I was worried as the package was different. Also on the inside I knew it was different because the old bars used to be surrounded by a wax cardboard liner on 3 sides, now the new one had it only on the bottom. I could see that the new bar did not have chocolate swirls even though it was marble. The old ones you could clearly see chocolate swirls.<br />The new one: first bite, dry, no velvet crystal crunch texture, no tearing off and leaving flaky layers extending. It was not oily. AND WORST OF ALL: IT HAD NO FLAVOR! AND EVEN WORSE: IT HAS A SOUR RANCID TASTE AND THERE IS NO DATE ON PAKCAGE. SHAME ON YOU JOYVA FOR CHANGING THE RECIPE. MORONS
