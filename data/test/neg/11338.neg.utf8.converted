i drink this regularly, 2 a day. i have found 2 packs already which contain mold patch. it looks like a rotten piece of coconut or some kind of jell floating on there. its realllllllllyy disgusting. i am a loyal customer but i now have to stop and really wish the FDA could look into this as it is dangerous!
