Basket is attractive but we are at a loss how to use it- it is attached by strands of yarn and we do not know if we should cut these or if they serve a purpose. We do not understand how the 2 baskets fit together or how to serve rice in them. They do not appear to stack. Instructions were not included with the product. Other than decorative, the basket is unusable.
