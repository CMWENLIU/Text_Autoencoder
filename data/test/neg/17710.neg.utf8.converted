I was pretty sad when I got these peaches (which are indeed very delicious) and the can stated they were from China. China, really? "Native Forests" like California and Georgia grow great peaches, why do they need to come from China? It's no secret that organic certification in China is HIGHLY questionable so you can't rely on this product to actually be organic.<br /><br />Also, the other reviewer states the cans are lined with BPA. Double shame, Native Forest!<br /><br />I love canned peaches, but I will not eat another until Native Forest or another company comes out with organic, steam-peeled peaches grown in the USA and canned in BPA-free cans.
