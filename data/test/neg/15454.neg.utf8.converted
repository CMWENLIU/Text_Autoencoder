I was excited to find a package of 48 Pop Tarts for so cheap, Until they showed up.  When we received the brown box from the UPS man my mouth was watering.  Then I opened the box to find the case of pop tarts just sitting inside the larger box with nothing to keep it from moving around.  I grabbed the box of Tarts and lifted it only to have the bottom of the colorful box open up and 4 boxes of frosted goodness fell onto the table.  Before opening the individual box I was a bit leary.  Yep, not to my surprise the foil wrapper was full of crumbs.  We now eat the pop tarts with a spoon.  Oh well live and learn.
