I was very disappointed that they have now raised the carb count in this cereal from 9 net carbs to 16 net carbs.  I have insulin resistance and my nutritionist told me this was the only cereal I could have.  It tasted great!  My local ShopRite stopped carrying it a while ago because it wasn't selling, so I had to purchase it elsewhere.  I called the company and they said they were relaunching it in July.  I was so happy to see it back on the shelves, but now they've change it.  Even the sugar level went up.  I just wish there was another cereal on the market that had 9 grams of carbs or less.  Oh well, I'll surely miss it.
