My husband is overseas and wanted to surprise me with a variety of coffee to try as I recently purchased a Keurig coffee maker. This order arrived in a brown paper bag stapled together with an expiration date of 8-23-12 written on it (it's almost June so not much time to consume these!). I was hesitant to even open the bag it just seemed a little strange to pack K-Cups this way (another order he sent me through a different seller came in unopened BOXES). I opened the bag to find DIRTY K-cups inside! Gross. There were crumbs of some sort stuck around the rim of a few cups. A few more felt hard as rocks as though they had been exposed to moisture somehow. I was completely taken aback. It seemed as though someone picked through the flavors and threw all the ones they did not want in this bag. Lots of decaf coffee, teas, one hot chocolate and a few other random coffee's I have never heard of were included. Needless to say, I will not be consuming any of these due to the packaging as it did not seem sanitary.
