I used this cream that went on smoothly and dissapeared rather quickly into the skin and although the smell was quite strong at first, I eventually got used to it, but after a couple of days I noticed huge cystic acne type bumps that broke out on my face only in the areas I having been using the cream. I was only spot treating, to help obtain an even skin tone but it did not help at all and caused more problems. I stopped using this tube long ago. And although it was cheap I am still quite upset that it failed!
