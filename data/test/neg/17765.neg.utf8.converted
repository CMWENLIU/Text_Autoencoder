I tried this Chai to see if it beats my all time favorite (Celest. Seas. Honey Vanilla White Chai Tea) since it got good reviews.<br />I am only glad I can rest knowing that I've tried all the main supermarket available brands and they don't satisfy.<br />Like all of Bigelow's vanilla flavored teas-there is this taste and scent that is released in your mouth when you sip it.  It's weird and strong.<br />It almost seems as if they use too much vanilla or they have some weird substitute flavoring in those teas.<br />I really like their Earl Grey tea-if you're into that.  But Stash makes that tea better.<br />I hope this helps.
