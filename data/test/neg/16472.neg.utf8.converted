I bought this tea because I love Lipton tea that is made with orange pekoe as well. After trying this tea for two weeks in several different ways and playing around with quantity and brewing time, I had to give the rest away to a colleague to try. There is an extra flavor in this tea that I can't place and I just don't like. I don't know if my colleague liked it. But I have since found another tea company through which I have found many much better teas. Before you buy this large package, contact Coffee Bean Direct directly and request a sample size of their teas for $2 each and free shipping. I will say that I tried three other teas from this company and also disliked them.
