The all-natural ingredients make for very pleasant reading - with dried cane syrup; rice, wheat, corn flour; and sesame seeds combining to provide a delivery vehicle for the anti-oxidants contained in cocoa. Unfortunately for me, the taste of cocoa was so strong, that it overpowered everything else - I could barely detect traces of cinnamon or the other ingredients.<br /><br />While I was very pleased with the fact that there is practically no chemical aftertaste, I don't see myself becoming a fan of this product.<br /><br />Happy Snacking!<br />~Damodar
