I grew up on seaven seas red wine vinaigrette and can no longer find it in grocery stores.  Imagine my dissapointment when the sent me Kraft lite vinaigrette instead.  I could just picture the stock person filling the order..."oh, we are out of this, i will just substitute this one instead"  NO WAY.  nothing beats the original.  When I contacted Amazon about the problem, they did say keep the dressing and they credited my account. I will probably just donated the unopened ones and order the orginal again.  hopefully I will get what I order.
