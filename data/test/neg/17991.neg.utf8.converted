I, too, thought these would be dried snap peas.  Boy, was I wrong.  The picture on the front of the bag is VERY misleading...when you actually get a look at the product inside the bag, there are no visible "pods" on the snapea crisps.  The crisps are actually more like sad, green Cheetos.  At this point, I'd rather eat some Cheetos...at least they have some flavor.  These snapea crisps (original flavor) are on the bland side...even after adding salt to them, they still weren't very flavorful. They also left my hands greasy.  I thought I might be able to keep a bag of these in my desk at work to eat as a healthy snack, but I have reconsidered.  The crisps don't seem like much of a health food at all.  If I want to eat something with 6g of fat per serving, I'd rather go with chips and salsa or a handful of pretzels.
