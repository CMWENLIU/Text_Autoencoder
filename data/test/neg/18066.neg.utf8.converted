I bought the chocolate peanut butter, I was hoping it was going to taste somewhat like ice cream. Unfortunately it just tastes like chocolate flavored frozen water. I may just blend it up in a smoothie and hope it taste better than eating it straight from the container. The vanilla maple seems to have good reviews so I'm thinking I might try it before completely ruling out this product.
