I have purchased these a couple times from whole foods and decided to purchase on the internet due to lower price, however when I received them I took a handful and went to work, 20 minutes later I was struck with nausea and lower back pain..(kidney pain maybe?) I drank a lot of water and a couple hours later it went away. I didnt think it had anything to do with the berries then and a couple days later I was snacking on them and was struck with intense nausea and ill feeling all over, I was very close to vomiting for most of the day I felt AWFUL. These were without a doubt the culprit, I am very healthy and didnt change anything else in my diet at the time :( unfortunately I have a huge bag left to go to waste. After researching I found this brand to be inadequate in quality control and similar issues with their goji berries since they are grown in china and the quality control is sub par. It is very disappointing because this brand has an image that you think you can trust..ahhh it is a shame.
