Product is as other reviewers note a bit bland and not without some oil.<br />Though the outer package is a nice Newman's Own box, the packages inside are completely generic with a small dot-matrix message "94% fat free unsalted".<br />After 2 purchases that seemed fine, the third is a bust - the popcorn will not pop! Using the same microwaves, after the normal cooking time very few kernals are popped and soon after everything starts to burn. Bag after bag has come out without any popped corn to speak of. With generic packaging and these cooking problems I wonder about the quality of the product.<br />Note that the product is not returnable.
