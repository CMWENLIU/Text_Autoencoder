This product is interesting. It is not a miracle product. It cannot do everything egg white or gelatin does. I tried to make gelatin free marshmellows with it, and it did not remain stable. This stuff also imparts a strange off flavor to foods if used in sufficient quantities. The only good the product can do is help stabilize egg  foam. It does prevent egg  foam from weeping and helps it remain fluffy longer so if you are looking  for a way to make a better meriange than this product is a good choice but for everything else I find it falls short.
