I bought this expecting to be able to enjoy the savory flavor of man's closest living genetic relative, the chimpanzee.  When I tasted this chocolate bar, all I could taste is dark chocolate.  Now, had this been marketed as just a dark chocolate bar, then I would have given it a four or five star rating, as JUST chocolate it's fine and quite tasty.  But look at the label, there is quite clearly a chipmanzee on the label.  Where is the chimp flavor?  Had I wanted just chocolate flavor I would have bought such.  Please stop such false advertising and put at least extract from the flesh of a chimpanzee into this chocolate bar.
