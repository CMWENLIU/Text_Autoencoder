The only reason I have given this review two stars is because I adore Whitman's chocolates. They are absolutely delicious. However, the reason I did not put more stars is because this is a rip-off. If you are going to buy Whitman's Sampler box, you might as well go to their website and purchase it there because they sell the 24-Ounce box for $19.99 and the 40-Ounce box for $29.99. So essentially, the grotesque mistake I made in buying from this awful seller, is that I paid for a 40-Ounce box and will be receiving a 20-Ounce. I am sorely disappointed, and disgusted. I wish I had gone on their website beforehand. Shame on the seller, shame on you.
