We love Earth's Best products, but these are simply too dangerous. We first tried them with our daughter at 7mo old.  She quickly broke off nearly half the bar in her mouth.  She is now 10mo old, and we still have the same issue.  We cannot offer these to her any longer.  Too bad. the ingredients are excellent.  We don't have this issue with others such as Gerber and BeechNut.
