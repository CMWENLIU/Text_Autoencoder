Just bought and tried COCO LIBRE coconut water. After reading the label, I see that it is from a concentrate and uses unknown "natural" flavors.  So, we would want to know the process for concentration, in what kind of storage container is was shipped in, at what tempurature, for how many days and what kind of water was used to reconstitute it. I don't think the advertising makes any of this clear.
