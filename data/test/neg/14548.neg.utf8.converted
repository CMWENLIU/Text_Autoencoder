I wanted 'Cat-Man-Do' Bonita flakes.  These are straight from japan so who knows what the flakes are...whale? dolphin? All writing on the package is in japanese.  The picture of the flakes (on amazon) shows a little cat similar to the one on the Cat-Man-Do package.  Since I don't like tricky little schemes like this & I don't support japanese fisheries I am returning the flakes & reordering the type we use around here.
