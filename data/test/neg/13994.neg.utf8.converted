This is very cheaply created Umeboshi and no true taste. It has uncured runny meat, just full of salt. Obviously it was not sundry - typically at least for 7 days which will shrink the meat more compact and has to be cured for 6 month or more with each shiso-wrapped in ceramic barrel. That's the way it's done in true Japanese Umeboshi which bring out great Sour flavor in the first bite as well as true health benefit of Umeboshi and will not have the taste of salt.<br />My family or many of people who really know how to make Umeboshi in Japan, will cure Umeboshi for at least one year and some are up to seven years. You only eat the one from the prior year harvest not from the same year harvest.<br />Most of health benefit of Umeboshi can only be true in well cured Umeboshi of 6 month minimum, otherwise you get the symptom of uneasy, queasy stomach taste. Normally children are advised not to have more than one Umeboshi for this reason.<br />Hope Eden people rework on how to make Umeboshi properly.
