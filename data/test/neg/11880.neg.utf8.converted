Remember that stuff your mom used to give you to stop your cough when you were a kid?  Well, this tastes VERY MUCH like that.  Ugh.  I am drinking this now trying to come up with adjectives to describe what I am tasting to you.... watery, non-carbonated, slightly-grape-ish, dry, and weird.  That best describes what this stuff tastes like.  I would never purchase this on my own.<br /><br />As for the claim on the can "burn up to 100 calories and more" - how does one prove that?  I certainly can't tell you if it will help me burn 100 calories.  There's no way for me to prove or disprove that statement.  By the same token - shouldn't we slap that on black coffee as well?  Certainly coffee ups your metabolism as well, right?<br /><br />The can is really trying to sell itself; "NO Sugar" "No Aspartame" "NO Artificial Colors or Flavors".  Yah but that doesn't mean it TASTES any good.  It's really like a light watered version of old corn syrup.<br /><br />I would drink this over a period of a week or so to see if there is any difference in my weight, but wow, I can't - I can't get past that flavor...
