I have used their products for awhile, but my recent subscription order for this Grade B Organic syrup arrived and is VERY watery.  Either it was not boiled long enough, or water was added.  Stuff just runs off pancakes and lays on the plate in a pool.  Not very appetizing for a premium grade product.  Have contacted them, so will see what their response is.  May keep my subscription for one more round just to see, but if it comes this way again, will be jumping ship for another brand.
