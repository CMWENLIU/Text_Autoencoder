Up until this week, I have LOVED Rockstar Juiced with Guava, which is 50% juice.  It is the only energy drink that I have found that I like.  Alas, this week when I purchased a new case of what is advertised as Rockstar Juiced Guava with 50% juice, I discovered that the product has been reformulated to be only 10% juice.  They have reduced the juice, but added sugar and sodium and increased the calories.  The result is a terrible-tasting beverage that is NOT what is described on their web site.  This is a classic case of bait and switch.  Rockstar is trying to increase profits by selling a watered down, awful-tasting drink.  What a slap in the face to their customers.  It reminds me of the New Coke disaster a few years back.  At least Coca Cola admitted their mistake and went back to their classic formula.  Will Rockstar be that smart?  I'm not optimistic, but until and unless they do, I will not purchase any more of their products.
