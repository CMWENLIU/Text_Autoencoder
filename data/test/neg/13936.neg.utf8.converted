These almonds arrived in a clear plastic bag closed with a plastic tie.  There is no original packaging or brand name on them.  It is as if some person took a container of chocolate covered almonds out of their cabinet, tossed them in a plastic bag, and sold them to an unsuspecting person on the internet.  What company sells unmarked food items in a plastic bag that could have been tampered with at any point of the process?  I will be returning and would not recommend this company...at all!
