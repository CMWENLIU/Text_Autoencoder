This WAS a great everyday coffee until Green Mountain, K-cup/Keurig patentholder and producer, started playing games with it.  They substituted an IMO inferior (cheaper) blend and changed the description to a light roast from medium roast.  They also changed the color of the K-cup to light green from orange and freely substituted this tasteless wastewater as the real caribou blend that I have enjoyed for many years.  My supplier agreed and gave me a full refund.  Not surprisingly, Caribou (Green Mountain) refused to respond to my requests for an explanation. They are currently being investigated by the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission for accounting "irregularities".  GM, of course, publicly blames their quality and delivery problems on their suppliers. How convenient.  In the meantime, "shortages" of GM K-cups appeared that drove up prices and profitability even though Green Mountains inventories were twice the level of the prior year.  Holding the patent and copyrights for K-Cups allows lots of liberties since the competition and prices are controlled by GM.  You may remember the Hot Cocoa shortage last year and the half-caff (their most popular) shortage this year.  But Greed is Good at Green Mountain.  Profits are up a whopping 97% and the CEO is probably, no, certainly wallowing in cash bonuses.  I bought some EZ-Cups from Amazon and make my own k-cup compatibles now with quality ground coffee.  They are indistinguishable from Green Mountain's in flavor and you'll save 80% of the cost.  Don't confuse EZ-cups with the gadget that Keurig (Green Mountain) sells. I refuse to give one more nickel to a company that ruthlessly exploits its customers in the name of profit.  Use the EZ-cups and stick it to these SOBs.
