I have read this about the brand..Amy Brians, like all canned coco water this brand is "cooked" coconut water. Unlike tetra paked coco water (vita coco and ONE)which is only flash pasteurized for 3 seconds, canned coco water is heated at extremely high temp for long time which cooks out all the vitamins and minerals and electrolytes. So there is no potassium left. Its basically like goya (really cheap brand that has been around for years) canned coco water without the added sugar and pulp.<br /><br />If you want all the good stuff and TASTE.. I would rate them<br />vita coco  ..10<br />ONE.......... 8<br />Zico......... 2<br />cans.........-10
