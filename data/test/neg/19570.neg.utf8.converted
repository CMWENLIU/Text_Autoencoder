I had never tried maple sugar before, so I really can't compare it to another brand.  We thought that the taste was very good.  We like to sprinkle it on oatmeal.  It would certainly not be cost effective to use in baking.  At $16 or so a pound I cannot justify the cost. We really couldn't tell the difference between this and the $3/lb organic sucanat I found at the food coop.
