Terrible texture, despite several trials of cooking lengths and with/without salted water.  Always turns out mushy, sticks to my teeth, and breaks easily.  Raccoto brand of 8-grain-pasta has a similar nutrition profile (with more fiber I think?) and tastes/feels much much better. And, as a bonus, is about a third of the price of Ezekiel-- at my local store, at least.<br />Goodluck!
