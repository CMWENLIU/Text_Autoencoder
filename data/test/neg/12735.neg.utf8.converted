I chose this brand of cheese powder over Trio, which I'd used in the past and really liked, because this was less expensive. It came with no directions at all so I winged it remembering how I'd used the Trio sauce. This ended up thin and very salty. I had to eventually add thickener to get the consistency without making it horribly salty, but that made it more a "gravy" than a "sauce". I'll still use it up, but won't buy it again.
