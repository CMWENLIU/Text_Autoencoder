The ad shows a picture of regular (mamri) brooke bond box which is not available in stores so I ordered it for $14 with shipping. Note that the description does not tell you its 'Orange Pekoe'.<br />What I got was the same orange pekoe which is available in stores for $3 !!!<br />If I wanted the same tea, I would have walked to the nearby store.
