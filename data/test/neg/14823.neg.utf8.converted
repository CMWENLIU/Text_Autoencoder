There is a problem with the packaging of Amore tomatoe paste,  As a former packing machine operator I could tell that it was done at the factory as the tube is inserted in the shelf box ( the black box )  MY 12 tubes arrived on time, and the cardbox was undamaged.  The second layer of packaging the large black box looked fine also,  the problem was the individual box for each tube.  My wife discovered that some tubes had actually leaked, not because of bad sealing but because the machine that inserts them into to display box (individual carton for each tube) was jamming them in the container so hard it actually bent them.  EVERY TUBE IS DAMAGED, TWO HAD TO BE THROWN AWAY.  So I cant fault Amazon for the damage it wouldnt of been noticed by your order filler.<br /><br />the Amore paste is a wonderful product just needs better inspection proceedures to insure better customer satifaction,,,<br /><br />product rating 5  packaging 1
