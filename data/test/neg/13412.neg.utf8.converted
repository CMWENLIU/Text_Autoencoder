Bought this item 4/11 which was made in Japan. Simply Extraordinary. My wife and I liked it so much I bought 6 more cases (8/11) but this batch is made in Thaland. The bottle is slightly diferrent, without the green leaf emblem on the front as pictured. This new version is absolutely inferior to the original ones I had. Don't get me wrong, it is still good but I would not buy it even at the discounted price currently offered on Amazon. I have read other reviewers who suggested they changed the formula. Whatever it is, it tastes  strong like the regular cheap tea I usually get at the Chinese restaurants and the after taste is completely different. I almost wanted to return the shipment but didn't want to go through the hassles. Buyers beware<br /><br />Update 7/14/12:<br />I saw a comment from other buyer that he/she received a Japan made batch. I went ahead and ordered 2 cases. Sure enough, they are now Made in Japan. The interesting thing is this batch tasted "watered down", exactly like another reviewer said!!! I now understand what he/she meant. Bottom line: there is definitely some quality consistency issue here (at least post Tsunami time). It is batch dependent, facility dependent ( have seen Thailand made, Japan Made, and have seen comments about Hawaii Made!). Good luck to all who seek good tea. I have switched to brewing my own tea and bought the tea from Eto En directly.
