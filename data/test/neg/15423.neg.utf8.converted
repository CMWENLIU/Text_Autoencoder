I love other Larabar products (and have them in my cabinet currently).  This one however shouldn't have ever made it through their testers.  It's so horrible that even 1 1/2 years after trying it, the thought of it causes my face to automatically squinsh up in digust.  I cannot express fully in words the utter awfulness of this product.  However, the telling of the story of both my mother and I leaning over separate sinks spitting it out and rinsing our mouths is sure to set both of us off in hysterics to the bemusement of anyone around us.  I wholeheartedly DO NOT recommend trying this product.  (Ugh.  I need to go rinse my mouth with mouthwash just from thinking about this product long enough to write this review.)
