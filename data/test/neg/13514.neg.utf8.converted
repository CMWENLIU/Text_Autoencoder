I never thought country sausage gravy was something you could completely screw up, but I was wrong.<br /><br />I tried eating a can of this with some biscuits and it was practically inedible. The gravy has an acrid, somewhat metallic taste which no amount of extra seasoning seems to be able to mask.<br /><br />I've got an iron stomach and have practically never met a gravy I didn't like, but I couldn't even bring myself to eat the whole can. And I HATE wasting food.<br /><br />RUN AWAY. Seriously.<br /><br />The only redeeming factor for this product is it doesn't really contain anything nutritionally atrocious such as hydrogenated oils, something which can't be said for most similar packaged white gravies.
