AlwaysDirect did an excellent job packaging and delivering.  They actually packed it with 2 freezer bags to try and keep it cool.  Now the freezer bags were complete thawed by the time i recieved it but I appreciate the gesture.  The chocolate was fine and not melted.  My only complaint is it is too expensive.  Target sells a 9.5oz bag for $2.99. This "tub" is 40oz(note: product description is wrong.  It is not 12/4.6oz packages; it is one 40oz tub).  So it should be no more then $12.59 and with the shipping it is 67% more expensive then just buying at Target.  Don't be fooled by the count because this is the foil wrapped andes and are 1/2 the size of the ones in the Target pack.<br /><br />So good product and delivery if you have no other option but way over priced.
