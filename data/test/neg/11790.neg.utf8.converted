Some of the comments here come from folks who seem to be very knowledgeable about tea. I am in no way an expert, but I drink green tea and have tried many different kinds. I found this one to be my least favorite. It's very confusing. It's not matcha. If it was it would not be in tea bags. When it's brewed, it does seem a bit like Japanese tea, but not at all like matcha. I'm not even sure what it is. It tastes terrible.<br /><br />If you want to try some good green tea, I suggest Numi brand tea. You should be able to find it at most well stocked supermarkets and health food stores. It is the best boxed tea you can get.
