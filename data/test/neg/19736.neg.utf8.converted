My cat hates this type of food. she even lost weight because she wouldnt eat it. So I started buying friskees classic pate canned cat food and she cant get enough of that. she licks the plate dry now! She also loves dry cat food. who wouldve figured? But she hates this filet stuff! What will I do with my 1 1/2 cases of prime filet?
