Better known brands of limburger spread disappeared from the market several years ago. I hoped this Amish Country product would fill the void. But what a disappointment! This spread is essentially a combination of limburger with an assertive and not very compatible white cheddar. This two-cheese combination could be acceptable to some tastes. But the blend also contains acetic acid and its patently distinctive smell, sharp taste and sting. For my taste, the three together produce a spread with a flavor quite alien to limburger cheese per se, though a trace of its aroma is still there. Because it is not truly unpalatable, I might suggest it to the adventurous snacker. I will not buy it again myself.
