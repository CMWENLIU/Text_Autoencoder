I'm so sorry to say that this was not good at all.  I really had high hopes, since I am a huge fan of tortilla soup.<br />It was watery and had a strange flavor.  I made it according to the directions, too.  I'm just sad I have three boxes left over.  I also purchased the potato soup, but haven't tried it yet.
