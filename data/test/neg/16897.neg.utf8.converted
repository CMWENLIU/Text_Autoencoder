This is coming from a real woman, and real matters. It's 5:31am and I am writing this. I had literally had diarrhea all night. Though none of you, need to know this. BUT, this is warning. This Tea has senna in it, a laxative. You will be getting the worst cramps, and diarrhea of your life! I have used it for two days, and feel horrible. I recommend regular herbal tea guys! I'm being totally honest, I am NOT using this product again. It doesn't even prove to help in weight loss. And the side effects are killer, and totally not worth it. Believe me, I wanted the easy way out, drink tea, and maybe cut back my diet. BUT, this tea is not what I intended. I wish not to spend another night on the toilet, practically keeling over.
