I still haven't figured out what I'm going to do with the 3-pack that I bought from amazon. I tasted one bar and completed it with great difficulty. I am a regular breakfast bar eater and bought this expecting meal bars to keep hunger away fro longer than breakfast bars do. I love strawberries too yet I say these taste terrible!
