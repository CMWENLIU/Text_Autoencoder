I like almost everything about these treats (I got the chicken).  They're small (though I still cut them in half when I'm not feeling lazy), perfect size for a quick training treat so that your dog can be rewarded but his attention stays on you (rather than on eating the treat).<br /><br />I like the texture.  They are moist but not wet so there is no sticky residue.<br /><br />The price is good.<br /><br />The ingredients are ok.  Not great, despite the "natural" claim, but I don't necessarily expect treats to be healthy.<br /><br />But, and it's a big but, they stink to high heaven.  In fact, they stink so bad that I have to hold my breath whenever I open the bag, otherwise I will truly gag.  I can't describe the smell but despite the "natural" ingredients, they smell nothing like what you would find in nature.  These treats have been so highly processed that the original ingredients are beyond recognition.<br /><br />Actually, the smell reminds me of kibble.  I haven't fed my dogs kibble in over a decade, but whenever we dogsit and I get a whiff of our friends' dogs' kibble, I want to gag too.  But the smell of Zuke's is at least 6 times stronger.  I hate how the odor lingers on my fingers after I've handled the treats.<br /><br />In fact, for a couple of days, while working at my desk, I would get a strong whiff of what smelled like crab.  I had eaten a whole crab a couple of weeks ago and kept smelling my clothes, thinking that the crab smell hadn't washed out.  But my clothes smelled clean.  It wasn't until a couple of days later that I discovered the origin of that crabby smell.  It was coming from a treat pouch I had put the Zuke's in and had left on the far corner of my desk about 4 feet away.  If laundering doesn't remove that smell, I'm going to have to toss that pouch.<br /><br />I feed raw green tripe to my dogs on a regular basis, and while some have likened the smell of that to sewage, I don't actually find the odor too offensive.  Certainly isn't pretty but not enough to make me want to vomit.  Zuke's actually makes me want to do that.  It's unfortunate that they stink so much to me, because I would buy more otherwise.  However, I will say that the 1 possible benefit of their intense odor is that it does get the dogs' attention and they don't seem to mind it.<br /><br />But I guess I'll go back to making my own treats.  Chicken/turkey heart or liver, cut up into pieces, then boiled.  Pat dry, then stick in oven on low until dehydrated.  Dogs love them just as much, and not only are they TRULY natural, they are human-grade, minimally processed, and actually healthy.  The things I do for my dogs.
