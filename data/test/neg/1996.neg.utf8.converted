This item contains potassium metabisulfite as a preservative. No returns on this item. Sulfites give me a headache.<br />I didn't see an ingredients list on this product. I should have researched it better, that's on me...lessoned learned. Didn't want some one else to make the same mistake. Having said that, it is a great buy if you have no issues with preservatives.
