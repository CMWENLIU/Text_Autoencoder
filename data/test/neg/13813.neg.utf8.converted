Well, I thought I had done my research. I am not new to bread making, but was wanting to add that malty taste to some of my loaves. The four smelled good when I opened it, and used 1/4 of the total amount of the flour called for in the recipe with this malted barley flour...as a bread book told me I could! I have since seen that info on line as well! OMG! The loaf never baked and stayed completely gummy.I've never seen the like. Upon further research, this flour is not what I had thought it was. The info out there and in baking books on barley flour is not complete and very misleading. Now I have 4 bags of this stuff. I wasted a lot of money for something you don't even need to make a good loaf of bread. I think what I need for my malt flavor is simply Malt Extract. I should have figured that out since my husband brews beer. I didn't think this WAS Malt extract, but I thought it was going to be the thing to use in breads! As it turns out this is diastatic malt and breaks down the starches in the flour. Why would you need that when white flour is already a refined starch? I MIGHT add a teaspoon or two of this to a 100% whole grain loaf, but what to do with 4 bags? You better own a bakery when ordering this bulk product and you better be baking a lot of 100% whole grain breads!...I think adding some vital gluten and starting the whole grain bread with an 8-12 hour sponge makes more sense than using this product though.
