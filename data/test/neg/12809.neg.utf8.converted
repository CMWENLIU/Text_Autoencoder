I was deceived. I was looking thru crystal lite  selections and found most of the offers were for 4 packages of 4 packs which gives you 16 containers. For about $39, which would cost about the same in supermarket.<br /><br />So without reading one ad  real close I order a four pack and that is what I got 4 containers not a 4 pack of 4 for 16--- for $39 cost in supermarket $10.<br /><br />For $39 I thought I was buying a four pack of 4 packs a total of 16 cans. Which sell for about $2.50 each in supermarket. instead I got only 1 four pack which at the rate they are charging is almost $10 each--4 times the supermarket price.
