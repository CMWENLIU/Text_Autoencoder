I thought it was great that there was hot cocoa for the keurig machine.  this is so watery when you make it.  green mountain needs to improve it.  it tastes like chocolate flavored water.  if you make a product that is intended for the machine it should work well in the machine.  i love all of the k-cup coffees but this cocoa sucks.
