I was extremely disappointed in this product.  I was expecting the rich, hint of sweetness of quality dark chocolate.

If you are a lover of dark chocolate, this is not the product for you.  The exorbitant price lulled me into thinking this would be made with quality chocolate and real ingredients.  Alas..
