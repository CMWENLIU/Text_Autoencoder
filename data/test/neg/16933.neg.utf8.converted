I was so excited to get the Keurig Brewer for my staff (They have been hinting for months). I ran out and bought an assortment of K-Cups to surprise them in the morning.  I just tried the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, milk chocolate.  It was awful, watered down, too sweet, and left a terrible artificial sweetener after taste.<br />I hope to have better luck with the coffee.
