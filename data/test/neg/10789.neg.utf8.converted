I received this item in poor condition.  It had leaves that were eaten up by bugs and the trunk seems to have some sort of rotting going on at the vase of one of the stalks.  Alot of the leaves have fallen off. This item was pretty much a waste of my money but thats what I get for buying a plant over the internet.
