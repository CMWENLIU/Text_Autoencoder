When I got this I thought it was a good deal.  I used some of the berries and the taste was very good.  However, a few days later there were worms coming out of the bag.  I have never had these worms in my house so I am sure they came from this bag of spelt berries.  I could not find a way to contact Amazon.com customer service about this.
