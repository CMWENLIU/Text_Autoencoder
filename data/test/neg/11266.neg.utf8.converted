Simply put, this vending machine is a piece of crap. And, dealing with the company is even worse. Just check the long list of complaints they have at the Better Business Bureau. That said here is the breakdown on how the machine works:<br /><br />Coin Mechanism - Most likely the worst Coin Mech in the Vending Business. Anyone with a piece of straw, a paper clip or even with their car keys can easily tamper it and get free candy. After a couple of months of use, it will start jamming and will work with everything BUT quarters. Unlike in the feature description, these plastic coin mechanisms will not last very long with normal use.<br /><br />Chute Doors - The chute doors are made of plastic. Very WEAK plastic. They will not last a week of normal use. This will leave an extremely unattractive machine that looks like a toothless Hockey player. Not to mention how unsanitary that is.<br /><br />Canisters - Sure the easy on, easy off design might be the best any company has come up with. However, the canisters are so weak that I have had them crack on my hands while cleaning them. Another flaw would be that these clear canisters will turn yellowish within a month if exposed to indirect sunlight of strong fluorescent lighting. Even if they aren't, they will still turn yellowish within a year.  Plus, they are very poorly manufactured. Finally these canisters would not only NOT keep the candy fresh, but also it is very easy for insects to get inside and make a total mess.<br /><br />Housing - This would be the piece attached to the metal pole and base and holds the canisters and coin mechs. It is so poorly made, that within a couple of months it will start to crack. I have had customers call me to tell me the machine fell on the floor. Imagine if it had fallen on top of a child!<br /><br />The Back "Security" Door - It is incredibly weak and made of plastic. Anyone with a screwdriver can steal your quarters without even breaking it.<br /><br />The Company - The Manufactures are Multivend. They might be one of the worst companies to deal with. As I said before, just read the complaints they have at the Better Business Bureau.<br /><br />If you are looking for a novelty TOY, this machine would be perfect if they didn't want to charge you over $100.00 for each (A new Unit can set you back almost $400.00). I would pay no more than $40.00 for a unit. But, if you are looking for an investment, then look elsewhere. I can recommend the Beaver Machines. Those are the best in the market. I've made more money with around 40 Beaver Units than the over 300 units of Vendstar 3000 Machines I purchased will ever produce.
