it took like 10 days to finally get them.  i hadn't tried this kind before, only the caramel and vanilla ones.  i have to say, i dont like these ones.  the apple flavor is a bit sharp and its very chewy/not very caramely.  now i have the joy of having spent 25$ (after shipping) on this and trying to feed them to my coworkers over the next 3 years.  i guess childhood just doesnt taste as good.......<br /><br />meh~
