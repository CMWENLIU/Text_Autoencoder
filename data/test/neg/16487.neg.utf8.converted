Recieved only one of each and not what is listed.<br />For the Emerald Cocktail Peanuts, 12-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 12) - I received one 4.0 bag of Diamond Chopped Pecans<br /><br />For the Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashew, 10oz Canister (Pack of 4) I received one 4.0 bag of Diamond Chopped Walnuts.<br /><br />What's the deal here? Now I can't return them, but they are not what I ordered. This isn't even close to what was ordered.<br /><br />Please fix.
