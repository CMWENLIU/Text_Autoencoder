This coffee is un-drinkable. I am so upset that I just spend $50 on all of these coffee cups and I have to actually throw them out! I am not a coffee snob my any means. But I am able to detect a disgusting plastic and stale aftertaste. I am so disappointed! After taking my first sip, I looked at the expiration date on all of the cups. They expired either 10 days ago or are about to expire next week. What a waste!
