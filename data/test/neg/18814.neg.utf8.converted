I am an avid dark chocolate lover. Not a lover of this one at all. This bar reminds me of Christmas because of it's intense spice flavor... like when my mom used to throw cinnamon, dried apple and any other spice she could think of in a pot of simmering water to fill the room with a 'holiday scent'. Way too strong to eat! This chocolate bar does not have a good spice flavor.. more like you are eating chocolate-covered potpourri. I don't really taste orange at all.  Just strong spice. Their other bars are much better.
