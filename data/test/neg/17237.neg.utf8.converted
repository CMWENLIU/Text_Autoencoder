Fine product, so I read.  Given that, I ordered multiple boxes of Pomi. Problem: use-by date just a few weeks from delivery of product. For me, buying from grocery store, though more expensive, is safer. I like Amazon, or want to, but I've received many 'bulk' products with impossibly soon 'Use By' dates.<br />Yes, Amazon, you do refund money.  No, Amazon, you do not address specific issues, eg: Please check with your supplier re: my complaint.  [Also applies to multiple boxes of Swanson Chicken Broth, which were so poorly packed the product leaked through the shipping box.] Shucks, reckon I'll give Amazon one more try, but that's it.]<br />Dr. B.
