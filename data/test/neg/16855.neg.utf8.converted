What was supposed to be a small "Secret Santa" gag gift (the recipient would love it), turned out to be a joke on me...I was not satisfied with the packaging...a zip lock bag? Come on! Why ask if I wanted a gift message if it would come on a wrinkled 8 1/2 X 11  piece of paper typed in bold black letters (font size about 100).  Just think if I would have had the gift sent directly to it's recipient...?  "POOR, POOR, POOR"!
