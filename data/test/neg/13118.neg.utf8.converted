We buy these on occasion as snacks for the kids, this and other brands. One day I actually took the time to compare sugar content and I was horrified. Peter Rabbit brand has almost twice the sugar as all of the other brands, across the whole line.<br /><br />There is WAY TO MUCH SUGAR in this for to be a healthy snack. No wonder that Rabbit is so fat.<br /><br />So you choose, cupcake or Peter Rabbit anything.
