The last time I bought this item was exactly 3 months ago on April 12, 2012.  The price was $28.62, it is now $35.99.  That's a sharp increase of $7.37 in 3 months, which is a price increase of  nearly $2.00 per lb. - and when you consider that this product is 61% sugar, that's quite a price hike.<br /><br />At this price, Traverse Bay Dried Cherries costs MORE PER LB. than the Trader Joe brand of Montmorency dried Sour Cherries which are delicious and come in smaller bags.  The whole point of buying bulk 4 lbs. is that you get a price break over buying smaller bags in grocery stores.  Not anymore.<br /><br />I'm gonna go to Trader Joe instead and buy their excellent dried sour cherries which are not as oily , and have a nice tartness.<br /><br />***UPDATE - Aug. 17, 2012  I just bought from Trader Joe their Tart Montmorency Cherries 8 oz. bag for $4.29 yummy!
