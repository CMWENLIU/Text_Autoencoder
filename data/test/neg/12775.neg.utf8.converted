I love ginger snaps and was excited to try Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps.  At first taste you cannot distinguish these cookies from any other quality ginger snaps on the market.  They taste really good and have that amazing "bite" that real ginger gives.  Amazing.  Truly.<br /><br />Unfortunately the cookies cannot ride on flavor alone.  They are really hard.  So much so, that chewing them hurt my teeth (and I'm an ice cruncher, if that tells you anything).  I was chewing so hard on these that I bit my lip and inner cheek just trying to manage these snaps in my mouth.<br /><br />If I can get the exact same taste in another brand, but not mangle my mouth and give myself a headache while chewing, I will go with a different brand.
