This Goji powder, I don't know... I feel like it was super heavily processed or something, and stripped out the life force and nutrition out of the Goji Berries.  I DO like Goji berries.  I think they're a powerful food.  But this powder is just complete garbage.  I noticed absolutely no benefit in taking it.  Not only that, it doesn't even taste like Goji.  It tastes odd, mixes weird, looks weird.<br /><br />I'd steer clear of this supplement.  Your money is better spent elsewhere. Maybe on some actual goji berries.<br /><br />How this review got 5 of 10 helpful votes is beyond me! What do I have to gain by writing a biased review? Some of you people rating these things are bonkers.
