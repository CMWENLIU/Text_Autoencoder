Organics consumers should know that Horizon is owned by Dean Foods, at $10 billion of annual sales and controlling about 50 different dairy brands in the country, the largest dairy processor/marketer in the United States.<br /><br />A large percentage of their milk comes from their corporate industrial-scale dairy, with 8000 animals, in the desert-like environment of central Idaho.  They say that 80% of their milk comes from "family farmers" but some of those "farmers" are also milking thousands of animals.<br /><br />There are serious questions as to whether or not these farms are meeting both the letter and spirit of the organic law.
