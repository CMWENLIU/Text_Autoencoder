If you are used to eating the pink colored (artificial) ginger sushi slices, you will be disappointed with this product, just like I was. The reason I tried it was the fact that they do not add artificial colorants to it. Nor do they add any sugar. But!!! They add tons of salt! It is so salty, I can't eat it at all. I put it into a big bucket of water, to let the salt leak out. So far, after 5 rinses, it is getting milder. But, the salt takes away from the natural gingery taste. Why oh why did they have to do that? If I have to choose between a vinegar-sugar mix or a vinegar-salt mix, I will pick the sugar anytime, when it comes to pickled ginger. By the way, the saltwater-vinegar blend makes up 10 % of the product weight indicated (I drained and measured it). I now replaced it with a sherry vinegar plus some sugar. I'll let it sit for some days in the fridge and see if it becomes edible. In conclusion, this was not a great buy, especially when adding the cost of the bottle of vinegar (5.90) and the sugar, and the time to work it up.<br />Unless you like it extremely salty, in which case, you'll be really happy!<br />One more thing: what do you do with all that ginger in a plastic pouch, once you open it? This is terrible packaging! How about a jar with a screwcap? That would definitely help with storage! (I had to find myself a glass jar to put it into.)
