I love coconut water. I make it my mission to try all kinds, from Naked to Zico to VitaCoco to Goya. Trying  different flavors is a part of my quest. While I tend to like plain the best, I have never had a bad experience with any flavor... except for Zico Lima Citron.<br /><br />Perhaps my expectations were to high, considering my love of coconut water and given the fact that lime seems a natural complement to coconut water (she put the lime in the coconut...)<br /><br />To be honest, it tasted like a cheap alcoholic drink, a bad gimlet perhaps. I could barely finish it, because the after taste was so awful. I finished it out of obligation, owing to the price mostly.<br /><br />I recommend, honestly, any brand and any flavor over this.
