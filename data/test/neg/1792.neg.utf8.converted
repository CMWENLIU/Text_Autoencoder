Great price but once I tasted it I realised why it's such a great price. Because it is not the real super fantastic pink salt that I have come to love. This salt has a very prounced aftertaste, the kind you find with cheap table salt.  I took this bag over to my sister who had the real pink salt.  Side by side we could see and defintely taste that this wasn't the real stuff.  We concluded that it must be a very small amount of pink salt added in for color and mixed with regular table and sea salt. Again, the aftertaste is very strong, something you NEVER taste with the genuine Himalayan pink salt- one of the many reasons people pay so much for it. And this defintely ISN'T it.<br /><br />(FYI- In San Francisco, Rainbow Grocery has it for a great price in the bulk section.  If I still lived there I wouldn't be trying to buy my pink salt online and ending up with this mess! :))
