I was trying to find an alternative to donut house decalf, but this is not it. My wife described it tasting like old rotten wood. After taking a sip I had to agree. Will never by again. It could be because of the cheap packaging that does not have a total seal. Reputable coffeemakers package their product in nitrogen to preserve the freshness and you cannot do this without a sealed cup. Advise everyone this product is no good!!!!
