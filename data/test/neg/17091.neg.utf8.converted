I love Nestles Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips, and only use those to bake my chocolate  chip cookies.  Everyone I bake for loves my cookies and says I bake better chocolate chip cookies than Mrs. Fields and Famous Amos combined. I have been baking for over 40 years.<br /><br />I'd give the white chips a -5 if I could. I tried them when they first came out years ago.  I love white chocolate.  I would LOVE to find a good white chocolate chip.  This chip isn't anywhere close.  It had sort of a vanilla flavor instead - except it was more like Dollar Store imitation vanilla.  Nasty.  I tasted three chips and threw the rest of the bag away.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.
