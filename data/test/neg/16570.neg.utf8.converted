My husband loves LifeSavers and even though my daughter thought orange mints sounded disgusting I thought these sounded pretty good. There were only six reviews,but since they were all five stars I decided to order the pack of 12 Orange Mint LifeSavers.  Big mistake!  My daughter put it best when she said they taste like orange medicine.  Also, why do these contain Aspartame?  They aren't sugar free.<br /><br />If you've tasted these and love them, then you should buy them.<br /><br />Definitely try these before you buy a pack of 12.
