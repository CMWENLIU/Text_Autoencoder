I see this product got a lot of excellent reviews but I disagree 100% with the other reviewers.  My wife and I are food critics, so we know when something is good or not.  My wife and I immediately thought this seasoning was way too salty.  It was so salty that it almost was not edible.  It also tasted like Lawry used seasoning salt in the "Perfect Blend".  This made it way too salt.  If Lawry reduces the amount of salt by 60%, then I think this product can live up to its name.  I found that McCormick Montreal Chicken Seasoning is the "Perfect Blend" for chicken.  I am sorry I am venting a little bit, but Now I have to throw a 24.5 oz bottle of Lawry's seasoning in the trash.
