I agree with all the other reviewers who say these are just like "regular" brownies, with a rich chocolately flavor and great texture. I agree, they taste great, and go down really easily. However, it's what they do to your body after eating them that I object to -- you will get really awful gas! It's not just me, it happened to my entire family, my husband, and both boys, teenagers. Not pretty. I don't think it was the sugar alcohol that caused the problem, but what was it? Who knows? I am so glad I didn't go crazy and buy a case before I checked them out. Just be cautious!
