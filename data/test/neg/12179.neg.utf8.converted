Got this flour in a timely manner.  I had bought it for Alton Brown's Super Apple Pie.  Shipping cost more than double the price of the flour and since I have found this flour at my local farmer's market for $2.00.  It was an expensive mistake.  I made the pie, the dough was tough.  I'm sure to my inexpierence than the flour.  The tapioca flour was fine, but shipping costly.
