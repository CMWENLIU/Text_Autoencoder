Too much salt in this product.  You'll regret using it if you have any other source of salt in your dish, e.g., pasta cooked in salted water, feta cheese, brined olives, etc.<br /><br />I far prefer the pesto marketed under the "Buitoni" brand (Nestle foods) that is sold in the refrigerated foods section at the grocery store, as that pesto has excellent taste without going over-the-top on salt.  The Classico product has almost 50% more salt in the same size serving, relative to the Buitoni pesto.<br /><br />I have nothing against salt, or salty foods, but the amount of salt in this Classico pesto is unjustifiable and may well spoil your dish.
