In Nov/Dec of '09, Innova decided to change the ingredients in this particular line of food. No need to let your paying customers know. $400 worth of vet bills later, and a bout with pancreatitis (my dog of course), I realize it's this food that is causing the problems. They later confirmed in email that they did in fact change the ingredients; however, they did not confirm whether they would pay my vet bills.<br />Not to mention, they also changed their guidelines recommending this food NOT be fed to large breed puppies, whereas it was previously fine.<br /><br />They tout themselves as some Natural, good for your dog, food, doubtful.<br /><br />AVOID
