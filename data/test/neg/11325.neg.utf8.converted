I got my product and refrigerated before actually drinking it. It was pretty easy to open but the taste was not that of a coconut. It actually tasted more like water with just a hint of coconut. For someone who grew up in the caribbean knows exactly what a real coconut tastes like I wasn't truly impressed. Maybe it might have tasted better if I hadn't refrigerated it but who knows. At the price it's being sold for I truly wouldn't recommend it.
