I had planned to give this cereal 1 star after eating it in milk because I could barely force myself to eat the whole bowl, but then when I tried it as a snack (without milk), it was good enough that I decided to up the rating to 2 stars.<br /><br />Similar to Kellogg's Krave Chocolate cereal, which I also reviewed, this FiberPlus has a texture problem.  When it milk, I found it so grainy as to be off-putting.  As a snack, there is a nasty aftertaste that I presume to be from the addition of antioxidants.  I don't remember the aftertaste so much in milk.  The cinnamon taste is more pronounced as a snack than as a cereal.<br /><br />For those who are interested in the nutrition information, here are the stats for a 3/4 cup serving:<br /><br />Calories  110<br />Total fat  1.5g<br />Sat/trans fat  0<br />Poly unsat  0.5g<br />Mono unsat  0<br />Sodium  140mg<br />Total carbs  26g<br />Fiber  9g (5g soluble and 4g insoluble)<br />Sugars  7g<br />Protein  3g<br />Vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, B12, C, D and E and several minerals.<br /><br />In summary, I do not recommend this cereal unless getting a lot of fiber in your diet is more important to you than taste.
