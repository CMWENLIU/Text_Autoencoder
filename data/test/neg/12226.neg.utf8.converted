My first order for the product which i received was well packed and had plenty of whole product at the bottom of the bag.  This new shipment of the same product had product dust and a few granules at the bottom of the bag. I understand that in packaging there would be a certain amount of settling of the product at the bottom of the bag but what i received was almost 2 inches of product dust and small granules. Either this is a packaging malfunction or a quality review lapse. At the price i paid for it there should be enough whole product at the bottom of the bag as there is at the top.
