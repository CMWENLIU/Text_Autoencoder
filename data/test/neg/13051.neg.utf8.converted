I love my Nespresso machines and have been drinking their espresso for years.  I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the capsules than buying direct from Nespresso, but this vendor is charging much more than Nespresso.  Nespresso sells these same capsules for $0.55/capsule - much cheaper than this vendor.  I would buy direct from Nespesso.
