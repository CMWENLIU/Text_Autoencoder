I love the convenience---Amazon does a superb job of packing - the subscription price is wonderful..unfortunately I am discontinuing the subscription.<br />The manner in which FRISKIES packs is unacceptable: the amount of DENTED cans seems to go up monthly...sorry--back to the store I go..where I can also mix up the flavors for fussy cats.
