I received 3.9 lbs in my 5 lb order.  The remaining pound consisted of catalogs.  The quality of the product was fine and it was shipped quickly.  The short quantity was the only problem, but it was 20% short.  The company told me that the manufacturer indicated that the order was shipped correctly and that they never had this problem before.  I was careful to weigh it a couple times on different scales to make sure.  KV Vet Supply Company said they believed that the order was shipped correctly.  Regardless, the company sent me a gift certificate for $5 to make up for it.  When I attempted to use it, it did not work through Amazon nor through The KV website.  The customer service person answered my emails quickly, but just trying to get what I ordered and paid for cost me far more time than it was worth and in the end I never got it.  I will not use them again.
