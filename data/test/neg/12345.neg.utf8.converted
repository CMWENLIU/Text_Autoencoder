I have been on 10 mgs of Lipitor for about seven years. I thought I might be able to get my cholesterol down even further by taking the chews. I don't eat meat, eat sensibly, count calories (I'm not obsessed), exercise at least three days a week, no alcohol. I've been taking the chews since February. My cholesterol is approx what it was last year (prior to the chews), 184, but my triglycerides are now in the borderline high zone. Not sure what happened but I'm off to the doctor's to see what I can do about it. I'm glad it works for some and wish it worked for me. :(
