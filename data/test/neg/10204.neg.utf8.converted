I'm a long time drinker of Jasmine Pearl tea -- when I saw this product listing I thought it was too good to be true (a pound?  at such a low price!).  I was right:  it's *very* low quality tea.  It doesn't have the subtle jasmine flavor that's supposed to be present in this tea -- it's bitter and simply doesn't taste good.  Stick with the Numi brand of Jasmine Pearl ... it's fresh with wonderful flavor, and it's reasonably priced.  You can find it here:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFIL60">Numi Tea Jasmine Pearls, Numi Tea Jasmine Pearls, Flowering Loose Green Tea, 16-Ounce Bag</a>
