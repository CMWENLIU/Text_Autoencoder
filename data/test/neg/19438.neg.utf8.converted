This food had some good reviews on a site that rated the quality of various dog foods, however my yorkie puppy would not eat it.  He put a piece in his mouth and promptly spit it out.  He tried a couple of more pieces with the same result.  The kibble is larger in size than I had expected, about 3x larger than Royal Canin mini puppy 33,  and it smells nasty.  I did not like the smell at all and the puppy agreed.  Glad I only bought the trial size.
