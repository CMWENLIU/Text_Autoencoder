I cannot fault the product.  Friskies is a reputable company and the food I ordered will be appreciated by one cat.<br />However, and I take full responsibility - the buyer did not beware - I received ONE 5.5 ounce can of shredded chicken and salmon for a whopping $3.88.  In my book that is pure and simple thievery.  I will be on the lookout for this seller and advise everyone tempted to order from them to do the same.  If I could rate the seller minus points I would.
