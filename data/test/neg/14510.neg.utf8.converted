One word - VILE!  Love Bethenny, but hate her drinks!  I was similarly disappointed with her original margarita.  I absolutely cannot understand the success of these cocktails.  Her TV shows are great, as are her books - both fiction and nonfiction.  Do not bother to try this.  You will be wasting your money.  VILE!!!
