We order these for our office on a regular basis. While not every cup is absolutely unique, that has never bothered us. For the most part, there is always a good mix, even if a few are duplicates.<br /><br />However, in every recent batch that we have purchased, there have been a few cups that were nearly empty. You can tell by shaking them. We tried brewing a few of these to verify that we were not just assuming they should be full. And, I would not recommend this, as the coffee they produce is absolutely horrible.<br /><br />It is very apparent these are defective cups. I thought it was an anomaly at first, but I found 3 more in our most recent order. All of them that suffer from this problem tend to be from Grove Square, in our experience.<br /><br />1. Until this issue is resolved, I think customers should expect to throw away 2-5 cups upon arrival. So, consider the price as if you were purchasing around 30 cups.<br />2. The seller of this product should seriously consider dropping the Grove Square cups until this is resolved.<br />3. The seller should consider doing quick quality assurance by simply shaking the cup before packing it.<br /><br />That said, we will likely continue to purchase this product since it is a great deal, but if the issue gets worse, we will probably look elsewhere.<br /><br />See the customer image I posted of the near empty cups from our most recent order.<br /><br />UPDATE: After a few more empty cups, we have decided to go with other options. It was not worth it to throw out around 5 cups from every batch when other K-Cup options are getting cheaper and cheaper.
