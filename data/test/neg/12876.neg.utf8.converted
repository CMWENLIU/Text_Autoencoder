I picked up a box of Grove Square "single cup" coffee (medium roast) at Wal-Mart. I should have shaken the box and compared it to another brand and maybe I would have caught on before I left the store. At home when I took one of the cups out to put in my Keurig machine I shook the cup and was alarmed at the noise. Regular K-Cups don't make that much of a noise. I brewed one to test it and the coffee was just so-so.<br /><br />After the K-Cup cooled down, I took a knife and removed the foil top. There was nothing there. At all. Just an empty cup. In other K-Cups there is a filter and the coffee grinds are left in the in the filter. Since there was no filter, no coffee grinds left in the cup, and none in my cup of coffee, then the Grove Square "single cup" coffee is glorified instant coffee.<br /><br />I was not impressed. They are being returned to Wal-Mart.
