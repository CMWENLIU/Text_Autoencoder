We ordered Hooter Wing Sauce for a party.  The packsge arrived the day of the party.  When we opened the box we had recieved Chipolte Salad Dressing. We contacted the return center and had to send digital pictures of the salad dressing before Nutricity would issue a return label.  We recived the email with the return label, however the FedEx label was for drop off only. We live in a rural area and the closest drop point is 20 miles away. We have called Lauren - the contact on the label for local pick up and have left at least 3 messages that we need Fed Ex to stop and pick the package up.  We have not recieved a response from Nutricity about the local pick-up.  We paid to have the product delivered to our home.  Nutricity sent the wrong item. They can send a truck to pick it up at our home.  Fed Ex trucks go passed our house daily. Still waiting to return item.
