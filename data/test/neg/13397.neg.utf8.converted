Talk about packing a punch!  They're not joking when they say these are WASABI seaweed snacks.  I thought my nose and sinuses would explode from the intense wasabi sting.  After my eyes cleared and I had wiped away the tears, I read the package to see if there was some kind of warning label..."Warning: only for the insane!"  I can't eat them straight out of the package, it's too intense for me.  I've had to find other creative uses for them...adding to soups or pasta dishes or on top of a salad.  I purchased these with the intention of eating them as a snack replacement for potato chips.  Sadly, not an option with this flavor, so I won't be purchasing these again.  I'll stick with the non wasabi versions!
