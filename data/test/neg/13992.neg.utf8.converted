Somebody at Eden needs to package these differently...I opened up my shipment today and there was a big sticky purple puddle in the box.  I love this company and buy loads of their products but this particular product was a disappointment.  And to those people who say "Dont review the shipping, review the product" I'm not going to eat something that is leaking all over the place AND the packaging is part of the cost I'm paying for these. Why can't they come in a plastic tub that snaps/screws shut securely...the price on the item certainly justifies that.
