I have purchased this as well. The plastic is so thin that when I drink from the bottle, and of course I drink it fast when i'm thirsty, the plastic practically gives out. It crushes as more water excapes and unlike the other bottles, when you pause from drinking to let the air go back into the bottle, it stays crushed. It doesn't matter if I even try to mold it back to it's normal "bottle" form with my hands. Useless! So you have to drink it all in one sitting so that you may recycle the bottle right away. Otherwise, your left with a deformed bottle you have to lay down flat in the fridge. Which ends up taking more space and it looks ridiculous.
