I like to consider myself a connoisseur in teas and this is by far one of the WORST blends I have ever had the misfortune to try. This blend tastes like an accumulation of old socks and sweaty feet. Lipton tea is leagues better than this garbage. I have tried the Earl Grey blend by Taylors of Harrogate and it was great; one of my favorite purchases ever. However, this blend turned out to be revolting. I bought this 2 pack, brewed one cup, took one sip and dumped out both packages straight into the trash. Awful tea, would not recommend it to my worst enemy.
