I love white tea and was looking for something new.  I gave this a try, and since I had enjoyed rose-hips in my tea before I thought I would enjoy it.  Not the case.  There was no vacuum sealed bag to begin with when I first opened the tin.  The next thing that hit me was the smell, it smells just like potpourri.  I gave it a few chances and every time the rose was over powering. I even tried multiple steepings to help mellow out the flavor and the rose was still an assault on my nose and taste buds. I can't even taste the white tea through the rose.  Also, the rose in this tea is not rose-hips, but actual rose petals.  Will not be buying again.
