The very first indgerint is what? CORN! Yes CORN!  Corn in dog food= cheap food. Dogs were not made to eat lots of corn, yes they need carbs but corn is too cheap. And meat? second ingerdint but it is a MEAT BY-PROUDUCT. Witch means hoofs, guts, eyes, brains, ect... Stuff humans don't want to eat. Pay a little more and buy Purina ONE, pliz.
