My 4 year old Jack Russell loves Natural Balance. I switch from Sweet Potato and Chicken and Sweet Potato and Fish formula. He's been on this diet for 2 years now. I just ordered for the first time the food on Amazon. He is hesitant in eating the food and then when he does he throws up! He's been on this diet for 2 years and now with this new package he is ill...so be warned. I usually pick up the food in Petco and did not have an issue before.<br />$30+ wasted, I empty the entire bag in a sealed container...can't return :(
