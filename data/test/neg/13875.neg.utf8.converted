I am always on the lookout for good ~100-calorie snacks. Clocking in at 90 calories, they definitely have the right count. Sadly, the brownies themselves are not very good to eat. They are not at all filling (a common thing with snacks with this low of a calorie count), which means they after eating one, you will still want something else to eat. The texture of the brownies is not good, plus they have a very unpleasant aftertaste.<br /><br />And the worst thing is that something in the brownie, perhaps the chicory root extract, gave me gastrointestinal distress - something I definitely don't want at work.<br /><br />I was not pleased with these brownies, and I definitely do not recommend them.
