<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SIY3O2">Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Peppered, Mega Pack, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a>This order took five days to deliver and this is Florida with high humidity and high heat. Upon receipt I opened each package because I always place in my fridge in gallon zip locks. I ordered two of the mega two-packs and three of the four were fine. The fourth was FULL of mold which was visible through the packaging. I am seriously disappointed (and grossed-out). No returns/exchanges means I will NEVER purchase foods items from Amazon again.<br /><br />Update: After figuring out a way to contact Customer Service despite their policy of no returns on food items, they credited back 1/4 of total purchase price and offered free next day shipping for this item (which I will not use). Never again.
