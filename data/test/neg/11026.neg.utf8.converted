I've had Capri Sun Tropical Punch, Kiwi Strawberry and the Roarin Waters Tropical Fruit and this Roarin Waters is nowhere near as good as the other two. It's got almost like a diet taste to it which leads to a nasty aftertaste as well. I have been drinking them at basement room temperature though as I am sensitive to very cold drinks. Maybe these would taste better coming from the fridge but I don't see how much a difference that could make.
