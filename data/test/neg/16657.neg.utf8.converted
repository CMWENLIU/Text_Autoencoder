Been purchasing this product for years. I have enjoyed it's dark color and molasses like taste. I opened a new shipment this morning and immediately noticed that the color of the produce has changed. Instead of the usual dark amber color, the sugar is almost blond. Upon tasting it I found that along with the loss of color it has also lost much of it's unique taste. It's almost like using white sugar. I think this will be the LAST order from this supplier for me.
