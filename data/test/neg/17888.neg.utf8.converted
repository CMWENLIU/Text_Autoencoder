I was shocked when I received this gourmet chocolate gift.The worst part I ordered two to send as gifts. I'm really ashamed of the size and they are definitely overpriced.  I'm really disappointed with Amazon for using photography to make the items look much bigger than they really are. I wish I had read the reviews prior to my order. I order frequently from amazon. I guess I need to keep my purchases to books,cds and dvd's./
