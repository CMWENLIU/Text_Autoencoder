This may be better than a bouillon cube, but it's still not great.  This Better Than Bouillon isn't absolutely terrible for straight stock but if you try to then use that stock to make sauces or demi-glazes, instead of getting a richer flavor, ugh, they just get saltier and saltier and saltier as the reduction occurs.  Do yourself a favor and pay a little more for Minor's.
