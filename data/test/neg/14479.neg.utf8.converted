I really like the product, especially as a post-workout 'refuel.' I couldn't find it where I usually shopped in California, so I ordered it off Amazon. Then when I was in Arizona I found it at Fry's for only $1.25 per bottle (vs. the ~$2.50 per bottle it costs on Amazon).<br /><br />I went online to Shamrock Farms website product locator and will be buying it at a store near my house instead of online. All in all a great product, but if you want to save some money check out the supermarket first(at $1 savings per bottle and 4 bottles per week you'd save $208 a year).
