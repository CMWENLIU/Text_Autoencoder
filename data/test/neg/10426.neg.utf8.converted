The price seemed good on these, but not in the final analysis.  Many of the quarters have hard layers on the outside that are too tough to chew.  So I cut them off.  There are also fibrous centers that have a very unpleasant texture on the tongue and sometimes seem almost prickly.  So now I have more to cut out.The result is that I have to work hard to cut out almost half the food.  Not only is this a hassle, but it raises the effective price per pound way above other seemingly more expensive alternatives.  Needless to say, I won't buy this brand again.
