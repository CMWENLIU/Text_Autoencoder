As the previous reviewer mentions, I thought this would be a great way to have mustard on hand for when I bring sandwiches to the office.  Imagine my surprise when this case of mustard packets showed up on June 3rd and indicated they were "best by" September of 2011.  I think even when I worked at a fast food restaurant as a teenager we would not go through a case of packets in just 10 weeks.<br /><br />Very disappointing as I had expected them to be good for at least a year.<br /><br />I'm sure they will still be edible but not as fresh as they could be.  Mine were shipped from D&J shopping connection, so maybe try another seller to order this from.
