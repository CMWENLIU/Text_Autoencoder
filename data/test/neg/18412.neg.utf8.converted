I am on the board of an animal shelter, and have 23 cats of my own.  We were directed to Wellness as an excellent no-grain food.  We buy the largest sized cans, and we spend almost $800 per month on this food.  The cats used to love all of the flavors we bought (Turkey, Chx, Chx and Beef, Turkey and Salmon) and suddenly NONE of them will eat ANY of them!  I can only surmise that something has happened to the recipe, or the quality of the ingredients.  It makes no sense.  More bizarre, we feed the outdoor (feral) cats the food and many of them won't touch it, either.  The hunt is on to find the next "great food"...
