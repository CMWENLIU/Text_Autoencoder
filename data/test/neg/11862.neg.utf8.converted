I've been researching Orgain online trying to figure out what happened considering I used to live on it but now can no longer even FIND it. Like many of the other reviews mention - I lived on this stuff for breakfast and would purchase it by the case for months. I immediately noticed the flavor change that other reviews have mentioned (I always ordered the chocolate flavor) and agree the new ingredient flavor change was NOT for the better. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Then I suddenly realized that Orgain was no longer available at ALL in my local Whole Foods where I used to find it in both the shelf and chilled sections of the store. I then noticed that my 'subscribe & save' case shipping from Amazon quit shipping entirely after a years on-going subscription. I mentioned this to the friend who first introduced me to Orgain only to hear her tell me that our very popular and local vegetarian grocery store, Rainbow Grocery, has also quit selling it. I assumed that Orgain went out of business but I am still finding it online here at Amazon (just no longer with subscribe & save option) - and the official website appears to be up and running (with Whole Foods still quite confusingly being listed as a retail provider). I checked another Whole Foods retail store in another city and they, too, have quit selling this product which leads me to believe that Whole Foods has backed out entirely.<br /><br />Super frustrated and really disappointed on all counts. I am actively seeking, like other customers, a new replacement. I tried Muscle Milk the other day -- GROSS!
