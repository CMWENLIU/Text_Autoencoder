I have a couple grand kids that had a flu bug.<br />They ate this cereal hrs before they got sick.<br />Just a note.....the flu was going around at that time, being sick had nothing to do with them eating this cereal.<br />Needless to say, their bottoms were stained with a bluish green color. How much food coloring are these kids eating?
