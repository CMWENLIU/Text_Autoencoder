Recently, I purchased a can of Oregon Dark Bing Cherries. While making my jello recipe, I noticed strange elongated pieces in the jello after adding the bing cherries, which originally looked fine.  After fishing these pieces out, to my horror, they were worms. My advise to anyone using these canned cherries is, to cut them in half and examine them first before using them in a recipe.
