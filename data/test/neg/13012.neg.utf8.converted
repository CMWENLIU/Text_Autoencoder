Ok so I was doing some research to find good deals on formula. I am not sure if many of you know, but if you go to the Similac website and sign-up to be a Similac mom they will send you frequent coupons in the mail. Not just any coupons kiddos. $5.00 off of any sized Similac formula as long as it does not cost less than 5 bucks. My baby is 2 weeks old and I have gotten these coupons in the mail twice already. 7 coupons in total. That is a lot of saving!Also, a huge plus is when you can use double coupons. Stack store coupons with the manufacturer coupons. This will help you save a lot of dough. Good luck and I hope this was helpful.
