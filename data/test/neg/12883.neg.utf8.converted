I did not realize this coffee was instant before I bought it. The cups were only 1/4 filled with grinds that you can shake like noise makers (versus the packed, quiet, REAL coffee k-cups). Above all however, the taste is flat, acidic, and bitter like most instant coffees are. I felt deceived. The box should have been more clear. WILL NOT buy again to save $3.
