I have not had a chance to try this soup. When it arrived, all the packages, all 4 of them, were torn open and there is no way that I can seperate the contents to make the soup.<br /><br />It sounds delicious, but I have no way of knowing. I wish the people who make this product would send me another to try at their expense and sealed in a better way.<br /><br />Actually, I have no real true way to give it any stars as much as I would like to.
