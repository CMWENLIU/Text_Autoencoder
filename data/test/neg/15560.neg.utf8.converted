I really like this cereal and thought a larger package would be a good idea.  But the package you receive is nothing like what is pictured.  The cereal came in a big brown cardboard shipping box.  The box contained a large plastic bag that was knotted at the top to seal it. The cereal tasted fine, but there were a lot of small bugs living in the bag along with the cereal. I'm going to stick to the smaller packages from now on.
