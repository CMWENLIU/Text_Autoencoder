The original release of Throwback in the blue cans was wonderful!  I stocked up a year's supply.  Then Pepsi released Throwback again after the initial run in the red/white/blue cans this year.  BEWARE!  This second release soda is horrible!  It has a chemical/artificial lemony aftertaste like stewed sweat socks in vinegar.  Totally disgusting.  WHY oh why, Pepsi?  Why did you change the formula for Throwback?  After decades of being loyal to Pepsi (until three years ago when I gave up everything with HFCS in it for health and weight management reasons) I thought I could enjoy Pepsi again.  You ruined it, and actually drove me to "MexiCoke".  (Coke made in Mexico with pure cane sugar in 12 oz glass bottles - many Costcos are carrying them now. Check it out!)<br /><br />Original Throwback (blue cans) was a mix of beet and cane sugar.  This new version has got to be mostly beet sugar - nothing else could explain the bizarre aftertaste from hell.<br /><br />Also, for Passover, the major soda companies release sugar-sweetened soda (Passover is apparently no corn products allowed time).  You can spot the special 2 litres by different coloured caps.  I believe Coke's are yellow caps on the bottles, don't know what Pepsi does.  I plan to keep buying MexiCokes since my Costco now carries them, and also sampling the "Passover" Coke/Pepsi to see if it is any better.  If so, I'll stock up to last until next Passover.<br /><br />Thanks for screwing up a fantastic product, Pepsi!  The new stuff tastes NOTHING like original pre-HFCS Pepsi, while last year's release did.
