The product description and listed shipping weight (12.7 pounds) made me think I was getting an amazing deal on a 12-pack of green olives, but I only received one jar.  Too good to be true, I suppose!<br /><br />I also took a chance on the Kalamata olives from the same seller (PTOmart/Saucier Enterprises, though I see that the seller for the green ones is now listed as Tropical Traditions), which didn't mention 12 jars but listed the ITEM weight at 10.8 pounds.  But the SHIPPING weight is listed at 10.1 OUNCES, which makes sense since I only received one jar of those as well.  I'll take the blame for that one...<br /><br />Anyway, hope this helps someone avoid the same mistake(s)!
