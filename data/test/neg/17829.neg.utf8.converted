DEC. 21, 2010<br />Since the "coffee revolution" spread from Seattle and captured almost every county in the U.S., there is no shortage of well-roasted coffee beans in regular and decaf for nearly every taste, provided by the larger roasters as well as by small operators. I hang out at a Starbucks with a terrific view and with the "Cheers" effect, and I currently like their Sumatra blend for decaf and Komodo Dragon Bold blend for regular.<br />Any coffee connoisseur will buy whole beans and grind just enough, in a BURR grinder, to brew. I use a (Braun) drip grinder with unbleached filters.<br />I "grew up" with low-acid, aero-therm roasted Heimbs coffee in North Germany and still like it when I am over there visiting. I also enjoyed the Jacobs blend that I discovered on ICE trains, in many restaurants or on the airplane(s) on trips in recent years.<br /><br />I ordered a batch of Jacobs Kr&ouml;nung recently for sentimental reasons and in order to get a large enough combined order that qualifies for free shipping. I was aware of the "ground" label.<br /><br />What I received was close to a powdered consistency, definitely NOT SUITABLE for DRIP brewing nor for French Press. I actually had particles penetrating the filter paper and ending up in my cup. Ridiculous. I was not excited about the TASTE either but realize that could be tweaked by varying the quantity and perhaps by using different water. I am not planning to do so and will probably give the remaining three packages away.<br /><br />Unless amazon.com offers whole-bean Jacobs, I will not order this product again nor will I recommend it to anybody.<br />Amazon should label this product as "not suitable for drip brewing".
