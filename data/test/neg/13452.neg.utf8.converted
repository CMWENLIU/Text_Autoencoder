I chose Westbrae's canned beans because they are organic. However, since then I've discovered that Westbrae uses cans with BPA in the lining. With BPA lining the cans and research showing solid levels leeching from cans and plastics into containers' contents, showing up in Americans' blood streams from infants to the elderly, I don't think the product can still be called organic! it isn't any better than products sprayed with pesticides, which can be washed off many foods (not all, though). Until Westbrae stops using BPA lined cans or stops claiming the organic label and charging organic prices, I can't give high marks.<br /><br />As additional information:<br /><br />I ordered a lot of food and other items when I made this purchase, thinking everything I ordered was from Amazon; but, while everything else Was shipped by Amazon, for some reason this one product ended up shipped by Nutricity.<br /><br />Nutricity charged more for the shipping than they did for the product, which amounted to $3.49 per can. At those prices, even without BPA in the cans' lining, these beans would not be worth that price!<br /><br />(I emailed Nutricity twice and they ignored me. I emailed Amazon twice, and after the second time, Amazon refunded the shipping charge due to "the circumstances" of the order.)
