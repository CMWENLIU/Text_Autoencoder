I was in the market for "cracked hominy", "pearl hominy", or "pashofa corn" (corn ground only enough to allow the kernel hull to be removed - a little bigger than BBs, or peppercorns), and from the product photo, thats what was being sold.  What I received was just plain, cereal-grade grits, about as coarse as regular yellow cornmeal.  They're good, mind you, just not what I was led to expect.
