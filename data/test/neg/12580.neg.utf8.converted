I usually don't write product reviews but I decided that it was necessary this time. I've ordered this coffee sampler several times and the last 2 times I have been disappointed with the variety that I have received.  In both orders I received over a third of the k-cup flavors in hazelnut. I like hazelnut but I thought the idea of a coffee sampler was to get a variety of flavors. I will not be ordering this sampler again!
