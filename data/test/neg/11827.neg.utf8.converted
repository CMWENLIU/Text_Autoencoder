Those people who wrote positive reviews on this pepperoni are definitely their workers doing their job behind the computer.<br />These smell bad, taste bad and looks bad.<br />I love pepperoni, I love them cooked but preferably eat it raw.<br />They should be licking finger good. But Nope! Not these.<br />It has that after taste and before taste. Very strong beefy like taste.<br />Like that other one star review, it smells awful but not that bad when eating.<br />It is edible but definitely not enjoying ones.<br /><br />I'm gonna try to put these on pizza and have it cooked all the way.<br />Or else We're gonna throw away 6 packs of these.
