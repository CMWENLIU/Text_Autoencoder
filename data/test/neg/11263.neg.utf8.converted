I got this as a gift... and the products in the basket look nothing like what is in the picture. All the bath products and the basket I received were cheapo versions of what is in the actual picture. The labels are all cleverly printed with home-made "Art of Appreciation" logos, but once you read the original product labels on the back and you see that it says ingredients for "LOITOIN" instead of lotion, it makes you wonder where they got these from and if I should even be putting it on my body... And the body scrub and "loitoin" are the exact same pastel green goop but just in different bottles. I mean, if you're charging people $50 a basket, maybe you could afford to supply your materials from somewhere other than the dollar store... and the towel is not green. I guess since people who buy these things don't actually get them for themselves, its ok to rip them off and send knock-offs to their friends. I was so happy when I got this in the mail, until I found out how much you overcharged my lover for this basket of .99 cent bath "loitoin." I wish I could include a picture for others to see.
