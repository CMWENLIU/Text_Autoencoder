I have to say first off that I love Tinkyada products. But I accidentally bought the white rice spaghetti instead of the brown rice spaghetti and I found a product I don't like from Tinkyada. My son (7) and I have Celiac's sprue and so eat gluten free everything. My son isn't usually picky about his gluten free food, but he won't eat the white rice noodles at all. I will eat them, but I definitely prefer the brown rice ones over these.
