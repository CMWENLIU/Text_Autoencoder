This is my all-time favorite spice; we call it "secret weapon" around our kitchen.  We use it profusely.  Last time I bought this was in September of 2009, 3 flats for a total of 36 pieces.  I was about to reorder today and notice the price has gone through the roof, i.e., there has been a WHOPPING TWENTY-FOUR PERCENT INCREASE.  So I checked other websites which sell the individual, 3 oz. shakers.  Those prices are unchanged.  Next on the agenda:  check the Euro/dollar exchange rate.  In September of 2009, the simple average for the month was ~145 which is ~ where the Euro/dollar is trading now.  Mentioning the exchange rate, though, is only meant for purposes of example  Because Aromat is manufactured by Unilever which is a huge multinational corporation.  Therefore I am ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that they have currency hedges in place to avoid wild price fluctuations such as an ungodly 24%. Bottom line:  THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE PRODUCT ITSELF TO HAVE HAD ANY WHERE NEAR THIS PRICE MOVE.  So I am going to chalk this up to increased shipping costs, noting that what used to be "1 day shipping" and "2 day shipping" are now more like 2 and 3-day, respectively.  On top of that, the #3.99 flat fee for what used to be true 1 day shipping was modified about a year ago to be #3.99 PER ITEM additional shipping even if they ship in the same box.  I also understand that signing up for regular, repeat shipping of an item does not "LOCK" the price in for the duration.  Amazing.  These not-so-subtle changes over time tell me that we can expect more of the same across the board.  And as consumers, we have to make hard choices. Because next on the agenda, the States will likely push for taxes.  Add that on top of the wildly escalating cost of shipping and it won't make sense for me to do so much on-line shopping because convenience can only offset so much of the cost. And that threshold is approaching fast. I am now exploring ordering this item in bulk directly from Europe.  It used to be available here in 2.2 lb. packages (1 kilogram)but that was discontinued.  However, they still package it like that all over Europe ... and Asia in the large size.  No more Amazon on this one!  Very, very unfortunate.
