I've been eating organic raw almonds for several years, buying them instead of the non-organic ones because of their better flavor and texture.  I found minimal flavor in these Sunridge Farms raw almonds and the texture chewy rather than crisp. I'll go back to the ones from the local large upscale natural foods store, where they are about 3 dimes more.
