As someone with digestive issues, I was so happy to find Orgain to help me gain and maintain my weight.  The ingredients are superior to most products out there and could serve as a meal on the go.  The new formula change, however, was not for the better.  It leaves a chalky aftertaste and just does not taste as good as the original.  As someone who does not have cancer, I also liked that I was getting additional anti-oxidants in the original formula. I am not sure who they used as taste testers, but the original was far better than the new stuff.  I seriously hope they consider going back to the original formula or making some changes to improve the new formula.
