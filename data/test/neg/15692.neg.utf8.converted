Despite the "all natural" vibe the can emanates, the product is anything but. It's made with natural flavors and colors but then they hit you with Sucralose, and it has sugar anyways...please just use only cane sugar, the drink is much too sweet anyways. I am also disappointed that they only use 5% cherry juice. The other ingredients they use besides caffeine are in such minute quantities they will never accomplish anything. What's the point of including .01 mg of Flax Seed extract? I guess it looks good on the label. I'm surprised they had the balls to actually disclose the ridiculous fairy dusting of ingredients.<br /><br />On top of all this Bing has a very weird smell and aftertaste. The initial taste is mildly enjoyable, but overall it's a subpar energy drink. It can't hold a candle up to Guru energy.
