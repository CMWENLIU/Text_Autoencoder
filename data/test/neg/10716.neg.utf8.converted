This sounded like a great idea for a teething dog, but it didn't work for either of mine. As another reviewer said, it's basically a fabric toy that you soak in water and freeze - but the plastic bag ripped after being frozen, it thawed quickly leaving a wet mess, and most significantly, neither of my dogs were the slightest bit interested in it. I too would freeze an old wet sock instead.
