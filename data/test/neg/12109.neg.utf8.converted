in the description again.  When I ordered this ib Jan. 09, they had a pretty little picture making it look "wholesome."  The box that arrived is colored white rock "candy" (their words)and definately not from Europe.  I was looking for a non-refined product.  Euro grocer lost this customer.<br /><br />Edit to add that when I posted this review it was called "sugar" not candy.  I was seeking the gourmet sugar crystals that are served by high end caterers.<br /><br />edit 2012 - When I purchased this - it was sold by another seller and was advertised as natural sugar.  I see that this seller is upfront about what the item is and commend them for it.
