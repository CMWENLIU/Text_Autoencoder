These are not the York Peppermint Patties that I am accustomed to. They are very noticeably made of lower quality ingredients. After I took a single bite I could tell something was wrong, so I checked the packaging and sure enough these are manufactured in Mexico (I saw on another variety here on Amazon that people were complaining about the quality of the 'Made in Mexico' York Peppermint Patties). This product is a waste of money.
