I bought this product, remembering the sweet almond taste of the Orzata beverage.  To my surprise, the sour taste of the added citric acid was strong enough to make the overall flavor tart instead of sweet.  Compare the ingredients in Ferrara Almond Orzatata Syrup to the ingredients of Monin Almond Syrup, and the difference is obvious.<br /><br />Ferrara:  sugar, water, almond extract, citric acid, artificial color, 1/10th of 1% sodium benzoate(as preservative)<br /><br />Monin: Pure cane sugar, water, natural almond flavor<br /><br />I rest my case.
