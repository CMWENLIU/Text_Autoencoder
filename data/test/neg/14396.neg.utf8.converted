Unfortunately I did not read all the 1-star ratings on this product prior to purchasing.  I had similar experiences with this Navitas product having black spots and mold.  Some of the berries were extremely dried out but nothing to be concerned about because it is dried fruit.  I have read articles stating that eating too much of this at one time can cause gastrointestinal issues.  Yes, I experienced that but do not fault Navitas.  I am disappointed with black spots and mold because it was on about 1/3 of the berries.  I do fault Navitas for that.  I decided to throw away the remaining amount instead of picking out the good berries because mold spores can spread and did not want to get sick.  When the local Whole Foods had goji berries in the bulk department, I did not see any of the mold or black spots.  I will look at other brands as recommended by other reviewers.
