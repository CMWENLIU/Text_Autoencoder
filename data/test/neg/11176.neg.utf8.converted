I unpacked the box of Old Wisconsin turkey snack bite sausage pieces and put the separate packages on my pantry shelf and kept one out to open and my mouth was watering.  After the first package was consumed I took another package of them out of the pantry and started in on it.  Wasn't too much later in the following week I noticed a pretty unpleasant smell in the pantry.  I thought for sure a rodent had got trapped somehow and probably died and was slowly rotting somewhere I could not see nor could I find anything of the sort.  The smell lasted and I scratched my head and wondered if the dead thing would eventually just dry up. Pretty soon my whole place smelled like the county landfill on a busy day. Well, it wasn't too long I went to grab another bag of the turkey sausage and gosh I found out the hard way where the small was emanating from all this time.  The bag of sausage I had just picked up was all rotted inside and it was totally putrid.  It was totally disgusting and it made my stomach feel a tad queasy.  I took the bag out and placed it in my garbage can and now I just can't wait till the City of Oswego KS comes and empties that can at the landfill. I have had my fill of this stuff! I doubt I will ever buy sausages from this company again!
