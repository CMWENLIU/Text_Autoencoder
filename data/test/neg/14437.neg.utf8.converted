My son want to make bubble tea at home so I ordered this kit.<br />It didn't taste anything like the bubble tea we have had, it just<br />tastes like chemicals. We couldn't even drink it. The tapioca pearls<br />were very chewey.<br /><br />I am going to return it. Oops, their return policy doesn't allow returns of food.
