I have had Twinging's Lapsang Souchong in the U.K., and this is a totally differrent and inferior product.  There is barely any smokey flavor -- it is as though they have put it through the flaor removing machine.  I suspect it is either very cheap Lapsang Souchong or they are mixing it with an unsmoked black tea.  Definitely inferior.  Try another brand or try to get the UK version in the black box.  Yuck!
