The Buster Cube and the Mini Cube is a great idea! The problem is that I almost broke all of my ten fingers, trying to get the inner cylinder out (for cleaning purpose). I let several people try it, because I thought there might be a trick...none of them was successful! I even went to Petsmart where they sell that toy. Needless to say that nobody there was successful as well. I ended up sending it back and putting some ice on my hurt fingers!!! 2 Stars for the idea...
