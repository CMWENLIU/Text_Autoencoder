I was quite hopeful about this candy, as I love the flavour of violet and having an inexpensive bulk supply would be quite nice.<br /><br />Unfortunately, rather than using a natural violet flavour, this candy uses an artificial one.  This makes it take on a rather flat and overpowering floral note, without any of the more interesting characteristics of violet (real violet flavouring always had a spicy undertone that reminded me of celery seed.)<br /><br />Additionally, the artificial colouring gives it a bitter note on the back of the tongue.  The flavour of the violet candy put out by L'Anis de Flavigny is much superior (and also available from Amazon.)
