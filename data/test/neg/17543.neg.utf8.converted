I purchased 3 brands of "pantry pest" type traps.  The "Pro Pest" brand FAR EXCEEDED the "Safer" brand.  Right now, "Pro pest" has 40 moths on it.  "Safer" has NONE!  I am a researcher, so trust me that I have controlled the performance environment of each product:  switching their locations, etc. Doesn't seem to matter:  "Pro Pest" is the clear winner and "Safer" has yet to catch anything!
