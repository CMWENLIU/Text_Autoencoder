When I bought this, there were no ingredients to be found. Not here. Not on the maker's lame web site.  From what I could tell by the photo, it looks like coconut water, pineapple, orange and watermelon... and that sounded really good.<br /><br />I actually complained to the company that there was no information, and they added the content to this page.  As you will see, it now says "coconut water, pink guava, oranges, red dragon fruit, and pineapple"... and gross.<br /><br />I don't know where the pink guava and whatever the frig red dragon fruit is on the photo, but apparently what I thought was a watermelon is one of the two.  I have also tasted the plain coconut water, and the only good thing about that is that it is a base to add with something else.  The only combination that works and is tolerable to drink is the coconut and pineapple combo.  And even after a couple of those, you don't really enjoy it.  But this tropical fruit case is still in my fridge.  I tried 4 different times, and each time I have had to dump it.<br /><br />... and Rihanna is certainly not a selling plus for me. I can't tolerate her either.
