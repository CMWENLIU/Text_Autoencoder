Kraft Pure Honey.  Sounds wonderful and "oh-so-wholesome", right?  Well maybe, but there is a problem.  When this product arrived I learned that it was a product of the USA, Brazil, and Vietnam.  There are two problems with that.<br /><br />The first is that US honey producers are struggling to survive, and cannot hope to compete with the price of honey produced in the third world.  Why do we care?  Because they are vital to our survival, and our ability to produce food.  We need to make a concerted effort to patronize US honey.<br /><br />The second concern is that many pesticides banned here in the US are still used in places like Vietnam and Brazil.  (And the ones still in use here are bad enough!) Because of the nature of bees and the production of honey, it seems inevitable that some contamination is likely to occur.  For that reason, I am not terribly thrilled with the idea of consuming honey originating anywhere other than the US, Canada, or Europe.<br /><br />Other than the above concerns, the honey is well packaged, and visually attractive.  But I am now looking for a source of honey packets containing only honey sourced in the US.
