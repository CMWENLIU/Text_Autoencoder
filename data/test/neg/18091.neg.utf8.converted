I bought this after reading high reviews in various places about how this is supposed to be one of the best hot cocoas.  It does a better job of getting the flavor of cocoa out than others have but the improvements are ruined by the inclusion of sucralose.  It provides that off putting after taste to the whole thing.  If you don't mind the taste of sucralose/splenda then this is probably pretty good for you.  I just really wish they'd just used sugar for the whole thing.  Oh well, back to cocoa packets for now.
