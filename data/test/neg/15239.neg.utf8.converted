How can you expect sales of a product with no information? No indication of amount, type, pkg, nothing. Does it contain one leaf or one teabag? One pound? How fresh? Organic? For the people who don't like reviews when the product has not been tested: Normally I would agree. But they are selling on Amazon like a professional company without any of the required information. Consider this a review of the amateur, gross inefficiency or, worse, dishonesty of the product sales venue. Amazon should not even allow it here, it downgrades their credibility.
