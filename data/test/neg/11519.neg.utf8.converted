I have a 3 yr. old pomeranian and 2 yr. old mini schnauzer. I switched the pom from Nutro to Innova Evo slowly and he was fine for about a month, all I noticed were slightly looser stools, but unless I mix his food with some plain rice, he get's very sick and doesn't stop having diarrhea. I adopted my schnauzer more recently and she can't handle the high amount of protein in this food AT ALL. They both get sick on and off so unfortunately I'm going to have to discontinue feeding my dogs this food. I strongly do not recommend Innova EVO for smaller breeds.
