I wanted to like this. I really did. I like the company's approach. Simple, minimalistic, natural ingredients to bring soda back from it's junk, empty calorie stigma. It's something to be applauded. But they missed the mark here. Is it less sweet? Certainly. Is it crisp? Sure. Is it refreshing? Yea, I could give them that. I'll even give them the claim that the soda doesn't overpower. They're damned right it doesn't because the flavor is just lacking!<br /><br />They call this one the Blood Orange flavor. I've had blood oranges and if you've had blood oranges, you love them and you wish you could get more. They're flavorful, sweet, delicious, and juicy every time. It's like a miracle. There's none of that here. If they used blood oranges in this, I mourn the loss of those noble fruits. They perished in vain. It's as if someone took a bottle of club soda and accidentally dripped a couple of drops of orange juice or some sort of citrus based juice into it. That's about all you could taste. Is it oranges? Maybe. It smells like oranges so it certainly smells good. But you don't buy soda for it's scent.<br /><br />They could have something, if only their soda was more than fancy club soda.
