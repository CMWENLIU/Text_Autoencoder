I've opened 4 of the 8 packages of Greenies, one was rancid.  My cat started vomiting after eating the Salmon Greenies. I compared them with another package only to find that they had yellow-orange spots instead of being entirely green.  I smelled them and they smelled different too.  Normally Greenies are great treats for my cats but rancid products are not acceptable. EntirelyPets and other suppliers have to be aware of the age of the product they are selling according to when they buy it from<br />Greenies.  I could not find an expiration date on the packages.  Greenies is manufactured by S&M Nutec and they should be providing expiration dates.
