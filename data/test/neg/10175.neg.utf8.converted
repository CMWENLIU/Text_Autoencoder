The coffee flavor is awesome, one of my all-time favorites - but the price?  Almost $40 for the 2-pack, plus shipping?  C'mon gimme a break!  Order direct from Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (the people who make it) for $26 for the 2 of them ($13 each) plus shipping.  Whoever priced this so high must be smoking something!
