It's possible that this product is aimed at children: with its cloying super-sweetness and otherwise bland, cardboard-like taste, it resembles Trix, the cereal so loved by that Silly Rabbit. But the hype of the cereal seems aimed at adults, with its "Nature's Path" brand and claims of gluten-free whole grain goodness and flax seed. For me, the real question is, why bother? There are so many yummy gluten free cereals now on the market, my favorites being Trader Joe's varieties of GF granola, which are delicious, that this product will not be on my radar screen. It's just not tasty enough to compete.
