For those of you concerned about the fire hazard with this product, the same thing happened to us this evening. The fire was almost immediate, and the smoke was pretty intense. The fire in the microwave continued to burn until it was doused, and now the whole house smells burnt, even after ventilating for hours.  It looked like it could have burned out of control if someone weren't watching it close enough to see it flame up.<br /><br />My microwave is ruined. My house stinks of smoke. We probably avoided a disaster out of sheer luck.<br /><br />This product is not safe for use by children, or perhaps even adults.
