I read most of the reviews (especially the negative ones) about this product before purchasing and knew of the possibility that this particular model may not fit the brand of natural PB my wife likes (16 oz Natural Organic PB from Trader Joe's in a plastic jar).  I decided to get it because there was a decent chance it would fit.  Without opening the package, I could tell it wouldn't fit.  This could have easily been avoided if the specs were included in the product details.<br /><br />Anyone purchasing this or similar models should know that there are 6 DIFFERENT MODELS TO CHOOSE FROM:<br /><br />#100 -- crank mixer for 16 oz jar with 77mm lid<br />#200 -- twist knob mixer for 16 oz reduced fat jar with 77mm lid<br />#300 -- crank mixer for 16 oz jar with 70mm lid<br />#400 -- crank mixer for 26 oz jar with 83mm lid<br />#500 -- twist knob mixer for 26 oz jar with 83mm lid<br />#600 -- twist knob mixer for 36 oz jar with 99mm lid<br /><br />The product considered in this review refers to Model #100.  Those of you who want it to fit on the Trader Joe's PB that I mentioned earlier will need to get Model #300.<br /><br />As I said in the subject, this product looks like a great idea, but the marketing lacks an important fact (which I find unnecessarily deceptive) so I am giving it a sub-par rating.  It does NOT take much effort to list these very important specs that would help people buy precisely what they need, especially when this info is contained on the back of the product itself.<br /><br />I found the #300 model on another site and am purchasing it separately.  I'm also returning the one I got here.<br /><br />If you're going to get this product, pull out a ruler or measuring tape and measure your lid to ensure you get the right fitting model.  Thanks for reading.
