Ingredients: Sugar, Gum Arabic, Natural Flavor (Oil of Peppermint), Gelatin<br /><br />I was a fan of Altoids mints until I started researching ingredients and found out how gelatin is made. It's not surprising that the tin doesn't advertise, "Contains boiled animal skin, tendons & bones," since most people would not consider these desirable. You don't have to be a vegetarian to have an objection to congealed animal scraps in your breath mints. Altoids may be 100% natural, but they are not made with 100% quality ingredients.  I suggest trying VerMints, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKVT18">VerMints All Natural PepperMints, 1.41-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a>, instead.  They are animal by-product free & taste delicious. And if you're looking for sugar-free mints try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FIWIWA">Emerald Forest Ricochet Sugar Free Mints with Xylitol, Peppermint, 100-Count Tins (Pack of 6)</a>. They are sweetened with xylitol, a natural alternative sweetener, so they don't promote cavities like sugar does. Both of these products come in convenient tins like Altoids and are made with all natural, more appetizing ingredients.
