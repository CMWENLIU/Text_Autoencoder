This product is falsely advertise and its name is completely misleading. I personally contacted the seller about what the 'ACTUAL' ingredients were in this product and here is a quote from them;<br /><br />"It is 8-10 percent HONEY and 90-92 percent CANE SUGAR".<br /><br />This is NOT a true 'HONEY POWDER'. It is simply honey flavored sugar. I would look at Arizona Farms, HiBee and others. They are 100 percent dehydrated honey, no sugar added. I have personally been buying honey powder for years at my local Asian Super market and they sell Arizona and HiBee for about $7-8 per pound and its 100 percent honey.
