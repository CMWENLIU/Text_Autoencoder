I was surprised to have found this item.  I had been looking for it for quite some time as we spend alot of time travelling and want to bring our own creamers (hazelnut flavor) But when i received the order - I was a little disappointed for a few reasons:  (1)some of them had leaked into the carton and (2) the expiration date of item was September 09 (just two months away).  I guess that is why they only had three left to sell (expiration date was coming up).  I believe when advertising an item like this - the expiration of the item should be listed so that we can make a decision on whether to order it or not
