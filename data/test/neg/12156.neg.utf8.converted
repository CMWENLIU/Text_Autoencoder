Ritz Crackers USED TO be my favorite cracker. I loved the buttery flavor with just a little salt.  That all ended with the last box purchased.  The crackers were almost white--half baked, no flavor except heavy salting.  Gone was the golden color, the buttery flavor.  All that was left was white cracker and heavy salt.  I contacted Kraft/Nabisco.  They apparently thought I was complimenting them, and only sent back ads for more Nabisco products.  They were very flip and apparently didn't care that the quality of this product was utterly gone.  Use extreme caution in purchasing this product any more.
