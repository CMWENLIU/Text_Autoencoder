While this protien shake is one of the better tasting I've had, it's not a real protien shake. This only has 10grams of protien compared to most shakes that have about 30g and up.<br />The real "keep away" factor for me is that this shake has 29 g of carbs/ 18 g of this is SUGAR. If you're serious about weight loss, there are much better protien shakes on the market.<br /><br />Try EAS Whey Protien - It comes in a bag and each serving contains 170 calories/only 3 grams of carbs and 30g of protein. I haven't tried chocolate but vanilla is very tasty, especially with (skim)or almond milk.<br /><br />In response to a user comment, yes this product is marketed as an "appetite suppressor" rather than protein shake - however, if you're trying to lose weight - you will need to avoid sugary products, such as this. Spring for a protein shake with MORE protein and LESS sugar. The EAS Whey Protein will NOT taste as good - Special K drinks do taste much better - that is for sure (18 grams of sugar!). Sometimes as a 'treat' I will take 1 scoop EAS Whey Protein (chocolate) , 1 banana, 1 cup almond milk and 1 cup ice - blend well in a blender - and you have a DELICIOUS and HEALTHY protein shake.
