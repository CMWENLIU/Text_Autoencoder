So far I only opened one can.<br /><br />Let me put it this way: if you didn't know it was a salmon you wouldn't would not identify it as such. It is very similar to canned tuna color-wise (white-ish small chunks) and pretty much tasteless. Not even similar to what I purchased in a "big box store" in a larger can (can't  recall the brand but it might have been Bumble Bee too).<br /><br />On the can it says "Tuna style" (you can see it on Amazon's picture if you zoom in). Fish origin is unclear except that it says "Premium Wild" and "Product of Thailand".<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars because I only opened one can. If the second one is the same I will lower the rating to 1 star.<br /><br />UPDATE: second can (and all others after it) is the same. Lowering rating to 1 star.
