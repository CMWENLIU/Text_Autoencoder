Used this 2 times first week of July.  Hair has been falling out profusely ever since.  My scalp is dry and itchy which has never been before. Am hoping this will end soon as I only used this twice..extremely traumatizing, I had beautiful hair before this happened..I may contact the maker to ask what to do and if they know how to make it stop.
