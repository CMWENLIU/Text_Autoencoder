12 out of 24 units is not an assortment.  Decaf is not coffee, and flavored hot drinks are no<br />excuse for not including coffee in the varities dispensed.  I don't care about the<br />packaging, it gets tossed, but to include only 2 or three coffees is ridiculous.<br />I'll not be buying from this seller in the future. Its safer to buy directly from Keurig.
