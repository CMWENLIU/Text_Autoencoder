I have just bought at BJ's a box of 80 K-cups (Green Mountain 100% Colombian dark roast extra bold)for $37 (that is 46.25 cents per cup). I found it similarly priced at Sam's. Do the math and compare. The moral of this comparison is that not everything is cheaper at Amazon specially when Amazon is only the middle man, so to speak.
