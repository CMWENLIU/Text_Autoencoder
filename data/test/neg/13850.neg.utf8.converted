I thought what fun. Fresh tomatoes all year round. The tomatoes bushes grew and grew and went past my hood of my garden and drooped over the top. I am loaded with tons of green tomatoes. Unfortunately, the bottom of the stems are slowly dying and I will end up not harvesting any tomatoes.<br />I have 3 aerogardens. I have tried the lettuces----GREAT. Herbs---GREAT. Petunia-----still blooming up a storm. The tomatoes.....I am hoping to salvage two plants by taking them OUT of the 'water' and planting them in real soil. The Aero Garden works great on the above except the tomatoes.<br /><br />I love my machines. I have given the Aero Garden as Christmas and birthday presents....(I should have stock) but, the tomatoes are a bust. Sorry.
