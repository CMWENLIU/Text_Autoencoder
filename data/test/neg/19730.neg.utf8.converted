Look carefully at the packaging in the store. Nestles' Juicy Juice is now a product of China: China where pesticides and chemicals banned in the U.S.A. are still used. China is a country that has sent us poison toohpaste and dog food and makes use of prison labor. From undermining breastfeeding worldwide, to the implicit condoning of slavery in the production of raw ingredients such as cocoa to importing juice of questionable safety into America, a nation awash in apples; there is no bottom for Nestle. I'd rather buy juice from British Petroleum - at least they don't use slave labor.
