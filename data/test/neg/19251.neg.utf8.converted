This is the worse tea than any fresh green tea. Indeed it was "Green" tea by the time they are produced. Poor storing condition, not in the sealed enviroment, exposed extensively in the air make this tea lost all the flavor. Don't know how old of the tea is but in my experience it's at least 3-5 years old in loose condition in the air. Junk.
