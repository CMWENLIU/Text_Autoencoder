While this maybe more versatile it is definitely not cheaper than buying boxed mac and cheese. The only benefit you get is that you get to pick what kind of pasta you use it for. When i got this I thought this would be great to have, now i can make wheat pasta with this mac and cheese. That was the only benefit....<br />This powdered cheese is in my opinion too expensive and not natural or organic or anything of that nature. It is exactly the same cheese youd get in the Kraft box. It has yellow dyes in it and all the other chemicals and preservatives ...<br />Do yourself a favor spend the extra buck and buy the Hodgson Mill Wheat Mac And Cheese Dinner. No dyes no artificial colors or flavors. Its whole wheat pasta and white cheddar cheese. Its not half bad either for a wheat pasta but none of the artificial stuff like this cheese.
