only 1 of my 2 cats have shown any interest at all in these mylar toys. Shes attracted to the crinkle sound right before i throw it but they dont go very far cause they're so light + they stop moving almost immediately when they hit the floor so she loses interest pretty quickly. As with most cat toys, you just never know until u get it home. 1 cats treasure is another cats yawn.
