I am very uspset.  This product is labeled 32oz.  i specifically bought this in 32 oz because my recipe called for 24 ounces and i wanted to have a little extra.  I was using the honey to brine a turkey for thanksgiving which called for 24 ounces...AND its not even 21 ounces!  very upset...I didnt even have enough for my turkey!!! NOT HAPPY!!!
