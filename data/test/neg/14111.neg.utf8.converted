Why bother creating an alternative grain (that's naturally gluten-free) cereal that's NOT gluten free?!?!?  I bought this knowing millet is generally gluten-free... glad I did more research before I ate it!  Arrowhead Mills has other gluten-free products...  Why not this?  On the packaging, it also DOES NOT include an allergen warning as most food product do now that contain, tree nuts, soy, milk and wheat. Incomplete labeling. Oh well, what could be a great product is sadly not.
