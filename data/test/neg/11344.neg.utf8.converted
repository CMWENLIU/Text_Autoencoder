I wouldn't know how this product tastes as none of the cans were safe enough to try. One of the cans in particular was so squished I'm surprised the box wasn't covered in orange goo. Every single one had dents. I saw another review saying the same and thought maybe that's a fluke or  it's been a while and the problem is fixed so I'll give it a try... it's really too bad.
