I was expecting a full flavor of coconut as I'm used to from other products. It states that it's natural, and I believe them it is natural. However, for someone like me, who likes sweet tasting flavors, it's definitely not a favorite drink. Like me, if you are expecting something sweet tasting with a certain amount of sugar, think twice. It doesn't have a distinct coconut flavor either. Very little, and slight flavor of coconut, almost doesn't exist. Expect something like water, no color. Regular flavored waters you find in supermarkets have a more distinct flavor, but this one doesn't. They are sitting in my fridge and I don't wanna drink them, I have a very good appetite and I'm not a picky person, but I don't want to drink that thing at all. It might be an healthy choice when you play sports and dehydrated. If you are expecting a delightful flavor of coconut, then find something else. Personally, I wouldn't suggest such an expensive drink for just dehydrating.
