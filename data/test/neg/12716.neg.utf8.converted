The nutrition in this cereal is undoubtedly good but the taste is pretty non existent.  It might have been ok when fresh but after being packaged in a plastic pouch it was a mushy mess that was almost inedible.  And expensive.  Do yourself a favor, save your money and cook some quinoa at home if you want this type of cereal.
