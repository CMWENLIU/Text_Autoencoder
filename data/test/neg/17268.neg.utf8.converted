If you're looking for a beef jerky you can (and will) feed your dog, look no further. With no discernable taste and a texture that resembles <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H4T6">Beggin' Strips</a> at twice the price, Wild Ride Gallopin' Pepper Beef Jerky for Dogs is an all-natural choice.<br /><br />The meat is weirdly soft and completely tasteless. Not salty, nor peppery, nor meaty. I took one bite and immediately spit it in the trash. And 5 out of 5 friends agree: It's garbage. To add insult to injury, one of the bags was ripped down the middle. So it was *actually* garbage.<br /><br />These bags of "beef jerky" have utterly offended me. Heed my warning and stay away.
