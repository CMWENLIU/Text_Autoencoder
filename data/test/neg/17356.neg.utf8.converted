I ordered the chia seeds believing they were whole seeds but they are ground up. The beauty of these seeds is in the crunchiness added to yogurt, cereal, baked goods. They are very digestible as whole, no need for grinding. I would never want them ground up for use. This is a very poor choice for use. I would recommend to anybody who is looking for healthy foods to add to their diet, to buy whole chia seeds.
