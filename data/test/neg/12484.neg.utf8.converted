don't be fooled by this despicable product.  it is not made from olive oil, it "has" olive oil in it, so they can sell it to people looking for a healthy alternative to the high omega-6 standard crap.  look at the list of ingredients and you see soy oil listed first, before olive oil.  helmann's knows people want this without soy oil, so they came up with a way to fool the casual buyer.  i would say shame on them, but obviously this is a company without shame (or scruples).
