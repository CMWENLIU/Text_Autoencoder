I received this through the Vine Voices program and was really excited about the prospect of a shampoo that would possibly take care of my scalp too. I have super fine hair, an oily scalp at the top and a dry scalp at the base of my head...quite the combination! I was hoping the shampoo would help to take care of the dry and itchy part of my head. I don't have dandruff and don't use dandruff shampoo, though I would like something that nourishes that area.<br /><br />The product arrived in a padded envelope and a plastic bag and had leaked all over the bag. Not a good first impression. I hope that's not the method of shipment for paying customers. I'd say a good 1/4 of the bottle was lost.<br /><br />I've used the shampoo for almost a month now and I'm very disappointed. After washing and rinsing I feel like I still have a film on my hair. Again, I have really fine hair, so I definitely don't need a product meant to wash, leave a greasy film behind. It weighed down my hair and took away any shine, leaving it looking dirty. I am just not impressed.<br /><br />I noticed no difference on my scalp, so overall, I wouldn't recommend this for anyone concerned with lack of hair volume or who wants to have shiny, soft hair!
