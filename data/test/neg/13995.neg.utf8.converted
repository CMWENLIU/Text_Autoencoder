Wish I had looked at the box more carefully before buying this tea.  While taking a bag out of the box I noticed it states on the back of the box "Product of China".  With all the articles on the news lately about unsafe, life threatening additives and basically no quality control in food manufactured in China I really don't feel comfortable using this product. Can't  return it because I opened the box so it will go into the trash. Lesson learned, look more closely at the packaging before buying!
