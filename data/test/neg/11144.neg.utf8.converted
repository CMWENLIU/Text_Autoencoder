These bully sticks stunk so badly that after I gave two of them to my 70 pound dog, he almost smelled like the sticks!  Needless to say, I gave the remainder of them to a man whose dogs live outdoors.  The price wasn't worth it as I went to a local store and paid three times as much for some bully sticks, but they didn't smell.
