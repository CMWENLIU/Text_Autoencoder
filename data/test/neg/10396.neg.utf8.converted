I specificlly chose this item because it specified Country of Origin was US, but it is clearly marked on the box that the oysters are a product of China.<br /><br />The amount of pollution rampant in China means I will throw out the entire order of oysters. I will not risk eating them. Do not forget the tainted milk, the tainted shrimp, and the tainted pet food just to name a few of China's dubious products.<br /><br />Seriously? Shame on Amazon for such a blatant error.
