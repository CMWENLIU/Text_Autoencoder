I thought this would be a great way to avoid scooping out solid waste. It's a decent concept, but it's poorly executed. The slots in the sifting pan are easily clogged if your cat pees a lot, which mine does. I've tried keeping the litter level higher to no avail. When the sifting pan gets wet litter stuck in it, then emptying it becomes a GIANT mess- worse than any traditional scooping litter box (the kind I was trying to get away from) made. To be honest, it made a giant mess whether there was wet litter stuck in it or not- the sifting pan is very large, so tipping it over even a large trash receptacle is awkward and messy. I would sooner use a traditional scooping litter box.
