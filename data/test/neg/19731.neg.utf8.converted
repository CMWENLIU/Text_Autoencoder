Both of my children have multiple food allergies, so it's hard to find something I don't have to make on my own. The ingredients labeled were items both of my children could eat, so I bought a case of Banana/cinnamon and Purple Funk. Both children got severe diarrhea and one additionally threw up several times after eating a little of both. (they shared each others bags).<br />Don't know what is in the processing or what grade of food they are using (GMO or older fruits). I looked on their site and didn't see any solid information. Mostly "cutesy" links. I'm not thrilled that I can't return the unused bags because they are "grocery" items. I wouldn't give these to any of my friends or children's schools.
