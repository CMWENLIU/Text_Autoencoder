I have a feeling that the bad reviews out here are from people who are impossible to please. No, this is not the greatest tasting cereal ever but it blows away anything else on the market claiming to be low carb. A low carb cereal is sort of an oxymoron anyway. After 30 long years, I finally found the key to losing weight and it was a low carb lifestyle. Do yourself a favor and do a little research on carbs and how they affect your body...it's rather alarming and why doctors and dietitians don't make you aware of this is even more alarming. I have eaten this cereal everyday for the last 3 years and I look forward to it every morning. If your store does not carry this item, just ask. It's a Kellogg's product and they can get it.<br /><br />Update: 9-24-2012<br /><br />Well, they went and screwed things up. The 'New and Improved' version has been ruined by them adding tons of sugar. It's almost sickeningly sweet now. I will quit buying it and try and find something else which won't be easy. Very, very disappointed. Changing a 5 star review to 1.
