I'm an experienced user of pre-made as well as home-made fondants -- having used Wilton (which tastes the worst), Satin Ice, etc. This was my first use of Fondarific, as I needed red fondant in a hurry and it was the only red fondant available on Amazon that would arrive on time.<br /><br />Big mistake. No matter which technique I used, this stuff stuck and stretched and tore. I will not buy any Fondarific fondant again.
