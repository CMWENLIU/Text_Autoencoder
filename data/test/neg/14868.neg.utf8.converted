Searching for food dye that does not have any corn derivative in it is really difficult. I found this and was willing to pay $30.00 for it!!!<br /><br />1. The set is for 3 colors and you can mix to make all the pretty colors in the pictures, I am an artist and have not problems with mixing colors. It comes with Red, Yellow, blue<br /><br />2. Problem 1: The blue was not blue at all - it was swampy muddy green. not teal, not blue-green, not anywhere close to Blue. I shook and shook the product until I was blue in the face and was still a swampy mud brown/green. Absolutely nothing I can do with this color. My daughter wanted a princess cake with pink and purple - I said no problem. Big Mistake - I simply CANNOT make purple from this color.<br /><br />3. It takes a TON of coloring to shade the icing. I have 2 pounds of icing (standard for a small cake) - it took over 1/2 the red to make a light pink icing. So frustrating. Now, the red is almost gone and I cannot make purple. this stinks!<br /><br />4. Oh yea, it cost $30 for this??<br /><br />Save your money - make your own dye from food - I am about to go on an exploration to find the perfect way to make purple because my little girl just wants a pink and purple cake.
