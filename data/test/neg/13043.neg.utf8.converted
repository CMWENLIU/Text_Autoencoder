Love Air Heads and was excited to find a 90ct box for so cheap. I guess the reason they were so cheap was because they were a little old. I'd say about 70% of the candies in the box were hard. It's not that big of a deal but if you like your Air Heads soft you probably won't be very happy with these.<br />Who knows though, maybe I just got a bad batch.
