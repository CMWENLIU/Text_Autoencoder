We use a Keurig machine at my office and someone drinks this crap so they keep ordering it.  But it's awful, so it's the only one left eventually.  My review isn't so much for this product, as it is for the people that force me to drink it by using up all of the good K-Cups first.  I've tried but just can't do it.  Too sweet & caramely & *WRETCH*.  Find those holiday-scented hand soaps, heat them to boiling, and drink them instead.
