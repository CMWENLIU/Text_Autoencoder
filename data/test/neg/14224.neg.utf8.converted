While I am pleased with most of the product ordered, I specifically ordered a "coffee only" sampler pack and received many non-coffee k-cups (ciders, hot chocolates, cappuccinos, teas) which will end up thrown away. So I'm throwing away about 25% of what I ordered. Not happy! Please either change the details of this item listing or pack only coffee. I won't be ordering from this seller again.
