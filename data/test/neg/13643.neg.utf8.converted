I've been buying this yeast for pizzas in the jar in my local supermarket for a year now ... until recently, when it went out of stock and I had trouble locating it. One jar = 16 pouches, according to the label.<br /><br />Well, out of desperation, I ordered these from Amazon not entirely sure if the description was accurate ... everything I've purchased from from Amazon has been a great deal, and I'm often surprised by how many units come in each pack.<br /><br />This time I was underwhelmed. You get what the description says. 3x 1/4oz pouches in a row, with 5 in a bag. For $12.55. A good $5.50 more than the jar I used to buy in my local store which had one pouch more product.<br /><br />In the end, it's my fault for ordering while hoping that Amazon had incorrectly listed how much you'd be getting ... this is just the first time I've ever known Amazon to rip grocery consumers off by charging almost double what you pay in a local supermarket.<br /><br />4 stars for the product, minus 2 for the price.<br /><br />Will not be ordering more unless the price is slashed to what it should be. This is way over MSRP.
