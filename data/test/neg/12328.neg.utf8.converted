The reason I purchased this product is for the "No Sugar Added" clause. I am annoyed with all the sugar that is added in almost everything. Every kids cocoa drink has too much sugar added. After I tasted my first drink, it felt  too sweet and had an after taste. The taste of an artificial sweetener. After checking the ingredients, I noticed it contains "Sucralose". According to Wikipedia, Sucralose is 600 sweeter than table sugar! What's the point of buying something that has no sugar added but adding something that's tons of times sweeter? I am not going after the calorie factor. So does Nesquick add 600 times less amount of Sucralose than sugar to get the same sweetness? I don't think so.<br /><br />Another major problem is that Amazon's ingredients section does NOT mention Sucralose. It mentions Aspartame which, according to Wikipedia, it's 100-150 times sweeter than sugar, which means much less sweeter than Sucralose. So did Nesquick change their ingredients and Amazon did not update their ingredients list?
