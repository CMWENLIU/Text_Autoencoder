With all of the recent problems and publicity over contaminated medicine, pet food, and bibs with lead from China, the fact that this juice is made from Apple "concentrate" from a country, seemingly without a lot of standards or oversight is extremely worrisome.  I am especially concerned because apple juice is frequently given to children and toddlers.  The company didn't even put this on the label but imprinted on the container which is not obvious.  It is clear that the company didn't want to advertise this.  However, on the company website, they proudly proclaim that apples are from the U.S.  I believe this is misleading and disingenuous.  I'm telling all of my friends to stop buying this product and for them to spread the word.
