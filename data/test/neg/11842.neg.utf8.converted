I bought this along with several other Roland tinned teas.  This was at the bottom of the heap in terms of taste. There is a faint, and I mean faint taste of cloves with this tea.  So faint that it's not really worth it if you're actually looking for some tasty clove tea.  The tins are nice, though.
