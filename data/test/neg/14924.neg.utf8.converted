Patooey!  Tastes like bug spray!!  I had to wash my mouth out with soap after eating this.  Fishers went on the cheap and just bought the name from the original danish manufacturer, not the recipe.  Earth to Fishers--buy the original recipe!!Aren't you just a little embarrased how much people hate this?  You can become a hero by buying the original recipe and reformulating this back to its origins.  Note to the original manufacturer-please write a disclaimer to disassociate yourself from this horrible product!
