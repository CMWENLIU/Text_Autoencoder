This used to be my favorite tea, but the formula has changed.  I've heard that if you can find the tea in the original pale yellow box, that it is still the old (good tasting) formula.  Read through the other negative reviews and comments for more info (and notice the dates on the reviews, good and bad).  It used to taste like a liquid fireball candy, now it tastes like hot water with black pepper.
