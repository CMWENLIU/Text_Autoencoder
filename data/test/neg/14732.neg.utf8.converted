Having used Red Mill non-organic oats for years, thought I would try organic--big mistake.  Got about a dozen bags from Subscribe and Save and a few days later had small moths all over the place.  Finally tracked them to a couple of unopened bags plus the one bag I had opened.  Took over a month to finally get rid of them.  Will go back to regular as I like the company and their products.
