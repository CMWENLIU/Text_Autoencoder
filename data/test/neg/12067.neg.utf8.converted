I agree with the above review that speaks to the false listing of ingredients. My can lists only "roasted barley and rye" but it is very sweet???  No indication in the ingredients of beetroot or other sweetener. In which other respect are the claims on the label false ("no preservatives, no chemical additives")? This is the stuff of a significant legal claim against Adamba Imports unless in the future, the labelling truthfully represents the ingredients and the processing.
