I bought this for my 3 year old daughter through Amazon. When it came, I opened one up and microwaved it and tried to feed it to her. The first thing she said after she tasted it was "YUK." I tasted it myself and she was right. This thing is extremely flavorless, Can't even taste the Cream of Mushroom. I can't describe the taste but it seemed like Campbell's main ingredient was water, then they added some other stuff for show but was still able to retain the "watery" taste for some strange reason-seriously this thing has no flavor whatsoever. Even when I dumped a ton of Salt and Pepper I could not make out where the "Cream of Mushroom" went.<br /><br />I would give this a 0 or 1 star rating but after I looked at the can and seen that it was Low Sodium, I can't fault Campbell because they did warn me. It was more my fault for not realizing this was the Low Sodium version but I didn't think Low Sodium meant No Flavor. My daughter loves the regular Cream of Mushroom soup but from now on I'm going to stay away form the "Low Sodium" version of anything. For those that require a Low Sodium diet, this soup might be for you. Don't purchase this 12 pack until you went to the supermarket and bought the Low Sodium version first to try it out.
