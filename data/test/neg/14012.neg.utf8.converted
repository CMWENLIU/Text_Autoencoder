I'm pretty much addicted to sparkling water. Perrier is my favorite because it has the highest fizz quotient. It is super bubbly compared to the other brands.<br /><br />However, for some reason the water in these 33 oz plastic bottles is only fizz-lite. I noticed that the caps don't seem to be on quite as tightly as the caps on the smaller bottles or on the glass bottles, so perhaps this is why. The other option is perhaps these just don't travel well and lose their fizz on the delivery truck. Either way, I cannot recommend the 33 oz plastic bottles of Perrier because they're missing their most vital, super fizz.<br /><br />The big glass ones are fine. We've bought those locally with no problems, and we buy the smaller bottles both locally and here on Amazon and they're all super-fizz. So if you're like me and want extra-fizzy, go with an alternate option rather than these 33 oz bottles.<br /><br />Summary: Not up to usual fizz levels, buy the little bottles or glass bottles instead.
