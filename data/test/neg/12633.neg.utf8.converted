I didn't give this 1-star because the preserves were ok.  They are presented as gift items, but as jams go, they weren't noticably better than a grocery store product at 1/100th the price per ounce.  As a gift recipient, there is no more sense that you've gotten a sampler of what is presumably a larger product.  As the gift giver, you're paying an exorbitant amount for the treats toward no end.
