I've been eating tamarind and tamarind paste since I was 3 years old, I ordered this product and was really excited to taste it. My tamarind paste came in the mail today, and once I put it in my mouth I thought I was going to throw up. Honestly this is the worst tamarind paste I had ever tasted in my life :(
