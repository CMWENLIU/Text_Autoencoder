I have been using the full line of Lipton's Green Tea to Go for a couple of years now, and just love it. Have also turned countless friends onto it as well.  Love the benefits of green tea, being able to avoid soda...and that it is sweetened with Splenda.  Splenda was the primary reason for chosing the Lipton line.  But NOW all that has changed and Lipton has made the decision to switch to Aspartame...which doctors tell you to avoid if you experience headaches.  Aspartame is not very good for us, folks...but it must be cheaper.  (Google it and see what you find!)  Lipton has fallen out of brand loyalty for me and it is a window into their practices that they would switch to a lesser, more controversial ingredient.  I'm sure there is plenty of marketing spin they can site for this reason, but facts are facts.  I'm told by friends that Jackie Chan has a line worth checking out, now that it's Lipton no more for me.
