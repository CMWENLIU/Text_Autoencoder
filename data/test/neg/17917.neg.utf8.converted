I don't understand all the 5 star reviews here. I am a very health conscious eater, and I usually like meat alternatives. In fact, I usually like health foods that others find disgusting. However, this product has a ridiculously grainy texture and little flavor. More importantly, it's not remotely healthy! It is made primarily with wheat gluten, which is not exactly a health product and has little nutritional value. The amount of controversial food colorings, preservatives and corn syrup in this product are also disgusting.<br /><br />I used to be a strict vegan (for three years) and a vegetarian (for 13 years), but I've come to realize that eating products like natural, organic turkey dogs are a much better choice than eating wheat gluten and soy protein concentrate products. This product is a great example of vegan not necessarily meaning healthy. I got a package of Linkettes at a big discount,  and I would have been really upset if I had paid full price. At least they last for years, so I'll use the rest as my emergency food stash.
