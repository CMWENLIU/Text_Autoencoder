I wanted to like this coffee as I appreciate the fair trade and organic policies of the company. However, I had my doubts from the moment I broke the seal on the can and there was no coffee smell whatsoever! There is hardly even an aroma when it brews! Drinking this, the coffee tastes stale and bitter with not even a remote hint of what a good cup of coffee should taste like.<br /><br />Perhaps their whole bean might have been better, I don't know. I got this for those mornings when you wake up and just don't want to take out the grinder and go through that process. Okay, I learned my lesson - it was a mistake!
