The Arcor Coffee Caf&eacute; is a dark brown, filled, hard candy; hard and sweet on the outside with a coffee filling that is delicious. However, the amount of filling varies tremendously from piece to piece. I had some that were more filling than hard candy, while others were all hard and no filling. The yummy filling was a real crap shoot; maybe yes, maybe no. The outer hard candy was sweet with a little coffee flavor, but tasted kind of strange. Most of the coffee punch was in the filling. Coffee was 4th item on a list of ingredients that numbered 8. When the filling was plentiful=6 out of 10; when there wasn't any filling=3 out of 10<br />  FYI- United, Kopiko and Coffee Rio were the top finishing coffee candies.<br />  God bless. Mike
