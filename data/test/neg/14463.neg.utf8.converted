This stuff is VERY greasy. It is not made for my type of hair. Once in, getting it out was a nitemare.  Mind you, my hair does smell really nice and my scalp feels great.  But my hair looks like I was auditioning for Grease!<br /><br />This was very poorly marketed and labeled.  For some users, it might be great. But not for most of us.
