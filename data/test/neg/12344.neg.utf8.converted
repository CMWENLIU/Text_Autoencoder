Some others have pointed out that the new formulation changed the shape, size taste and consistency of the chews.  But there are some more important changes you need to know about.<br /><br />  First of all, each piece contains less plant sterol esters (0.70 down from 0.85), but more sugars (4g up from 3g).  They have also added 50mg of calcium.<br /><br />  One study has shown that calcium in conjunction with plant sterols has beneficial effects on HDL and LDL. (Effects of calcium and plant sterols on serum lipids in obese Zucker rats on a low-fat diet - Timo Vaskonena, Eero Mervaalaa, Ville Sumuvuoria, Tuulikki Sepp&auml;nen-Laaksoa and Heikki Karppanena - British Journal of Nutrition 2002)<br /><br /> However, other studies indicate that calcium might be associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer, possibly due to supressing Vitamin D levels.  All of this is still somewhat controversial, so I suggest you do your research before using this product.
