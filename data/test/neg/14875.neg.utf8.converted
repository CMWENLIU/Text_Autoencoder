I roasted this beans full city, next batch full city+, the beans are dry as a bone, no oil at all.<br />Coffee tasted flat, no aroma, flavor thin and sour.<br />Roasted the Colombia Quinchia, the Mexico Chiapas, same thing.<br />This beans must be very old and dried out. I certainly won't be ordering from them again.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001NBGHM">5 Lb. Organic Fair Trade Green Coffee Sampler</a>
