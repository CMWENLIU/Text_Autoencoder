These look like the perfect pebbles for a project I have coming up, but there's no way in H.....L I am going to pay The Party Works $9.65 to ship 1.5 ounces of candy that is already WAY overpriced at $3.59 (that would be $35.09 if getting a whole pound at this price).<br /><br />The Amazon page on this company says that their shipping is $6.85 per item (which is also absolutely ridiculous!), but when I went to check out - there it was ... $9.65. Needless to say, I won't be buying these.
