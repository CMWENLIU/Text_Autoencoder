Compared to the Twinings gunpowder green tin my coworker has, this tea is not green in color (it's almost black) and has no scent.  Since it's over 2 years old and it's only wrapped in paper and stored in a cardboard box this is not surprising.  It still tastes like green tea when brewed but I consider it a waste of money.
