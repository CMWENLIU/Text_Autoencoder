Ok. So all I wanted was a simple way to get some good for you pineapple without the mess. The answer... Canned Pineapple, right? I of course opted for Organic, because hey, at least it's better then boring ol' Dole. Boy was I disappointed. Ok, first let's talk color. The color pictured on the can's label shows pineapple that is bright yellow and vibrant. Alas, the pineapple in the can was more of n off brown see through, mutated something or other. Not yellow at all. Not bright and vibrant at all. Now let's talk taste, because even if the color was off (by a lot!) at least it still tasted good, right...? Wrong! This tasted like cheap imitation pineapple that airlines wouldn't even serve back when they served meals. I gagged at almost each bite hoping the next one would be better. These stale with almost no flavor. My Advice... buy the real stuff and slice it up or buy it already sliced. Nothing... and I do mean nothing beats the real thing. And the fact that this can says organic, don't let it fool you, it tastes awful...
