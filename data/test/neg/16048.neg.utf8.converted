This powder has a strong wheat grass flavor to it.  It smells great like berries, but doesn't actually taste like berries at all.  The scoop seems pretty large for one serving, also, I have to mix it with at least 16oz. of water otherwise it is just too thick and clumpy.  It probably has nutritional benefits, but I don't feel magically different.  Maybe if you had a terrible diet pre amazing grass you could feel the change.  Nice to get a quick 5-9 (I'm not sure how they could have been more accurate with this measurement) servings of daily veggies though.
