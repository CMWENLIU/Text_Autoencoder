I bought this product when Amazon was out of my regular Saco milk. What a disappointment! This milk was almost impossible to mix! I followed the directions and ended up with a big glop of  unmixed powder at the bottom of the pitcher every time! Tried hot and cold water, spoon, whisk, hand mixer. and even a blender! Nothing worked! I never have any trouble mixing the Saco brand by hand. Wont' buy this again ever!
