Coca Cola now partially owns Zico. So, now it's made from concentrate, has added "natural flavors" and is packaged in plastic. How to ruin nature's perfect drink for profit. This was my favorite, now I will not buy this "new formula" again...Looking to find another like Zico used to be. Don't know yet if the Zico tetra pak is still the "old formula"..also..rumor has it that Pepsi is looking to buy Vita Coco..so will be keeping my eye on this, too
