I can't recommend this flavor for now because at least one out of five cups had a problem that resulted in grounds in my coffee. I've used this in two machines, one is less than a month old - same outcome. Maybe it's just a bad batch, I'd like to know if other reviewers are having similar problems. I've always bought Timothy's and hope that this is just an anomaly. Two out of five stars because the majority of brews made came out fine. Will update this review if I feel I can recommend this flavor again.
