I'm Vietnamese and I know how Pho should be tasted. Of course, I don't compare this one with fresh Pho. But compared with all kinds of instant noodle, organic or not, gluten free or not, this one tastes extremely bad. After eating a first few bites, I threw the whole box. I don't even call this one Pho, from the look to the taste!<br /><br />I would rate it 0 star!
