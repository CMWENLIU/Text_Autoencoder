PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT AS THE PACKAGE SHOWED EXCELLENT LOOKING PISTACHIOS.  WONDER NOW IF THE PACKAGING IS NOT CLEAR ON PURPOSE.  THESE NUTS REMIND ME OF THE FEW YOU FIND IN A BAG WITH THE SHELLS STILL ON THE NUTS.  THE FEW THAT YOU BITE AND KNOW ARE BAD.  STAY AWAY.  LOVE THE PISTACHIOS FROM THE SAME COMPANY IN THE SHELL.
