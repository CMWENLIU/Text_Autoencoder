This is a very good food suppliment. It strengthens your nails and hair and connective tissue. I have been using it for over 10 years. However the price for shipping and handling is way too much!!!<br />You can get this in Walmarts for $7.24 8 oz I would not pay this shipping price in my opinion it is not right. Try Walmart.com. They are premeasured in the 8 oz box 32 packs so you can just pour it in your tea or hot water. This is powered it should be a lot less for not having to package it.
