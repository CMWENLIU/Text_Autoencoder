my cats love catnip .they have always reacted to different brands. for a few seconds or many minutes depending on the brand.  well i got the zoom catnip<br /><br />to try and i've never seen anything like it.  it was as if they had slipped into a catatonic(no pun intended) trance.  they sniffed it, mentally yawned and walked away.  NO REACTION WHATSOEVER.  will not be buying this again
