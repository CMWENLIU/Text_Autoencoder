My 9 year old Tortie LOVES this food and ate it for almost three years.  When I tried to give her other food she would eat just enough to not starve and cry for other food.  However, a month ago she started throwing up once or twice every single day.  The throw-up was almost half-undigested food.  Then I noticed she was having diarrhea as well.  Additionally, during this same time period I opened up one of the bags of this food and saw cobwebs and insects inside the bag.  I returned the bag to my local food retailer and was told it was not uncommon and that they were "onion moths" and that the manufacturer has been having problems with them.  Add all of this together, and I had had it with this food.  I switched to Eukanuba and IMMEDIATELY the vomiting ceased and the diarrhea ceased.  I also noticed that her coat improved as well.  I don't know if there are quality control issues or what, but I would stay away from this food.
