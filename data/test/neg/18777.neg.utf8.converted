I used to buy Special K Protein Plus all the time, but now that it "tastes even better" (read: now that they added sugar as one of the main ingredients), I won't be buying it anymore. More calories, more sugar, less fiber- but alas, now it is supposed to taste better. Maybe it does, but I won't be finding out.
