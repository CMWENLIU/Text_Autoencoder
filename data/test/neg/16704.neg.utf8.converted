I first read about this product in First Magazine for Women. I knew roasted seaweed was very good for you, but these things are awful. First of all, they are very pricey; $1.19 per package. I picked them up at Whole Foods, because if I hated them, I would not be stuck with 14 bags. Anway, these things are just large seaweed sheets cut up in bit size and so spicy, you can't eat them. I expected them in a chunky chip, because the magazine touted them as a very filling snack. You could never get filled up with these thin things and the spice and salt are just too much. If you want something like this, just cut up the large sushi sheet seaweed and season; much cheaper.
