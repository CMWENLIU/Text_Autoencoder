Safer: Pantry Pest Trap (2 per box)  I have used this product many times over at least ten years.  The most recent order was through Amazon, and the traps have proved to be mildly effective in attracting the moths.  This is possibily due to the age of the traps.  The little pheremone insert might be waning in its effectiveness over time.  So, I think it is important that the traps be fresh, not from long stored supplies.<br /><br />I was dissatisfied with these traps, as very few moths have been trapped, compared to MANY in the past.  Compared to past traps, these rate about a 2 on a scale of 1-5.  Not good.
