I am very mad at myself for not doing better research before selecting formula once my breast milk supply dwindled.  Do your own search!  The Obama Admin has said that organic formula should no longer be allowed to be marketed if it contains dha/ara made with hexane.  Organic foods for adults are not allowed to be labeled as organic if they are made with  hexane.  There are several articles out there discussing possible side effects including autism and ADHD from hexane.  I am switching to Baby's Only which is the only organic formula that contains Dha/ara not manufactured using hexane.  It says it is a toddler formula which is why I didn't consider using it to begin with.  Do your own research, supposedly they market it that way to support breastfeeding exclusively for the first year.  It meets. The infant Formula requirements.  I am hoping to return the box of Earth's Best hexane formula I paid so much for thinking I was doing something good for my son.  Red the review here that copies the response from Baby's Only about it being suitable for infants  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009DXVP4">Babys Only Organic Dairy Formula Case (6 cans)</a>.
