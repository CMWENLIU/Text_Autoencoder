This vanilla has sugar in it.  Nowhere in the description does it specify that, but on the ingredient list on the label it does. This isn't the real thing at all, which would explain the price.  Shame on Amazon/seller for not listing all ingredients on this product. I buy from Amazon weekly, and this is the first purchase I've made that's made me feel taken.
