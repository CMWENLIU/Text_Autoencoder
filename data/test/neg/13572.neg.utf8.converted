IT was wonderfully convenient to have cat food delivered to my home.  Unfortunately, there was something very wrong with this food.  I didn't even get through one box of it.  It made all three of my cats vomit repeatedly (and one of them, violently).  I thought maybe mine were too used to higher quality food, so I gave it to a friend who feeds a colony of feral cats.  So, get this, she called me the next day and said she put it out for the feral cats, who wouldn't touch it.  They all sniffed it, looked at her with disappointed expressions.. and walked away.  She thought maybe they weren't hungry just then.  She went inside and watched through the window.  They still didn't eat it.  She put it out near where a family of raccoons eat later in the evening.  And THEY wouldn't eat it, either.  She finally brought it in and threw it out.  There must have been something wrong with the food.  We threw out the rest of the boxes without checking the expiration date.  Hope that wasn't why it was so much cheaper than buying it at the store!
