I am not exaggerating when I say this is the worst tuna I've ever had.  EVER.  I cannot even call it tuna, it is more like fish pulp.  It is a soggy mess of tiny flakes of very old-tasting tuna all mixed with water, and it is so mushy you cannot even drain it.  It is close to inedible and only good in the case of the Apocalypse or some other dire emergency.  I can't believe Chicken of the Sea sells inedible crap like this.  I would not pay 20 cents a can for it.  It is really not even good to feed to a dog because of the salt content.  However, I rinsed it as well as I could and fed it to the dog.  He seemed to think it was ok.
