I gave my two cats a can to test to see if they would like it.  Well it failed.  When I saw that the ingredients had gravy, I assumed that it would have gravy.  But in case you're wondering, it's more of a pate type wet food.  My cats absolutely love wet food with lots of gravy and I think they ate more of the dry food than the wet.  Go figure...<br /><br />Can anyone recommend a healthy wet food with lots of gravy?
