I search all over for food for the kittehs---I was so pleased to find a new "flavor'---but was also VERY disappointed when I put it down at feeding time - the first time I fed this---the "kids" picked at it--never really cleaned up the plates.  I waited several days and offered it again and all I got were looks of total disgust and tails that flicked as they walked away!!!<br />I guess I won't be ordering this again!
