I ordered flowers for my mom for her birthday and when she received them they were warm and wilted.  I was reimbursed for the full amount of my order and a  replacement was sent to my mothers house.  I was content with the manner that amazon handled that situation, and I was surprised they sent a replacement.  Although I would rather had them sent perfect the first time, overall I was pleased with the order.
