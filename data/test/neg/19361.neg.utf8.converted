This was given to me as a gift, and I was truly excited about the product.  My husband and I were adamant about our plans to prepare our baby's food ourselves.  However, after a couple of uses it became apparent that the Beaba Babycook product was neither easy nor quick to use.<br /><br />The steamer worked ok, but frankly I find just using a nice silicone steamer tray ($3.99 at your local grocery store) and my own pot worked just fine.  Plus, since I freeze a couple weeks supply at a time, using "adult-sized" steamer / cookware meant I could make one large-ish batch rather than 2 or 3 too-small batches.<br /><br />The blender component was totally inadequate.  Either the speed was too slow or the blades too dull, but it took a LONG time for the food to be blended enough for our infant.  If you are looking for a chunkier texture for an older child, perhaps this would be ok.  And the dial was awckward to hold continuously during the blending process.<br /><br />My suggestion:<br />1.  Use your own pots & pans w/a steamer to cook the veggies, fruit, meats, etc.<br />2.  Use a hand-held blender (like Braun's Multiquick) to really puree the foods.  BONUS:  You can actually use a<br />  handheld blender for other things non-baby related.
