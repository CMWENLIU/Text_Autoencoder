I was so disappointed when Amazon stopped carrying the black tea version of this Blueberry iced tea. When I found the green tea version, I quickly ordered another case. Boy am I unhappy. The green tea version has no flavor - no matter how many bags I use to make a pitcher. If you are looking for blueberry flavor - skip this one. Now I have a cupboard of tinted water bags!
