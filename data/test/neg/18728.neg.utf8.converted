My order arrived completely broken. The Zataar spices had spilled completely in the envelope. When I opened the envelope, it spilled all over my kitchen floor!!<br />The product was poorly packed.<br />Plus the Zaatar did not smell like authentic lebanese Zaatar. It smelled more like indian curry.<br />Total rip off and bad packaging.
