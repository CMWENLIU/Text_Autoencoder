It may be a great buy for people who don't make cheese and have no food allergies.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it was a waste of money. I relied on a positive reveiw, hoping to make cheese with this milk.  It does not act or taste like pure powdered milk should.<br />It does not make a curd at all.<br /><br />Additonally, the powder has some inclusions in it, small purple seeds (grains), when dissolved in water- it becomes soapy, and tastes soapy too.. Probably mixed with one of those "gums" or "beans" to give a no-fat product a more "creamy" (comes out as soapy) flavor.<br /><br />I give it one star, because the producer of this milk does not indicate the full ingredient list of his milk and tricks customers like me into buying it relatively cheaply, but with a no-return "catch".
