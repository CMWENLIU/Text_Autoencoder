I have been using Direct Coffee Bean Earl Grey tea and I think it is superb! My granddaughter won't drink any other kind of tea. I decided to try the Orange Pekoe and it hardly had any flavor. Like others, I used double the amount of tea I was using for other loose teas. It is better but certainly not what I am used to. I will not be ordering anymore. I will go back to my favorite, which is the Dilmah loose Ceylon tea.
