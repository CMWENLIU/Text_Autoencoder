I thought this had an awful metallic aftertaste.  It was not pleasant, even the kids didn't like it and they drink anything sweet.  But once I added tequila and triple sec it tasted a whole lot better.  I wouldn't purchase again, I'd stick with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5CXY">Jose Cuervo Margarita Mix, 33.8-Ounce Container (Pack of 4)</a> and not add the alcohol or even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0FG">Baja Bob's Sugar Free Margarita Mix, Original, 32-Ounce Bottles  Pack of 3)</a>.  Both have a better flavor than Crystal Light and no metallic aftertaste.
