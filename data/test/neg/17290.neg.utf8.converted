The cost of this item was great(I thought). The problem I had though, was when I opened the shipping box I had Powered Stevia ALL OVER. I thought that maybe it was just a couple packs leaked. NO!!! So far, 2 out of 3 boxes had at least 15 of the packs miss cut, therefor they were not sealed. It's like they were misfits! Had to wipe each packet, and so now the cost REALLY WASN"T THAT GREAT!!! I would have sent them back, but I really needed them.
