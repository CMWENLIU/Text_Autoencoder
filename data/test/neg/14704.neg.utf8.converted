I ordered the Original Beef Jerky, 3.25-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4) and I got it today. But after I opened the box I noticed that there are only 3 bags in the pack, and the pack is opened already. Very disappointed with this order! I have shopped through Amazon for many years, and this is the first time that appeared a problem.
