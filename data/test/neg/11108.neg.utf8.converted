This is an oat cereal bar, plain and simple.  Thick "planks" of chewy oats and some other big, puffed cereal with a few almonds and blueberries tossed in.  I was completely disappointed, especially at the price I paid for these bland bars and also at the lack of many berries and nuts.  I loved the trailmix bar from this company but this thing was way overpriced and tasted so "oaty" that my daughter wouldn't eat more than a few bites. We swigged lots of liquid after eating thinking a bowl of actual oatmeal would have been more pleasurable.<br /><br />Incidentally, the 5 star review above mine isn't even for this particular bar...
