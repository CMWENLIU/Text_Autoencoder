This ghee has a horrible taste I cannot get used to!<br /><br />I tried to like it but to no avail.<br /><br />It separates in two layers in the plastic (yuck!) jar.  And the texture is granular and lumpy.  Just looks wrong. Tastes plastic-y too.<br /><br />I admit, I am new to ghee, but I know that much: this product is going into the trash.  Cooking with butter might not be as healthy, but this stuff just tastes nasty!<br /><br />Do NOT buy.  Amazon will NOT let you return it (their policy for all food items) !
