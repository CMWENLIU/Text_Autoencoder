We believe it's no coincidence after eating this food for a few months that 2 of my dogs started losing their hair and one died of having (0) blood pressure that was only 6 months old. They were ALWAYS so hungry, beyond normal. We got rid of it, gave it away. One dog eventually grew her hair back, the other one didn't. When you see the beneful food stacked up in Wal-marts you can appreciate what a mass productive product this is.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/03/2012: Finally after a few years one of our min pins started growing her hair back at (11) years of age after losing it a few years ago from this food. We fed her ORIJEN brand (6 fish) from Canada for a while then switched to something called Orgainix from PetCo (Made in USA) which is like $35 a bag, about the same price as the #1 rated ORIJEN. We now have 4 min pins with shiny coats that are healthy and playful.<br /><br />dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/beneful-dog-food-dry/ also rates this as one star<br /><br />Ingredients: Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, propylene glycol, meat and bone meal, tricalcium phosphate, phosphoric acid, salt, water, animal digest, sorbic acid (a preservative), potassium chloride, dried carrots, dried peas, calcium propionate (a preservative), L-Lysine monohydrochloride, choline chloride, added color (Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 2), DL-Methionine, Vitamin E supplement, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, manganese sulfate, niacin, Vitamin A supplement, calcium carbonate, copper sulfate, Vitamin B-12 supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, garlic oil, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin D-3 supplement, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), calcium iodate, folic acid, biotin, sodium selenite.<br />Fiber (estimated dry matter content) = 4.7%<br /><br />The first ingredient in this dog food is corn. Corn is an inexpensive and controversial cereal grain of only modest nutritional value to a dog.<br />For this reason, we do not consider corn a preferred component in any dog food.<br />The second item is chicken by-product meal... a dry rendered product of slaughterhouse waste. It's made from what's left of a slaughtered chicken after all the prime cuts have been removed.<br />In a nutshell, chicken by-products are those unsavory leftovers usually considered "unfit for human consumption".<br />In addition to organs (the nourishing part), this stuff can contain almost anything... feet, beaks, undeveloped eggs... anything (that is) except skeletal muscle (real meat).
