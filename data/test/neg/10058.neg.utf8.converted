The taste alone deserve all the accolades I found from fellow reviewers before I bought this product (4 Boxes). There were only two reviews, one for 5 stars and the other for 4 stars. Not one mentioned the after effects this product causes in the human body. Who said gas is expensive? With this product is free and long lasting! The first time we did two boxes, which is not much in quantity, and the whole family had a go at it. I bought it for selfish reasons, the fact I am not supposed to consume sugars and lots of Carbs, but more importantly because the two reviews sold me! Who else can I trust these days when everyone claims they are the best but the actual consumers, the everyday people of this great land of ours? Yes, I am that naive, I fully trust the opinions of the majority. In this case they were only 2 reviews and I should have been more cautious. The taste great but after eating this product the body undergoes severe swings, all adorned by long lasting gas and in the end by several visits to the "throne". I have always been blessed with a reliable stomach but when I eat something that is not quite right I suffer like everyone else. Another member of my family suffers from a very delicate stomach and almost no will power when it comes to treats like these. There must be some kind of ingredient that promotes this reaction and my question is: Is it safe to suffer the after effects for the taste of the moment you eat it? In my opinion, no, even though I know that some ingredient that makes it sugar free might be the culprit and perhaps the body will adapt and in time become more adept at accepting this side effect, but I do not want my body to participate in the adaptation process. So why was this not mentioned at all? That, in a nutshell, is the question. Are we being difficult and antagonistic? From where I stand (or should I say, sit?) I do not think so. 2 Stars for Doctor's Carbrite Extra Rich & Fudgy Brownies and the 2 stars for the initial great taste, at least that part is true and tried!
