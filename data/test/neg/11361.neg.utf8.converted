Ok I read the other reviews and said "How bad can it be?" Let me tell you it smells like a wet dog that got sprayed by a skunk when it is brewing. As you drink it every once and a while you get that odor. It doesn't taste half bad (no Kahlua flavor though more Hazelnutty).<br /><br />I can't make this at home the house stinks for hours and my dog won't go in the kitchen after I brew it. I took it to work and put it on the table in the kitchen area where free stuff disappears fast. I can't give this coffee away.<br /><br />It's a shame I had high hopes for this flavor. Believe the other reviews, this coffee smells bad!
