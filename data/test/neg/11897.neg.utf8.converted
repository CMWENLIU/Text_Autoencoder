i bought these when they stopped having the original nong shim kimchi noodles available for subscription. they are NOT the same and htey taste awful!!! there is a super strong fish flavor i do not like. they are nothing like the original kimchi noodle bowls. if you want the yumtastic noodles that are my favorite ramen instant noodles ever, go here -  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQNK5A">Nong Shim Bowl Noodle, Kimchi, 3.03-Ounce Bowls (Pack of 12)</a>
