Numi Earl Grey doesn't rise about the level of a cheap imitation of an excellent black tea. It simply sucks. I've been drinking Rishi's Earl Grey and have been very pleased. Of course money is always a problem and Numi is substantially cheaper. I like Numi's Jasmine Perl and thought that their Earl Grey would be good too. Boy was I wrong. If you like Earl Grey, stick to Rishi or some other brand that satisfies you. Don't go cheap with Numi when it comes to Earl Grey. You will be sorely disappointed.
