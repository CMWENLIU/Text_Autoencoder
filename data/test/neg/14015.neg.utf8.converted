Looking at the reviews here you'd think these were straight out of Star Trek- just put the packet in the inflate-a-lator 4000 and out pops a chicken.<br /><br />Kidding aside I *really* wanted to love this product. I typically use canned broth or make my own from scratch, a time consuming process. Savory Choice Chicken Broth Concentrate is not vile by any means but has what I can only describe as a "sweaty sock" taste to it. I've tried to adapt to it but keep coming to the conclusion that my palate simply finds it offensive. The sodium content is also outrageous: one packet, equivalent to 1 cup of broth contains 770mg of salt- ouch.<br /><br />I'd still consider this in a pinch instead of a bullion cube but it's not as good as canned broth.
