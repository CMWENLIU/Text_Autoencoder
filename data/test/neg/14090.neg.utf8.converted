I REALLY love oatmeal, not the creamy style, but al dente, nutty, crunchy style.  Based on all the reviews, I was sure I'd love the McCann's.  I experimented with the McCann's today, and I have to say that I don't like them at all.  Regardless of proportions or how I cooked them, they seemed to my taste to be gritty (they are chopped really fine) and not very flavorful.  Sad to say, Amazon won't accept returns of Grocery products.<br />I much prefer the WalMart generic Old Fashioned oats, measured 1 to 1 with water, and cooked quickly until the water is gone.  Let them stand (covered) for 5 minutes and there it is:-)
