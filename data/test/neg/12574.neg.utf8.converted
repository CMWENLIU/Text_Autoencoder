I can not believe the lack of packaging from this company!! The coffee k-cups were thrown into a Ziploc baggie...then shipped! I had intended to give this as a Christmas gift, but am unable to do so now. It looks like I have just gone to my own cabinet and thrown some stuff in a bag.There is no expiration date on the bag, so as far as I know, the k-cups could already be expired and the company is just trying to move their leftover stock onto the unsuspecting consumer. Additionally, the lack of variety was disheartening. I will NEVER buy from the BECCO Corp. again. If I could give this less than 1 star, I most certainly would! I would also add that although the advertisement was for caffeinated coffee only, I received several decaffeinated coffees. Oh,and I have already checked to see if I could return this item. I can not because it is a grocery item and they are non-returnable. To summarize...buyer beware!
