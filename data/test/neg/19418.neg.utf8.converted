I bought this stuff from ThinkGeek.  I didn't know that it was sold here until now.<br /><br />I love bacon and I love hot sauce, *all* kinds of hot sauce, so I thought this would be a great product; two of my favorite things rolled into one.  But the execution on this one is 90% wrong.  The amount of sodium in this product burns your tongue almost as much as the peppers in the sauce.  The liquid smoke is waaaay overpowering.  It's well over the top.  So, this stuff tastes like salted smoke.  No real bacon flavor here.  They totally need to rework the recipe on this one, and I hope that they do.  I'd give it a second try if they did.  Until then, it's a bacon FAIL.<br /><br />Better luck next time!
