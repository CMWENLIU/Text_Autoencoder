I ordered Kitty litter by mail as it was the same price as pet store, plus no shipping cost! When it arrived two boxes were opened, and I mean this was not rough play by UPS, the boxes were literally opened and about one quarter of the contents were gone in each box. It took us a while to undue all the boxes after finding the first one and this was so deliberately done. Each box was seperately wrapped, and the reason I ordered this type of box was because the quantity is supposed ot be greater for the same price as other brands. Someone truly is literally stealing Kitty Litter out of boxes, then shipping the rest in orders. They were open at the perforations on the side of the box, the way you normally open Kitty litter boxes, not from mishandling. You would have to see it to believe how much someone just plain stole 1/4 of the litter from each box. Crazy! Not happy about this at all!
