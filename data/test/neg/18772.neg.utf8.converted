I tried the new formula other day and its terrible. I tried two days in a row and its like someone poured a box of fake sugar sweetener on the cereal and not a good kind. I had the worst after taste  for hours even after i brushed my teeth. Anyway i emailed them and complained and asked why fiber was reduced to. I told them i would be taking it back to the store and buying a different cereal now. I am so disappointed. Here is the email response i got from them below. And there was no coupons attached either. WHATEVER.<br /><br />I'm happy to hear you've enjoyed them for many years! Thank you for your comments regarding Kellogg's
