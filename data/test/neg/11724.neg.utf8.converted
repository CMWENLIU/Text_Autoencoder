Taste like plastic!!<br />We just opened the jug to refill our smaller empty bottle of Agave. There was a strong chemical odor of the plastic jug. Sadly this odor can be tasted in the Agave too. My wife tried it and she noticed it right away as well. I am rather sensitive to things like this but she is not, so if she noticed it, is bad!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00311T3YO">Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Blue Agave, 5-Gallons Jug</a>
