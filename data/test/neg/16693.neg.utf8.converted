I love the product.  However, I ordered a subscription for every 3 months at $14.94 per shipment through Amazon.com.  Recieved one shipment, and then never heard from Annie Chun's again.  I noticed, today, that the prices have gone up for subscriptions by over $2.  Will NEVER order another subscription from this company again, nor through Amazon.com!  The price is the same at our local grocery store for the same product.  Save your money.  Shop locally!
