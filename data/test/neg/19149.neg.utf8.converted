I would not object if these had been labeled simply "currants" because Zante grapes are called currants in this country (the U.S.). However, Bob's Red Mill has unfortunately chosen to label these "black currants" which generally means Ribes nigrum. Luckily, I read the fine print at the last minute. Zante raisins (Vitis vinifera) are fine as raisins go, but they are not the antioxidant powerhouses that real currants are, and they do not have the complex flavor that the rest of the world associates with black currants. Bob's Red Mill "black currants" are probably better than most Zante raisins, but the label is misleading and it misrepresents the product. Bad call, Bob. I expect better from you.
