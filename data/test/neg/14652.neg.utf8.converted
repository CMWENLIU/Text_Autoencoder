The picture is of BOB'S GLUTEN FREE OATS.  However, the package is of regular oats with a sticker applied on the bag that says gluten free.  WHAT THE HELL?  We all know that oats are NATURALLY gluten free, but without the gluten free certification we do not know THEY HAVE NOT BEEN CONTAMINATED W/GLUTEN IN THE MILLING PROCESS.  I AM DISGUSTED BY THE MISLEADING SALE.  YOU PICTURED ONE ITEM, BUT YOU SOLD ME A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ITEM.  I FEEL 100% DECEIVED.
