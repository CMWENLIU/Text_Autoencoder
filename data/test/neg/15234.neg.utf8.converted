This bread and its brand may be tasty, but this product should not be advertised on Amazon under the "gluten free" items heading.<br /><br />Rye is a member of the wheat grain family and does contain gluten. Though this gluten ppm (parts per million) is relatively low in comparison to wheat, it is still high enough to cause intestinal damage to a person with celiac disease.<br /><br />Remember: Celiac is not simply an allergy or a food preference. Celiac is a full-blown intolerance and inability to process the compound gluten. When a celiac person ingests gluten, it is going to cause damage to the villi in the small intestine, no matter how small an amount of gluten is present.<br /><br />Amazon, please remove from the GF products category. Advertising this bread as GF poses a health risk for those with celiac.
