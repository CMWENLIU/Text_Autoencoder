It appalls me that companies can claim their products are gluten free and then go on to say that some people do have a reaction from them!  All experienced gluten suffers know to read ingredients and know that BARLEY is a no-no, yet this company claims that it is gluten free, people new to gluten sensitivities may not know this and having the company say this is gluten free is very deceiving. After going to their website and looking up the Q&A's, I found that the company says it has been tested and MOST people don't have a reaction but admit that some people do.  Sorry, but I think that alone should be enough to take off the claim of being gluten free.<br /><br />Thankfully I did not buy this product, but I want to put this review up because when I was first diagnosed, I didn't know that barley was a no-no and and only when with companies claiming "gluten free" and did myself a lot of harm.  I am trying to save others the same harm, or better yet, have the company remove the Gluten Free status!
