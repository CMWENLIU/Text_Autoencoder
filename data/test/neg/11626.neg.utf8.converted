I tried the angel hair and the fettucini.  They are well packaged, and no doubt a fine version of shirataki noodles.  I am a pasta lover, and no matter how many suggestions I tried, nothing was appetizing.  The texture is odd, and off-putting.  I read the other reviews and was persuaded to try it.  I am writing to warm others that it is not remotely like regular noodles.
