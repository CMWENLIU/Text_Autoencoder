These were definitely not worth the price, and I only paid a little over eight dollars. These bags are incredibly tiny, and there really are a few tiny bears in each bag. I wish the product description provided the number of ounces per package so I could better judge how much product I was getting. The total product received is comparable to approximately two regular sized bags of gummy bears that you would buy in the candy aisle at the grocery store. I was shocked at how little I received for the price.
