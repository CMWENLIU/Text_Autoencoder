Placed order then got an email stating that the ad on Amazon.com was in error and that they unfortunately cannot fill my order.  What ever happened with customer service that if the price is wrong its YOUR problem not mine. Neither Petco nor Amazon.com stepped up to the plate!  As my grandfather taught me, measure twice and cut once.  Obviously someone didn't read before they pressed the listing button and the customers paid the price.
