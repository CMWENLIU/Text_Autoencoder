I have been a fan of Gevalia's Swiss Hazelnut for about two years...however the new formula in the new packaging/logo from Tassimo is HORRENDOUS! The original formula had subtle hazelnut flavor that tasted like it was in the roast itself....the new tastes like they added a cheap shot of hazelnut syrup and a couple of vanilla shots to boot! This is nothing like the original, which had a medium roast taste, the new brew is watery, sickly sweet and off putting. Please beware this is not the same brew as the old packaging. Unfortunately, I cannot return this item and am now stuck with this terrible coffee.
