I "subscribed" to this gunpowder green tea. The first pound was pretty good, and was what one expects from "gunpowder" tea... each leaf was tightly rolled into a ball as it is suppose to be. The second pound that I received does not look like gunpowder tea at all. Simply hard little blobs of nearly flavorless tea. NOT the same quality as the first pound. This all sounds like tea-snobbery, I know. But when buying loose tea, one should be able to expect consistency. I am going to cancel my subscription. Unfortunate- I would have been a customer for life.
