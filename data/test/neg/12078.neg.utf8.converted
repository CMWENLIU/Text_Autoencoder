This stuff is barely acceptable. I have some Starbucks Tazo Matcha powder and thought this might be a close match in flavor. But, it's really funky tasting. I'd describe the taste like a cross between grass clippings from a lawn mower and a really strong fishy taste. I know the Starbucks Matcha has sugar mixed in there but even still, with a pound of sugar and cream you can still easily taste that fishy flavor. I pretty sure I would not buy again. BUT, the seller shipped it VERY fast and there were no problems otherwise.
