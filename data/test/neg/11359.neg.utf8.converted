This is most definitely the worst K-Cup I have ever tasted.  I have had the pleasure of tasting the majority of K-Cup varieties and this by far the worst!!!!  It smells horrible and tastes even worse.  The best way to describe the odor is the burnt aroma that would come from a coffee pot that was left on a burner until all you could smell was the charred remains.  Since when does Burnt = Kahlua?  After brewing this in my office, I was trying to find lysol or air freshner to clear the air.  I feel I need to run vinegar through machine to clear any trace of this bad coffee.  I have 23 more K-Cups out of the box of 24 if anyone wants them for free.
