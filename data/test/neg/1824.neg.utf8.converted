I'm sorry but I gotta go with the "nasty" crowd here.  The smell, oye...the look, well they kind of look like little intestines...the texture, pure rubber and sort of give you the feeling of biting thru stringy grissle.  Cudos to the folks who can do them, I wish I could but there are some things I can't even do for zero calories.
