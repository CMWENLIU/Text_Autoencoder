This was one of the most foul tasting products I have ever tried.  I first tasted it plain (the many positive reviews tricked me into thinking it would be edible) and I had to spit it out.  I gave it a fair try- I put in on a sandwich, on celery, crackers, everything I could think of.  I even mixed it with real peanut butter, and the taste was still unbearable.  Nobody in my family liked it either, so into the trash can it went!  For everyone who loves peanut butter but doesn't want all the calories and fat, PB2 is a much better alternative to peanut butter.
