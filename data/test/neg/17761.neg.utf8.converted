I tried using this product in the garage after purchasing at a farm store.  The traps made it smell like something died in the garage.  Two traps got 2 flies in 3 days and there were a LOT of flies around.  My kids swatted a lot more flies than these traps caught.  Then I placed them outside where one trap caught maybe 100 flies and the other caught 1 (in addition to the 2 it got in the garage).  But even outside the odor was so bad my husband asked me to get rid of the traps.
