I love wheatgrass (my favorite breakfast is banana smoothie with applesauce and wheatgrass) but really dislike this flavor.  The "berry" bits don't taste like real berries at all; instead, it tastes like someone is desperately trying to cover up the taste of wheatgrass with imitation berry flavor (I know its all natural, etc., that's just my opinion on the overall taste).  Also, I like the flavor of wheatgrass.<br /><br />Last note : as a scientist, I like to see the hard facts about supplements.  Cancer.org has a decent review of wheatgrass ([...]).  It's not a miracle powder, but it has been proven in clinical studies to help with bowel issues.  And it tastes good, if you don't buy the berry one.
