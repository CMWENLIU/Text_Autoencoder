I LOVE LOVE LOVE peanut butter and eat it straight from the jar, and also love powdered PB 2, so thought I'd like Better'n Peanut Butter.  It was disgusting.  I couldn't even keep the spoonful in my mouth or swallow it - had to put it into a napkin and the trash - and I rarely do that with anything.  It has a very peculiar sweetish taste and odd texture. Obviously a lot of people like it, but all I can say is Blechhhhh.
