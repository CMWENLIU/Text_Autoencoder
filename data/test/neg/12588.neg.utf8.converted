I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this purchase.  The product description indicates a variety of caffeinated coffees and five (5) of the 24 k-cups in each of the two (2)  were for cider drinks, iced coffee and DEcaffeinated coffee.  I feel like I have been ripped off.  Twenty percent (20%) of the coffee I received is not what was described and not what I wanted.  I won't buy from this seller again.
