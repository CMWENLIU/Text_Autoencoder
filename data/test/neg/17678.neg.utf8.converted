I got two Baby Tears Plants and one of them died pretty early on - about 2 weeks later. The other one was also kind of 'week' and almost died - it has now 3 branches with some leaves - I hope it'll survive. I was kind of disappointed. I transfered the plants into a little larger pot after arrival - maybe that was the problem. Not sure.
