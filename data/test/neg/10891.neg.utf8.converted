Much as another reviewer indicates, these bully sticks were anything but "thick".  My dog goes through bully sticks on a regular basis and to even call them standard sized was an overstatement.  My dog likes them so I have no complaint about the quality.  The problem is he can go through these at a rate of one a minute.<br /><br />If you are looking for small bullysticks these will suffice, but you can find them for far less elsewhere.  If you are looking for sticks bigger than a pencil, keep look elsewhere.
