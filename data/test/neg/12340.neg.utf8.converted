I'm sure I won't be the only one that stops using this product after they changed the shape and more importantly the flavor of the chews. I just received my most recent shipment of the chews on November 4th, 2010 and I noticed the size of the individually wrapped chews was now rectangular. My first thought was no worries, it's all good new shape, same great product. But once popped that Carmel colored rectangle into my mouth I quickly realized that Benecol had changed the flavor of the chew from caramel, to something that tasted like a combination of butter, sugar and caramel flavoring and in a word, YUCK!<br /><br /> The old chews tasted exactly like a piece of caramel, they were actually pretty tasty and even though it helped lower my cholesterol, I actually enjoyed them as a treat. Now I'll have to find something else because I just can't bring myself to eat something that tastes as bad as these things.<br /><br /> It will be interesting to see how long it takes for Benecol to change the formula again, because I'm willing to bet that the popularity of the product plummets now that it no longer tastes good. Brain dead move Benecol, no doubt someone loses their job over this blunder!
