There is no correlation between the cover of the apple pies on the ad and what you get.  They dont look at all alike.  I would certainly not buy these again.  Maybe l l/2 spoonful of apple inside...and not good tasting either.  Sorry, I hate to do this but the truth is the truth. Dont be fooled.  Not a good product.
