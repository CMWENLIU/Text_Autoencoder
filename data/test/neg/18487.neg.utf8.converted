I usually love french vanilla coffee, but this one is horrible.  Even the smell gets to me, it really does smell similar to a chemical smell.  I am disappointed in tassimos selection lately.  They got rid of Starbucks and they don't have hardly any acceptable flavored coffee.  I think my machine may be ending up on ebay and I may make the switch to Keurig...they have Dunkin Donuts!
