I regularly heat soup in a microwave at my office.  Brands include Campbell's, Progresso, etc. in "microwavable" containers like this HC product.  Each requires a slightly different time to heat completely so the first time I heat a product I watch it carefully to determine that time.<br /><br />I followed the HC directions, removing the metal lid under the plastic cover and replacing the plastic cover.  Our microwave is a relatively low wattage model (compared to the 1700 watts assumed by HC on the label) so I knew it would take longer than the 1 minute 30 seconds they recommend.<br /><br />Because it was lunch hour, other people were waiting while the soup heated.  We were all startled when there was a loud bang from the microwave and the plastic cover blew off the top and the container jumped, splattering soup all over the inside of the oven.  It took about five minutes and a lot of paper towels and water to clean up the mess.<br /><br />The soup that remained tasted fine and the meat was more tender than normal for soup in microwavable containers.<br /><br />That said, I cannot recommend it nor will I buy it again.  I choose such soups for convenience, not excitement.<br /><br />I did report my experience to ConAgra (parent company of HC) but to date they have not responded.
