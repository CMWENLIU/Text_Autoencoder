Spare yourselves the disappointment and do not buy this version of Kraft's Ranch Dressing! You might as well buy a cheap jar of mayo and scoop it on to your salad. Who approved this flavor at Kraft? They certainly lack normal taste buds and don't belong in a position to make any kind of decision regarding Kraft's salad dressing products.<br />I hope I can keep others from the tragic realization I had by writing this note.<br />Good Luck Kraft! This new ranch is history in my book.<br />Sincerely,<br />MM
