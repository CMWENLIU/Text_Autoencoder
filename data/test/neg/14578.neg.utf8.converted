Most of the strip were either hard and brittle or so tough they could barely be chewed. They put no expiration date on the bags so I don't even know if I was given old product or they allowed the salmon to leave the processing plant this way. On top of this, they were too spicy. My dog seemed to enjoy it though.<br /><br />The Ahi tuna, on the other hand, was great.
