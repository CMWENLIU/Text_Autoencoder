I have been drinking tea for some decades, and keeping notes to remind myself of favorites.<br /><br />Green teas usually benefit from steeping at cooler temperatures, and this Boston Tea Dragon Well is no exception. I suggest using water of 185 degrees or cooler.<br /><br />My experience with this Dragonwell was disappointing. The tea was flat and anemic. Not only was there no complexity or freshness to the aroma, the leaves simple had little fragrance at all.<br /><br />The bag I received had no packing or expiration dates. But, the lack of aroma was the first clue that the tea was long past its peak. Older tea does not become rancid, but taste and aroma diminish as packaged tea ages. For best results, search for teas with a packing date of less than six or eight months previous.<br /><br />Trying to obtain more flavor from the tea, I tried longer brewing times and even higher temperatures. More tannins were released, giving some bitterness, but flavor did not improve.<br /><br />Bottom line: I personally will be cautious of buying any Boston Tea product without learning packaging/expiration dates. Trying this Dragonwell is an inexpensive gamble, and perhaps you will receive fresher inventory than I did. However, the package I received truly deserves a rating of two stars.<br /><br />Options: I enjoy Peet's Lung Ching Dragonwell, which comes in a steel canister. And, sometimes Asian markets can yield unusual pleasures. I recently picked up Tian Hu Shan Dragon Well for just a few dollars. It was reasonably good, and certainly more flavorful than this Boston Tea product when I did a taste comparison. Good luck in your tea tastings.
