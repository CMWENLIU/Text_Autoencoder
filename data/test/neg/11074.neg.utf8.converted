While these seems tasty and have a good texture, they are made in China. Despite what the manufacturer or anyone else says, while I might let my child play with a toy or wear clothes made in China, I would not let my child ingest any food made in China.  My colleagues at work have visited with manufacturers of all types of products in China (including food) and based on what I have heard from their first hand accounts as well as the known incidents such as melamine milk, I would not let my baby put food made in China is his mouth.  Sorry, not worth the risk in my opinion.
