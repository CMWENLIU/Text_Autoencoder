I'm not repulsed by pests in my food (I figure if it's cooked, it can't hurt you), but i was disspointed to find 5 dried maggots in this product given it is produced in the US, I paid $5 for it, and i was hungry and really craving mushroom risotto.  I found the maggots when i rehydrated the mushrooms and strained the liquid through a paper towel to remove grit.
