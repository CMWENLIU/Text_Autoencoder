I always enjoy Starbucks PSL's so I thought this was going to be a great buy.  Mistake I made is I bought a lot of this.  Did not like the taste at all.  Seems like its too much spice not enough pumpkin.  I have been adding flavored creamers to this coffee just so they don't go to waste.  It helps.  Won't buy this again and won't buy so many without tasting  first.  My bad.
