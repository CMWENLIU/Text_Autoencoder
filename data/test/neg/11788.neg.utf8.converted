Sorry, but I really don't get all the great reviews.  I have been drinking green tea for more than 20 years and this tastes nothing like good quality green tea to me.  I admit, the smell is quite nice right when you open up the packet.  But once you steep it, all the taste and aroma goes away.  I had to force myself to drink this on three separate occasions just to make sure my taste buds didn't just have an off day or something.  I seriously can't drink this flavorless "tea" anymore and am throwing the rest away.  Good thing it wasn't very expensive.  If there's a Asian grocery store in your area, try out as many brands as you can to get a good sense of good and bad green tea.  I like My Green Tea a lot.  But I don't think they're readily available in most places.
