I've been using Wellness "Just for Puppy" dry dog food mix ever since I brought my French Bulldog puppy home with great results. My pup simply loves his dog food and happily chows down at every meal.<br /><br />With the positive results from the puppy food I decided to try out these Wellness "Just for Puppy Treats". Unfortunately, even though the ingredient list is impressive - real pieces of lamb & salmon along with a mix of veggies and fruit - the results have been less than ideal. These treats cause my pup to have room-clearing gas and make his stool extremely runny.<br /><br />I planned on using these treats for obedience training and positive reinforcement for house breaking. But after putting up with a solid week of terrible gas and diarrhea I had to switch to a different puppy treat I purchase at my local Whole Foods. The results were immediately better - a lot less gas and firm stool.
