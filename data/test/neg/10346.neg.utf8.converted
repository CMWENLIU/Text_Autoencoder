Being a great fan of 85% plus chocolate I was excited to try this 88% product. What a disappointment! It manages the remarkable feat of being bland at 88%! It lacks flavour (tastes like extremely cheap chocolate), has a poor, dry mouth feel and is overly sweet. I suspect the presence of Soy Lechtin is not helping. It is very light in colour compared with similar strength chocolate - again amazingly so for a claimed 88% bar. If you only eat 85% plus chocolate then it is unlikely you will enjoy this chocolate :-(
