I ordred this for $19.00 and 2 days later the price dropped to $12.98.<br /><br />I know Amazon has several different people selling the same product, but this is LITERALLY the same exact product.  I click on the product link in my order history, and it takes me directly to this exact product with the lower price.<br /><br />Contacted Amazon, and guess what, they don't even price match their own products.  It is not like I told them I found it cheaper at Walmart, no, it is the same product on their site and they won't match the lower price and refund me the $7.00 difference.  Unbelievable rip-off.
