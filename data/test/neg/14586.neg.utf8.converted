Baby Gourmet has a good idea here - organic food makes mommy feel good about what she's giving her baby, and at the same time it tastes good for the baby.  This particular variety, Juicy Pear & Garden Greens, does taste good as far as baby food goes.  You taste the pear more than the green (which tasted mostly like broccoli to me), and you certainly don't smell the green (odor goes a long way with mommies, especially if it gags you to spoon it into the baby's mouth!)<br /><br />My biggest problem with this food is not the food itself, it is the packaging.  "Organic" implies that the food is not just healthier for your (or your baby's) body, it also suggests that it is better for the earth itself because there were no chemicals used & therefore no pollution to the earth caused by growing the food.  It is hypocritical to then produce the food in packaging that simply has to be thrown away because it has no recycling options whatsoever.  The packaging for this food is completely unrecyclable, as far as I can figure out.<br /><br />The cap, although hard plastic like many other food containers, has no recycle symbol on it and therefore cannot be recycled in most recycling programs.  The actual food pouch is just like a juice pouch, which also cannot be recycled in curbside recycling programs - the best some juice companies have done so far is ask you to clean the pouches and turn them in to be repurposed (or make crafts with them yourself).  The plastic spout on this pouch makes it even harder to do something like that, and the truth is most people don't repurpose, they just throw it out when there are no recycling options.<br /><br />While it is convenient, the packaging leaves much to be desired, and would lead me to purchase one of the other organic baby food options out there just because I could then recycle the container when I'm through.
