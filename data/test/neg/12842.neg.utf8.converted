I was not highly impressed with these sardines. Not a great taste, higher in fat and lower in protein than the ones packed in olive oil, BUT they are lower in sodium than most. Amazon is still the best place to buy them, but just make sure what you really want first. The two layer in olive oil have a much better flavor and texture and they are not that much more in price.
