Stuck with it.  Gonna have to order something else cus I can't take drinking it anymore.<br /><br />There's a tag stuck on the bag with the numbers "30911".  If it's meant to be a date of some significance then that's clearly a problem because March 9, 2011 was almost 9 months ago.<br /><br />FWIW this is the second 5 lb. bag of Coffee Bean Direct that I have received from Amazon.  The first one was one of the Sumatrans and it was fresh... tasted great
