Do not know what everyone is raving about concerning these almonds but the ones I received today and just returned back were horrible. They arrived cracked chipped and totally broken. I tasted two of them and not only were they tasteless but they left a metallic after taste. Being born in Italy and having tasted many Jordan Almonds--these were not authentic. The real Jordan Almonds are truly sweet, with a sugary coating and they just melt in your mouth. These also smelled "plasticky" when they are supposed to have a hint of vanilla in the smell--which is heavenly. I rarely write reviews but I just had to with these almonds. So you may save $2-or-$4--the extra cost is worth it to get truly delicious and authentic Jordan Almonds. I gave this product Zero stars but it would not let me so that is why you see one star.
