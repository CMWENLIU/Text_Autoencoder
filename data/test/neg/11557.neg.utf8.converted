As with Mr. Carlson's review, my order was also received damaged, no less than one container leaking badly & messing up all other containers up (had ordered 12 liters total). This most certainly is due to Amazon's continuing long-term practice of inadequate packing for shipping. Inflatable, lightweight, flimsy plastic bubbles packs for 3 gallons+ of juice with lots of "slop" packing-wise? Of course they will arrive damaged! In fairness though, the seals of the caps are very lightweight too.<br /><br />The expiration date on my juice was 2013, much better than Mr. Carson experienced. Have also appreciated the taste as well as the juice's truly amazing amount of vitamin C as well as the total price comparatively... but c'mon, Amazon! For years I've written to report damaged items from inadequate shipping practices, a few just this past year counting this shipment.<br /><br />So far as the Soursop fruit being 100 or even 10,000 times more effective than chemotherapy, my thought is that this is simply from the great amount of natural vitamin C available in the fruit/juice & may be nothing more than that. One liter of this juice contains about a half dozen times the FDA's suggested adult male's necessary intake of vitamin C (about 7 times of an adult female's needs) & this alone would likely be dozens of times more effective than taking dozens of times more of a synthetic vitamin C in pill form.<br /><br />Amazon simply must do better in packing this product for shipment as well as do much better packing many other items for shipment, though my honest opinion is that even if Amazon were to amp up their packing of this product that the flimsy outer seals on the containers may well not be adequate for shipping even then though they certainly must be better packed if Amazon has any hope of these arriving to customers undamaged. Thank you.<br /><br />~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~<br /><br />Edit, weeks later: Ordered 2 more shipments of the same with worse results. One package did not so much as make it out of Nevada it was leaking so badly & undeliverable as a consequence. The other arrived as the last one had, except this time 2 of the 12 liters were leaking. Amazon used the very same totally inadequate large air bag packing in a box with lots of slop for the heavy liters of juice to crush & pop, resulting in the containers getting tossed around during transit. No wonder some leak. Not UPS friendly packing for shipment.<br /><br />Frustrating, having written the review, even directing Amazon to it as well as expressing myself thoroughly as has been done for the better part of a decade & Amazon has yet to change their packing system. Folks, the juice is very good, 4 of 5 stars. It's Amazon's continued predilection for lame packing of so many products over the years that is so unnecessary, in my estimation, 1 of 5 stars, that reduces this fine product to my rating of 2 of 5. Again, thank you.
