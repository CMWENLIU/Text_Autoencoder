I bought this for my picky 5yo, since she'll actually eat this for lunch at school.  I didn't even THINK for a second to check the ingredients to see if the trans-fat ridden and cheap "Partially Hydrogenated" oil was used to make FROOT LOOPS.  -I mean, really!  I cannot believe that in the year 2006, Kellogs is still using such cheap and unhealthy ingredients in their cereals, which are aimed at kids!!  They have at least attempted to make this cereal seem "healthy" by lowering the sugar content, but would be even better if they took out the partially hydrogenated crap!!!
