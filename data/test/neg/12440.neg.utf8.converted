I really wanted to like this one-stop-shop for my morning run out the door. However, the taste is getting in the way. I prefer making a similar mixture with a packet of Instant Breakfast mix (no sugar), a half packet of Via (your choice of brew) and a half scoop of premium Chocolate or Vanilla Whey protein powder. You end up with something better tasting, higher in protein and lighter on the e-wallet.
