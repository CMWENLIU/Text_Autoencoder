From the front of the package (and the only image shown), you'd think it was 100% macadamia nut oil, but it's actually olive oil "flavored" with macadamia nut extract when you read the back of the package. So if you're looking for any of the health benefits or the high cooking temp of the real thing, look elsewhere.
