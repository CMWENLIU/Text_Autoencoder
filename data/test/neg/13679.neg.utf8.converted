I was a loyal customer of this product for over four years.  It WAS the best pizza crust by far!!!  BUT, they reduced the amount of mix per pizza.  Used to use 2.25 cups of flower for a 14" pizza.  Now, they want you to use 1.25.  It is terrible now.  You have to reduce the amount of water that they recommend in order to get a crust that is not too watery.  I am very disappointed. I am not a celiac, but my wife is.  I enjoyed this pizza crust even more than regular wheat flour crusts.  But, no longer.  Namaste, raise the price on your product.  Do not try and fool people by giving us less product and telling us it makes the same amount.
