I never purchased this product. I did some research on emergency kits and one of the big questions is how to handle the water requirements. Guidelines state 1 gallon (about 4 liters) of water per day per person. It would take 6 of these cases (48 boxes of 250ml) to built a 72-hour kit for each member of the household. it would cost you A LOT of money - well over $100 with shipping - per person, for 72-hours. the only gain is the 5 year claimed shelf life.<br /><br />In contrast, buying simple bottled water would cost you about $1 - 2 per gallon, and has a 2 year "best before" date. It will probably taste better if you rotate it once a year, and will sustain life without poisoning you for much longer than 2 years. A simple trip to the grocery store and now I have 7 days of water for a family of 4 for under $40. Even if I replace the water every year, it is still way cheaper than buying specialized emergency water. Sorry Aqua Blox.
