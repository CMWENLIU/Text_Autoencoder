Very, very disappointed with this.  I was a huge, huge fan of the original Honey Milk Light Chocolate and waited very anxiously while the brand conversion was made from Honey Milk to Core Power.  I did NOT expect the product to change, and from their message boards it didn't sound like it was.<br /><br />Well, guess what?  It did.  Amazon finally had cases of the Core Power Chocolate Light available and I excitedly ordered one even though the price had gone up $10.  This morning, I took one sip of the new chocolate drink and instantly knew something was wrong.  It tasted disgusting - like diet milk - and had a strong aftertaste like I had just drunk a Diet Coke.  Sure enough, when I compared the ingredient list to a Coffee Honey Milk Light that I still had, they had changed the formula to use a sugar alcohol as a sweetener!!  Yuck!<br /><br />It looks like the "regular" version of Core Power stayed true to the original honey milk formula, but I don't really want the calorie/sugar trade off to get 6 extra grams of protein.  The original light version of Honey Milk was perfect.  Thanks for screwing it up.  You should at least tell people that the formula changed before the blow $40 on this lame product.  I want my money back!<br /><br />BTW, the picture of the nutritional label that is currently posted on the product page (as of 6/14/2012) is not accurate and does not match what is on the bottle.  The ingredient list does not show that it contains erythritol (the sugar alcohol).
