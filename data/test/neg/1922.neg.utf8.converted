The description is misleading. These are mini Chupa Chups, not the full size ones. There is nothing in the description stating this. It's such a waste of packaging, because the suckers are tiny. I am very disappointed in Penguin Mints. I love their mints, but I won't be buying anything from them again. The suckers may not be so fresh either. The flavor isn't as vibrant as I remember. Also, the flavors are kind of limited. This is stated in the description. However, it's still disappointing to get so few flavors when they are made in 50+ flavors. Even though the description lists 8 different flavors, may bag has only 5: choco-vanilla, cherry, strawberry, strawberries & cream, and orange. I hate orange flavored candy:( I can't seem to find anyone who sells online in the US who has cola, or any of the more interesting flavors available.
