Let me start by saying my dog weighs 24 lbs but should be 17 lbs. I make this point because she is overweight and will eat anything.I purchased these treats because they are low calorie, all natural and had great reviews. I tried for 3 days but she wouldn't eat even 1 little morsel.Obviously I was disappointed and also shocked like I stated she's 7 years old and will eat anything. Maybe the bag I received was stale but wasted my money and tossed into the garbage.
