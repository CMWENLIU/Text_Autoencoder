I bought Emeril's K-cups based on the reviews here. I love strong, bold coffee but Emeril's goes way over the top. There is a difference between bold and bitter and this coffee is just plain bitter and it is one of the worst coffees I have ever had. I got a Keurig B60 after my coffee maker broke and saw a Keurig in one of the lounges at work. I was taken in by its convenience and bought one and am the sorriest person I ever did. I have sampled all the Keurig K-cups and cannot find one to my liking. They are either too weak and watery no matter what size cup you make or just plain bitter which leaves an aftertaste. In addition,if you like stronger coffee, you need to make the smallest size cup, 5.5 oz. which in this day and age is ridiculous; people drink out of large mugs and you can drink that 5.5 oz in 3 or 4 gulps! I am getting rid of the darn thing and going back to brewing my own. There is a reason that the majority of the nation's premium coffee roasters have NOT jumped on the Keurig bandwagon. It does not make an excellent cup of joe.
