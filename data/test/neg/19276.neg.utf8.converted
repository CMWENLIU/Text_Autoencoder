I read the previous reviews for this K-cup variety pack and I was skeptical, but wanted a good selection of coffees for my new Keurig so I decided to just order it. I received it today (7/19/12) and I am NOT HAPPY. I mean the selection was good for the most part, but most of the cups were EXPIRED or very close to being expired (within a month or two). This is what I received:<br />Timothy's: Parisian Nights - Best Before Date (BBD)3/21/12 EXPIRED<br />Timothy's: Morning Blend - BBD 3/29/12 EXPIRED<br />Timothy's: Italian Blend - BBD 4/12/12 EXPIRED<br />Timothy's: Decaf Rainforest Espresso - BBD 1/19/12 EXPIRED<br />Timothy's: Rainforest Espresso - BBD 4/3/12 EXPIRED<br />Timothy's: Breakfast Blend - BBD 3/26/12 EXPIRED<br />Timothy's: Peppermint Tea - BBD 4/24/12 EXPIRED<br />Timothy's: Chinese Green Tea - BBD 6/23/12 EXPIRED<br />Emeril's: Jazzed Up Decaf - BBD 7/11/12 EXPIRED<br />Wolfgang Puck: Sorrento - BBD 7/11/12 EXPIRED<br />Tully's: Italian Roast - BBD 7/3/12 EXPIRED<br />Tully's: House Blend - BBD 7/17/12 EXPIRED<br />Green Mountain: Hot Apple Cider - BBD 7/13/12 EXPIRED<br />Coffee People: Organic - BBD 5/1/12 EXPIRED<br />Grove Square: Caramel Apple and Spiced Apple (2 k-cups) both were rock hard solid when shook, Expiration date unknown, but UNUSABLE<br />Wolfgang Puck: Creme Caramel - BBD 9/7/12<br />Wolfgang Puck: Hawaiian Hazelnut - BBD 8/18/12<br />Wolfgang Puck: Vanilla - BBD 7/24/12<br />Wolfgang Puck: Jamaica Me Crazy - BBD 7/26/12<br />Newman's Own: Special Blend - BBD 8/29/12<br />Timothy's: Kahlua - BBD 9/11/12<br />Caribou: Colombia - BBD 9/11/12<br />Green Mountain: Golden French Toast - BBD 10/22/12<br />Green Mountain: Spicy Eggnog - BBD 8/28/12<br />Green Mountain: Our Blend - BBD 8/29/12<br />Green Mountain: French Roast - BBD 8/1/12<br />Green Mountain: Donut House Chocolate Glazed - BBD 8/31/12<br />Coffee People: Jet Fuel - BBD 10/9/12<br />Coffee People: Black Tiger - BBD 9/7/12<br />Bigelow: Chamomile - BBD 12/28/12<br />Bigelow: Mint Medley - BBD 12/27/12<br />Celestial: Decaf Green Tea - BBD 9/20/12<br />Grove Square: Hazelnut Cappuccino - expiration date unknown, but seems fine<br />Grove Square: Hot Cocoa Milk Chocolate - expiration date unknown, but seems fine<br /><br />so basically, I received 16 out of 35 UNUSABLE k-cups. I am requesting a refund or product exchange. It's up to you if you want to take a gamble on getting good k-cups, but I regret buying from this seller.<br />Thanks!
