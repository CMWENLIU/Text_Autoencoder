**Well, I'm amending my review... in the negative.  10 more dogs found it completely unappetizing.  Some wouldn't even pay attention to me when I held it out.  The few who tried seemed to spit it out in confusion, like, "Why does a cookie taste bad?  I don't understand this."  Have to return.  Wholly disappointing.<br /><br />As a behaviorist at a local shelter, I need lots of different types of treats to keep dogs' attention.  I trust Zuke's to make non-reactive yet enticing doggie snacks and had success with their moist "mini naturals", so I thought I'd give this a shot.  I bought the Blueberry flavor.  So far, 5 dogs have informed me in varying ways that they couldn't give less of a flip that these are edible.  I've had them spat on the ground or flat-out ignored.  I have no idea where Zuke's went so wrong with this treat, but 5 otherwise treat-motivated pups give it two paws down.<br /><br />Risking disgusted stares, I will venture this information; I occasionally taste a crumb of a dog treat.  These were entirely bland and tasteless, and frankly reminded me of the insides of a vitamin pill.  No hint of blueberry or peanut butter... and downright sandy.  They may be starting to sell old stock from the back of the warehouse, as others had good experiences earlier with this treat.  I can't explain this shelter's unanimous population down-vote any other way.
