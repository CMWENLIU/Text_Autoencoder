I love looking for healthy alternatives, but this taste weird and if you don't like 85-90% cocoa then you will definitely not like the taste of this product.  And we decided it was not a taste we were going to get used to.  It is expensive and like another reviewer, it is an important for first timers to know that it does not taste good.<br />Now we have to throw the whole lot out as I can't think of any alternatives use for it other than melt it and add loads of sugar!!
