I have concerns with this product that would prevent me from buying.  It has more calories and sugar than regular coke and was much too sweet for my taste.  The strawberry flavor was not subtle but had a "bite".  All this might be OK if it tasted terrific; however, it doesn't to me at all.  It tastes sort of candyish--or like someone carbonated strawberry jelly. And it costs almost a dollar a can....
