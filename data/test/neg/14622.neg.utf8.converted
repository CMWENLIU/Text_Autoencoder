NOTICE TO ANY PRESCRIPTION DRUG PATIENTS ... it is not clear on most liquid stevia products how many of them (this one included) utilize "grapefruit seed extract" as an additive (typically as a natural preservative). If you take any medication that restricts or suggests avoidance of grapefruit "juice," I strongly recommend that do a bit of research before relying on the "seed extract" issue as not be included as a concern. My research has shown that grapefruit "seed extract" can have the same impact as grapefruit "juice" relative to interfering with how some medications are metabolized or absorbed. It appears they (grapefruit juice and/or seed extract) actually have the ability to render some drugs almost completely ineffective.  I have been a long term user and advocate of the positive benefits of grapefruit seed extract as a supplement (natural anti-fungal, anti-yeast, antibacterial, etc.); however, really had not expected that grapefruit "seed extract" might, in fact, end up as an unexpected additive and, more specifically, that it (seed extract) would end up showing the same evidence of drug interference as grapefruit juice does with two of the drugs I am required to take. I already knew about "no grapefruit juice" at all, but no mention of the grapefruit seed extract connection. Of course I understand that this product includes an incredibly small percentage of the seed extract, unfortunately, I haven't found any conclusive information regarding any "acceptable" amounts of the seed extract or data addressing any sort of "volume" thresholds of juice or seed extract.  I'm disappointed I can't use this product anymore (and wish I'd known this sooner and/or even thought to ask my doctor or pharmacist sooner); however, I FEEL SO STRONGLY that I should introduce this issue to anybody else this might effect regarding health recovery, maintenance, or quality of life. --  PLEASE ALSO NOTE:  I only gave one star to enable this to post (and hopefully get any appropriate individual(s)' attention). This was a five star product for me for quite some time as far as quality of taste, overall value, and excellent "blend-ability" with any kind of fluid or food ...  it really is one of the best if you have no restrictions. I'm sad I can't use this type anymore. I do now, however, use some stevita packets that I like, and am trying a couple liquids that are available that don't have the grapefruit seed extract additive (or at least not listed) ... I'll post a review if/when I find one I can confidently verify as grapefruit seed extract free.
