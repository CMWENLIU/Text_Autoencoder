I tried this product out of curiosity since it was new.  It tastes like all the others but with a much higher price tag.  I am now at the point where I think bottled water is such a waste of money and natural resources - clogging landfills with all the bottles that no one recycles - that I am going to buy a water filter for my sink and just use that.  You can also buy packets of electrolytes from companies like Emergen-C and add them to your water.  I used those when I ran a marathon and they worked wonders!  Save a buck and save the environment...use filtered water in a bottle you can reuse.
