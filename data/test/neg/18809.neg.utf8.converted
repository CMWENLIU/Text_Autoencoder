I know flavored coffee is not intended to be blow your socks off dark roast, but all of the flavors in this variety pack are very weak, consider that if you like a full bodied cup, or taste.<br />The best of the bunch is probably the Egg Nog, which has a nice almost rum flavor, the Gingerbread is fairly bland, the French Toast is more like French Vanilla with a touch of cinnamon and the Holiday Blend is just plain and weak.<br />I got these locally for $25.99, and thought that was pricey for only 48 cups, I don't mind having to pay for the different flavors for a change, but these are seriously overpriced here.
