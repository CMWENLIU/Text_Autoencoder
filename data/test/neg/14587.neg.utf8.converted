This Baby Gourmet baby food claims that it is BPA Plastics-Free and Organic. They make these claims boldly and prominently. And thus it is fair to critically examine them and their motives and products and claims and prior corporate history when rating these premium products. I guess we could have reasonable faith in the two features, USDA Organic and BPA-Free, even though we really wouldn't know anything about how these foods are grown, manufactured or packaged unless we were experts and had accurate data on the entire production chains. However, there is still an obvious major hole in BPA-Free product claims today. Many alternative news and safety organizations/groups claim that plastics manufacturers and food companies knew for decades that BPA was highly dangerous for humans, and yet they still chose to go ahead using it for food either through willful negligence and greed, or outright intent to poison the American population (for various conspiracy theories/realities). If that's true, and it certainly could be--since the same companies now are conceding that BPA could be dangerous--then the big obvious hole in the story now is that all these same companies are NOT certifying that the CURRENT plastics and substances they use for packaging and processing are not dangerous and harmful, to the best of their knowledge. Anotherwords, they eliminated the BPA, but the same potential problems could remain, dangerous impurities and toxic substances, and the manufacturers have included no promise, guarantee or certification on their products that they promise and certify they are telling the truth that they know of no potential likely dangers in the current new generation materials and processes. Therefore, the only logical conclusion to draw, based on past behavior, is that these companies and corporations cannot be trusted, you have no reasonable expectation that they can ever be trusted, or will ever deserve to be, and therefore any use of products for babies mass-manufactured by Anyone, let alone major food companies and corporations, or any profit-seeking entity, whose only agenda is profit, should not and must not be trusted or relied upon, and you proceed in using them at your own (your children's) risk. (And, even if they did do such certification, as we have learned in the past 20 years, the certifications of governments, corporations, companies, and indeed most NGO's/think tank's/activists/and lobbyists are worth about as much as the paper they're printed on.)
