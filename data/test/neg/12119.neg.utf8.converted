I've cooked with this type of sauce twice now. The first time, I had it with low-sodium soy sauce in the dish I made. It turned out painfully salty to the point that we washed the dish in the sink, re-heated it and ate it that way. Even then, you could taste the saltiness.<br /><br />Thinking it was my fault for even adding any type of soy sauce to it, I bought a new jar and tried it alone in the dish. Once more, the saltiness was so overpowering, one couldn't even eat anything without having to rinse the dish off.<br /><br />The tastiness of the black beans and garlic is there, but the saltiness is way too overpowering and is too much to take in.
