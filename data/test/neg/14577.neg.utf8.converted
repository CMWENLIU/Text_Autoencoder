This salmon jerky is so unbelievably tough, it is pretty much inedible.  And when you do painstakingly gnaw on it, it doesn't release much flavor, but instead just turns into sharpish little sticks in your mouth.  I had the misfortune of ordering this, and 7 of the 8 bags are still untouched, and I'm not sure what to do with them.  I even tried soaking the jerky, and tried boiling it with some macaroni, and NOTHING seems to soften this stuff up!  What a waste of money.  Go for some beef jerky instead, and if you need salmon, eat it fresh or canned.  This product is a joke.
