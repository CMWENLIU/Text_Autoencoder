This is the only variety of Wellness food that my cat refuses to eat.  It is also the only variety that smells horrid.  Most of the varieties actually smell good, especially the chicken or turkey flavors.  This one is nauseating.  In fact, the first can I opened smelled so bad that I thought the product was spoiled and opened a second.  Now, either both were spoiled or neither were and it just smells horrific.  Too bad, as the product isn't inexpensive (though this Amazon sale is, perhaps because it doesn't sell well??).
