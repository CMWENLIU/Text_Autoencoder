I ordered the Nutiva Hemp protein powder as listed, but received the hemp protein powder plus fiber. After MANY messages exchanged between myself and the vitamin shoppe they FINALLY refunded my money. It took them over 10 days to do this, and it was extremely tedious having to deal with their atrocious customer service. Instead of offering to correct the problem, then sent me on some wild goose chase for a lot number (which did not exist). Finally they told me that the vitamin shoppe does not carry the product listed. Unbelievable.
