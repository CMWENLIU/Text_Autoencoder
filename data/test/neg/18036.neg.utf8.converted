i tried to be a conscientious consumer but there is not any info on AMAZON of where  the country of product origin is. BTW it is a product of a South American country which means that the cattle this was derived from injested the toxic chemicals that are sprayed as pesticides , chemicals banned in the US.<br /><br />its a 6 pound bag and they are large but I will not risk my dogs life.
