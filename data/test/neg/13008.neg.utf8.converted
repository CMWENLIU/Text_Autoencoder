I was really excited when I seen this Jalapeno sauce at the grocery store because I love taco bell's quesadilla's but I was very disappointed when I made my own Quesadilla at home with it because it doesn't taste anything like the jalapeno sauce that Taco Bell uses on theirs. I has a mild kick to it which I like but it has a funny  smell and taste. Not a funny after taste but an actually funny taste when you first taste it.. I would not rebuy it. It was only $1.50 so it was worth it to try..
