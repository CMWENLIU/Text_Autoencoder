I bought Columela because it had gotten such praise from other reviewers and on other websites.  I did a blind taste test of the Columela against my favorite olive oil from O&Co, which is, admittedly, somewhat more expensive.  I did not like the Columela.  My bottle does not have a fruity taste.  Instead, it is somewhat bitter, and I found the taste somewhat unpleasant.  I would much rather pay a little more and get a much tastier oil from O&Co.
