I was shopping K cups and this item was stuck in the middle of the listing for<br />all Kcups.  I ordered, not seeing that they weren't K cups like everything else<br />on the page.  Now I'm stuck with 3 boxes of coffee that don't fit in anything I<br />own.  Wish Amazon would remove it from the Kcups listing.  Other people have done<br />this too!  Not right that they won't let you return them.
