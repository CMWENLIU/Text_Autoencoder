I was excited when I bought this because if it was anything like what the coffee tastes like from the keurig machines then it was going to be awesome.... I tried the peach/black tea and it was nasty to say the least.... there was almost no peach flavor and it was supposed to be sweetened... it isnt... I like to drink unsweetend tea but this was just nasty and extremely bitter with a chemical aftertaste.
