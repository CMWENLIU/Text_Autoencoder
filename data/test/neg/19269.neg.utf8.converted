The high amount of fish meal in this food probably contains ethoxyquine which is a carcinogenic preservative. It accumulates in the liver and causes damage down the road. Unless you can get written verification that this company buys fish meal that does not contain ethoxyquine, do not feed this food. I think it states on the bag that no artificial preservatives are "added". This just means that Solid Gold company did not add artificial preservatives in their formulation (dog food companies are not required to list ingredients which were already present in the meals that they purchased). Fish meal in dry dog food is the newest fad since it is now recognized that dogs need essential omega 3 fatty acids. Unfortunately, these fatty acids have a very short shelf life (a week maybe?)and so dry dog food is not a reliable supply for these fats. Adding large amounts of a very strong anti-oxidant (ethoxyquine, which was developed as a pesticide and later found to be excellent for preventing the oxidation of latex rubber)is the only way to keep fish dregs (i.e. "fish meal")from becoming overly putrid. If you don't have a good preservative, then your dog ends up eating rancid fats which are also toxic. Solution: feed a natural diet of real food. If you still want to feed kibble, buy one that does not contain ethoxyquine and fish meal, then supplement your dog with human grade fish oil capsules. Also, don't fall for the flaxseed gimmick either. The short chain omega 3 fatty acids in flaxseed are not converted to the essential long chain fatty acids that high food chain mammals need. Dogs do not have the enzyme to make the conversion (ruminants do and so do krill!)
