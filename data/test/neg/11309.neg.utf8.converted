I purchased this as a gift and expected a nice variety of decaf teas. More than half of the package was English Breakfast and Earl Grey, neither of which the gift recipient likes. Since she doesn't like them and I don't have a Keurig, they will be going to waste. The rest of the pack was mostly mint, with a couple of chamomile, green tea, and rooibos. If you are looking for good variety, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. If you don't mind your variety pack leaning heavily one way or another, this pack might be good for you.
