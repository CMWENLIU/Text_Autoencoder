There were bugs in this product.  I've grown wheatgrass from seeds for over 15 years. You can tell when you first fill the soaking jar w/water (to rinse them). Gently shake it back and forth and the bugs float to the top.  If you bring a bug into your pantry it will lay eggs and you'll have bugs in all of you grains.  I had to throw it away.
