I bought a bunch of the Kitchens of India items during a promotional sale and the only one I'd recommend is the butter chicken sauce. If they were tasty I could overlook the salt content for the occasional enjoyment but I'm not loving the taste. This one's consistency is like baby food.  I ofter buy similar products, including a hearty Palak Paneer from Trader Joes and those, in my opinion, are much better in flavor and cost far less.
