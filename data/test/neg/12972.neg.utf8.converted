I wish that the food companies would treat their customers with respect by not putting unhealthy ingredients in their products. These bouillon cubes contain not only an inordinate amount of sodium but MSG as well. And then as an added bonus they threw in some hydrogenated oil. WHAT are they thinking when they pump this garbage out and box it up? Hey Knorr - if we all end up too sick to work from eating this kind of so-called food, we won't have any money to give you. If your conscience won't cause you to use wholesome ingredients maybe the thought of losing out on sales will.
