The old recipe for 70% Lindt bars was perfect -- it was just the right balance, and my favorite dark chocolate bar at the price point.<br /><br />The new one is flavorless and waxy, tastes like I'm biting into a brown crayon.  I'd rather eat a Hershey bar.  No idea what Lindt is thinking.  Their website says they made this change after extensive consumer tests showed folks wanted a "smoother" taste with a "less intense cocoa flavor."  Who on earth would buy a chocolate bar advertising 70% cocoa content and expect it not to be intense?
