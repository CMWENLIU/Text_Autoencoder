Product was smaller than the description, Product was priced more than three times what it should have been priced, compared to others on the market. It was received in poor condition. I WILL NOT ever buy from Hirts Garden and/or Amazon again, due to their deceptive description and poor condition of the product. I buy items like these to grow and to resell to my customers. This item is so poor it will not grow and is virtually not saleable. As far as I'm cocerned this is a big internet SCAM!!!
