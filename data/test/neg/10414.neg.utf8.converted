I grew up eating merguez so it's easy for me to tell good from bad. These merguez were not the worst I ever had but close. Cooking them so much fat came out I had to empty the pan a couple of times. The fat was red meaning that they use artificial colorant which is not good either... I wouldn't recommend this product.
