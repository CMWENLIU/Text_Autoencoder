Beware---what used to be a wonderful, tasty cracker is now a dry piece of cardboard!!!  Sometime this summer the new boxes appeared in stores with the blue banner across front saying "Now with Tastier Crunch."  They are awful!  I can't imagine that they test marketed these crackers because nobody seems to like them.  I used to buy a few boxes and week and now I will never buy again unless they change back to earlier recipe.  I give Amazon 5 stars because they refunded my money.  This is because I called to check on formula before I ordered and I was told it was not the new one.  Beware -- it is...
