That's great that they have so many good ingredients that are beneficial, but the problem is no one is going to want to eat them when they taste like compressed particle board.  Which these do.  They're like Kashi bars, but worse.  Incredibly hard, bland, flavorless and just an overall huge disappointment.  I had half of one, and couldn't even finish the rest.  My 5-year-old son took one bite, and I couldn't get him to eat anymore.  After the rest of the family and my extended family tried them, I couldn't GIVE these things away.  No one wanted them.  They're THAT bad.<br /><br />So if you want to eat a bar with good ingredients and you have lost any and all sense of taste, these are the bars for you!
