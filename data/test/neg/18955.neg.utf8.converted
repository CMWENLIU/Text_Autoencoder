This hemp seed made me and my family extremely ill.<br /><br />I ordered the 3 lb bag. I do not know if this was a fluke or just a bad batch but this was TERRIBLE<br /><br />I received the product in great time. It arrived in about 3 or 4 days and i gave half of the bag to my daughter. I used hemp seed mostly in my protein shakes. I've been taking hemp seed for about 4 months now. When I got this product, i used it in one of my shakes and 2 hours later I had horrible stomach pain and threw everything up. My stomach continued to feel horrible all day. I really didn't even think it was the shake, but a stomach virus at the time. Then 3 days later, my daughter called me and told me she got very sick, with similar symptoms. She had mentioned that it was a couple hours after drinking a shake she made with the hemp seed. At that point I was afraid to use to product, unsure if it was the hemp seed or my family had gotten a "bug" (by the way, my daughter does not live at home). So a month just passed and today I decided to give it another try. I made a shake and put 2 tablespoons of hemp seed in it (the recommended dosage is 3 but i only use 2 in my shakes). And then, like clockwork, 2 hours later i threw everything up and my stomach still feels horrible and i still feel nauseous. The expiration date of this product is December of 2012 so its not expired but there has to be something wrong with it.  To date, we've used about 6 tablespoons of this stuff and we haven't thrown the rest away in hopes the company will contact us and want it back for testing and give us a refund. I'm not saying the company acted maliciously but I do believe this may have been a bad/tainted batch.
