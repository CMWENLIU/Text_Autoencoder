Don't buy the cherry tomato seed kit unless you own the newer, higher aerogarden!<br /><br />I own the "standard" Aerogarden.  This version has a maximum distance of about two feet from pods to lights.  I had previously had a great experience growing the herbs.  The tomatoes just needed a lot more headroom that my aerogarden provided.  My harvest was a meager eight (if great-tasting) cherry tomatoes.  I've noticed that since my experience, Aerogarden has introduced a new version with a four foot headroom.  I think the tomato seed kit should be clearly labelled as requiring the four foot version!<br /><br />Also, make certain to read the directions--you'll need to pollinate the tomato flowers by hand, which is a straightforward process that is clearly described.<br /><br />I'm now planting another round of herbs.
