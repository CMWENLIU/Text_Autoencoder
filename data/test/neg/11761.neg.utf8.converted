I was very excited to read the terrific reviews about these white chips and ordered the three pack. When they arrived, and I opened the first package, I was profoundly disappointed, these are easily the worst white chocolate I have ever tasted. The texture is hard and waxy, like cold margarine. There is almost no vanilla flavor, they are too sweet and the overall impression is horrid. The second ingredient after sugar is vegetable fat, and it shows, the chips are not smooth and do not readily melt, giving the mouth feel of cold margarine. I wonder if the other reviewers have never tasted superb white chocolate, because I cannot understand how anyone could rank them 5 stars.<br /><br />I threw them out.<br /><br />Perhaps in the panoply of kosher, vegan, lactose-free white chips these rank well, but compared to actual white chocolate, they are inedible, even the cheap packages of Nestle's white chips at the grocery store are far better.
