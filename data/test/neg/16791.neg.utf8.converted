This is misleading and Amazon should attempt to correct this problem. This ad shows the packaging for the original Stride Peppermint Gum and the various reviewers state this is actually the NEW version.<br /><br />I was considering ordering this (old) stock as I have tried the new Stride 2.0 and was very disappointed.<br />Bottom line - I won't purchase Stride 2.0 as it has an unpleasant taste and (luckily), the flavor doesn't last.
