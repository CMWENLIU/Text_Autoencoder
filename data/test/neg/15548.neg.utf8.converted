Tried the 'blend' after having had their orig. recipe for quite a while. In my opinion it was a waste of time and money.<br />First off: all I could taste was the salt. Salty start, a whiff of cocoa, the slightest whisper of 'generic nut flavour', then more salt. Very unsatisfying.<br /><br />2nd: the texture. I don't know if adding the almonds to their 'blend' is responsible for this, but the gritty texture in this new recipe was awful. I've had poorly cleaned mussels and poorly shelled walnuts before: that's what this texture reminded me of. I kept getting these brief moments of alarm when one particularly gritty mouthful made me think I was about to bite into an even bigger piece of grit then end up with a cracked tooth.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting smooth and creamy like Nutella, but something that didn't remind me of unpleasant grit would have been nice.<br /><br />I understand that hazelnuts are more $$ than almonds, but having virtually no taste of hazelnuts at all made for a very sad and depressing sandwich.<br />If you only like the smell of almonds and don't care about texture, this might be for you. If you expecting anything else, look elsewhere.<br />Hopefully Justin's will change their recipe again, 'cause this one's a dud.
