These teething biscuits are supposed to be hard enough for baby to gnaw on and not have it break off into pieces. About a couple minutes after my son sucks on the biscuit, it softens, and he's able to break off very large pieces into his mouth. Luckily, I was right there watching and was able to retrieve the huge chunk out of his mouth. This is just not safe. I do not recommend these teething biscuits.
