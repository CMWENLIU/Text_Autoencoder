I also used the silver can version until discontinued last spring.  I contacted Hershey to see why they changed it and what was the difference.  They said they had improved it to give it a richer, more intense flavor.  I suggest they go back to the drawing board or better yet back to the silver can.<br /><br />I make one of the best devil's food cake around, rich chocolate, moist, etc. even after freezing.  (And the chocolate pies were just as enjoyable.)  Now it is dry, lacks any flavor (icing as well) and is a great dissapointment to all.<br /><br />It doesn't rate one star!
