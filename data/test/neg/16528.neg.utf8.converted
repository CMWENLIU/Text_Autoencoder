I travel a lot, often to places where nescafe (ugh) is high end. So my comfort was Via but the packaging is so irresponsible. So I experimented. I have now taken several multi-week trips with a plastic bag of  Bustelo Instant Espresso  measured out from a jar. I used it with just boiling water - or hot milk and water - its as good if not better than Via despite my snobby skepticism about preservation of taste. And I feel I am not adding as much  to a scary pile of non biodegradable waste. Starbucks says they care about environmental stuff but I'm not a crunchy and I can see how marketing has over-run ethic.
