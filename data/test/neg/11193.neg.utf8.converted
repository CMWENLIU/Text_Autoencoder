5 strands of a couple hundred feet worked through the rain, an ice storm, etc.  Really got it to protect chickens from neighborhood cayotes and dogs which broke through the strand and haven't seen it since.  BUT the fence will ELECTROCUTE, did zap some growing Rooster (even though I had explicitly told him to stay away), at least I can find them now though, instead of disappearing, but you probably want a lower amp fence, it's not everytime as I've seen them fly through it, and only been the last couple of days that they got fried. Fence has been up over a month.
