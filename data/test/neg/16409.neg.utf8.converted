I was very excited to find a cheaper cider. However, it is most likely worth the expense to get green mountain brand. Unfortunately I did not realize that the product was artifically sweetened. When it came I saw on the box that it was and tried it anyway. Luckily one of my roommates enjoyed it so was not a total lose.
