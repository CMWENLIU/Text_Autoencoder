They will send you 70% cocoa lindt chocolate but it has a "new recipe".  It's 30 calories more a serving, all sugar, and takes like crappy milk chocolate you'd get in a cheap easter bunny.  Has none of the cocoa bite that it used to.  This is kind of sad, since this chocolate used to be the best readily available dark chocolate on the market.<br /><br />If you're looking for a dark chocolate that's kind of low in carbs, this isn't it. Save yourself some money and buy a hersey bar.
