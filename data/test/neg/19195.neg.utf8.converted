I think Amazon is on the right track by offering groceries, but I think you need to stick to major brands and work a bit more on making your pricing competitive ( it was still quite a bit more than Safeway, not to mention Wal-Mart).I expect to pay a little for the convenience but not quite as much as I did. The rice crispies were a little "different" than I expected.I don't quite understand why you make us buy quantity when your packaging is not pre packaged? I expected to get four boxes somehow stuck together or banded together to ease your shipping costs and was quite surprised to get cereal one or two boxes of cereal to a shipping box.If that is how you are going to ship it wouldn't it be better to let us buy smaller quantities to increase your overall sales?
