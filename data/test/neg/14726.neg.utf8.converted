Package arrived in the mail a few days ago in what appeared to be good condition.  The bag was properly sealed and didn't appear to have any holes in it.<br /><br />I decided to try this out today, but upon scooping some of the rice out, I noticed quite a few bugs.  In fact, I've never seen any rice with so many bugs in it!  I'm not sure how common this is in this variety of rice, but I can say that I've never had a problem with Lotus Foods' products in the past.  Unfortunately, I have to give this product 1 star because of the extent of the contamination.  I'd caution any buyers to stay away from this variety of rice given my experience and the fact that it can't be returned.
