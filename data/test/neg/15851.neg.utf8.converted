Honestly, I should stop my automatic one-stop-easy-shop addiction shopping at Amazon.  This is just another example of purchasing at Amazon a product that, after the fact, I find in several other places for a much lower price.  In fact, Amazon's "sale" of 2 boxes for $[...], is more than the regular price at several other stores.  Additionally, the packages came with big stickers "Ready for shipment," on them which were not easy to peel off (makes for tacky looking gifts).  Search elsewhere.  You'll find you'll save money.<br /><br />These are tasty, however.  We've had them before and enjoyed them.
