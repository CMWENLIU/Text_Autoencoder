I found no benefit in taking the Kirkland Energy Shot where the 5 hour Energy has me going in a few of minutes.<br /><br />In my daily work day, I take half the bottle when I yawn for the first time after I get to work - about 2 hours after I arrive.  I take the remaining about 5 hours later.  The 5 Hour Energy keeps me going all day without any lags.  The Kirkland product did nothing.  I don't drink coffee.
