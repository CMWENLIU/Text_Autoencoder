This beer is going to be my second beer batch that I have made. When buying these kits, you assume that these will come with certain things. The first thing  I noticed was missing from this kit was detailed INSTRUCTION on how to make the beer. I contacted the seller and they told me to read the first two chapters of a brew book that were free online.<br /><br />I was really dissapointed that I was now going to have to find detailed instructions on the internet, with the exact ingredients for the beer I had.<br />Also there was no SUGAR, which in my opinion is FALSE ADVERTISING because you buy a kit based on the assumption that your going to get everything to make the beer....this is false and you do not. You have to buy the sugar extra. I just thought I would let future buyers in on this, since its not stated in its description.<br /><br />My first kit was from Monster Brew Home Brewing Supplies. I would recommend them, and I personally will use them from now on for all my future brewing activities.
