Be sure to note that the reason they can call this 'grain free' is because they use potato and pea starch instead. (Just read the ingredients.)<br /><br />I ordered some without realizing this--when you open the bag you will be knocked off your feet by the smell of instant mashed potatoes.<br /><br />If your goal is to get your cat off starches, this isn't the one.
