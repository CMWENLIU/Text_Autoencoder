I'm not sure I'm going to order any more of these 50 pack things. I always have two or three that are broken and spill coffee grounds everywhere.<br /><br />This entire box of Timothy's Rainforest Espresso tastes stale. I compared them directly with some store bought Green Mountain K-Cups of a similar variety. The Green Mountain coffee had a much fuller flavor. The Timothy's K-Cups have "best by" dates of December 8 of 2011.
