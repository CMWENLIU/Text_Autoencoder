Bought this because I read a review about Spry gum being made in China.  Wouldn't have bought this if I knew that this product was made in China also.  Its' hard to trust imported products that are consumables, when there has been so much written about contamination and imported products from China, and the fact that our government gave China MFN status for importing products to the U.S. as well.(And people wonder where the US jobs went ? and why the government is heavily indebt and corporations are not paying taxes on importing many products? ...?)
