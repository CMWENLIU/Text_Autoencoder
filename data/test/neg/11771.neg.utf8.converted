I'm not sure if the four I purchased were from a bad batch or what, but the product had no effect on me whatsoever. I have tried the blue lotus 50:1 tablets and was very satisfied. I thought a liquid blue lotus would be absorbed better by the body, thus a better effect. It was quite the opposite. You live and you learn I guess, but I wouldnt try this product again unless it was free.
