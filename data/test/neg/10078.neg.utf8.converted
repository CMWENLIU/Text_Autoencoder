I found this to be one of Timothy's least flavorful coffees.  As mentioned by other reviewers, the pumpkin flavor was slight.  I also found that it had a 'watered-down' coffee flavor...and I did make it in the 'small' cup option.<br /><br />German Chocolate Cake is my favorite so far and Winter Carnival is a close second.
