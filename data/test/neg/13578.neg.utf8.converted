Over the past month I've dumped what is supposed to be enough of this to cover 750 square feet on one ant hill, about 2 feet in diameter.  I can only assume that the "triple action" is this:<br /><br />1.  The ant colony thrives on the stuff.<br />2.  A population explosion ensues.  Social mores erode.  War breaks out and the majority of the ants die in battle.<br />3.  The few remaining ants decide life is no longer worth living and commit suicide.<br /><br />Seriously, I might as well be dumping bags of sugar on the ant hill as use this stuff.  It's worthless.
