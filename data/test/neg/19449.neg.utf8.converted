I received a shipment last night and opened it up.  I thought I was buying "Powdered Chicken Broth" and "Powdered Beef Broth", just like the names of these product claim to be.  Much to my dismay, I turned each bag over to discover that they are vegan AND contain HVP or HPP (MSG).  I wasn't looking for vegan and I certainly don't want MSG.  Too bad the "detail" pages for these products don't contain the ingredients or I never would have ordered them.  Glad I only got 1 of each to try out.  Apparently I should have gone to the vendors web site to check for ingredients first.  Aside from that, it took about 3 weeks for this to arrive.  I guess I'm just spoiled by quick service elsewhere.  I won't be ordering from these folks again.
