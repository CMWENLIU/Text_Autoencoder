I was glad that Podravka made a new, improved Vegeta without MSG. Unfortunately they substitute MSG with two other flavor exchangers, Disodium Inosinate and Disodium Guanylate, who are leading to the same harmful effect to our bodies through their by-products, just like MSG. So don't waste your money, search for other healthier alternatives.
