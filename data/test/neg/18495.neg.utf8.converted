I just found out through talking with a specialist moments ago that walnuts have a high number of bacteria/micro-organisms on them, the highest of all nuts.<br /><br />Your body system might be able to handle them.  Mine can't because of current health conditions.<br /><br />If you are interested, here's how to do a comparison check on the degree of little critter infestation on the surface of different nuts...<br /><br />Put the type of nut you want to test in its own cup and add maybe 6  oz of water.  Add some  cheap hydrogen peroxide purchasable at any large scale grocery store in the USA that is used for cleaner and let sit for a 5 minutes. (I used 2 tablespoons)  Bubbling occurs in the water as the micro-organisms are killed off. (Eating the nuts afterwards is not recommended because this hydrogen peroxide is not food grade so has additives to stabilize the hydrogen peroxide.)<br /><br />The test I'm doing as I type this review is compromised of organic walnuts and almonds, each in their respective cup.  The almond cup had a few sparse clouds of bubbles at the top.  The walnut cup has a 1/4" thick white carpet of bubbly foam at the top.<br /><br />Even cleaning the walnuts with food-grade HP isn't workable for me :(.  The good news is that Good Sense may start selling their organic almonds on Amazon.com.  YAY!  :)
