What a terrible product to order from Amazon.  I opened the green beans to find that about half the cans were dented and some of those terribly.  A can that is as dented as some of these cans are not trustworthy to eat because it is unsure if the can is damaged enough to allow a leak inside which would make the beans spoil.
