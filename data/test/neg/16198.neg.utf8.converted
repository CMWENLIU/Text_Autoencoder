I got this fence because I worried the one I got from my dad was to powerful around my pets and kids...I went through putting this one up and it worked for a little bit but the same day we put it up I bumped into it and no zap..so my husband check it out  and tightened some things and it worked he touched it and said it felt about like a 9volt battery as he was telling me he showed me again and he said it did not work..this went on for several minutes...also the poles are pretty flimsy pvc pipes not the ones it showed in the videos along with the product showing how to put it up...(which is why I picked this one)I gave it 2 stars because it looked a lot nicer than my previous fence that I now have to put back up after going to the store because I cut the wire in several places to put the new fence up.
