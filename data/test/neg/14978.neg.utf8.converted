I ordered this tea because it had decent reviews and was a good price. I am a huge fan of jasmine tea, particularly the pearls. I tried steeping the tea in a variety of ways, using varying amounts and brewing times. I found the tea to either be weak or have a bitter taste. I have owned a number of other low and high quality jasmine teas and they have performed better and had better flavor than this tea. I will not buy again.
