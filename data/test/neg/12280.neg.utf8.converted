Bob's flour is one of the first mixed GF flours that I tried.  The only problem is that everything I put it into, ended up tasting like beans or lentils.  I tried to thicken soups, tasted like beans...tried to make cake, tasted like beans.  I seriously thought I had some sort of taste bud problem.  I always cut the bag open and poured it into a container, so I couldn't check the ingredient label.  In desperation, I went to the supermarket and looked at the bag.  Sure enough, Bob mixes "GARBANZO BEAN FLOUR" into this mix.  So caution, if you like bean-tasting food, then this is the best flour for you!!  Instead, I'd highly recommend Gluten-Free Pantry's Beth's Flour mix.  It's amazing in both texture and taste, and works as a substitute for any recipe that calls for flour.
