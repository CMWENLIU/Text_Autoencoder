I received these as a Xmas gift. I was so anticipating these pistachios since I had tried "Wonderful" before and they were delicious.<br />The bag that I received appeared to be over-roasted and the nuts did not taste good at all. I notified the company but as of this date I have received no response.<br />These were a waste of money.
