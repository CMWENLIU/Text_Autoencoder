While I know it is good for my baby, I cannot stand the awful looks of disgust when my baby eats this formula. Organic is important to my family, but I decided to do a taste test of several different brands to try and find a non-fishy tasting formula. This brand has the most pungent flavor of fishiness, yuck! Similac is a bit better, and Enfamil also is better but still fishy. The only brand I found that doesn't taste fishy is Baby's Only Formula. I believe it is because it does not have the DHA, which I know is good for brain development, but my son gets this in his vitamin.
