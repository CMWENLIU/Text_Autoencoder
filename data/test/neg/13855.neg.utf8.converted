I have to say I'm incredibly disappointed with this seed kit.  First, neither cilantro pod even sprouted.  I went to the Aerogarden website and got replacement pods, but they don't offer a replacement for cilantro, so my garden is not likely to be very "South of the Border".  In addition, the only two pods that are really growing are the globe basil and epozate.  The thyme, parsley and oregano are a pathetic bunch of sprouts that are beginning to turn brown after four weeks.  I'm following the directions and just finished a successful garden, so it's not like I'm doing anything wrong.  These gardens are supposed to be idiot-proof, at any rate.  I would not bother purchasing this seed kit in the future.
