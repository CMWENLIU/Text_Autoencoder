I just wanted to say that if you want to get your dog a healthy snack alternative, this product would be a good one; if the vendor did not ship you old, outdated, dried out and hard crap.  Very disappointed.  Luckily, I found a store that is close to me that carries this item that is fresh.  I would NOT recommend this vendor to anyone.
