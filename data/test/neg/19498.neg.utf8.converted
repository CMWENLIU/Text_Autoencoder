I had previously bought various brands of certified organic and extra virgin coconut oil from the Philippines and was very pleased with them. I decided to try an Indian coconut oil. This seems to be the only brand that India makes. It's not organic or extra virgin but I wanted to try it anyways. It is tan in color not like organic coconut oil and it smells like used grease from a frying pan. It smells that way too. I will not purchase this again.
