The Aerogarden was going great until today when the pump stopped working.  I did some searching on the net and found others have the same problem.  The pump needs to be replaced, I wrote Amazon to see if they are going to replace or refund my money for the Aerogarden.  I am not very happy, especially when many other have the same problem with defective units.  Buyer beware, you may want to wait a year or two until they perfect this system.  Who want to watch their plants die because of a bad pump, then after they die you have to put in a new pump and start all over again.<br /><br />I don't think they even tested many of these units before they sold them to the public.  How could a problem like this happen to so many people if they did proper testing?  And if they did test them out good, they must not care about selling a quality product.<br /><br />My final thought is it works well at first, but does not last long.
