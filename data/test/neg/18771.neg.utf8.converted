BUYER BEWARE!  I have been enjoying this cereal for quite some time.  I was so disappointed when I received the "Now Tastes Even Better" boxes of this cereal.  I guess Kelloggs' idea of "better" is adding sugar and reducing the fiber.  Sugar is now listed as the 3rd most prominent ingredient.  REALLY???  Had I wanted more sugar I could just add that myself.  The description of the cereal I bought from Amazon reads:<br />  Product Features - 100 calories<br />  "4 boxes of 13.5 ounce Special K Protein Plus Cereal<br />  Protein-rich combination of tasty, low-carb wheat, soy, and rice flakes<br />  10 grams of protein with just 2 grams of sugar and 3 grams of fat in each serving<br />  Lightly sweetened and deliciously crunchy for a great breakfast or snack<br />  Good source of fiber for overall dietary wellbeing and sense of satisfaction"<br /><br />The new numbers are 120 calories, 7 grams of sugar, just 3 grams of fiber and at least the one positive of only 1 gram of fat, reduced from 3. It may taste better to some, but to me it was fine just the way it was.  I would have appreciated knowing about the change before I purchased this cereal again.
