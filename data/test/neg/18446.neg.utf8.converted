Unfortunately, this brand no longer cares about their quality and must be going for some type of volume game.  The taste is now terrible and overly sugary, no hint of honey and the corn is oddly shaped and cheaply made.  If they were going to have it made it Mexico, that's one thing, but they could have at least kept the recipe and quality standards the same.  Geeze.
