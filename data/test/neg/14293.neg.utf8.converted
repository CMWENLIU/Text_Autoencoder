I just bought 2 bags of the product. Tried and it was all PRO's until I noticed the big CON: one of the ingredients is corn syrup! I usually eat all organic food and love healthy stuff - I'm sooooo against corn syrup. I could've avoided the surprise, though, by reading the ingredient list that was disclosed in the product's page at amazon.com.<br />Well, as I said before, there are good things about the product, too. The chocolate bit is really creamy as they say, and deliciously bittersweet. It tastes so fresh and helped boosting my energy. Oh, and the delivery was really fast - I had it in two days!<br />Please, please, make them without corn syrup so that I can give it 5 stars :) !!
