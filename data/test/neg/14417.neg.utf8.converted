I placed an order with Amazon for these berries, when the package came the berries were Rotten. They were soft, sprouting and had some mold. I called Amazon who immediately sent out a new package. However, that package was also moldy and sprouting. Amazon was great about giving me a refund without any questions - but it still leaves me without any berries.
