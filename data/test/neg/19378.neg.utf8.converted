I have ordered Flossies several times.  First few times they were great and well worth the money.  Lasted a long time.  I have an 11 pound Bichon who loves to chew. I order 20 at a time.  This last time, they were much different.  Very skinny and seemed to be stretched much more.  My dog finished it in about an hour. Usually she works on her flossie for days.<br /><br />Amazon Communication Center wrote: We do not sort flossies and because they are natural one box can be<br />thiner then another. we sell over 100 box a week, so it is quite possible.<br />I am very sorry you got a bad batch.<br /><br />I have ordered them from another source and hopefully, if I get a bad batch, they will stand behind their product.  It seems impossible that all 20 could be so thin.  They come loose and not pre-packaged.<br /><br />Good luck to anyone who orders Flossies from Amazon.
