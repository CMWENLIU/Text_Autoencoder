I was so exicted about this product when I found it on line and bought it with my new Coffee maker, then over the next weekend saw the EXACT same product in Bed, Bath and Beyond for $20 cheaper.  And when mine came in it was missing the Hot Chocolate.  I have never been disappointed in AMAZON before, but I really will look at my purchases MUCH more in the future.
