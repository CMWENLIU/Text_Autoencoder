The reviewer Jo Ana Starr is right, this canned "lobster bisque" is plain gross.  I am a lifelong New Englander and I've been enjoying lobster bisque for 30 years...this stuff is NOT lobster bisque. It's an odd-colored concoction of canola oil, milk, and "native tapioca starch." I paid $3.89 for a (tiny) 10-oz can, and I'm very disappointed. There is so much canola oil in it, you can feel it on your tongue.  No lobster flavor at all.  It's a travesty that they're using the name "Bar Harbor."
