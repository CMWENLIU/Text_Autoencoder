Ordered these on 6/9/09 and received them today, 6/12/09. They are so stale they actually BOUNCE on the kitchen counter and I can bend them almost in half. The 'use by' date on the package is a year from now, May 2010. By then, they'll be compost! Steer clear of these. Horrid product. I can't be bothered wasting my time and money returning them, so I'm pulverizing them with the rolling pin and giving them to the dogs with their supper! :(<br /><br />Updated 6/21/09-Amazon's Customer Service acknowledged my e-mail complaint promptly and just as quickly credited my account. Hats off to Amazon for great customer service. (I never did give these to my dogs...)
