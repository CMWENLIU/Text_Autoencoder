I would never buy this water! I'm not even thirsty! Why would I buy some water when I'm not even thirsty like some kind of idiot? For decoration? To pour out onto my shirt which is currently on fire? Yeah right! I'll probably be completely burned to death by the time it gets here, even with the free 2-day shipping!
