Now that the new "improved" bar is made in NH, USA they seem to think that it has to have soy lecithan and be made for the so called "American taste" as in sweeter and smoother. They really ruined a good thing. When the new version appeared at the local store I bought some and did not tell my family that it was a different ingredient list. The comments went like this: "This isn't the same" "This tastes like a cheap chocolate bar" "Do you have any Lindt 70% chocolate?" and so it went. When my current stash of the old style is gone I will be looking for a new favorite bar. I still find the old style once in a while, but I am afraid that it will be gone for good unless it can be ordered from a European supplier.
