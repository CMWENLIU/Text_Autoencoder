My 2 year old loves this milk, drinking at least 1 per day for the past 2-3 weeks.  He began having digestive issues and complaining of belly aches, so I googled the ingredient listed as carrageenan.  It's a "natural" thickening agent used in soy milk and other organic products that causes many people to experience the same symptoms my son has experienced.  In fact, many people who drink certain brands of soy milk containing carrageenan mistakenly attribute their digestive problems to the soy, when it's actually the carrageenan.<br /><br />IS CARRAGEENAN REALLY NATURAL?<br /><br />Carrageenan is about as wholesome as monosodium<br />glutamate (MSG), which is extracted from rice, and can<br />equally be considered natural. Aspartame (NutraPoison)<br />is also natural, as it is extracted from decayed plant<br />matter that has been underground for millions of years<br />(oil). So too are many other substances such as<br />carrageenan that can also be classified by FDA and<br />USDA as wholesome and natural food additives.<br /><br />Just because something comes from a natural source<br />does not mean that it is safe.<br /><br />Organic?  What a joke. Horizon and the conglomerate that owns this factory farm should be ashamed of themselves.
