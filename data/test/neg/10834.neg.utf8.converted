I was sent CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce, thru the Vine Voice Program.  Unfortunately, the bottle was sent in bubble wrap and a manila envelope.  It leaked...all over!  This is when I first learned that the bottle shape is not good for soapy hands!  It kept slipping out of my grip as I tried to clean it off!<br /><br />This product claims it is "for all hair types and is clinically proven to help restore scalps natural moisture balance."  It also advertises that it is "Formulated with Nutrium10, an advanced moisture complex of vitamins and nutrients including vitamins B5, C and E, sunflower, almond, soybean and coconut oils and aloe vera."  This all sounds great!  However, when I used it - only once - I had what I can only explain as an allergic reaction on my scalp!  My scalp became so sensitive - felt almost like it was sunburnt is the only way I know to describe it.<br /><br />The ingredients are:  Water (Aqua), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Fragrance (Parfum), Dimethiconol, Sodium Chloride, Carbomer, Dimethicone, Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Zinc Pyrithione, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, DMDM Hydantoin, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Stearic Acid, Citric Acid, Tallow Acid or Palmitic Acid, Zinc Sulfate, Glycerin, TEA-Dodecylbenzenesulfonate, Sodium Isethionate, Poloxamer 407, Laureth-23, Laureth-4, Tocopheryl Acetate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, PPG-9, PEG-9M, Panthenol, Lysine HCl, Hydrogenated Coconut Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Xanthan Gum, Methylisothiazolinone, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Niacinamide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Mica (CI 77019), Bismuth Oxychloride (CI 77163), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Red 33 (CI 17200).<br /><br />While it only took very little to make quite a lot of suds...I don't plan to use it again, as this is the only good thing I can say about it!<br />I do not recommend it for anyone with sensitive scalp (tho I didn't realize I was one of those people until using this product.)<br /><br />-1smileycat :-)
