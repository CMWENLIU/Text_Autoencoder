After reading the other reviews, I was so anxious to try this popcorn.  I've been trying every popcorn available on Amazon.  The Amish brand (non-Wabash Valley) are good, but small.  The Fireworks Orchard blossom is also very good, but also somewhat small.  Therefore, to see a "large" popcorn advertised was exciting.<br />  However, the popcorn didn't pop any bigger than cheap store-bought popcorn, but had ten times as many hulls!  The broken hulls are large, hard and curled.  Few kernals didn't have open hulls still attached, and trying to break off the hull destroyed the fluffy part.  There were more hull pieces than popped kernals.  The few white/yellow parts are also sort of rubbery/chewy and have no flavor.<br />  Terribly expensive.  It would be worth it if the popcorn were half-way decent, but it isn't.  If you don't pick out the hulls, your mouth is full of them and they are stuck between your teeth and caught in your throat.<br />I always pop in a frying pan on the stove top for best results.  This was popped the same way as all the other brands.  I will try it one more time, hoping for different results and will update this if the next batch is better.
