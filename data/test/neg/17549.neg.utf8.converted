Each packet of this soup is NOT single serving size!<br /><br />...and the packaging does very little to correct that misperception: the soup is shown in a coffee mug-sized scenario. You're supposed to add 4 cups of water to each packet; which is more soup than anyone is looking for at lunchtime. Even when you add all that water to the mix, I hope you're on a starvation diet, because the serving size on the box is 2 tablespoons!!!! TWO TABLESPOONS! What are you supposed to do with 4 cups of chicken soup (with a stray micro-noodle floating by now and then) when your alloted portion is two tablespoons? You're supposed to forget that consuming a reasonable amount of soup fills you with 100 percent (if not more) of your daily sodium intake.<br /><br />This is an absurd product.
