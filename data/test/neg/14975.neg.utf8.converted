The product shipped me was so old the chocolate had turned white and was dry, cracked and tasted toooo nasty - returned items to shipper but have not received a refund.  First time I've been unhappy with a purchase from Amazon.  Ordered all three candy pkgs shown on Amazon - was unhappy with all of them as they were definitely rejected product but at least the other two with the Reese's products and Hershey bars were fresh - just misshapen or broken but taste was good. Will never order candy again from any of these folks.
