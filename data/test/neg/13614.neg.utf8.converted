I purchased this product because I REALLY liked the Nesquick "Very Vanilla". And of course they stopped making it; like they do everything else that I like. It came in a plastic, obling container. This one comes in a round canister. I figured that they would be very close to the same, if not exactly. They are the same brand after all. But I was wrong. This one isn't anything like the other. It is bright yellow to start with. Drinking neon yellow milk is not too appetizing. The taste was completely different. too. I'm not sure how to explain the taste of this one. Except yuck. Ya it is vanilla, tho. But there is some  kind of weird after taste. If you are going to be purchasing this for a child, especially if it is to try to get them to drink their milk, I  would reccomend it. A child wouldn't be bothered by the yellow color. They might even think it's cool. But if you are like me and are trying to replace the "very vanilla" that Nesquik recently discontinued. DON'T. I wish I hadn't. I even purchased an entire case! Big mistake. Oh Ya. One more thing. The writing on the can is mostly Spanish. There is some English but it is not the main language. It is like under the Spanish-just incase we need it. You know how they do with the merchandise here (in the USA); they have a small Spanish translation under the English word. It is the same on this, but reversed. Spanish is the main language. The directions are even in Spanish.<br /><br />I hope this review helps you:)
