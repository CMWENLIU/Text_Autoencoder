I was skeptical about this item.  Seems like my intuition was right.  It did arrive fully frozen and packaged well.  However, you cannot eat this stuff without a chisel to get it out of the carton.  The flavor is is just so-so.  But, the biggest drawback is that it is the consistancy of ice cream that has thawed and been refrozen.  I won't be buying this again!
