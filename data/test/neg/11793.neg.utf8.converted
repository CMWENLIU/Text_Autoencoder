I also just don't get all of these good reviews, I have no idea what they were drinking.  I found the Kirkland tea to be the most flavorless green tea I've had.  It's a terrible tea.  I'm not even sure if it is green tea, it almost tastes like steeped grass.  It is also very weak.  I have to use 3 tea bags to get a decent cup.  I think the other reviewers just see the nylon bag and think, wow, this must be good tea.<br /><br />One other gripe, they make the strings to short on the bags.  They aren't long enough for the tab to hang over the edge of a normal sized coffee cup.  I have to cut the strings off unless I want paper floating in my tea.<br /><br />I would recommend the Stash premium green tea.  It has fantastic flavor and is about the same price as the crappy Kirkland tea.
