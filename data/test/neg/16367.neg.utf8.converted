I didn't really enjoy this product at all. I like the idea, but the actual product wasn't very good. The cookie crumbles all over the place making a big mess. The blueberries are hard little rocks with a strange texture that isn't very appetizing. The flavor of the cookie itself was alright, a definite brown sugar taste. The serving size is small, and not very satisfying for the calorie count. Overall I would try a different snack product over this one.
