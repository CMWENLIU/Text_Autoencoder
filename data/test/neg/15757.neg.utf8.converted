This review is about the 8-pack Nonni's biscotti.  These biscotti taste quite good, but are pricey.  I thought the price was acceptable, however, because I could see there was room for at least 10 biscotti of the size shown in the front window of the box.  I was very disappointed, therefore, to find that 1/5 of the package width is taken up with empty plastic, and there were actually only 8 biscotti.  I wrote to Nonni's to complain and was told they were re-designing their packaging.  The new packaging is even worse: now, on the back side of the package, you can see parts of 2 biscotti, and it looks like there is room for 12 or even 14 biscotti of that size in the package, but again, a significant fraction of the box is empty filler.  The count is not listed on the front of the package; you have to read the fine print of the nutrition information label to find that a serving is 1 biscotti and there are only 8 servings in the package.  On the Nonni's website, the nutrition information label associated with the 8-count box has a blank "Servings Per Container".
