I received this 4 pack of graham crackers on June 26th.  It expires Sept. 12th.  It is ridiculous and inappropriate to send bulk food items with such a short expiration date.  I am living overseas, and returning this will involve significant time and money on my part, almost not worth the effort.  Not a happy customer, and will not be ordering from this vendor again.
