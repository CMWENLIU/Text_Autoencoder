Recently I decided to switch my French Bulldog to Royal Canin Bulldog 24 after he developed food allergies. Royal Canin came highly recommended from our vet and being "specially formulated for a Bulldog's needs" I thought this food would be a good fit. The label on the bag tauts features like "highly digestible proteins and starches" that reduce a Bulldog's rather active digestive system. In my experience it doesn't.<br /><br />I was skeptical too of the ingredients list which lists the first ingredients as: Chicken meal, rice, brown rice, oatmeal, soy protein isolate, rice flour, chicken fat, and natural chicken flavor. For an "ultra-premium" brand this is not an impressive list of ingredients. Similarly priced dog foods like Canidae, Solid Gold, Wellness, Innova, and Orijen feature ingredients like chicken off the bone and other high quality sources of protein as the main ingredients.<br /><br />After about 3 weeks of struggling with my pup's very loose stool, gas and all around lethargy I decided enough was enough and stopped feeding my dog Royal Canin. In the meantime I decided to educate myself on dog food, the ingredients and the manufacturing processes. I think that although many of the premium dog food brands on the market now are certainly better than run-of-the-mill grocery brand dog foods, there is still a lot to be desired.<br /><br />I think that the bottom line when it comes to Royal Canin (and many other dog food brands) is that many of the large corporations who produce these dog foods do not have you or your dogs best interests at heart. Royal Canin is now fully owned by the Mars/Masterfood Group - a massive conglomerate that makes everything from candy bars to dog food.<br /><br />In short I think that whatever was once Royal Canin - is now something different altogether. That something being a company more mindful of it's bottom line and marketing practices than the ingredients in their product.<br /><br />I really recommend anyone interested in Royal Canin to do a bit more research and compare to the other brands I mentioned above. In most cases you can get a better food for the same price.<br /><br />Most definitely not recommended.
