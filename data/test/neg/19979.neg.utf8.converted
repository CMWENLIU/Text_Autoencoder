I read the other reviews who mentioned that these have a very definite and somewhat unexpected taste. Most claim to love them or are able to acquire a taste for these Nibs after several tries.<br /><br />SORRY I could have tried, sampled and endeavored my way through the whole bag but would probably still be spitting and washing my mouth out.<br /><br />I'm not a finicky eater and like to try new things. I also enjoy raw or whole foods.<br />THESE CROSSED THE LINE and were pricey to boot.<br />IF you can't get a sample size locally or on-line I would avoid.<br /><br />Otherwise like me - you may have a high dollar bag of organic "goodies" even the dog won't eat.<br />If you don't LIVE in the organic health food store you may very well share my experience.<br />KUDOS TO ALL WHO ENJOY THEM... Cavet Emptor. Or let the taster beware but I don't know the latin for it.<br /><br />I'm gonna go gargle again - Definitely a LOVE or HATE item.
