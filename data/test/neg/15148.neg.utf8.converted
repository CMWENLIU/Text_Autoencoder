This coconut water isn't very tasty.  It says tropical fruit but it only tastes like guava.  There's no taste of any of the other fruit. This was my first time trying coconut water.  I know people who rave about it and I thought I could do several things with tropical fruit, but it's pretty much been a waste of money.  Only buy if you reeeally like the taste of guava.
