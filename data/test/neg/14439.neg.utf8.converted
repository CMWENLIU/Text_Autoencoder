Based on the other reviews I purchased this product. I have been using stevia for over 15 years, so I know the ins and outs of using it pretty well, and I love it.<br />I currently mix droche cocoa powder with stevia powder for a hot chocolate drink and it definitely has a super dark chocolate flavor which i like.<br />So when I saw this product I thought I'd try it...what a complete disappointment. It tasted horrible. It's taste reminded me of what fresh potting soil smells like, and it left gritt in my mouth...so unless i happened to get a bad batch of this and they cut it with soil, don't buy this. Hopefully, me wasting my money saves you from wasting yours. Make your own with cocoa powder.<br />Also this is what the usage directions on the lable read exactly...  "Suggested Use: Blend 2 1 sp in Oz liquid".  Did ya get that?<br />I went by serving size which was 2 tsp.<br /><br />I did order the strawberry and orange mixes also, but haven't received them yet.<br />Hopefully these are better.
