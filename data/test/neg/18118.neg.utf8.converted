Where do I start?  This soup is HORRIFIC!  I bought 4 pouches to send to my father for Christmas, but decided I had better sample 1 pouch prior to shipping to him (since I had never tried this product before).  I love all of the ingredients it says is in this soup, so had high expectations of the flavor, consistency, etc.  However, to say I was disappointed is an under-statement!!!  The soup contained maybe 10 pieces of yucky-tasting potatoes (I hope that's what they were..hard to tell), and only a few shards of salmon, if that.  The entire mixture had a "fishy" taste to it..not fresh, and not much like "salmon".  It was watery, flavorless (except for the harsh "fishy" taste, already mentioned) and very difficult to eat.  I had to throw out the entire pot.
