I purchased these beans expecting a product similar to the fantastic heirloom beans I'd sampled from Rancho Gordo in Napa, CA. Unfortunately, this was not the case. These beans took four hours to cook, and this was after I'd soaked them overnight! Even after four hours of cooking, some of the beans were semi-hard. The beans were not fresh at all, and the fact that they were old beans made for a less than satisfying end-product. The price was great, but the beans were not.
