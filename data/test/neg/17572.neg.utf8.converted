I ordered this as a gift for someone.  5 of the teas smelled OK, but one of them smelled rancid, like oils gone bad.  Adagio does not provide a telephone number for customer service.  Everything is by e-mail so I wrote.  They did not respond so I wrote AGAIN.  I finally did get a response which was: nobody else has complained.  I don't feel this is a decent answer.  They should have opened up the bin of tea in question and taken a whiff for themselves.  I feel that would have been a more appropriate response.
