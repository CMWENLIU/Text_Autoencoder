I tried this at Costco and just loved it...until I read the ingredients.  Contains yellow #5 and #6.  Now why would Quaker destroy such a good idea by adding horrible food coloring?  Also contains maltodextrin, a product of corn.  I'm so mad because I love Quaker oatmeal.  Why can't they leave out the horrible coloring? :(
