I must say I really dislike the new recipe.  I liked the old "low carb" version and had been enjoying it for years, but somewhere along the way Kellogg's decided that people really just wanted high protein and high carb. No doubt the new formula will appeal to some, but for me, it no longer is that different than a range of other cereals out there.  Unfortunately the old one was pretty unique and I have not found a suitable alternative.
