The quality of the cherries from this company used to be very high, but they appear to be using cherries from another location now.  The cherries used to be plump and sweet.  Now they are dried out and almost tasteless. Think twice about this purchase if you have purchased cherries from this company in the past.  They are not the same cherries that you know and love...
