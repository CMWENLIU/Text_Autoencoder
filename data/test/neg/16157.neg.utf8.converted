Like another viewer, my cans arrived dented, some bulging , in a box from Centos that was placed in an Amazon box for shipping.  I had to throw out over half my order.  I won't be ordering products like this again from Amazon, nor will I use Cento products in the future.  It seems Centos is pawning off their damaged cans to Amazon.
