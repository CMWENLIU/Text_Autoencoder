I prefer raspberry jam but bought the strawberry because it was less expensive.  Since Smuckers makes great raspberry jam, I thought their strawberry jam would be high quality too.  Wrong.  It is overly sweet and sticky.  No strawberry chunks.  It seems like a very cheap product.  I would never buy this again.  Since purchasing this jam, I have read reviews on what to look for in a good jam.  Good quality jam is sweetened with sugar, not corn syrup.  Corn syrup is much cheaper than sugar and tends to make jam too sweet and sticky.  I guess you get what you pay for.
