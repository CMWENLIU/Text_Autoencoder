My husband loves this gum and I'd like to order it but for some unknown reason, Amazon thinks it is a grocery item that cannot be shipped to Alaska, the 49th state of the US.  What could possibly be considered too fragile about gum to send?  I don't think it can get bruised or frozen.  Matter of fact it is warmer here than 40% of the US right now.  I'm not happy.
