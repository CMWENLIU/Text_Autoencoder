The Milk-Bone product is great.  My dog has been getting them for a treat for almost ten years now.  I used to by them a CostCo. Same box.  But early this year they stopped carrying them.  I did buy a box from this source in desperation in May.  The price was outrageous then.  Now even more so.  For $21 you can go to your local PetSmart and get two 10lb boxes.  That's 20 lbs of biscuits for less than 14lbs here or another 6 lbs for less than free!  Don't buy this here.
