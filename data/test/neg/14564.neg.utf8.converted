I have been shopping for Nabisco Premium Saltines and have found them on the shelves but are not the original as the box claims every box that I find proclaims them to be original but stamped on the box it indicates that they are with sea salt (not original). I would like to know if they are still made with salt containing iodine which is a required ingredient for a healthy diet. Dietations have indicated that the American (United States of America) diet is iodine deficient, therefore, the crackers with sea salt is less healthy for us.  Where can I find them with Iodized salt if they are still made. If they are no longer available shame on you for producing a less healthy food product.
