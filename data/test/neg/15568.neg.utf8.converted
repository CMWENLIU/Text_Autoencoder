We've been drinking Monsooned Malabar coffee from Coffee Bean Direct for about four years, first ordering 5 pounds monthly from the roaster and about a year ago switching the order to Amazon's subscription service. We've been disappointed with the decreasing quality of flavor and freshness of the coffee, not knowing whether it might be due to a greater delay from roasting to delivery or the manner in which Amazon stores it.<br /><br />To check our perceptions, we again ordered directly from the roaster, Coffee Bean Direct, and found its coffee to have the flavor of Monsooned Malabar we originally enjoyed. But it comes at a cost. With the higher price of the coffee itself plus shipping charges, we paid significantly more ($46.25 compared to $33.81 for the Amazon subscription).<br /><br />We're disappointed with the product we've gotten through Amazon lately, puzzled by the decline in quality, and debating how to proceed.
