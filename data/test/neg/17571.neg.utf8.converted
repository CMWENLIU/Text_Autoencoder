The picture supplied shows a label with "1 pound" printed on it. Under details, the weight is listed as 8 ounces. My order showed "1 pound" as did the order details for feedback. So...3 of 4 details say I should receive a pound. I was a little put off getting half as much. The powder is remarkably void of carob or any flavor. Even adding several heaping spoonfuls didn't provide the flavor of carob expected, let alone intensity of flavor. It was also permanently clumpy. Putting it in hot or cold water, hot or warm coffee, hot or cold milk, nothing changed that it clumps up around the sides or bottom of the glass. Stirring for 5 minutes, letting it stand, stirring more, still Clumpsville.<br />  I want to say something nice about the product, but there isn't much. I ordered 3 other items from Barry Farms, one of them being carob chips. THOSE had the flavor I was expecting, (and came in the one pound size advertised), and all items were packed well and shipped quickly. It's this product that needs work.<br />  If you want half an order of bland, clumpy powder, order this. Otherwise, pass on it, and get their carob chips (sweetened) if you want carob flavor.
