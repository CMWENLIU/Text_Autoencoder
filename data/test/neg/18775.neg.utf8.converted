The previous incarnation of this "protein" cereal was acceptable ( nutty tasting, good with fruit) and relatively low in carbs for junk food.  It has been my mainstay for breakfast for years.  I used to travel with it in the days when it was hard to find because I wanted to stay on track with eating while traveling.  I was not the only one to do this: I recall that a business passenger who was on the airliner that landed in the Hudson river a few years ago voiced his distress on air to a reporter that a box of this hard to find cereal was certainly lost along with his luggage.<br /><br />Now I just bought four boxes of the new "Plus" version and I am trying to give it away:  sweet, bland, overly dosed with chemical flavors. It has gone from 9 to 19 gr carbohydrate with sugar as its third ingredient.  I am irritated at being forced to change, but on the positive side it has prompted me to do the sensible thing and jettison commercial breakfast stuff entirely.
