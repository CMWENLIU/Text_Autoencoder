When the product is good it is great. But I warn you in advance that they do not check the quality on the beans very well. I have received edamame that tastes sweet in one box, bitter in another, and even the color of the bag ranges from yellow to orange. The inconsistency shows a lack of attention to detail and quality control which certainly makes me nervous about continuing to purchase from SeaPoint. This item can't be returned so be very weary... Although I love it when its good, I have to say I hate it because of the high price and low quality control. I would like a refund for the 24 bags of sweet and bitter beans that I can't eat.
