To call a seed a plant is like calling an egg a chicken.  This is an overpriced single seed in a drink can. I hope it grows, but based on the reviews (...which I wish I had read before purchasing) the chance of this "plant" producing peppers is not so hot. (pun intended). Now I wish I had the drink in the can instead.  That would have been more useful.
