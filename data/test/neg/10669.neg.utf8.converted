I just received this today and I am greatly disappointed.<br />Here is why (Cons)<br />  *Not glass - I know it says ceramic grinder, and yes, the actual grinding part is ceramic. The clear part is plastic.  I thought it was glass, and ordered because I am trying to get rid of plastics due to a hormone imbalance.<br />  *Small - It looked larger in the photo than it really is.  The grinder is less than 6.5" from the very bottom of the grinder to the top of the knurl.<br />  *Crooked - The top sits crooked on the grinder.<br />  *Expensive - If the grinder were glass and larger, this would be a good value.  With it being plastic and small, it is greatly overpriced.<br />My suggestion is - Buy a glass grinder and order a bulk coarse Himalayan Sea Salt to grind in it.<br />  *Not enough of the Himalayan Salt to make it worth the price.<br />(Pros)<br />  *Excellent salt, that is why I suggest buying the Himalayan Sea Salt in bulk and purchasing a better grinder.<br /><br />I made this review to help others who are trying to rid their environment of plastics and heal their system from hormone imbalances.
