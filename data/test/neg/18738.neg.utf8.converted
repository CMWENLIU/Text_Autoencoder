This is probably one of the most incompetent companies that I have ever ordered from. Not only did the first two orders not arrive (one somehow got lost in the mail, and the other was damaged during shipping, which they never notified me about; I found out by calling Amazon several weeks later), but for the third order, they sent me Earl Grey tea, instead of Rooibos tea. I didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it, so I kept it, but the people who process these orders seriously need to get their act together.
