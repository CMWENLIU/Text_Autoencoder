I bought these dates based on the ratings. Initially, I was very pleased with the product, however, since I use them in my VitaMix, I decided to remove the pits ahead of time. Well, it's a good thing that I did because the second package of four that I opened had 4-5 dates that were literally black inside and had the odor of mold. Just be careful if you decide to order them. I threw mine out because I didn't want to take a chance.
