I'm starting to doubt the legitimacy of reviews for Bigelow teas.  This is the fourth (and last) tea from this company I'll ever purchase, no matter how enticing it is.  Like the other flavors I tried, I really gave it a fair shake, brewing up several cups and sharing with friends.  We came up with the same, insipid black tea with a bizarre chemical-like smell to it each any every time.  None of us could detect anything remotely similar to white chocolate, or much of anything save for a hint of cinnamon.  Might be best to try one box first.
