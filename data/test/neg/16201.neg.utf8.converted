I purchased this for my dog who likes to jump over our deck railing.<br />I immediately returned it after reading in the instructions that the dog must be in contact with the wire and the ground at the same time to get the shock. Unfortunately, since I was buying this because of jumping, the dog would only be in contact with the wire. Amazon was great to deal with and took back the return w/o any problems.
