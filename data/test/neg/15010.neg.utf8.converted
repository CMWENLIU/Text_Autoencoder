I had high hopes for this coconut oil.  What is not to love? Organic, Extra Virgin, decent price, subscribe and save, glass container???? but there in lies the problem, I was hoping from the image in the listing that this coconut oil was packaged in glass, but alas it arrived in a black plastic container, with the safety seal damaged nonetheless, so I had to send it back.  Oh well, I hope it is BPA free at least, but I couldn't see that indicated anywhere?  So, if you are looking at this listing hoping to get coconut oil in a glass container, look elsewhere.
