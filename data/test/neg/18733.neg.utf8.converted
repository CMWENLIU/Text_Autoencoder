Tea tree oil is toxic to cats in all but the very smallest doses. A cat's liver is not capable of processing it. For an average cat weighing seven to 12 pounds, somewhere between 1 1/2 to 3 teaspoons of tea tree oil would be lethal. Because of this cats should never be treated with anything more than one to five drops of tea tree oil per teaspoon of carrier oil. The same thing applies to small, and some medium-sized dogs.<br /><br />Another reason to avoid using tea tree oil on small animals is that they tend to lick themselves and end up ingesting the oil.<br /><br />Most of the cat deaths from tea tree oil come from people using tea tree flea & tick treatments which are applied to the entire body of the cat. This product is applied only in the ear. Nonetheless, given the extreme toxicity of tea tree oil to cats, I would be very cautious. Is the ear wash so essential that it is worth risking your cat's life? Perhaps try another product first.
