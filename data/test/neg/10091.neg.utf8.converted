I was optimistic about the flavor, based on the yummy soy sauce and sesame aroma coming from the finished product. But the taste... oh man, the taste. It tasted like pure vinegar. The sauce was SO SOUR. The acidity overpowered any soy or sesame flavor by a long shot. The only thing I can think is that in order to compensate for the dish being lower sodium than most noodle bowl type things, they tried to ramp up the flavor with acidic ingredients. A touch of acidity does help bring out the flavor when you reduce the salt, but this was WAY too much.
