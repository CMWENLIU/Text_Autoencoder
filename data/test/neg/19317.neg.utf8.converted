I've been looking for an affordable source of sulfite-free lemon juice since Costco stopped carrying "Italian Volcano" brand locally.<br /><br />This looked like a possible alternative; the amazon price wasn't bad, and it was called "natural".  The ad above does NOT list the ingredients.  And I went to the Sadaf website which ALSO does not list the ingredients. So I wrote their website and asked nicely if it contained sulfites, and after a week I got back a terse reply that said "read the label".  They HAVE a label on their website, but it doesn't have ingredients on it.<br /><br />So I had to dig into googling for research, and I finally found a complaint against their firm (you can find it too, just google "Sadaf Lemon Sulfites") which accused them of falsely using the word "natural" despite the fact that their juice contains sulfites.<br /><br />So despite their being - seemingly - intentionally obscure about this, this product is full of sulfites, and should be avoided by those who are sulfite sensitive.<br /><br />The "Sadaf" people don't make it easy to find this out, and refused to answer me honestly.  My recommendation is to give this product a pass.
