I am horrified that this picture would appear on a site with Easter toys.  I am glad my nephew is young enough to still think the easter bunny still comes to deliver the treats, not to be served for dinner!  This is definitely inappropriate, and I will cancel my order with Amazon, and will not order another thing until this is rectified. Selling groceries is one thing, but on a TOY site, come on!
