I have tried different sugar substitutes.  This one is terrible.  If anyone had given me a clue as to how bad this is I would not have purchased it.  I can only use Xylitol or Stevia as a sweetner.  Now that I have tried both I can only say DO NOT BUY this product if you want to sweeten anything.  It just does not work.  I  cannot give this away.  No one wants it.  Sorry but a review should be honest.
