Wish I'd known before I bought this. "Hydrogenated" means partially hydrogenated means "huge trans fats" but atleast now I've learned something. I had assumed it meant "fully hydrogenated" which is an entirely different thing. Never eaten anything with huge amounts of trans fats and now I know what that's like... I won't say what happened but I won't be touching this stuff again. Worse than paying more for something else at the grocery store. Too bad I ordered another order before I figured out why I was getting so sick. I will cancel my subscription.
