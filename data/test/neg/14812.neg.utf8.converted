This product was sent in 105+ degree weather without being packed with any type of coolant to keep it from melting.  All 12 boxes were melted and the outside package was even greasy from the melted candy.  Not one piece escaped from melting.  I was so disappointed.  I can not believe it was mailed this way.  What a waste of my money.  I will not be ordering through you again unless you would want to make it good.  I will send the product back to you in the same shape I received it if you would like a box of melted mess.
