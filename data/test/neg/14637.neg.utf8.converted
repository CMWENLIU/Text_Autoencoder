This product was a true disappointment.  When I opened the box, there was a slight odor to it.  Amazon would not let me get a refund back, and instead sent a new box of rice crumbs.  The new box of 8 packages expires in April 2011!.<br /><br />Not sure I will buy food again through Amazon unless it is returnable.  Very, very dissatisfied.
