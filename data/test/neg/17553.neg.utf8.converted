This drink is awful. It reminds me of a cocktail (perhaps a plain margarita) that one has left on the table from a party the night before, where the drink is diluted from the melted ice and the alcohol evaporated away. The drink has a very slight lime flavor and a tinge of sweetness (but less sweet than other crystal light drinks when made according to instructions). It is reminiscent of a plain margarita, so if that is what you seek, you may find it here. But I don't like it, and I ordinarily LOVE Crystal Light. I suggest Sunrise Orange or Iced Tea by Crystal Light, more authentic flavor. Also, the Mojito flavor "mocktail" is not bad, assuming you like subtle mint flavors.
