I wish I could say that I loved this.  I really do.  However, all I can taste is PLASTIC.  I have no idea if the coconut water is decent or not because the taste of plastic container is SO overwhelming.<br /><br />It honestly tastes like a bottle of average water that has been left in your vehicle in the 100-degree heat for four days.
