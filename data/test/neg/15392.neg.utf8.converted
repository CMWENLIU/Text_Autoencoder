I have been a huge fan of this brand of cereal enjoying it for over 3 years.  However, just recently, the taste has changed dramatically.  It tastes like wood now and sometimes, I can taste some pesticide.  I called Amazon to return all 12 boxes, and they immediately replaced them without any hassle.  However, once I got the new boxes and opened them, it tasted the same, quite awful.  I called Food For Life and let them know about the taste change and a lady said that she would bring it to the manufacturers attention.  I also have a twin brother in California who also said the taste has changed.  Then, I went to Whole Food Market to see if the same problem was occuring with the cereal in the store.  And sure enough, it tastes awful.<br /><br />I hope they change the taste back to how it was.  Unfortunately, due to the change in the taste, I will not be buying this cereal anymore and warn all other buyers to stay away from the GoldenFlax due to its sour and bitter and woodlike taste.  I am on the search for a new cereal.  Also, I noticed the packaging insert is different.  Usually, it is a frosted plastic bag that has the cereal in it.  Now, it is a clear like plastic bag.  I wonder if the new packagaing has changed the taste.<br /><br />Thanks
