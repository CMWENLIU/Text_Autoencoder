I used this product in a Solofill cup on the ten oz setting on a Cuisinart SS700.  The first thing I noticed is that the packet doesn't tear open easily so I had to get the scissors.  A bit annoying.  Second, even though the coffee is sealed in the packet, there is no fresh coffee smell when I tear the packet open.  Third, the amount of coffee included just fits in the solofill cup.<br /><br />The next thing I noticed was that the brewed coffee did not flow as easily as it does with a K-cup so maybe the amount of coffee is actually too much.  It was a thin stream of coffee that threatened to stop flowing but did end up filling the cup,  although with no satisfying bit of foam at the top.<br /><br />Taste: typical restaurant coffee rather than coffeehouse coffee, that is, plain, uninteresting.  As one reviewer mentioned, muddy.  Sediment at the bottom of the cup.  The kind of coffee you swallow mindlessly with the breakfast special at the local greasy spoon.<br /><br />I only paid $7.50 and at this writing you can get Ekojava more cheaply than that, but I don't recommend it.  Splurge for a real k-cup or at least put freshly ground coffee into your Solofill.
