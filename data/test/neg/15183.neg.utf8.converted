I was the biggest Orgain fan, purchasing many cases a month. They have recently changed the formula and the new taste is bad and very different.  Also, they've removed the antioxidant complex. They also added a sweetener - Stevia which I don't understand. Usually, sweeteners are added to make products taste better, not worse. I wish they'd wouldn't have messed with a great thing.
