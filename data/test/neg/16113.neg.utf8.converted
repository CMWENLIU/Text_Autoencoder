I was looking to see what amazon had as far as kombucha goes and came across this drink.  I did a little research and realized this stuff is pasteurized.  I must repeat- PASTEURIZED.  One of the main reasons to drink kombucha is to bring beneficial bacteria into the gut to balance gut flora to aid digestion, nutrient absorption and to fight off bad bacteria and other invaders.  Pasteurization kills this bacteria rendering them useless.  There are still plenty of B vitamins in the drink that the body may still utilize even after pasteurization.  If you are buying it for taste and the small amount of B vitamins, go for it.  If you are buying it to nourish your body and introduce probiotics into your system, forget this product.  Instead, make your own kombucha, check out raw brands such as GT's or other local brands(In Madison WI we have Nessala which is raw, nutritious and delicious) or invest in some refrigerated probiotics.
