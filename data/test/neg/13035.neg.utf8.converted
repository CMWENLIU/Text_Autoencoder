This is bottom of the barrel dog food. You can tell by the ingredient list. The number one and three ingredients are a low grade filler; corn. The number 5 ingredient is beef tallow, which is a low grade beef fat. Scrolling through the rest of the list you find nothing but low grade fillers like wheat flour, soy flour, and rice flour. Wheat is the number 1 cause of food allergies in dog food. Soy is another filler that is a poor source of protein for dogs and another high cause of allergies for dogs. Grains and fillers are not a natural part of the canine diet.<br /><br />You'd be better off feeding your dog nachos.
