I love Rishi Tea.  Its flavor is fantastic and its all gluten-free.<br /><br />But, I based my order on the 3.3 oz size.  I received a 2.6 ounce and now see the picture represents that size.<br /><br />This is a HUGE mistake so I have to give 2 stars.  I hope this will be corrected so I can continue my subscription.
