In my opinion, Healthwise does not have the rich taste of Trader Joes Low Acid Coffee<br />Not worth the price. Taste like upscale Yuban to my palette.<br />Plus did you know you can cold brew REGULAR COFFEE and its considered low acid. Google it!<br />In my opinion,  whats the point of Healthwise coffee? On the directions it reads...<br />and I quote from can "Use cold water and brew at least two 5-ounce cups at a time using one tablespoon of ground coffee." Hello!<br />and I dont see any reports or data sheets to confirm its "low acid" rating.there could be, but i have not been able to find them..if you do let me know!<br />Cold brew regular Coffee. its waaaay cheaper and for really low acid coffe try cold brewing Trader Joes Low Acid Coffee! Yummy!!<br />Their cinnamon is off the hook GREAT!! :)
