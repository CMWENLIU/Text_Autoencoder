As avid Keurig users - and Tassimo converts - we were thrilled to finally find Starbucks K-cups had arrived. I purchased 1 box of 16 K-cups for $21.90  - Pike's PlaceRoast - here on Amazon.  And the taste didn't disappoint. We were very satisfied with it and feel it rivals the taste of a cup purchased at a Starbucks store. Unfortunately, the price also rivals that of a cup purchased at a Starbucks store.<br /><br />Here's the math. We have been drinking Caribou Blend coffees to this point.<br /><br />Caribou Blend on average = $0.67/cup<br />Starbucks =  $1.37/cup<br /><br />We understand that Starbucks is a "premium" coffee and don't expect it to be cheap. Caribou is also premium coffee and we can afford to by either. But on principle, suspecting Starbucks Corporate folks set the price, we've decided to stay with Caribou. Based on our household coffee consumption, we would pay a whopping $1,660.00/year more to have Starbucks. So we're going to vote with our $$ and stick with Caribou.  (For those of you who are Kindle owners, this feels like the publisher price gouging we experienced when they set prices at 50% more than Amazon's.)
