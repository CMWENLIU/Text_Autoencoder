This is a very deceiving advertisement. It says each bag has over 300 pieces, so you think you're getting a good deal at $11.90 or whatever per bag. THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU GET. You get a regular bag of candy with 27 pieces in it. So you end up paying about $15 for something you could have gotten from the store for about $4.
