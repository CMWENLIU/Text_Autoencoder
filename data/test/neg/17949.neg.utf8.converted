I am so disapointed with this buy....<br />These sardines are so over salted and no even hot at all...<br />So scally and smells funny....<br />I bought 2 packs of these and ended up giving it to my friends<br />who have thesame coment as I....<br />I am still looking for the one perfect or if not, at least near perfect<br />"HOT" sardines around.... Amazon has the best deal by far....
