Based on the high review marks on so many of Feridies products, and my love of butter toffee peanuts, I purchase the 4 9-ounce can set.  I received them, only to find that they are really tasteless, have no buttery taste, the "toffee" is only on about half the nuts, and they taste stale.  Amazon will not take them back, so no more food purchases for me.
