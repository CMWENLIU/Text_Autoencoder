Since these cans of Ham are supposedly almost fat free, I was surprised that I found so much fat on the periphery of the can.  And it tastes like there is a salt shaker full of salt in each can too.  All in all I find these Hormel Chunk Lean Ham to be a bit on the disgusting side.  I will try using them for appetizers after adding onions, olives, chives, lots of pepper, celery, etc etc to try to smooth out the rather gross<br />taste onto crackers or roasted bread pieces.  A strong overwhelming salt taste can be subdued but it really requires a lot of work and forethought.  Don't expect a delicious HAM taste to be present though.  This is the first time I have tried these cans of lean ham but I will not be buying these again.  I DO NOT recommend them to anyone!
