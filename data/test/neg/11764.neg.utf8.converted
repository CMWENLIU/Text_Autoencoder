I picked Delallo because it was offered on Amazon Prime, had one good comment and was comparatively inexpensive.  I'm  a bit disappointment because based off of the other comment and product description, I was expecting this olive oil to be noticeably unfiltered.  I have reservations if this is even unfiltered olive oil and just a false description by the seller.<br /><br />I've posted a couple pics but I can't see a single spec of anything in it (yes, I shook the heck out of it).  Nor does Delallo's website make any suggestion that this bottle of olive oil is unfiltered.
