I have always loved Kashi cereals & Go-Lean bars. But I just bought a box of these bars (expiration 3/26/11) and it had bits hanging off of it -- the way food gets when moths or worms have gotten at it. There was webby, crummy residue inside the inner package (the one holding each pair of bars). I tried to e-mail the company, but its e-mail page just takes you to a FAQ page, in which packaging+worms calls up nothing and it takes you right back to the FAQ pulldown, no option to write my own message, even though the previous page had offered a "send e-mail" option. Very frustrating. I will return this package & am hesitant to eat Kashi in the future.
