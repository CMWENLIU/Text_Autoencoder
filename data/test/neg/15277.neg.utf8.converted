There were two things I did not like about this corn bread.<br /><br />1.  It is way over-the-top sweet.  I like sweet corn bread, but this is so sweet that it did not taste good with my chili or soup.  It tasted like something  to eat for dessert.  I wish they had left out about 2/3 of the sugar.  You can put more in, but you can't take it out.<br /><br />2.  It does not have the crumbly, corn-meal texture that I like.  It must have a higher percentage of wheat flour than I am used to, because the texture is finer and like there is more gluten than I like.  Maybe it is just a very finely ground corn flour.  I don't know.<br /><br />That said, if you know what to expect, and this does not sound bad to you, you might like it.  It just does not suit my preference for corn-bread.
