I do like the taste of this soup as I have purchased this in the past at the grocery store. I haven't been able to find it so when I saw this offered on Amazon I ordered several cases. To my disappointment all but 3 of the cans were severly dented and one was actually leaking. Amazon immediately sent replacements but sadly they arrived in the same condition. I'm not sure if this problem originated in the warehouse or was the result of poor packaging and shipping. The only reason I gave this one star is because of the superior customer service I received from Amazon. I will try this item again at a later date to see if they have corrected the problem.
