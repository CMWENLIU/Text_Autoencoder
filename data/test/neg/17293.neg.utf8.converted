Having just now finished 3/4 of a cup of this vapid brew, and dumping the rest down the drain, I felt compelled to write a review that will hopefully be heeded by all.  I usually make my ginger/peach tea by brewing a cup with one bag of ginger tea, and one bag of celestial peach tea, which brings out the very best of both.  So I thought I'd save myself a little money and buy one bag that would, in theory, do the same thing.  I was sadly mistaken.  This being my very first experience with the Stash brand I honestly have to say that I will not be a return customer.  There is virtually NO ginger flavor, and the peach is more noticeable before brewing than after.  In all the reviews I have ever written over the years I would implore you to heed my advice on this one.
