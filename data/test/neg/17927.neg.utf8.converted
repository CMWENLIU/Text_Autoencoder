After several months of use and following instructions for care/cleaning, the mesh bag started to slip out of the handle while my baby was holding and chewing on it -- which allowed the food to come out of the bag -- which my baby could then have choked on -- which misses the whole point of using this thing in the first place. Also the rubber letters on the handle (that spell "BabySteps") started to peel off in little pieces! I don't want my baby eating that...
