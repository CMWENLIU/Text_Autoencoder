This stuff is awful.  Great termite food.<br />Product of China!<br />Amazon should be ashamed to offer it as nutrient.<br />I threw it away (all packs) rather than by chance have another human eat some.<br />I've had good soy nuts.  This is not it!<br />Might be good brazier fuel.<br />Who are these people who liked it?
