I bought a single one of these locally to try out and thank GOD I only bought one!<br />After I hit the brew button I walked over to the fridge to get the creme and as soon as I opened the door the stench hit me. I swear I thought something was rotting in my fridge but it was actually this swill brewing on the counter. I was horrified. Some people described it as a burnt smell and it certainly has that going for it but there's so much more. It's unbelievable. The taste isn't as bad as the smell but it's so overwhelming that you just can't get past it.<br /><br />Clearly a LOT of people like this coffee and I would suggest trying one before you buy the case. You will be very angry to find out you're one of those people that thinks this smells worse than a spent diaper.
