Overly sweet, with kind of a nasty chemical flavor to them. Texture is soft and spongy and sort of artificial feeling in the mouth. Creme is softer and gooier than the cookies, and the cakes don't have enough of that great toasty cocoa flavor that Oreos still have.<br />I just didn't like these at all, it was very disappointing.<br />And for what its worth, they pair terribly with Australian shiraz. ; -)
