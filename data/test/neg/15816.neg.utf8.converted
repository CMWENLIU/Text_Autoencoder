When I purchaed this item, I thought it will be normal size lollipop... But when I opened, I was really disappointed.. It's so tiny(I'm talking about finger size lollipop)  it's not worth spending That much money.. I should of just went to candy store... I could of found better lollipop! And With that money I could of found more and left with some change!,
