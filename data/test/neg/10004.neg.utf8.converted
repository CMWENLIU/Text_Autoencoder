The design of this product is fatally flawed. Notice on all manual drip coffee makers the ridges on the sides and around the hole. This keeps the filter just far enough away from the filter to let coffee flow. This one has ridges, but they are pathetic. If fact, it would be impossible to create deep enough ridges out of porcelain to do the job. The result is a drip filter that takes FOREVER to flow, to the point of being unusable. You can stick something in the base to break the seal of the filter with the sides, and that helps, but what a pain. I can't believe Melita keeps this thing on the market. They must not test their products. It's very frustrating.
