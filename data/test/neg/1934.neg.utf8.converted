This is a super sweet tea that tastes like you're sucking on a "red hot" candy. Because none of the ingredients listed on the box are themselves super sweet, my best guess is that the "artificial flavor"/AF listed on the box is Splenda.<br /><br />If the AF was Stevia, they wouldn't need an AF disclaimer because it is natural ingredient; if it contained the other two artificial sweeteners in the pink and blue packets, they would have to include a PKU disclaimer on the box, which they do not.
