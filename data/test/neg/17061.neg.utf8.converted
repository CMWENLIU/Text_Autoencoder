I used to LOVE Smuckers jellies but that was over when I read the ingredients and saw Color #4 and Color #5 in the list. Two doctors (a traditional doctor and also a naturopathic doctor) told me to NOT EVER  buy any product that had Color# plus any number because they are carcinogens. One of them also told me that they could not understand why manufacturers should add colors to their products.
