This seller gives you various order options. For example, the word "pack".  You would think this means you would receive a "box" of 24 Mars Bars or 24 Cadbury Fruit & Nut Bars or a 12 pack of the Cadbury Crunchies. These are the items I ordered and they all arrived thrown in a cardboard box.  I was told this is how they come!! How can you gift this?  I was told the master box is 48 count.
