I don't think anyone expects couscous in a box to be spectacular, but this stuff smelled and tasted awful.  All of the other flavors we've tried from this brand (chicken, mushroom, Mediterranean curry) were actually pretty decent, so it was a surprise just how awful this one was.  Avoid at all cost!
