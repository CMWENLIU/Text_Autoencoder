I ordered this tree for a Valentines gift for my boyfriend.  It looks dead!  We will try to revive however...it doesn't look good.  It looks to me like it may have froze but I'm not an expert.  The packaging is as everyone says a pain which would have been fine had it looked healthy.  Unfortunately there was no zero for a rating.  I got a beautiful diamond necklace, he got a very sick looking tree.
