I buy this juice at the local grocery store, and on the label it states NOT FROM CONCENTRATE as well as on the ingredient list. I just received these from amazon and they say FROM CONCENTRATE, but amazon advertises it as PURE NOT FROM CONCENTRATE. Just a heads up for anyone like myself looking for the real stuff, as from concentrate juice can be had for a fraction of the cost of the real stuff. Very disappointed.
