Was so excited to receive these kisses with macadamia nuts.  I know they only have them in Hawaii and I was shipping them to my son's girlfriend who had them there and was telling us about how good they were.  Unfortunately, when they shipped they came in all melted.  i would have thought the company would have sent them with dry ice or overnighted them.  We could not even try them because the tin foil wrapper melted into the chocolate.  We had to return the product.  My suggestion since the bag was $40.00 they should invest in dry ice.
