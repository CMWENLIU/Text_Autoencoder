This is a great tasting cereal, but it is NOT gluten free. It took me months to figure how my family kept getting gluten because I trusted the "family" owned Erewhon brand.  Guess what?  They are no longer family owned. The corporation who makes Skinner Raisin Brand owns them and processes raisin bran in the same plant as the supposedly gluten free Crispy Brown Rice cereal. If avoiding gluten is important to your family's health, then avoid this cereal. It is definitely cross contaminated with gluten.
