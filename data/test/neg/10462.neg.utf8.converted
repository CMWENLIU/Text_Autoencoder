We ordered this product and it arrived thawed and soured. Very disappointing.<br />Considering this item is sold as a 'frozen' product we expected it to be shipped with this in mind, but it arrived in a box with absolutely no insulation or packaging to retain the cold, let alone frozen.<br />We are a small coffee shop selling fresh baked goods and were hoping to purchase reasonable amounts of this, and other products.<br />But considering how this product was treated and the state it arrived I would not recommend this company unless they can guarantee delivery of the actual product they are selling.<br />Worst experience we have had ordering on-line.
