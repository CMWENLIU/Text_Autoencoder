i bought these noodles after seeing them on dr oz! everone on the show said they taste good and have no callories . and they said these noodles pick up the taste of what ever you mix them with, ok here is what i have to say first these noodles are very expensive and although they do indeed pick up the taste of what you mix it with, it smells like fish and the concistency is that of worms!! you really cant bite though them very rubbery! i bought the angel hair and there is nothing angle about it. it is thicker the regular spagitti . i was worned by my friend not to get them ,but she is italain and of course there is no pasta replacement for her . well i should have listened.
