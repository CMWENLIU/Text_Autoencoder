After eating foods made with Barry's Farm sweet potato flour, I began to have some GI problems. I called Barry Foods to find out the details of this product - who they get it from, where it's grown, whether it's cooked or raw, if it's processed in any way, etc.  They flatly refused to tell me anything about this product.  According to my online research, the manufacture of sweet potato flour is a cottage industry in Africa and China, grown at home and dried in huts. I'm not touching this stuff ever again!  The possibilities for contamination are endless, and I suggest you do not order this product.  There needs to be transparency around food safety, and a company that will not disclose basic information about a product is not to be trusted.
