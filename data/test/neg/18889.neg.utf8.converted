I have ordered these Bergin Nut Company Brazil Nuts for many months and have been very pleased with my orders.  I even ordered them as gifts.  This past week, I ordered my usual 16 oz - double pack and was SO disappointed.  The nuts were soft.  They did not look the same.  Rather than the large, crisp nuts with tons of flavor, these nuts were smaller, had dark skins on all nuts, and tasted soft and almost moist.  I could not return them but if I could have, I would have.  I'm afraid I will not order any more.  I'm so disappointed as I ordered them regularly.
