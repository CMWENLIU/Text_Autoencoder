I purchased this product and was very unhappy. For starters, since you have to warm this oil up a little to get it into its liquid form, I found that the dispensing part was HORRIBLE. I could barely get any out.. even after warming it up a tad, Also I think the one that I got was rancid, it did not smell pleasant. I will not by this brand again. If I could give it no stars I would.
