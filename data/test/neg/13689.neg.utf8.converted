I am a big fan of eating cereal any time of the day, especially for breakfast. It's fast, convenient, and a healthy start to the day. I was excited about tasting this cereal because it is gluten-free and contains quinoa, which Dr. Oz says is a must for any diet. On first inspection, the cereal looks as if it's a combination of Corn Pops, Rice Krispies, and Wheaties. It has a lot going on in one box. In terms of taste, it has a vanilla flavoring that lingers in your mouth long after you have eaten it. Not very appealing! As for  the nutritional value, I was surprised at the lack thereof. Comparing Original Special K (serving size is one cup) to the Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise (serving size is 2/3 cup) without adding any milk, SK has 15% Vitamin A of the daily recommended amount and CVS has 0%. As for vitamin C, SK has 35% and CVS has 0% and sugars SK has 4g and CVS has 7g. It doesn't look like the Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise is all that healthy. Overall, if you like the taste, it's probably better than eating a sugary cereal; however, I wouldn't buy it.
