I saw some complaints about spillage and bad packaging, but thought I would order anyway and hope for the best. NO LUCK! The package just arrived and even from the outside, I could see nasty wet leakage. When I opened the soggy box, it was awash in leaked creamers, many if not most of the containers bent, dented, damaged and leaking. I simply threw the whole vile mess into the trash and called customer service for a refund, which I was granted, as Amazon has great CS....but definitely some packaging issues!
