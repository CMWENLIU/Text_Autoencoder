This product tastes good, but you can buy a container of each type for $9 at Wegman's. If you get it from this place, you pay $26 (TWENTY SIX!) for shipping and handling. Why? All I found was a freezer pack! What a ripoff. When I asked about the high shipping, the response was fairly snotty. When we received the product, we found it labeled "specially selected for Wegman's." Sure enough, next time we went, there it was. In addition, two of the containers had an expiration in two weeks! All in all, the shipping costs make this a big ripoff. Get it at Wegman's.
