I bought this cheese to use as a flavoring for microwave popcorn. I know there are lots of good reviews for this product, but I thought is was terrible.<br /><br />Taste is a matter of taste.<br /><br />This cheese has a very tangy, sour, taste to it. Very uncharacteristic of cheddar cheese. When used on popcorn, the tangy-ness of it overrides the little cheese flavor of the product. It is a taste that is very inappropriate and uncharacteristic of cheese flavored popcorn. You are much better off just buying a quality bag of cheese popcorn. Also, it doesn't stick to the popcorn very well and half of the cheese is left in the bag.<br /><br />I decided to use this stuff to make mac and cheese. I made it very simple. Butter, milk, and this cheese product. With gentle prolonged heating, and cooking down the milk to thicken, the cheese melted very well. Creamy with no lumps. The tangy, sour taste, was overwhelming. I had to throw out the mac and cheese. At least I was able to eat the popcorn.<br /><br />I can't recommend this product. If you are looking for powered cheddar cheese, try a different product before you try this one.
