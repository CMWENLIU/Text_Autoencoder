I tried this food because reviews claim it is more natural and therefore more healthy for your dog, it also gives a satisfaction guarantee.  Well, the food made my dog sick! (caused puking, muscle spasms) So I clipped the proof of purchase and mailed in my receipt as the guarantee asked. I got a coupon in the mail for a small bag of food! For one, the coupon is for a smaller bag of food. Two, I requested a refund....why would I give the same food to my dog and make him sick? I called customer service and they said you can only get refunds from the retailer! Ok, now that you took my receipt how do I do that? The customer service for Evo was unhelpful and was not able to help my situation. Apparently it is not a true satisfaction guarantee.
