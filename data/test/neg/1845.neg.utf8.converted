At least half of my cans came dented.  And they were packed that way, not dented in transit.  **** Also, be sure to call the company to ask if they are Product of Thailand or Product of Sri Lanka.  (It is printed on the back of the cans.) They have a different supplier in Sri Lanka which waters down the milk -- the cans sound like water when you shake them, not like thick creamy coconut milk (as in the Thailand cans).  And it is NOT that the flesh settles to the bottom -- it is watery all the way through.  Completely different product and the watered down cans just don't produce as nice a product in the kitchen :(.  Beware.
