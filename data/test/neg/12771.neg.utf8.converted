I wish I could give these cookies a great review.  However, I can't. At first taste, they remind me of regular ginger snaps. However, after the second bite, I found the ginger to be so overwhelming that it's almost hot. The aftertaste lasted so long in my mouth that I couldn't get rid of it even after eating something else. I appreciate that they are organic, but I did not find them at all appealing and could not even finish the first cookie.<br /><br />Ellen Gable Hrkach<br />Author, Stealing Jenny
