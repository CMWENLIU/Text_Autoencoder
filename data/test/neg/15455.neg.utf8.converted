I was extremely disappointed in the pop tarts I received.  First of all, the package arrived with the wrong zip code. So it had travelled all over the state before I received it.. (The other product I ordered at the same time arrived in a different box and much sooner than the pop tarts, and with the correct zip code. So I know Amazon has my correct zip code.)  The pop tarts were so old that they were all broken up and they tasted extremely stale. I have ordered and received many other products from Amazon which were all excellent, so I know this was an anomaly.
