I recently tried the Sugar-free Jelly Belly product, and I sure wish I had never bought it.  Whatever chemical is in these jelly beans made me violently ill - twice.  So it is confirmed, believe me.  The first time I thought I had a stomach bug.  A few days later, I ate some more of the Jelly Bellys and got very sick again.  It was horrible.  Take my word for it, you don't want to eat this candy!
