THESE ARE CHINESE NUTS, NOT AMERICAN.<br />I was deceived.<br />The country of origin is listed as "America" on the product's Amazon page.<br />However, when I received the nuts, they looked just like the Chinese nuts I had obtained from another vendor.<br />I checked with J&D (something I should have done before ordering) and was told the nuts are indeed Chinese.<br />I see from previous critiques on this page that I am not the only person who<br />was misled by the information on the Amazon product page.<br />Of course, there is a disclaimer on the page.<br />"Let the buyer beware."<br />Let the Amazon buyer be doubly beware.
