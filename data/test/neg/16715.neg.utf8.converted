I would not consider myself an expert on coffee, but I did not care for this flavor.  It seemed quite bitter, and did not have the same flavor as the Italian roasts I have had before.  I used to get coffee pods, and one of my favorites was the Italian roast.  I have since switched to whole beans that I grind myself, but I was disappointed when I tried this one.  It did not have the same flavor I was used to in an Italian roast.  It is possible that the ones I had before were the ones that were not true Italian roasts, but this coffee just seemed bitter, and without any real flavor to it.  I did use the entire bag, but it is not something I will order again.  This is the second bag I have ordered from Coffee Bean Direct, and I am hesitant to try another flavor, because I was not impressed with that one either.  Maybe I just ordered two bad bags, but both of the bags I received seemed over-roasted and bitter.
