Buyer beware.  Notice how carefully worded the descriptions are to avoid stating the caffeine content.  Many other sites still quote Perky Jerky's original advertizing claim that Perky Jerky contains 150mg of caffeine (from guarana).  Before you buy you should know that, due to federal Food Safety and Inspection Service intervention, Perky Jerky no longer contains anything close to 150 mg of caffeine.  U.S.D.A. officials explained that the Food Safety and Inspection Service "would not allow producers of beef jerky to add sufficient quantities of guarana to produce a stimulant effect." You can read the original source published in the New York Times:  [...]<br />Notice that the company now refuses to state how much caffeine their product contains.  The description says: "Perky Jerky, the caffeinated beef jerky is an all-natural, great tasting snack with a kick: an energy-drink's worth of invigorating caffeine in each serving."  But some "energy" drinks contain very little caffeine.  This new and intentional vagueness about their main claim does not bode well.  Buyer beware.
