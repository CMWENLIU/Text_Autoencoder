Based on the one positive review - that will teach me - I ordered a banana shrub and this product - two sweet olive tea trees.  I received three plants in a box, wrapped in plastic wrap.  The packing slip said the box contained a banana shrub and the requested two sweet olive tea trees.  However, the tag on the plants and a visual inspection showed that they were slow growing bay trees.  And they were tiny with two or three leaves.  It will take me years to get them to shrub size.<br /><br />I called the number provided inside the box twice and got a recording both times asking me to leave a number and PROMISING EARNESTLY to call.  I left my number and reason for call - twice - and nothing.  It's been almost a month now.<br /><br />Buy from a reputable company that sends what you ordered instead of what they have in stock.  This has been a totally frustrating experience.
