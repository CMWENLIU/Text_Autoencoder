I was excited with the concept of being able to burn calories and boost my metabolism by consuming one can of a flavored drink.  After opening a can and taking one sip, the disappointment was written all over my face.  The taste is horrible.  I can not even force myself to drink one whole can.  I sipped it as long as I could and poured the rest down the drain.  The flavor is strange - I don't how else to put it.  It is bitter and has a bad after taste.  I could smell the Raspberry flavoring but the awful taste was too much for me to handle.  I have tried other energy drinks like Monster, and I did not care for the taste of those either. The taste of the Celsius Raspberry Acai actually reminded me of those drinks, the staleness and bad after taste. On a plus note, one can only has 10 calories compared to other energy drinks that are very high in calories.<br /><br />In regards to boosting your energy level, I could see a difference.  I only drank half of a can, and after a couple hours I felt very fidgety, energetic and wide awake.  However, my mouth keep watering like I was going to "up-chuck" and I kept burping up the flavor of the drink.<br /><br />Even if I was guaranteed I would loose one pound a day by consuming one can daily, I would still not be able to force myself to drink it.  Maybe the other flavors might be more appealing to my taste buds, but this flavor was not for me.
