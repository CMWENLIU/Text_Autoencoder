I think I received a bad batch( there's no expiration date).  Tried one---made me a bit queasy afterwards; like a fool I tried another( a few days later), this time w/o the mustard/mayo, and felt sick again.  These have probably been sitting on the shelf in a sweltering warehouse for quite some time, which can't be good for the mustard/mayo or the oily soy sauce pack.  That aside, they don't taste too bad actually but nowhere near as good as the other reviews would suggest.  I ordered a couple other Myojo ramen and they seemed fine, so I'm guessing it's just the luck of the draw---ordering food products from Amazon is something of a crapshoot( I've had stale popcorn delivered too).
