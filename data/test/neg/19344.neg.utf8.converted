I love Cheez-Its, and it makes sense to get multiple boxes instead of one big box because they stay fresher longer. I used to have a Subscribe-and-Save subscription to this item when it was 4 boxes, but then it dropped to 3 boxes and the price stayed the same. Now it's just not worth it to buy here.
