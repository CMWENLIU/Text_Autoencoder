I ordered a whole box for work and was so disappointed when I realized they were all STALE! I usually buy these at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods but the price was better on Amazon so I ordered them. Unfortunately, they were stale and old. So, no  more buying these delicious bars from Amazon. I would rather pay more but get a fresh product. Why doesn't Amazon do something about this? I am not the first person to have had this experience. I didn't bother reading the reviews before I ordered them on my iPhone. Oh well. I hope they fix this or at least that others will read this!
