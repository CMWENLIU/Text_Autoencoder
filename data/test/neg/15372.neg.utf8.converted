I work in a very hot locality, at least when it's summertime.  My group and I get very thirsty.  We discussed this (argued, actually...) and decided to order some fruit punch so we'd have a break from drinking the water here (it has lots of minerals and tastes like poison).  We ordered five 4-packs of this fruit punch, there are four of us and figured it would last awhile.  But we were shocked when we opened the package.  The bottles are only 1.6 ounces - this is less than one twentieth of a liter, or one thousandth of a cubic foot!  The hole under the cap is very tiny, you can't drink from it or even fit a straw.  We cut them open with knives and tried to soothe our parched throats, but the mixture is so extremely sweet it only made us thirstier.  Plus the shape of the bottle is very hard to keep on the handlebars of your bicycle if it is in motion.  Please make the bottles bigger (maybe a liter or so) and put a hole for a lanyard so I can tie it to my bicycle or hang around my neck.  Bless you for your quick mailings!!!
