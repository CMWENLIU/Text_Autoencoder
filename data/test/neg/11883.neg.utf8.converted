I was intrigued by the claim that this non-carbonated but caffeinated drink would actually burn calories although I wouldn't quite know how to really prove or disprove that it does. But I found it interesting enough to order this "dietary supplement", as it says on the can. At the very least I figured it would be healthy (green tea and acai) and taste great given that it contains: No sugar, no Aspartame, no preservatives, very low sodium, no high fructose corn syrup and no artificial colors or flavors.<br /><br />But I was in for a surprise - it tasted awful. Imagine a can of carbonated soda that was opened and then sat out on a table for a day and you get a pretty good idea of what this tastes like. Very flat and simply not good. Both my husband and I tossed it after just one sip. Even if it burned double the calories it claims to burn, I highly doubt I could down the entire 12 oz or even just a third of it. Maybe if it were carbonated that would help but honestly: Save yourself the money, this is NOT good.
