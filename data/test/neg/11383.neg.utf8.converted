I love dark fruitcake. I grew up with dark fruit cake.  I grew up with homemade fruitcake, but I am not such a cook.<br /><br />After disappointment with grocery store fruitcakes, I thought:  Hey, I'll get one on line that is highly recommended.<br /><br />I bought 3 lbs of this one -- the price is reasonable -- it has lots of good ingredients and I was thrilled when it arrived in my mailbox today.  I cut a slice to have with my tea and it was dry, it was bitter, it was perhaps the worst fruitcake I have ever had!  Am I supposed to drench it in brandy before I eat it?  How do I rescue this $35 doorstop.  This fruitcake is the kind of thing that gave it its bad name.  My wife hates the stuff, but I still love it -- when done right.<br /><br />Think twice before you buy this one.
