I AM A MAJOR LOVER OF PANFORTE AND HAVE EATEN IT FOR 60+ YEARS SO I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH ITS PROPER TASTE.  BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY BRAND STILL AVAILABLE, I DECIDED TO ORDER FOR THE FIRST TIME AS CHRISTMAS GIFTS MARABISSI PANFORTE TORTA CIOCCOLATO FOR THREE FRIENDS WHO I DO NOT SEE FREQUENTLY.  RECENTLY I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT MY FRIENDS AND LEARNED FROM ALL THREE THAT THE PANFORTE HAD AN UNPLEASANT AND GRITTY TEXTURE.  NONE OF THEM FINISHED THE PANFORTE NOR FELT COMFORTABLE  TELLING ME AS IT WAS A GIFT AND THEY DID NOT WANT TO SEEM UNAPPRECIATIVE.  I THEN EMAILED THE PROVIDER, JR MUSHROOMS AND SPECIALTIES, EXPLAINING THE ISSUE AND WHY I DID NOT CONTACT THEM SOONER.  I ALSO COPIED AMAZON.<br />I NEVER HEARD FROM EITHER OF THEM.<br />CAUTION-BE AWARE OF THE RETURN/COMPLAINT POLICIES BEFORE YOU ORDER.  IT WAS NOT THE FACT THAT I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY CREDIT BUT MORE THAT NEITHER AMAZON NOR JR MUSHROOM NEVER HAD THE COURTESY TO REPLY.<br />THE TIME LAPSE SHOULD NOT HAVE AFFECTED THEIR  QUALITY AS PANFORTE WERE ORIGINAALLY MADE AS NOURISHMENT  FOR THE CRUSADERS BECAUSE THEY LAST LONG, MOST PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN MAINLY DRIED FRUITS AND NUTS.
