OMG, this is NOT orange BLOSSOM water. This is a watered down "distillate" (see label) of orange oil from the orange PEEL. This company clearly has no idea what orange blossoms remotely smell like or what orange BLOSSOM (hello!) water is. Made in IL, figures. If I had known it was watered down orange oil, I certainly would not have paid for it. Buyer beware.
