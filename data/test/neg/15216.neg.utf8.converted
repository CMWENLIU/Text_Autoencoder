I used this stuff successfully a number of times and started having failures.  The manufacturer's rep in L.A. told me that it is supposed to be refrigerated or the cultures "bloom" early and then don't work to make yogurt.  Well, the product is not sold nor warehoused under refrigeration, so who would have guessed?  The package does say "store refrigerated" but why the end-user only?  Could it possibly have "bloomed" before purchase?  The company does not stand behind the product for direct purchase; if  you are going to buy it, go to a retail store where you can return products that don't work.  I now use store-purchased natural yogurt for my starter, a bit of a pain, but no failures.
