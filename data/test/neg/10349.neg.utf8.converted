I put one square in my mouth and it made me want to vomit. I love most of their other products but this was absolutely volatile. The taste was stuck in my mouth for the rest of the night. Unless you like your chocolate very very very very very dark, do not get this. 88% cacao content is ridiculous- I try to stay below 70-75.
