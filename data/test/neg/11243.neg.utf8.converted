My 9 month old is sprouting 6 teeth and I thought this would be great for him to hold and chew on (like a chew toy). The first time we gave him one was to keep him occupied while we were out having dinner, but to my horror, the mess he made while it dissolved in his hands and mouth didnt help us enjoy a meal. The table cloth, high chair and his clothes were all smeared with mush within a few short minutes. I had to take it away from him. The second time was at home (where I could bear the mess alittle more) I gave him a piece to entertain himself while I prepared dinner. He was entertained with it in his highchair for awhile - just enough time for me to wash the rice twice before putting them in the rice cooker, then I heard him coughing and gagging. Thankfully, he was only an arm reach away from me. When I stuck my finger into his mouth, I found the cause to be the 1/3 of the biscuit broken in there! Unless you are prepared to keep both eyes without blinking on your kid and use up a box of wipes cleaning up the mess; look for something else.
