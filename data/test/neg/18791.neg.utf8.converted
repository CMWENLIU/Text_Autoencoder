Used it for years. Now, the new version with the yellow top band has killed that. The original taste was pretty good for the benefits, but that is gone. The flakes now actually look like some cardboard fell into the box. Awful texture. I am moving to Hi-Lo (also not so tasty unfortunately). The nutrition numbers are worse as well. Considering the health-mindedness of this cereal's customers, this move is hard to understand.
