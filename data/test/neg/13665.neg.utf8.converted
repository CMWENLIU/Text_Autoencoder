It's not quite noodles, it's not quite mac and cheese. It's some kind of monstrous hybrid that I wouldn't have been able to finish had I not been starving and there was nothing else to eat. You can go to any country in Asia and I guarantee you'll never find a food like this. Only in America can you get away with adding cheese to everything.
