Agave "nectar" is not nectar. It is high fructose syrup made by the same process used to make high fructose corn syrup. Its basically high fructore agave syrup. But agave is worse, because it contains a higher percentage of free fructore than corn syrup.<br /><br />This is not a health food. Seriously, its a scam.
