There is a national boycott of Horizon products as they are not organic.  This company was sold to a large conglomerate a few years ago.  Horizon is practicing "Greenwashing" - where a company claims to be sustainable, green, and organic but really is not.  Many Co-ops and local health food stores are boycotting Horizon products, including PCC Co-op in Seattle (largest co-op in the country)<br /><br />Please do some research before paying organic prices to a bogus company.
