I first tried FRS when I got a free sample in a package I ordered from a bike shop here on Amazon.  To be honest, most drinks that cost this much is almost criminal in that most buyers thinking that they are getting some sort of magic potion to make them feel better, run faster or jump higher.  Most of the time you would be better buying sugar free Kool Aid and adding a couple of vitamin tablets to it.  There is no scientific basis for sports drinks except for one caveat.  If you sweat a lot during your exercise, you will do yourself a favor by replacing electrolytes and a few calories but stay away from a lot of sodium salts.  Having said that, this drink and many others should not be used by people who have GERD (gastro-esopogeal reflux disease) as it will cause reflux and heartburn due to the citric acid in the drink.  Overall, this drink and many others really have no value for most people and considering the price of these additive type drinks, you can purchase a membership in a health center and then drink water when your there.  I am a bicyclist and often ride in very hot, humid weather and I drink a watered down sports drink, but its cheap and only has a few calories and can be purchased at a local big box store.  Save your money and don't buy expensive drinks like this one.
