As noted, the flavor isn't even close. But I have found a company that is making a red licorice with a hauntingly similar taste. Look up Tubi's Tire Tread Red. The smell alone will bring you right back to the original Delfa. Not the thin ribbon or the flexibility of Delfa/Danish Ribbon. Other than that, very close.<br /><br />Red Licorice, Tire Tread - 7 oz,(Tubi'S Organic Soft Licorice)
