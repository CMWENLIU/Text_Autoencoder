This is a review of the SELLER Amazon chooses to deal with vs. a commentary on the product of Cafix. Cafix is a wonderful coffee substitute giving you that warm drink feeling in the morning without the after-effects of caffeine. It is the BEST coffee alternative made in my opinion.<br /><br />But DAB Nutrition (Direct Super Center) was TERRIBLE to deal with! They quoted a price for shipping on Amazon.com checkout of about $6 but then sent me an email that they had cancelled my order and wanted to charge me $26 to ship if I wanted to place the order again!!! When I called their customer service department, they refused to send the package via USPS which could ship for FAR less than $26!!!<br /><br />I am getting fed up with the suppliers Amazon chooses to deal with when it comes to shipping to Hawaii! Wrong shipping quotes and rude customer service- I was even told I lived in a 'foreign' zone once and that the supplier refused to ship to me! How can Amazon allow their suppliers to refuse to ship to a US address??<br /><br />I have chosen to buy my Cafix at  [...]<br /> where they offer reasonable shipping choices such as USPS parcel post. I can get 12 of these tins sent to me via  [...]<br /> for only $18.95!<br /><br />Forget DAB Nutrition (Direct Super Center) and their rude policies and get your fantastic coffee alternative from an online supplier who cares:  [...]<br /><br />signed, "Frustrated in Maui"
