I've always been happy with the organic Puffs and so I decided to try the Super Puffs.  Not at all happy, they have added sugar.  I'm going to donate the unopened packages I have left.  I wonder why they decided to add sugar?  Not necessary and I certainly won't buy these again.  They taste like Fruit Loops.
