I've been drinking 2-3 cups of this wonderful, spicy tea for the last 6 months and absolutely can not live without it!  However, the last batch I received (an Amazon order) is almost undrinkable--it's as if there's a missing ingredient and the tea is very bitter--not sweet and spicy.  I would love to return all of it (6 boxes) and start over, but I'm not sure how to do that.
