When somebody sells something for three times more than you can get it at a brick and mortar store, it is outrageous.  The only problem at the moment is that Similac had a recall on several of their products and they are currently in short supply.<br /><br />We have tried 5 different formulas and our daughter refuses to eat anything but this formula, so I'm not knocking the formula, just the quick buck artist selling it at such a high price.  Put it this way, our 3 month old drinks a whole bottle (quart size) of this formula per day, so the six bottles being sold here for $102 means you'd be paying over $400 a month for baby formula.  Outrageous.
