This coffee base of Latin American beans is foul smelling and tastes bitter and leaves a strong aftertaste after brewing. The cinnamon was subtle but I would not pair it with these beans. It needs a lighter roast to meld the flavors better. I won't be buying this blend and was glad a friend brought her bag over to try so I didn't waste my money.
