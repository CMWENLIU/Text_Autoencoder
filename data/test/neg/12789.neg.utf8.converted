The FDA made it illegal to sell RAW Almonds in the Fall of 2007.  There are people who believe that the cure for cancer lies in the raw almond, and when the FDA got wind of it, they took them off of the market for 2 cases of food poisoning.  I don't see cantaloupe being outlawed and we had how many deaths recently from food poisoning?)<br />You can google the ruling and the outcome(s).<br />[...]<br /><br />The fact that this company advertises these as "RAW" almonds makes me angry.  This is false advertising.  They are steam pasteurized.  See the email below from the company to me, after I emailed them asking if these were truly "raw" almonds:<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />customerservice@berginfruitandnut.com<br />Customer Service to me<br />show details 10/20/2011 12:09 PM<br />Kristin,<br /><br />All our raw almonds are steam pasteurized.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />So, if you're looking for truly "raw" almonds, you must look at your local Farmers' Markets, or grow your own.
