I didn't purchase this from Amazon although I was about to since the 12 pack is so much cheaper than buying individual bags at the grocery store. So I thought I'd try a couple of bags to see how I liked them. The first bag was wonderful - plump, sweet, juicy pieces of ginger. Nicely sweetened with a good, hot ginger hit. The second bag was awful - mushy ginger and some pieces with strange unnatural textures. And the ginger was way too hot in that second bag.<br /><br />Not sure what's going on. But I also tried a couple of bags of the Reed's and liked their ginger much, much better. And the quality was consistent.
