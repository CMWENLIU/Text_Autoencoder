I use this at hotel breakfasts all the time while traveling and the quality is great. So, I ordered them for myself to use at home for portion control.<br /><br />I received the shipment in a timely manner but in all the cups I have used so far, when I open the individual cup the oil is sitting on top of the peanut butter, and the peanut butter is grainy.  If I stir it up it becomes very runny and not easy to spread.  So then I pour the oil off and the peanut butter is very dry and hard to spread.<br /><br />I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Thank you.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YVGNFG">Heinz Peanut Butter Spread, 0.5-Ounce Cups (Pack of 100)</a>
