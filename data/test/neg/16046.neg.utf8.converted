This was on sale a little while ago and I decided to try it.  My dogs wont eat it.  One of my dogs actually went on a huger strike for a few days, when this was the only food we would give him.  But, I don't really blame them, the stuff in the can looks and smells disgusting. Definitely nothing like the beautiful white meat chicken shown on the box.
