The contents just taste like plastic. Not even a little bit of coconut taste. Just plastic. Luckily for me, unlike some reviewers, I only bought 3 bottles. I got through the first one by chugging it, because I hate being wasteful. I left the second and third in the refrigerator at work until someone stole them. I'm sure they regret it.
