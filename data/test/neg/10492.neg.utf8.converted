I ordered "Fresh Whole Rabbit" four days before I left on a cross-country drive across America.  The package sat at my doorstep for three and a half weeks.  Upon my return, I found my box of "Fresh Whole Rabbit" was now growing into the pavement in front of my door.  My box of "Fresh Whole Rabbit" is now "Rotten Gob of Rabbit Good-Coyote Attractor".
