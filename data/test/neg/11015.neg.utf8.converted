i normally don't write reviews, but needed some recourse since i have to eat 6 bags of this bitter stuff. and the bitterness refuses to go away no matter how long you wash the grains. (other quinoa i've eaten in the past, i don't even bother to wash.) the nutty quinoa flavor i love is entirely missing. don't buy it.
