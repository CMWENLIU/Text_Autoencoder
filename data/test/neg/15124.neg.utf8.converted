I bought a case, not yet knowing that while it qualifies as organic technically, the company does nothing to go above and beyond like many organic companies do. I bought it because the prices were so much better than Organic Valley.<br />My soy allergic son had an allergic reaction to one sip.<br />I called the company, and they do run soy on the same line.<br />I drank the rest of the case myself over time and only buy Organic Valley for my kids. Not only do I not want another soy reaction, but Organic Valley actually makes it a rule to treat their cows with respect and gives them a good life in addition to following the organic standards. Horizon does whatever they can to be right on the margin so they can charge organic prices.<br />Still better than conventional? Maybe. But even without allergies, I like my milk to contain just milk, not traces of something else.
