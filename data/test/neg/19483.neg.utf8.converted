First I will say I love most Innova Evo products and feed my three Miniature Schnauzers the chicken formula which was the original recipe.<br /><br />Before I had found Evo, my Miniature Schnauzers were fed a RAW diet (aka BARF)which was great but unfortunately one of the girls started getting sick on raw chicken because of the fat content.<br /><br />Innova Evo's red meat recipe came out much later than the Innova Evo's chicken formula and I decided to try it to give them a change of taste. Unfortunately two of my dogs couldn't take the change even though I did it on a very gradual reduction of Innova Evo's chicken formula to Innova Evo's red meat formula.<br /><br />Any little amount of the Innova Evo's red meat formula (10% Innova Evo's Red Meat to 90% Innova Evo's Chicken) gave two of my Schnauzers bad diarrhea after eating it and after a week of trying to convert them all gradually I decided that it wasn't worth it and took it to back to the store where I purchased it from and they allowed me to trade it for the chicken formula. I placed all of my Schnauzers back on Innova Evo's chicken formula and they were fine.<br /><br />I don't know why Innova Evo's Red Meat formula caused two of my Miniature Schnauzers diarrhea (each time I fed them this) but I don't think it's the red meat, I think it's what ever else is mixed in with the red meat which may have caused it or perhaps I just had a bad batch.<br /><br />The reason I believe this is because I have given all three Schnauzers meaty beef neck bones before in the past and they were fine.<br /><br />Whatever it is I'm not going to try Innova's EVO Red Meat formula again and take my chance.
