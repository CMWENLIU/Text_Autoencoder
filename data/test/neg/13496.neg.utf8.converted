Ok, I purchased the Manuka Honey from Y.S Bee Farms, when the store was out of my regular brand, and halfway through the jar, I pulled out a looooong blonde hair on the spoon!! EWWW!! I was so skeeved, that I threw the rest of the jar out as it was contaminated as far as I was concerned.<br /><br />I emailed them, but not enough time has passed to get a response. I will post an update when I get one.<br /><br />But beware! If a hair got into the honey (we all have dark hair and no one has long hair in the house), you have to ask yourself how high their standards are when it comes to packaging and harvesting..Someone could get sick.<br /><br />Maybe that's why it's so inexpensive. You get what you pay for :(
