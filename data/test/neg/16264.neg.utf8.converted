Despite the fact it claims to contain only coconut water and pulp, I am pretty sure this has some sugar added to it. It is way too sweet...unless these are some very special coconuts. I've never tasted coconut water this sweet straight from the coconut. I really hope I am wrong...but my gut tells me they've sweetened it to appeal to the American palate, and haven't mentioned it on the can so as to appeal to the diet conscious folk at the same time. To me, it is actually sickeningly sweet and I definitely wont be ordering again.
