HORRIBLE!  The actual so-called "Pure Spanish Saffron" is, in my opinion NOT what it is claimed to be, and certainly NOT AT ALL AS PICTURED! (And certainly not at all like the beautiful golden saffron threads I have purchased from other sources in the past.)<br />Instead, it resembles a red bark, shaved and chopped.  When placed into water to see how it affects the color, the water becomes RED, rather than GOLDEN.<br />INTERESTINGLY?  They scrawled a handwritten note on the back of scrap paper:<br />"Thank you for your purchase. This month we also have promotion of if you buy 5 gr Spanish Saffron we give away 10 gr of ground Turkish Saffron.  If you like it please order it next time. Thank you. Marshall Books"<br />The ground Turkish Saffron is golden in color. BUT it seems to me that this indicates that Marshall Books KNOWS they are ripping customers off with this "saffron" and try to assuage their guilt by this "give away".<br />That, my friends, is the true "dead give-away" that this product is NOT what it is claimed to be.<br />Therefore, I claim, "FRAUD!  I want my money REFUNDED!"
