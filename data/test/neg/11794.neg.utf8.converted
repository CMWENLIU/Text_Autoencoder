These bowls arrived last week and almost half of them were broken.  Since we bought these to substitute as bowls to do less dishes, defeated the purpose for sure.  They are tasty enough, but not nearly as good as most waffle bowls or cones you get at an ice cream shop.  Disappointing, won't purchase again.
