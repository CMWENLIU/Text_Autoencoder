I love all of the Peanut Butter & Co peanut butters except this one. I expected a far more subtle hint of heat not the overpowering spiciness you'll find here. The texture, because of the dried pepper skins and seed bits,  really bothers me. It was very disappointing. This is not to say you won't like it, IF you know what to expect and find those characteristics appealing. I just can't imagine it tasting good on anything, it's way too hot and the flavor and texture are just not good. I may try to use it for Thai peanut sauce but I'd put it in the blender to smooth out all the skins and seeds. I have 6 jars, that's a lot of peanut sauce...
