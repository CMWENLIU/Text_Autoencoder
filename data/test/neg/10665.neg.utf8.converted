My puppy just couldn't take these treats--or the grain-free dog food. It just wasn't for him. He was having a lot of digestions problems, which went away as soon as we stopped giving him these treats.<br /><br />Make your own treats if you have the time! My dog prefers our homemade treats, plus there are no added preservatives, and you'll know how long they've been sitting around.<br /><br />Good luck!
