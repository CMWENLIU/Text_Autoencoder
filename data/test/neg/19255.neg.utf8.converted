This is the first 'gunpowder' tea I've tried, so I don't know if I am not crazy about the type in general or Davidson's brand, but the tea has a slightly bitter after-taste which I don't like. I often brew from China sourced sampler sets, which I've found to have a slightly sweeter, smoother taste. Still looking for a reasonably priced standby for green tea.
