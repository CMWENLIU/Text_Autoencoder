I was excited when these came out as I LOVE white chocolate! I ordered them immediately and was excited to get them. Unfortunately it didn't taste as good as I hoped. With the 8oz. brew (as recommended by the manufacturer) it tasted very watery and with the 6oz. brew (not recommended ~ by me!) it didn't brew the whole product and just clogged up. I brewed the 8oz. into a stronger cup of coffee and that didn't taste too bad, but I won't be buying this again.
