After reviewing the ingredients I immediately threw away this product.<br />The research that has been done on corn syrup indicates not only is it a big factor in the obesity area, but very hard on digestion - affecting the kidneys!!!  All Americans should be eliminating this from their<br />diets immediately.  I am on a campaign to hopefully have that happen.<br />Lets us the corn for feed and ethonol.  There is no nutritional value in corn!!!
