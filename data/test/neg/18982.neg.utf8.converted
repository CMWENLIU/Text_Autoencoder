First they changed from 4 boxes to 3 and charged more, then they lowered the price again to maintain the customers, now they have DOUBLED the price again!!<br /><br />I just imagine how people would react if another type of subscription went up to double price from time to time, and you only realize it when it arrives in your mailbox.<br /><br />It's not the product that is in question, it's the marketing
