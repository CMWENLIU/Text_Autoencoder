I find Simply Organic spices to be a good value but I do not like this nutmeg.  It is very fresh but the more I use it the more I keep ending up with bitter food.  I thought that I was adding too much mace so I deleted the mace all together.  That did not get rid of the bitter taste. So I tasted the nutmeg and found it to be very bitter.  Then, to make sure, I have made things leaving out the nutmeg and then with it again and have confirmed that it is this nutmeg that is the problem.<br /><br />Watkins nutmeg is so sweet and so much better. In fact I have never had bitter nutmeg before.  I'll have to throw out the rest.  So disappointing.
