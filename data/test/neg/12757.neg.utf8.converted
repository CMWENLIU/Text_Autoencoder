The waffles taste good and have a crispy exterior.The problem is the berries.The label says bluberry,not blueberry flavored.No berries,just food coloring.I would have purchased another flavor if I knew the truth.Before I ordered I looked at the label and it looked like there wer berries.What there is is little purplish specks.I try and eat more fruits and veggies and I feel like Heartland lied.Change the label.
