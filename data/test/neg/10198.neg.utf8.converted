Bendicks Bitter Mints are an excellent English product. Too bad they don't have an American distibuter. I found out too late. The product is distributed from the UK and "posted" from the UK by the Royal Mail at International Postal rate. The product is priced in the UK in Pounds Sterling, charged to my credit card in US$ and after paying the exchange rate and surcharge on my credit card, the 8 or 10 mints I received cost me nearly a king's ransom. I'll wait until they are available in the USA. Meanwhile I will have to put up with a domestic mint patty.
