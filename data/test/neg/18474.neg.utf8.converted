There are high levels of Arsenic in this formula from the organic brown rice they use. My pediatrician told me to stop using it because it has high levels of arsenic in it which is a poison! This happens because the organic brown rice used to make the formula soaks up the arsenic from the soil when it's growing and then when they use it, it contaminates the milk. I'm not sure how Earths Best will fix this issue but until they fix it, I am not using this formula.
