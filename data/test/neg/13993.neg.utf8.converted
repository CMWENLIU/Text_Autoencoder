I fell in love with the taste of umeboshi plums in Japan, not knowing that they were supposed to have health benefits.  They are delicious, but a bit of an acquired taste.  When I saw the reviews, it seemed like most of the negative reviews were from people who had purchased them for the health benefits without ever tasting an umeboshi plum.  I assumed that they did not like them because they are an acquired taste.<br /><br />I was wrong.  These plums are not sour, are too salty, and lack the haunting umeboshi flavor.  I would buy them from an Asian grocery store instead.  I went to a local Korean grocery store and was able to get ones that weren't quite as good as some that I had in Japan, but were still tasty.
