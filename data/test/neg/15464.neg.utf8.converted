You know I wrote to Lesser Evil before I had purchased the individual size bags. I was buying the large bags at the grocery store and it was great. The small bags had so many hard kernels that I actually broke a tooth. I had split the box with a friend and she too said that she about busted a tooth also. I don't know the reasoning but maybe the way it is manufactured. I absolutely love this popcorn, but I know that I will never buy the small bags again. I was sad because this is my absolute favorite snack.
