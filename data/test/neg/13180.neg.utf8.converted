I will start by saying that I am NOT an avid drinker of coconut water.  This was my first (and probably only) experience with the stuff.  I like trying new, healthy items when they come out and coconut water had been on my list for a while.  I decided to bite the bullet with this one since I am a fan of the Naked brand.  While I'm sure that the beverage is healthy and good for you, and may even qualify to college kids as a hang over drink, I, on the other hand, think that its distinct taste (not coconut-y, but rather 'earthy') and don't enjoy it.  I'd probably say that if you have ever had wheat grass drinks, you would like this.  If you don't like wheat grass, you probably will no like this.  (I'm not crazy about wheat grass, but I mix it into some drinks for the added health benefits).  While they are made of different ingredients and don't taste exactly the same, I think that the taste TYPE is very similar.  They will probably taste better in a nice, healthy fruit smoothie.<br /><br />It's also important to point out that the expiration date of the beverages I received was 2.5 months after I ordered it.  That may seem like a lot of time, but if it will take you a while to consume the drinks, you may want to keep that in mind.  I ended up bringing them into work and left them in the kitchen for anyone who would want them since I knew I wouldn't finish the entire box before it expired.
