I like the fact that this Stevia had no additives such as maltodextrin; however, it does have inulin, which is fiber. The fiber STRONGLY disagreed with my body and caused me severe abdominal cramping that lasted for days before I finally figured out the cause. Once I stopped using this stevia, the cramping subsided.  They REALLY need to cut back on the inulin or completely remove it all together and just give us stevia, which is what we want and pay for anyway. Now I'm stuck with two full boxes and part of a 3rd because it's made me soooooooo sick. I'm really saddened about this because I do have chemical sensitivities and have to be careful with all types of products, but I never dreamed that this would make me so sick.<br />I'm sure that I'm the 000.1% in the world that this has ever happened to, so don't be afraid of it. I would like to add, though, as well that this stevia did not dissolve for me, not in hot and not in cold. I had just little round balls of stevia (or maybe it was the inulin/fiber, who knows??) but I will definitely not buy it again.<br />I just want STEVIA. Why can't I find Stevia WITHOUT something added to it?? Especially when it's so expensive. I give up on the grocery and Amazon type markets and I'm going the whole food / organic supplement route this time.
