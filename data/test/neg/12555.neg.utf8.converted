I'm a big fan/drinker of Green Tea and a big fan/drinker of Earl Grey, but this tea is a little too Bergamot-y for my taste. It may be because plain green tea naturally has a weaker taste than black tea, and the Bergamot is therefore more evident.<br /><br />After a couple cups of this I decided these two tastes are best on their own.
