I thought I was getting 30 bars of regular size bars shown. However 10 of the bars are mini bite bars. Didn't realize that or I wouldn't have ordered them. This is the description: Contains: 8 Chunky Peanut Butter; 6 Chocolate Fudge; 6 Brownie Crunch; 5 Toffee Nut; & 5 Cookies & Cream. NOTICE it doesn't say different sizes or weights. MISLEADING! You have to really look at the box image to see the box is a mini byte but the bars shown are the regular size. MISLEADING!
