I read all the other reviews...I'm in the camp of the customers who think it tastes pretty terrible. Two days into a 3 lb. bag; not sure if I'm going to make it through this supply. I'll likely try the pea protein next.  I went through a bunch of the Vega Sport protein; awesome product but a bit pricey.
