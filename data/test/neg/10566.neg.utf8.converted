This is the brand I find most often in grocery stores where I live, if I can find it at all. It's a metal can with a soft plastic lid to seal it again once you've cracked it open. I don't know if it's just that the product doesn't move enough off the shelves to be fresh, or it is always like that, but the tahini is heavily separated between oil and paste, the paste ranging from tar to a brick at the bottom of the can. I usually have to chip out a piece of the paste to make hummus, and hope I don't splash the top layer of oil all over the place in the process. I recommend trying any other brand first. This one is for the desperate and out of luck.
