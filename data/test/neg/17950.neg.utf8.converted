I'm sorry, but I just have to be honest.  This chocolate has no flavor of bat in any way shape or form.  I did a review of the chocolate from the same company with the chimpanzee on the label, and noted no flavor of chimp in it.  I was forced to give it a one star review, but did try to be fair and say the chocolate itself, if it was sold as JUST chocolate was fine.  Now they continue this trend of such false labelling and have no bat flavor in this chocolate.  What gives?  Yes, as chocolate it's fine, much like the so called chimpanzee flavored bar I tried earlier this year, so consider this a four or five star review if the lack of bat flavor doesn't bother you.  But doesn't a chocolate bar with let's say raspberries on the label contain a raspberry extract, jelly or something else with raspberry flavor?  Why wouldn't one with a bat on the label contain no bat flavor?  I may try the other chocolates by this company, I'm curious to see if the one with the panther on the label does taste at least like some sort of cat, if not an actual panther.  But I am disappointed yet again by this company.  If you're going to claim to flavor your chocolate to taste like animals, include the animal flavor!
