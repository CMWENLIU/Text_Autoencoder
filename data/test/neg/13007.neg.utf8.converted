I love spicy sauces, knowing that I knew that taco bell and spicy arent words you put together. I still got this anyway. I love condiments, its a known fact, and if there is something new to try I will probably dip something into it. I used to be forced into Taco Bell food back in the darker days, and actually enjoyed the Baja Gordito with the orangish sauce..i suppose that was the Chipotle. It was the only redeeming tidbit to those visits.<br /><br />This sauce, is just plain nasty. It doesnt taste like jalapenos or sauce or tacos or bells, it tastes like a creamy plastic tangy mess. I suppose if you are drunk enough at 3 am and weave through the drive thru this stuff all over a soft taco would be heavenly, unfortunately I tasted it stone cold sober in my kitchen and I actually uttered the word "BLECH" ...I bleched and that is a bad sign.<br /><br />This is one bottle of sauce I will not dip into.
