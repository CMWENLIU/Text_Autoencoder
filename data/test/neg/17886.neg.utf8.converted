I was the recipient of the gift and it was a wonderfully thoughtful thing for the person to do for me since I like chocolate, but there was hardly anything in the basket.  How can the receiver tell the gift giver they are being deceived? The receiver MUST tell the gift giver how wonderful it is or risk being thought rude and ungrateful.  Since this comes through the mail as a gift, the giver would usually never see it.  This is set up as a rip-off situation. Don't order this!!!  The chocolates were nice but could be eaten in two small snack times -- and I'm a 130 lb woman, not a giant. One box had 3 small chocolates in it and another just 1. Not what you'd expect for $30 worth of chocolate.
