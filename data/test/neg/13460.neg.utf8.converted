So let me start off by saying that I am a HUGE fan of anything with marshmallows and/or mallow product of any kind. My boyfriend and I saw these and thought they sounded delicious, and they turned out to be a huge disappointment. The quality of the chocolate is terrible, I'm talking "Russel Stover" terrible: grainy, chalky, and hard. The "mallo" filling isn't too bad, but there isn't much of it, and the coconut is essentially non-existent. What you basically end up with is a mouth full of grainy, terrible chocolate flavor with sweet milky aftertaste from the wannabe marshmallow filling.<br /><br />If these things were more like Reeses Peanut Butter Cups with filling similar to the marshmallow in either Rocky Road candy bars or Hagen Dazz Rocky Road ice cream they would be awesome. And they should either have more coconut or none at all, because right now it only adds to the grainy texture without adding any flavor.<br /><br />Anyway, I seriously regret buying these- ESPECIALLY SINCE I LATER FOUND HUGE PACKS OF THEM AT THE DOLLAR TREE! -_-
