I purchased this from another source so that I could just buy 1 of this variety. The product tasted terrible. Glad I didn't buy it in bulk from Amazon......<br />This review goes for all her other varieties as well... since I tried and tasted them.... what a waste of time and money. I ended up eating something else with taste for the rest of my dinner because this was so bad....
