I ordered these steaks for a dinner party. I contacted the seller to let them know that my guests had more than enough negative comments on the steaks. They had said that they were inedible, that they were grainy and fatty. There was also a comment that they had shrunk considerably in size. We spent well over $300 for this product only to be extremely disappointed. We wound up throwing the half eaten steaks out.  When I contacted the seller, they could careless on what my guests had said. Couldnt care that we wound up throwing away over $300 in steaks and did not want to credit my account nor re-ship the product to satisfy a commitment.<br /><br />BUYERS BEWARE.....DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY.  VERY EXPENSIVE FOR POOR QUALITY.
