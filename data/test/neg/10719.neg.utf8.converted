When I saw this product at one of my favorite kitchen stores, I just had to try it out, especially since I love this coffee cake and the Barefoot Contessa show.  I figured it would be a great mix.  I was very disappointed after baking the product that the cake itself was very dry and the crust was very hard.  The flavor was there, but might need to add pudding to the mix or something else to add moisture to it.  For the price of $14.95 that I had paid, it's probably worth it to just buy one already made from a local bakery.  Definitely not worth the price paid.  Sorry, Ina!
