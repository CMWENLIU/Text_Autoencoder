Thanks to another reviewer, I learned today that Greenies contain a synthetic, controversial ingredient, menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB), that is highly questionable and considered by many experts to be toxic. I will no longer take that chance with my pet just because the FDA hasn't gotten around to banning it. Based upon the information I have read about it, the only apparent reason to add MSB to pet food is to claim it as a nutritious ingredient, namely, the k-vitamins that come from green plants. In other words, the basis of "Greenies" is a cheap synthetic version of the real thing. That must be why the ingredient label describes the stuff as "source of vitamin k activity."<br /><br />Furthermore, although my 3 year-old cat has been eating between 6-12 Greenies every day, he is currently in need of advanced dental work. I see no evidence that these so-called dental treats are effective and they may very well be harmful.
