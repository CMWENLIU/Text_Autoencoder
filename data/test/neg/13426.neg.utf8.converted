Have purchased this honey in the past. I does crystallize, which tells one this ( IN MY OPINION ) isn't totally Tupelo Honey. Pure Tupelo Honey does not crystallize. I now purchase CERTIFIED TUPELO Honey. it is not that more expressive and is like night & day in Quality & Taste... Just finished a gallon and were no crystals even in the bottom of my container after setting almost a year. The one container of the above Honey I have left is now totally crystalized, and makes it nice to spread on toast.<br />THANK YOU<br />BOB
