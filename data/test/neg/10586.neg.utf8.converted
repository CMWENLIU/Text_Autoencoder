Please tell me in these hard economic times that good american people are not spending $26 for two loaves of bread? I don't care if it had "0" net carbs - the cost is insane. There are people living on the other side of this world making 0.26 cents a day. Our grandparents, great grandparents, etc. all ate WHITE bread, butter, pasta, dessert & did you ever notice in old photos nobody is fat? People worked hard back then. And we "bellyache" about doing 30 minutes of exercise a day! I'm guilty too & buy the healthier more expensive options but I'll spend my $26 to put gas in my car thank you very much.
