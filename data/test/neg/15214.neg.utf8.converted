Got 10 bottles from Vitacost about 3 months ago.  I mix it with the smoothie and give it to my son.  When I finished the first bottle and opened the second one, I found the juice was bad and tasted like vineger. I sent an email to Vitacost but I couldn't return them because it passed one month period.  I wouldn't know the juice is bad unless I open it.  I've had this juice for 2 years.  This is the second time the juice went bad.  The first time I got replacement but not this time.  You can also see the photos I uploaded.
