This soup was a monumental disappointment as not only an Amy product but soup and Thai cuisine as well.  Do NOT buy a case if you have never eaten it.  Try one can first if at all possible. The can says "Best by Sep 2012" but I believe it will take a lot longer than that to get to "best".  I had to eat something else to satisfy my hunger and I still have the aftertaste of the soup.  Or maybe it was the carrot that had all but disintegrated, it was very mushy.  I am surprised it had maintained its shape.  I was not about to try any other vegetable.  Others advise adding ingredients but more power to them.  I don't see how one can doctor this soup to edibility.  The instructions say heat and serve.  I say don't bother.
