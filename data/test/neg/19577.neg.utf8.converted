I have been looking for a good sweetner for a long, long time. Sugar is out, and after reading about all the research on the artificial substitutes, I was almost physically sick. Those little blue, pink and yellow packets we've been pouring into our drinks are highly toxic!!! It boils down to the fact that these products are made from wood alcohol. In other words, formaldehyde!<br />It causes a myriad of health problems, and could be a pre-cursor to alzheimers, according to medical lab researchers. Many people experience loss of memory, slow, fuzzy thinking, or fogginess. There are so many other troubling symptoms that I cannot even list them all.<br />This is why I tried "Just Like Sugar". I put one packet in my tea and couldn't tell any difference. I put 2 more in, and still couldn't tell it was sweet at all. I had the feeling I was going to stand there all day and pour it in and still nothing would change. I am stuck with 3 boxes now, but never fear I DID find something better called "TRUVIA". I found it at the grocery store and am very happy with it. It has the natural sweetner Stevia in it and is healthy for you. I have tried other sweetners with Stevia and was disappointed, but this one works! One packet is all you need. Forget Just Like Sugar. Try Truvia and stop searching! Don't wait another day!
