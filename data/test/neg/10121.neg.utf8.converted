The product picks up the poop and empties very well (have a large dog) but the plastic pull up handle always breaks between 3-6 months.  If the product would last longer it would be a great value for the $$$$.  Seems to me for very little money the product could vastly improve it's longevity.  This seems to be a wide spread problem, at some point nobody will be left willing to pay $12-$15 for a product with such a short useful life.  Good function, lousy longevity.
