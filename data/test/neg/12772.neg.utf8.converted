I was looking forward to these. The shipment got lost in the mail and arrived three weeks late, however, from inspecting the cookies inside they were not damaged at all. The cookies have a very VERY good gingery taste without any after-taste of chemistry. Organic as homemade, just as you want from Newman's Own. They are riddled with chunks of candied ginger, too, to amplify the flavor. Flavor is top notch.  A ginger-snap is supposed to be crispy... BUT... these are hard-cooked to dog-biscuit consistency, over-browned on the bottom and tooth-breaking solid. Would not purchase again, unless I run into a few in the bottom of the bag not so dark and hard.
