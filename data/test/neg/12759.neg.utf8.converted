I received this product and immediately noticed that the grading is off. The product I received seems to be a broken orange pekoe grade. It does not resemble the picture AT ALL (which does represent a TGFOP grade). All in all, I have found the tea to be pleasant tasting, not overly tannic, plenty of body. But I ordered and paid for a higher grade of tea. It's not acceptable to furnish an inferior grade of tea.
