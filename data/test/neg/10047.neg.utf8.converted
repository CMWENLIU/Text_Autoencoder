I've tried Natures Path other granola bars and have been delighted with them, and so I thought I'd give these a try. I really wish that I had tried one first (such as buy a single bar from a local store/health food shop), because If I had, there's no way I would have bought an entire box. Texture wise, these are ideal, soft, chewy and don't leave you covered in crumbs when you take a bite. However, these bars are sugar, sugar, sugar!! Okay, so it's not HFSC or refined white sugar, but it's every other kind of ....well...here's a list of ingredients: (brackets are mine).<br /><br />Granola<br />evaporated cane juice (sugar)<br />soy oil<br />tapioca syrup (sugar)<br />brown rice flour<br />pumpkin seeds<br />salt<br />invert cane syrup (sugar)<br />flaxseeds,<br />acacia gum<br />evaporated cane juice (sugar)<br />sea salt<br />spice, and finally<br />molasses (more sugar)<br /><br />As well as being super sickly sweet, these have an almost condensed milk aftertaste to them. I really don't have a problem with sweet as I do have a sweet tongue, but these are just sickly and leave both your mouth and fingers icky-sticky. The other thing that annoys me is that they make it clear on the packaging that these are Flax seed bars, but you'll have noticed in the list of ingredients that flax seeds come way down the list in terms of quantity. Before you order a six pack of six, I'd be inclined to try one bar first, and then decide whether these are to your liking or not.
