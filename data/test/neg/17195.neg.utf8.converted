Until recently, Nueske's was my favorite bacon. The perfectly sliced lean strips with their heavenly taste and aroma was always a winner on the breakfast table or as an ingredient in my other dishes. The last two orders I placed with Nueske's have been a huge dissapointment. Much of the smokey flavor was missing and the amount grease left over after frying was astounding; leaving me with hardly any meat. The company is now obviously purchasing inferior pork bellies and rushing the processing time. There are many other premium bacons on the market that are worth a premium price. I would suggest to my fellow bacon connaisseurs out there that you give one of these other companies a try and forget about Greaseke's
