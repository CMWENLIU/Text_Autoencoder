My husband thought this blend was okay, though not as good as the Breakfast Blend (he gives 3 stars).  I did not like it at all (1 star).  It left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth long after the coffee was gone.  I tried it both hot and iced, and experienced the same bitterness.  We tried making it weaker and stronger than suggested, brewed from different bags, alternated with the Breakfast Blend, and used fresh water - every pot tasted bitter to me and just okay to my husband.  Can't recommend.
