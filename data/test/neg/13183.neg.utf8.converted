I was very excited to find this product.  It is suppose to be the same yeast as in the "Rapid Rise" and the product for bread machines.  I used the exact amount for my recipe: a typical 1/4 ounce strip envelope equals 2 1/4 teaspoons.  The end result was a baked product that tasted foul.  I contacted Fleishmann's Company the next morning.  I was told that they would replace the two pounds of yeast I had purchased with a (three envelope strip with a total of 3/4 ounces).  When I pointed out that this did not seem reasonable, they said they would replace the two pounds of Fleishmann's yeast with a coupon for a 4-oz glass jar, and pointed out that I had complained about another product from their company in the past.  I was further told that I would not have any future defective products compensated for.  (?)  This is not a company that stands behind their products, and apparently they are not committed to a reasonable level of quality control.
