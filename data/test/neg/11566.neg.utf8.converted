This doesn't need to be a long review. I was intrigued by the concept of this mixer, especially since I love natural peanut butter but hate the stirring. I suspect that if I could find a brand that used a jar of the correct diameter I'd be in love with this thing. But that's asking a lot of me as a consumer.
