Unquestionably the worst salsa I have ever tried.  Bad doesn't even begin to explain this salsa.  I can stomach bad salsa, though I may not enjoy it.  This salsa literally triggers a gag reflex as I try to eat it.  I tried one or two bites on three separate occasions and have decided to throw out the rest.<br /><br />Maybe the shipping wasn't kind to my salsa, I can't say.  I suspect that one or more of the ingredients is rancid in the salsa I received.  Either way, I will not be buying this brand again.
