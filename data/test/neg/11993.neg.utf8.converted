Ok, I probably should have known better. I heard on tv that most Americans that try this stuff hate it. So I had to get a small jar to find out. Well, guess what SURPRISE, I hated it. I like real limburger cheese, I mean the really stinky stuff but couldn't stand this. One bite and I thought I was eating old gym socks wrapped in spoiled meat that had  been left in the sun in plastic for weeks. Don't get me wrong for ppl that like this stuff. More power to you. But if you're an American or even European my guess is you'll hate this stuff too.
