I read the reviews before buying this cereal thinking it would be somewhat decent. But it's lacking one essential thing: flavor. I give this product 2 stars only because of the nutritional value.  I'm so glad I only bought one box from a local grocery store instead of buying the 4 pack here, as I am already having a tough time finishing off the  one box by itself!
