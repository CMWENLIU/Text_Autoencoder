I had tried this years ago and it was okay. It has improved somewhat, but not much. It is still lumpy when mixed. I used an electric hand mixer to blend this and it still came out lumpy. I used lukewarm water with the mixer and it was still lumpy. The flavor was also a little bland. I prefer pre-made rice milk. This will do in a pinch for baking or cooking, but I will not be using it for anything else. Blech.
