If you want everything to taste like very strong almond, with a green color, then buy this.  If you are looking for something that tastes like pistachio, keep looking.  Since you can not return this, make sure that you really want almond flavor in a different nut base, otherwise you might be disappointed.  Yes, it does have a puddle of oil on top, but that can easily be stirred in, like old fashioned peanut butter.  The almond flavor is not something that you can do anything about.
