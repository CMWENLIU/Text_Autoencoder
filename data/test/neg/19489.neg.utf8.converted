I give the Kong Incline Cat Scratcher two stars because our four kitties do like the incline and the scratching pad.  However, the overall unit is lightweight and flimsy.  The toy in the base intrigued them but unfortunately it's not a furry mouse as shown in the picture, but instead is (was) just a paper pom-pom.  Our smallest kitty had the toy in shreds by the end of the second day.  The base of the Kong scratcher is cardboard and the unit moves at the slightest touch, so you need to add extra weight in order to use it.  We bought the Bergan Turbo Cat Scratcher at the same time, and I'd recommend it over the Kong.  The Bergan model has a similar scratching mat and a heavy plastic base that stays in place.  And our kitties love pushing the ball around the track on the Bergan.  Overall, at around $12.00, the Bergan is more expensive but promises to last much longer.<br /><br />Update on 9/07/10:  Be aware that the refills that Amazon sells to accompany this Kong cat scratcher are too big for the base.  The only way to use them is to cut them down, which is a pretty messy process.  Meanwhile, our Bergan is still going strong.  (Their refills do fit their base.)
