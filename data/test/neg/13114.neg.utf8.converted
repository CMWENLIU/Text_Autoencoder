I love Manuka Honey and use it for many purposes. I was on vacation last week and forgot to bring my jar of ApiHealth Active Manuka Honey with me. So I went onto Amazon from my iPhone and found one that I could have shipped quickly on my Amazon Prime account - which was the "Manuka Health New Zealand Active MGO 550+".  The price at $55 is the going rate (albeit expensive) so I didn't give that a thought when I ordered it....but...what I didn't notice is that it's only 250 grams and the high quality active Manuka honey for which the going rate is $55 is for 500 grams!!!  So, for a product that is already too expensive, they're selling HALF THE SIZE for the same price, making it OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE.  In addition, when I got home, I checked on the AMHA (Active Manuka Honey Assoc) web site and Manuka Health New Zealand is not a licensee. Nor do they use the UMF standard, therefore, there is no way to verify the quality or the true Activity Level of the Manuka Honey in the jar.<br /><br />It tastes fine but it does not have the delicious taste of ApiHealth or Watson and Son or Spirits Bay, all of which are excellent.  This one is obviously Manuka, but there is also a bit of the taste of regular honey, which is an entirely different flavor.<br /><br />If this jar were the standard size of 500g, at this pricing level, it would have cost $110!!!! Don't get me wrong, they didn't lie - the site specifically says 250g - but without the other jar in front of me, that size didn't mean anything to me and given that the price is the same as what others charge for twice as much, it never occurred to me when I ordered it that this was such a rip off.
