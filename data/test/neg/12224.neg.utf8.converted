I don't think it's my imagination or just two bad bags; Peak Protein has been changed.  I bought 2 bags from 2 different stores and there was almost no fruit in the granola.  My daughter has always wanted the cranberries from my granola because they were better than ones I could buy separately.  First the cranberries changed to not as good quality and then in the bags I bought around June or July the fruit almost entirely disappeared.  There were about 6 cranberries in the entire bag!<br /><br />I miss the real Peak Protein.  No other granola for sale is as good.  I've started making my own granola because I wanted something as good as Peak Protein used to be.  Turns out it's not that hard -- not to mention far less expensive.
