I was extremely disappointed with this product and here's why:<br />A dog's natural diet is meat and greens, and maybe a tiny<br />amount of fruit. The main ingredient in this dog food is<br />corn meal. (There are also wheat and rice flour in this<br />product.) It also contains sugar (!) and 4 different<br />artificial colors (!!!!). Who is the color for? Do dogs<br />care about color? No! Shame on you, Purina - this is not a<br />"natural food" for a dog.
