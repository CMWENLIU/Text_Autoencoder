This tea is okay but not what I had hoped for.  Seems as though low quality tea leaves were used as there is a definite lack of depth to the flavor.  If left to steep for a much longer time than normal, flavor develops, but it is not what I've had with other brands.  I wouldn't really recommend this brand if you love this type of tea.
