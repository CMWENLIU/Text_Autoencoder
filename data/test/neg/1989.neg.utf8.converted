What a surprise when I only received 3 bars total!  The seller blamed it on Amazon putting in the wrong information.  The ad was marked as sold out for a few days.  Yesterday I was checking and the same ad was back on.  When I contacted the seller they again blamed Amazon.  They were again offering a pack of 12 for $[...].  Today they have changed it to a pack of 12 for $[...].  I will be keeping a close eye on them and hope you do too!  An honest seller would have checked their listing and honored their ad. They are saying that Amazon confused thier listing with other sellers of this same product.  They are the only ones selling Lindt Excellence Dark Chocolate 70-Percent Cocoa Bars, 3.5-Ounce Bars (Park of 12).  How could Amazon have gotten this confused! The seller should always check their listing.
