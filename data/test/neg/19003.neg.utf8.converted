OK, so please do not consider this a negative review of Davidson's Tea in general.  I guess tea is like anything else, there are some who will like a particular tea and some who won't.  As you can see, there are other reviewers who like this tea a lot.  Another reviewer hit it right on the head, "smells like grass".  It does in fact smell like grass.  I don't want that.  I am ignorant of what a green tea should taste like and I am sure this is the proper smell and taste for this tea and that as green rooibos goes it will be better than other because Davidson's teas usually are, but like my dad told me about Gin-and-Tonics when I was a we one who snuck a sip while he pretended not to be looking, "it is an aquired taste son".<br /><br />I give it 1 star because I personnaly don't like it, not because it is wrong in how it tastes or smells.<br /><br />Hail Flavius!
