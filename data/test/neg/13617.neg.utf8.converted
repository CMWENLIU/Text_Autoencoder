I bought this 2 pack of Nestle Dark Chocolate cocoa packets for the office.  Unfortunately, even with sugar as ingredient #1 and high fructose corn syrup as ingredient #2, Nestle thought it essential to add sucralose (a sugar substitute, Splenda equivalent) as a final ingredient. That makes for a nasty, saccharin-y, hypersweet and artificial aftertaste.  Nasty.  Guess I will have to go back to Costco for Milk Chocolate Swiss Miss.  Adios, Nestle.
