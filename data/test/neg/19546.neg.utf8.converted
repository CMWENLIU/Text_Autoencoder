For the record, my review is not about the taste of Vegemite, I understand that it is an acquired taste. "like it or not". My complaint is about the price of this product in particular, 99$. Who in the right mind would pay 99$ for this! There better be gold shavings, ambrosia, and ground Rhino horns in this 99$ jar of Vegemite. To top it off, there is a deal to get four 150g jars of Vegemite for $38 on Amazon from the same seller of the same exact product and brand. Hmm. . . 600g for 38$, 1800g for 115$ or 400g for 99$? Seriously though, what the heck is with this pricing Kraft?<br /><br />I may be wrong for assuming this, but the other reviews I have read for this product are for Vegemite in general, which does deserve 4~5 stars. This particular product however deserves a 1 and for good reasons.
