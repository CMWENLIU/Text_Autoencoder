If you all want a tasty, light, crispy wheat free cracker I recommend KOYO brand organic rice crackers.  They have a few flavors like garlic and I think teriyaki (though I can't find that one lately).  These mary's things taste like card board and sand.  Who would review these so highly?  Maybe they like the flavor of cardboard and sand.  I myself like a light, crispy, more flavorful cracker.  I like teh KOYO but I am getting bored of just that one brand so I keep looking for more organic wheat free crackers but when my husband and I tried the "Mary's" we both almost threw up.  I instantly threw the whole box in the garbage.  Also the KOYO are sturdy enough for dipping too.
