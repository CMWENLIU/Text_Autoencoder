I was not happy with the product at all.  The sticks are all varying lengths, some as short as 3 inches, some as long as 8 inches.  Also, they are a wide range of thickness.  Some are smaller than a pencil and others are huge!<br /><br />Alot of them have knots in them which are hard for the dogs to chew. Quite a few of them also have curved ends on them which also make it hard for the dogs to chew.<br /><br />They are not at all the quality of the sticks you can buy in the stores.<br /><br />They may be okay for large dogs, but I have dogs in the 10-12 lb range and they are having a hard time with them.
