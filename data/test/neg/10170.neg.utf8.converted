I am very, very unhappy with Knorr, which I have always thought made great products. The online Amazon product description states that there is no MSG other than that which occurs naturally in the hydrolyzed protein and autolyzed yeast extract used in creating the soup base.  I never buy products that list MSG as an ingredient, but the idea that it was simply a naturally occurring  component in the yeast and protein used seemed innocent enough.<br /><br />When the package arrived from Amazon I simply put the containers on the shelf ready to use because I had read the ingredient list on Amazon before purchasing the product.  The first time I pulled a canister out to use I scanned the ingredients again and was shocked to find that listed right after the first ingredient-salt-was MSG.  While there was a disclaimer in the Amazon ad by Knorr it seems dishonest to me for them to minimize the presence of MSG in that ad and then list it as the second ingredient on the canister itself.  Many people react to MSG, sometimes quite frighteningly (facial and tongue swelling, rashes, etc.)  Restaurants are generally quick to let customers know if they use MSG. Many no longer use it to enhance the flavor of food.  I never add MSG to any  food I prepare.<br /><br />Knorr has lost a customer.  I will never recommend their products to anyone again.  I am also writing a strong complaint to the company.  I hope others will do the same if they, too, feel that Knorr misrepresented their product.<br /><br />Just another reminder that advertising can be dangerously misleading.  This was an expensive lesson for me as both cans are being disposed of in the garbage.
