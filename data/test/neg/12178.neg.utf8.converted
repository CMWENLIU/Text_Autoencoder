These snacks are fairly priced at $0.89. BUT the shipping cost is horrendous! $4.62?!<br /><br />Now, back to the review of the actual product, I love the strawberry one. Chocolate not so much, there's also a vanilla one but they both can't come close to the sweet flavor of strawberry. Damn.. Makes me wanna go to Ranch 99 now lol.
