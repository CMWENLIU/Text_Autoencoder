I wasn't expecting much from a Taco Bell product, but I was at least expecting something edible, with a little heat, that I could offer as a sauce for tacos.  A pretty low bar, right?  But this 'Jalapeno' Sauce doesn't even meet that criteria.<br /><br />First of all: "Bold & Creamy"?  I guess it's creamy, in a gag-inducing way, but there is no bold there.  Perhaps someone passed a jalapeno over the bottle as a flavoring. Maybe.  There is no heat, no kick at all.  Which would be fine; some people don't like kick.  Except they named it Bold & Creamy Jalapeno Sauce.  So....yeah.<br /><br />Even if you accept that this is a mild sauce, it's still gross.  There is buttermilk in it, which gives it a tang, but soybean oil & water are the first two ingredients (of more than 25).  The whole thing just tastes really chemical-y and fake and bad.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  I have teenage boys.  Who run cross country.  They're hungry at dinnertime, and not what you'd call discerning.  And even they wouldn't eat this stuff.
