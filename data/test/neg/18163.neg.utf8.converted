I have many problems with this product. First, the packaging was not airtight. Who knows how long it has been sitting in the warehouse for? Second, the label said nothing about being organic, so how do I know that the description on Amazon is accurate? Third, the tea does not even taste like Longjing Tea. This leads me to believe that this is an imitation and not true Longjing. It doesn't even taste good at all. Do not buy this product!
