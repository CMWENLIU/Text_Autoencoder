This the worst honey I have ever tasted. It does not taste like honey at all; I would know because I am  an Ohio bee raiser. This stuff taste like cough syrup. When I try to get my family to eat it, they all agreed that this stuff was uneatable.In addition, when I tried to get my refund, Amazon refused to do it.  Please don't buy this product. It is terrible, and Amazon will not do anything about. I lost $21 yesterday; please, I do not want you to go through the same thing.<br /><br />Surata
