Seriously, folks...I got a better deal at Bed Bath & Beyond: A *60-cup* variety pack (5 k-cups each of 12 different kinds) for $34.99 not counting tax. Really, go out and look a bit more and you'll find better deals. And for what it's worth I hate Emeril but even I like the "Big Easy" blend that's included in the 60-cup pack.
