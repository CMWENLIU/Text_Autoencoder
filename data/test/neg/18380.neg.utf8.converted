Sorry to say, but need to warn others that this tea is tasteless, like it wasn't properly made.  It is so bad that we can't drink it, tastes like tea colored water without the tea flavor.  We have drunk Oolong for years and enjoyed all other brands of Oolong, so this was a terrible disappointment.  Wish we could return it as it was about $20 wasted on this 16 oz bag.
