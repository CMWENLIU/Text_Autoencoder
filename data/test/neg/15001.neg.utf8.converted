I'll give Kraft credit where it's due. I think short of growning up in an Italian household, most of us only know parmesan cheese thanks to Kraft. In terms of availability and convenience, Kraft has "all" the others beat. And for the vast majority of North Americans, if you know no better, Kraft is better than fine.<br /><br />However, if you are willing to forego a little convenience and challenge your tastebuds a little, try buying an inexpensive rotary cheese grater ($5 - $10) and some fresh properly aged parmesan and grate your own. The rewards of the extra effort will be immediate. You won't believe that the two (Kraft and fresh) are even the same category of cheese.<br /><br />Compared to it's alternative, Kraft Parmesan is expensive, flavourless and just plain lousy. But it will always have a place where convenience matters most.
