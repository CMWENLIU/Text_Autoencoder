I was going to purchase this until I saw that it has Soy Lecithin in it. Soy is estrogenic and Soy Lecithin in particular is like the crap they scrape off the floor. They pump it into everything and is NOT good for you. Why is it so hard to find food without this crap in it? Especially in food that is supposed to be good for you because it is organic!
