The problem here is that the lemon packets just are not strong at all!!!  While I love the concept, I have to pour at least two to three packets in the water to get some sort of kick.  I think I will stick to buying either lemons or a bottle of lemon juice from here on out...as that is much more potent and tasty!!!
