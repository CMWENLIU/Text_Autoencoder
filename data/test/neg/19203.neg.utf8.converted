This product has two types of hydrogenated oil, artificial colors, and two types of MSG (MSG and hydrolyzed yeast extract). The company can be difficult to deal with- no notification if your shipment is delayed due to unavailable ingredients for example. It took several attempts via e-mail and phone calls to get anyone to answer why the order had not even shipped after the estimated delivery date. The shipping is outrageously high for the weight as well. Not what I have come to expect from an Amazon related company.
