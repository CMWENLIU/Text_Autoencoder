My brother uses Pro Flowers repeatedly for birthdays, Xmas, Mom's Day.  *All* the flowers we've recieved are skimpy, wilted and die in a day.  My bonsai arrived all broken.  The replacement arrived all broken too.<br /><br />My mom won't tell my bro his flowers suck and are a waste of money, but I will.<br /><br />Save your money.  Grocery store flowers are better than their's.  Use family owned small businesses.<br /><br />I won't use them again.
