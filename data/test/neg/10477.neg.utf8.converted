I have trouble finding plain white tea in my area, so I tried this Lipton, Mango & Peach flavor.  The name sounds good, the aroma was enticingly delicious & made me look forward to my first sip. Boy was I shocked! The flavor was awful. I can't explain if for you; I just don't like it. I'm using it up anyway because my motto is, "Waste not, want not."  If you think you might like this tea...everyone's taste is different...I suggest that you try a small box first.
