I purchased this same product from Costco recently. The taste was alright; nothing particularly special, probably a solid three stars. I felt it was a little heavy on the dried plums (that's what we call prunes now, thanks to the boys in marketing for that one), but otherwise it was a respectable mix of fruit. My problems with this product began when I looked more closely at the ingredients.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients, directly from the package:<br /><br />California Pitted Dried Plums, Dried Mediterranean Apricots (Product of Turkey), Dried California Peaches, Dried Pears (Product of USA or Argentina), Dried Apricots (Product of USA or Argentina), Dried Apples (Products of Chile, China or Argentina), Medium Chain Triglycerides (from coconut and/or palm kernel)* and Natural Flavoring. Sulfur Dioxide and/or Sodium Bisulfate and/or Potassium Sorbate added as preservatives.<br /><br />* Adds a trivial amount of fat.<br /><br />I have two main issues with this:<br /><br />1. The apples are not from the United States. To be clear, I don't have a problem with imported fruit; it offers consumers year-round availability of things that otherwise might only be available for a couple months. But why are we importing apples into the U.S.? Don't we grow, like, a bazillion of these things every year? And from China no less? If I visited China, it would be risky for me to eat the fruit... is it somehow okay when it's dried out and sold here?<br /><br />2. There's fat added to fruit. Sure, it's a "trivial" amount, but why is this even happening at all? It's fruit, it doesn't need fat added to it, especially in triglyceride form.<br /><br />Now, neither of these issues are the end of the world... but I feel like I can do better. I noticed the availability of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAUKP4">Mariani Mixed Fruit</a>, made by the same company, but without Chinese apples or triglycerides listed among the ingredients. Do they have two lines of the same product? I'll probably just stick with getting my dried fruit at Trader Joe's... their stuff is pretty reliable.
