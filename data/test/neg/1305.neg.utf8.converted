WHEN WE TASTED THIS HONEY WE WERE QUITE DISAPPOINTED.<br /><br />IT IS HONEY BUT WITH  - NO -  FLAVOR OF CLOVER.<br /><br />TASTES LIKE MIXED WILD FLOWERS - OK BUT NOT CLOVER.<br /><br />I  HAVE BEEN EATING CLOVER HONEY FOR 50 YEARS AND THIS IS NOT IT.<br /><br />SAD THAT THE SELLER IS CHEATING FOLKS WITH THIS  " CLOVER "  HONEY.<br /><br />LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR REAL CLOVER HONEY - DON'T TRUST ANNA'S HONEY.
