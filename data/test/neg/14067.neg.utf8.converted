The product labeling in my mind is a little deceptive considering these crackers contain a forum of MSG. MSG's most active ingredient is free glutamate. Free glutamate is the active ingredient of mono-sodium glutamate, or MSG. Yeast Extract contains free glutamate. In my opinion, the only reason this company is using the term "Yeast Extract" is to conceal the fact that this products contains MSG.
