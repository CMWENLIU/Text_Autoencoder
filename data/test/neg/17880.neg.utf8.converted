If you really want berries in your muffins, go elsewhere! It's hard to see from the small picture on amazon, but this "triple berry" mix has only "imitation berries" -- i.e. collections of chemicals/food coloring to make them look like blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries. Yuck! If you really want "triple berry" muffins, try a plain blueberry muffin mix with REAL blueberries and add your own fresh blackberries and raspberries. Now THAT'S yummy!<br /><br />P.S. Guess I sounded overly snotty as I have only 1 helpful review out of 5!  Can't figure out why the other 4 people didn't find the review useful -- if I were thinking of buying something called a "triple berry muffin mix" I would want to know if it really had any berries in it.  This mix doesn't!  Now come on, isn't that helpful to know?  :-)
