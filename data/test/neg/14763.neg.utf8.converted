These are great little cups of soup to throw in your bag for work and have for lunch.  However, everytime I have ordered from Amazon, one has become damaged during transit and spilled all over the rest during shipment.  I contacted Customer Service and they sent me another set, but the same thing happened!  Should probably just wait for them to go on sale at the grocery store!
