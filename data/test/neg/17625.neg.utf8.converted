Vitality is owned by an American Company. Their Chicken Breast Jerky is MADE IN CHINA - They tout the fact: Cage Free Chicken.  Well,based on little if any Chinese restrictions in China I can imagine what these "Cage Free" chickens walk around in and eat.<br /><br />Our dog, a 16 pound 4 year old Cockapoo was extremely active prior to feeding this product to him.  After a couple of weeks we noticed a change. He's now acting very strange, fearful, anxious and no longer the fireball he was.  Vitality should print "MADE IN CHINA" in the same large size font as the Cage Free Chicken logo on the front of their package.<br /><br />Was it the Chinese chicken that changed him?  We don't know.  We do know that we will not buy any product that is sold from Arthur Dogswell LLC, Los Angeles Ca. again.  "BUY AMERICAN PRODUCTS THAT ARE MADE IN THE USA" !!!!
