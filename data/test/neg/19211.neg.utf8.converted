I was given a referral to try this dog food from someone else who owns a French Bulldog and it turns out mine hates it. I have to say, it does look really gross also. The green color when you add water is weird and I wouldn't want to eat that either. My Frenchie is picky so it might work well for other dogs, but i would try raw meat before this. I mean actual meat that humans would eat, stew meat, chicken, ground beef or turkey with veggies. My dog loves it!
