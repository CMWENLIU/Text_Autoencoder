Yesterday I reviewed the "Mixed Berry" flavor (which has no berries, just cherries and raspberry juice), and I found it to be stale. I was hoping that maybe I just got a bad batch, but this batch of "Rich Cocoa" bars is also stale. Not quite as stale as the so-called "Mixed Berry", but stale none the less.<br /><br />But what's worse is it had no flavor, either. I've had paper with vegetable-based ink that had more flavor than this bar!<br /><br />I really don't think that I'm going to be eating the remainder of either box. I have better high-fiber granola bars in my cupboard already, and I'm just going to buy more of them. I'm going to check to see if there is anything in these that birds and other wildlife shouldn't have, and if they clear that test, I'll periodically put one out for them.<br /><br />These bars are incredibly disappointing.
