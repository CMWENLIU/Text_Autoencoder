I won the Beaba from a blog giveaway, but I don't think I would ever spend the money to buy one.  I only used mine about a dozen times before passing it on to a friend.<br /><br />It did everything it was advertised to do.  I don't think it saves on time and effort, though.  You still have to clean, peel, and cut your fruits or veggies into chunks, so no time saved there.  If anything it takes MORE time to prepare baby food with the Beaba simply because it has such a small capacity.  You can put about a cup to a cup and a half of chopped raw food in the steamer, which seems like a good amount of food.  However, by the time you steam and puree your food, you end up with only about half a cup of baby food, maybe a bit more.<br /><br />Let's say you're going to make some sweet potatoes.  Always a great food to start babies on because it's mild and sweet and can be pureed really smooth and creamy.  The Beaba can only cook about half of an average sweet potato at a time.  I can cook four LARGE sweet potatoes and puree them in my 7-cup food processor all at once.  With the Beaba, start to finish, from peeling to chopping to steaming to blending to cooling, you're looking at around 30 to 45 minutes before you can feed your baby.  Also, food coming out of the Beaba is EXTREMELY hot, rightly so, but you can't feed a baby food that hot so you have to let it cool, which just adds to your food prep time.<br /><br />Anyone who is serious about making most or all of their own baby food is going to want to make baby food in BULK.  Most busy moms don't have time to waste on a product like the Beaba that makes such a small amount of food at a time.  Just one hour  in the kitchen on Sunday and I had enough baby food to last all week, if not longer.  I have a KitchenAid 7-cup food processor which I found on sale at BB&B for around sixty bucks.  I would steam my veggies and fruits on the stove or even in the microwave, then puree them quickly in the food processor, usually making about 4 cups of baby food at a time.<br /><br />Also, one pot, one steamer basket, and one food processor was MUCH easier to clean than the Beaba.  The Beaba streamer basket was stained orange the first time I used it and I didn't care for all the little parts and pieces I needed to clean on the Beaba.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on fancy or expensive baby food storage containers.  Gladware makes small 4-ounce containers.  I believe a pack of 8 is under 3 bucks.  I would fill about a dozen of these at a time with 3 or 4 different foods and pop them in the freezer.  Each night before I went to bed, I would pull a couple of containers out of the freezer and stick them in the fridge for the next day.  Come mealtime, it was fast and easy to scoop out what I needed and warm it up in the microwave.<br /><br />After several months of freezing and heating the little blue lids of the Gladware containers would crack, but they're so affordable that I didn't mind tossing some in the recycling bin and buying another set.
