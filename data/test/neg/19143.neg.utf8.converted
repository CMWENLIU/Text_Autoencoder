Ok. So i ordered this cheese set for Christmas. The packaging was very good, and I didnt even need to wrap it. We opened the cheeses and none of them were the cheese that were advertised, ok well they did say that they may substitute them. They were still similiar to what they had advertised. Once we opened them we were surprised to find that 3 of the 4 smelled horendous. Once again some cheeses will, we'll try and get past it. One cheese was so bad however that we almost got sick. I dont plan on buying this again for the price and what I got. If you like smelly cheese than you may like this. I cant say it was all bad, but not what I was expecting.
