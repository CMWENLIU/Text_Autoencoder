It does not work as expected.  Just after served three glasses of wine I noticed the splatter all over the table.  the wine would also dripped from the two holes on each side of the aerator along the arm holding the aerator all the way down to the bottom of the base.  I can deal with the wine dripped from the aerator but not the splatter since it will ruin your beautiful table cloth unless you place it on the kitchen counter.  It would be messy even on the kitchen counter.  This "Deluxe" package looks elegant when first set up, but it looks messy just after served three glasses of wine.  I will be returning this to Amazon for a refund.
