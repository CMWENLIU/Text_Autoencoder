I was put on a waiting list when I purchased these nuts so when they arrived I was a little concerned about the expiration date of Sept 2012 on the bags.  After opening and chewing a couple I was really concerned about the freshness since they tasted a little dried out.  I called Diamond Nuts and inquired about how long nuts are good for after they're packaged.  I was told by their company rep that nuts are good for two years after packaging so that meant I was sent bags that were 1 year and 7 months old.  Now how do you get put on a waiting list for a product and then receive old , almost out of date product?  I'll tell you how, companies think if you're from West Virginia then you have an under 50 IQ and they can send out of date items, factory seconds and merchandise that had been in the recycle or junk bin straight to West Virginia and us dumb-ass hillbillies won't know the difference.  I have no problem with Amazon because they made it right by issuing me a refund.  A word to the wise, always check the expiration date on any thing you buy.
