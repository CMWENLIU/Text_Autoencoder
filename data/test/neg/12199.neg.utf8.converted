I have been buying Sweet Potato and Yam treats for my 3 dogs for the past year or two. My dogs love them so we make sure we always have a good supply on hand. I purchased these particular treats from this particular supplier because the price was a bit less than usual. However, they are so HARD that even my big dog has a hard time chewing them!! And my older small dog will not even try to chew them, though they are his favorite treat. This is the second time I ordered this product from this supplier and both orders were the same, the treats are too hard for the dogs to chew!! I ordered a second time hoping I just got a bad batch from them or something. However, both orders were the same, too hard for the dogs to chew!! I don't know if they have been allowed to sit around and get old and hard, or what. All I do know for sure is that I will not be ordering any more items from this supplier!! It's not cheap if you have to throw it away in the end!!
