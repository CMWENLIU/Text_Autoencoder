Whow!  I was going to buy a couple of these boxes for my mother because she has SEVERE lactose intolerence and there are very few things that she can eat, until I saw that these wonderful bars have been raised almost $9.00 a box?????????  Whow, definitely NO SALE here!  Why is it that people are really starting to jump up prices on Amazon so high! Go to Liberty Orchard direct, they are less there.<br />TOO BAD!  Very disappointed.
