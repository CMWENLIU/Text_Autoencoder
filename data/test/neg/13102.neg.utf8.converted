The page fails to mention the fact that this Flea spray contains a pesticide in addition to the Growth Inhibitor. It's not safe for use if you have young animals or children running around. This should have been mentioned on the page, instead I had to wait til I received the product to find out. At a $10 nonrefundable shipping price and no reimbursement for costs to send it back, it costs more to try to return it than to just keep it.
