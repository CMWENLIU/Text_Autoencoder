My 2 Turkish Van kitties usually eat Wellness Core w/ no grain, but when they were due for a new bag Amazon was out of stock and I would have had to pay shipping, not to mention wait much longer to receive it, so I looked for something similar as a substitute.<br /><br />Long story short, my cats hate this food... even the female.  They barely touch their bowls and would rather go hungry than eat it.  I've been mixing it in with some wet food that I have so they'll acquire a taste for it.  As many cat lovers know, Vans are very vocal.  So they've been whining and crying about the food even with full dishes.  Essentially indicating, "We want our old food back!"<br /><br />I will be sticking to Wellness Core.  I do not recommend it to owners with picky kitties.
