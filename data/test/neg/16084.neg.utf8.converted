I was along on a camping trip with my sons scout troop when someone brought along a half dozen or so of this vegetable blend.  It was very convenient since it required no refrigeration, plus it was surprisingly flavorful for a dry blend when made into a soup or stew.  Unfortunately I have to go along with the other reviewer here when he calls it a major rip off.  Even for an average size soup that is about 2 quarts, two bags of this 4 oz size would be needed.  That makes it far more expensive than it is worth when you can add canned vegetables at 10 oz. (minus the water) for about a dollar a shot. At the same time I cannot honestly put down all of the Barry Farm products, thus the extra star I added.  I have bought and used several other dry products from Barry Farms including their bouillon and powdered eggs and have been very satisfied with them, both price and product wise. Unfortunately as for this particular veggie blend, I cannot recommend it despite its fairly decent taste.  Way too expensive. Even if bought at a case at a time...
