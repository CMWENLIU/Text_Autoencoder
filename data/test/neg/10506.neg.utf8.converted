When i received my rabbit, i was impressed at the likeness to a real rabbit, but after closer inspection was disappointed with the lack of features. First of all, the 2 AA batteries were not included, and considering the price i payed for my rabbit i would have expected a pair. The mobility options are very limited, being able to move only by holding the rabbit and moving it around in a rabbit-like manner. The noise capabilities are non-existent, no sound was heard even after poking quite hard.<br /><br />All in all i was not impressed with this fresh whole rabbit, in the end all i could do with it was cook it and eat it.
