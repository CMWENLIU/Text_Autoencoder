I used to buy the old version (silver box). My whole family loved it. It was the best affordable European Style cocoa powder on the market. I used it for everything, from hot cocoa, brownies and birthday cake fillings to chocolate mousse and truffles. It was rich, smooth and had a wonderful chocolate flavor. It was great!!!<br /><br />This year, before Easter, I run out of cocoa. I went to different stores trying to find my favorite cocoa - Hershey's European Style. I couldn't find it! I called Hershey's to see if I could order some and I was told they don't make it anymore, the updated version is the special dark. I bought it but I promise not to make this mistake ever again! It is black, without any flavor, and very unpleasant. If this is Hershey's specialists idea of "European Style - Dutch Processed Cocoa" they are wrong! Maybe they need a trip to Holland to drink some good dark cocoa and attend some training!
