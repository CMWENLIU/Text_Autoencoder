I just got my order of 2- 1.5lbs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LCAJKO">Beef Oxtail - 1.5 lbs.</a>packages of oxtail sent by fedex. Problem is that the meat was not frozen like it should be when being shipped from one location to the next and the frozen packs that are suppose to keep the meat cold were completely defrozen. The meat was not even cool to the touch. If I had been gone for the day that meat would have been outside all day and would be rotten. Cosidering what I paid for that is completely unacceptable not to mention disgusting. I put this meat in my freezer immediately but this meat should have been frozen in the first place. I really don't think I will eat it. Buyer please beware!
