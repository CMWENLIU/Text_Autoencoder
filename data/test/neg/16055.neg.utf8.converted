I won't pretend to be an expert on olive oils;  but I will attest to being a family cook and consumer of olive oils and this one did not strike me as quite what I was expecting. The first whiff gives a hint of stale and when blind-taste-tested in my home kitchen by my husband, my ten year old and me- dipping crusty sourdough bread-straight-up, no herbs, no garlic no other flavors- 2 out of 3 of us selected the OTHER first-cold-pressed, Virgin Olive Oil from Italy;  we were trying to buy more American stuffs but will stick with our imported Italian olive oils for now. OK,  for me, this one is fine for sauteeing- just not the best fresh flavor for dipping or dressings. In case it it matters substantially-  the bottle indicates: 'Harvested  Fall '07 and Bottled 6-21-08'
