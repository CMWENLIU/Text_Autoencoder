I ordered a dozen strawberries hoping for a tasty treat to share on valentines day.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when instead I received a dozen multicolored roses and small box of 5 chocolates. This is the second item I ordered and received today that was not what I ordered.<br /><br />THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!! EPIC FAIL!!!
