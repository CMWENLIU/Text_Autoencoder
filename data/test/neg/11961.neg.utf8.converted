These are sugar-free and definitely taste like it--BITTER as heck, with no sweetness to balance it out.  Bought a couple boxes--different flavors--at a health food store and ended up throwing them away because they tasted so awful.  These might be for someone, but not for me; I recommend skipping these and buying Daprano & Co. LICORETTE Pastilles instead.
