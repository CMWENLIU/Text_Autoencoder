I see quite a few people saying how wonderful this tastes, but that was not my experience.  It tastes horrible and I have it away to someone else (she hasn't reported back if she liked it or not).  So....either some people truly like the taste of this or the cereal company has people writing positive reviews.  I've loved all Kellogg's cereals until this one.  Blech.
