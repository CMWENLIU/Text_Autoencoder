Just bought these today, opened the container, popped two in my mouth and gagged.<br /><br />I immediately looked to the ingredients label and shocked to discover a long list of seasonings including MSG.<br /><br />Plain almonds are delicious. Roasted almonds are even better, but Emerald almonds are the worst tasting almonds I've have ever had. They barely taste like almonds and even have a strange coating on them.<br /><br />Any positive reviews have to be from an Emerald employee, family member or someone Emerald bribed to write something good.
