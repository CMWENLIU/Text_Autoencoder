Well, the soup is very salty, way too salty. Sadly, all 12 cans I received from Amazon were so badly dented from having too much weight stacked on them until the cans crushed. This was clearly visable, yet Amazon shipped them like this anyway. There was no damage to the box they were shipped in.<br /><br />Just a waste of time for mediocre soup.  So far the other soup from them, had half the cans dented as well. Not a good sign.
