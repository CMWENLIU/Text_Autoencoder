I purchased this food because I have 6 cats, and they were throwing up a lot.  I went from Purina, to Purina One to Whiskas to Iams and I knew there was something bad in the food.  After buying Newman's the throwing up stopped.  GOOD NEWS!  Except they don't like the food. I had 2 different flavors and they didn't like either one. I had a leftover bag of Iams and they broke into it.  I mixed it with Newmans and they picked it out.  I have now switched to California Natural and they don't throw up and they love the taste. I went to the natural pet store and got some free samples of different foods and my cats told me what they wanted.
