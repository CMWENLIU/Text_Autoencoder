This product is just awful.  It tastes as if it was made with shortening instead butter.  And, it is as dry as the Sahara and as sweet as standing water.  Cardboard comes to mind.  I ate a few pieces and tossed the rest.  I guess I'll need to wait for the local Greek festival to get something decent.
