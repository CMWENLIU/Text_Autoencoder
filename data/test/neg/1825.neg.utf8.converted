If something sounds too good to be true, it is. These Miracle Noodles (should be called Nasty Noodles) are exactly that. Although the fishy smells washes off with proper rinsing and boiling the texture of the noodles is nauseating. I was literally gagging as I tried to swallow them. When you chew them they break a part like some odd watery substance. I tried the noodles twice, two different ways (once stir-fried and the other in a soup) and both times I was absolutely repulsed by their texture. I ended up throwing the remaining 3 packs in the garbage. Miracle Noodles may have no calories, but they also have no place in my mouth. They were disgusting and I caution you all! Plus, you can find them in your local grocery store for much cheaper (they are called shirataki noodles)
