The smell and taste are undescribeable. I love Timothys and I love Kahlua, this confused me. The smell was so bad my sister woke up and thought there was a skunk outside the kitchen. We brewed another, still smelled and tasted aweful. I didnt even want to give them away to anyone because I would feel bad.
