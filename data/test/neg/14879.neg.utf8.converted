... unfortunately, I was totally disappointed when using Droste.  I looked high and low for it too, and paid $8/box thinking I would have an outstanding product.  The finished 14" square X 4" high layer cake was very moist, but lacked the darker and richer chocolate expectations both in color and taste.  In addition, it also allowed for the cinnamon taste to lean forward - which under the previous chocolate used, was considerably the faint surprise that flavor was meant to be.  Droste may be wonderful for making devil's food, but did not hold up for the darker, richer chocolate that I was hoping for.  I was very disappointed considering all the hype.  But, I truly appreciate these posts.  They are a source of helpful input, inspiration, and the kindliness of sharing one's experience.  I appreciate all the information especially the comparisons to other cocoa powders.
