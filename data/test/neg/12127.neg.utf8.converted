Since Atkins discontinued their low-carb bread mix several years ago, we haven't used our bread maker. I was delighted to discover someone was still making a low-carb product and ordered Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb Bread Mix. I should have known we were in trouble when the anticipated "fresh baked bread aroma" never materialized. There was a slight smell... but not a good one. My wife and I both took one bite and had to spit it out. Initially, it was tasteless, but after a few seconds there was a horrible, disgusting aftertaste. We quickly toasted some regular bread to rid our mouths of the taste. Even with our regular toast slightly burned, it couldn't clear that disgusting aftertaste. Needless to say, the rest of the loaf went into the trash along with the 3 unopened packs of bread mix. This is the most vile, disgusting thing I've ever eaten. It's hard to believe that some folks actually gave this a positive rating.
