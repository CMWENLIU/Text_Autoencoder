I am a HUGE fan of Pop Chips and buy them regularly so I was excited to see them add a new product to their line. I was so excited I went ahead and ordered bulk from Amazon. Unfortunately, it was wasted money. They taste very odd. I wish I had a better word to describe it. When I realized I didn't like them I put them in the community kitchen at work for anyone who was interested. Word has gotten around from those who tried them and also didn't like them and now they're just sitting in there. :-(  To be clear, I absolutely LOVE regular Pop Chips. It's just this tortilla version that needs to go back to the drawing board.
