It's not what I expected.  I thought it would be a dried crunchy peapod.  Except it's more like a Cheeto without the cheese -- maybe even greasier.  If I'd read the product information a little more closely, I may have noticed, "baked snack formed in pea-pod shape from dried peas and a little rice."<br /><br />They're not so "healthy" either.  Make sure you read the "Nutrition Facts":  [...]<br />I love Cheetos but I was looking for a snack with a little more dietary/nutritional value.  These aren't it for me.
