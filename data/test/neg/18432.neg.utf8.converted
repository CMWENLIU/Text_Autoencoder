I don t know what to think about this oil right now. The oil in the last 2 bottles I bought is cloudy. The first one was slightly cloudy but it didn't bother me The second one is more cloudy. The cloudiness is constant It is not a question of temperature. I have kept several bottles of oil in the same location for yrs and I have never seen this happened  Smell and taste don t seem to be affected. What is the reason?
