I bought these beans and the same size can of organic black beans from Westbrae Naturals for about the same price. Libby's says it serves 3.5 servings of 1/2 cup each while Westbrae serves 3 (1/2 cup each). This is significant because it allows Libby's to s-t-r-e-t-c-h the truth a bit in sodium levels. Westbrae's Sodium 140mg (6% per serving). Libby's Sodium level get this! 440mg (18% per serving). I have found these unnecessary high sodium levels on all of Libby's canned products including their canned organic green beans which I will not feed to my toddler anymore. Unfortunately when something sits in this salty solution it soaks up the sodium- therefore you can't just rinse it off. Libby's could make this healthier, gain more customers, AND save some money on the manufacturing of this product if they reduced the sodium.
