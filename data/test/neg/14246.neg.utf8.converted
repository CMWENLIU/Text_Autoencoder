I have been buying these nuts from Amazon for about a year now using the autoship and they have been hit or miss from the very beginning. One bag is fine and the next is stale, which means half of the 6 bags they ship out each month are bad. I've been continuing to buy them because the price is so good and they are loaded with lots of good fats. Also, I am allergic to almonds and this is a great alternative, but after buying some hazelnuts from a local store I realized just how much better they were compared to the Diamond ones here and have finally cancelled my subscription with Amazon and decided to just pay more for some fresh and much better tasting nuts. I don't know if its the brittle plastic packaging that Diamond uses or if the nuts are old to begin with but unfortunately I now have to pay almost double at the grocery store. I did use the nuts for baking and the slightly stale taste is definitely masked when you grind them up and put them in chocolate chip cookies or something similar but if you plan on eating these raw like I was doing on a regular basis then prepare yourself to be biting into quite a few stale ones and a few downright rancid ones in every bag.<br /><br />I also just want to mention that I also order the Planters pecan halves and they are delicious with never a stale nut in the package and Amazon has them at a great price too!!
