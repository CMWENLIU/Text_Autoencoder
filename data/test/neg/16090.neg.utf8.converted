The price was considerably better a while back at $19.44. How can they figure the original price was $6.30 per bag, when the company who manufacture's this product sells it for $3.99 per bag plus shipping. For the price they are charging now, I can get it at my local healthfood store for much less. The product is excellent and have used it for many years, but Amazon's price is not a deal anymore!
