I love that it is American made from renewable sources (Birch trees), and the taste is great (better than splenda or stevia)--absolutely indistinguishable from sugar. However, a couple of days of use had my wife cramping and a bit distressed in the nether regions. Now the canister stands a bit sadly unused (hey, don't look at me--I like sugar!).
