I should have gone with my gut. Cotton candy frosting doesn't sound all that great. After one bite, I passed my piece of cake to my husband. He ate both his and mine, while grimacing, and said he will eat the rest. I guess it was for the sake of not wasting a whole cake. He never requested more after that night. I couldn't even look at the cake without getting nauseated. I made a plain, white box cake. At least, I know, cotton candy frosting doesn't go with white cake at all. And I can't imagine it being good with any kind of cake. I'm hesitant to try any of their other flavors - this was my first. I rarely write reviews, but I felt I had to. This nauseous frosting is not worth trying. It doesn't even taste like cotton candy, anyway.
