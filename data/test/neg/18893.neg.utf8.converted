My doctor prescribes 2 Brazil Nuts a day for medical treatment. One day I was out and so was the store, so I risked it and ordered these from Bergin Nut Company. The first two I ate were both mushy, and one was bitter. :(  I can tell by the yellowish color that these have all been through something. I'm guessing severe temperature changes, maybe frozen and then too hot. I eat them for the selenium, which I can only hope is still good after whatever these nuts went through. It is a crying shame for such large beautiful nuts to be neglected to the point of becoming yucky. Nuts really should be kept cool and are probably best bought from a place that is air-conditioned, or even better, a place that refrigerates them, a service that the Amazon warehouses are not yet offering. Hopefully not every bag will be like this. You may get lucky and have some tasty ones, but if I were me, I wouldn't order these.
