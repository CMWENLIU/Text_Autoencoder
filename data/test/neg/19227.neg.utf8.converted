I ordered a LARGE birthday bouquet (that was supposed to come with a birthday balloon) for my daughter's birthday. Did not show up until almost 6:00 pm day of delivery. Was most definitely not a large bouquet. Was a small bouquet in a cup that said "get real" on the front (seriously, lol), and no balloon. Called 1-800 flowers, and was hung up on twice. Once by someone named Anne and again by someone named Carl. Finally got someone named Tracy. She said she would send another bouquet out the next day (UH, LITTLE LATE, NOT DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY ANYMORE). Sent another one, better, but still not what ordered. Still was not a LARGE bouquet (as stated in the description), and no balloon. She had also said she would refund my full amount paid, she only refunded half of it. Was not a good experience AT ALL, and it was for my daughter's 16TH birthday, I wanted it to be special for her. Not at all happy with this company. I will never order from them again, and especially not if it is for a special occasion. AWFUL EXPERIENCE.
