I purchased these K-cups on sale recently on Amazon.  Unfortunately there weren't any product reviews available yet, so I took a risk.  I am fairly certain these cups contain instant coffee.  I think that for a few reasons 1) if you shake these cups they have a distinctly different sound than K-cups of other types that I have.  It's as though the contents are dehydrated and take up significantly less space in the cup than the others; 2) The coffee comes out of the machine initially as dark sludge, then as almost clear water.  Obviously these extremes mix together in the mug; and 3) the flavor reminds me a lot of instant coffee.  Not undrinkable, but not something I would buy again, even if it were on sale.
