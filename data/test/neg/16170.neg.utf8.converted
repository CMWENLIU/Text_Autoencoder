I really wanted to like this product.  I am trying to feed my 6 month old baby a variety of foods so he hopefully will not end up a picky eater, but we follow the "4 day wait" rule because my husband & I have some food allergies/sensitivities.  I often cook homemade food but since I work, I appreciate the convenience of organic pre-made food.  Our son had already eaten apples & carrots with no problem.  What I missed in not reading the packaging (my fault - I know) is that in addition to carrots, apples, and parsnips, this product also contains lemon juice.  I happen to be sensitive to all citrus fruits.  Obviously I'm not sure if it was the lemon juice or parsnip or what, but my son was quite sick for 2-3 days after the one time he ate this product.  Blowing out his diaper every hour kind of sick.  We are going to save the remaining containers we had purchased for when my son is a year old and hopefully by then any food sensitivities will have worn off.  He gagged on the taste, though, so we will see.  I gave it two stars instead of one because I plan on trying it again in six months.<br /><br />I personally think that "stage 1" is misleading, because of the lemon juice additive.  I certainly wouldn't give this to a 4 month old.  Although I think most infants don't have a problem with citrus, it is not unheard of in causing digestive distress because of the high acidity.  I also wanted to point out how important it is to read food packaging labels, because even if something implies specific ingredients on the front, there may be additional additives.  I wish Amazon would post the ingredients on here.
