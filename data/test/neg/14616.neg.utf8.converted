I purchased this specifically for using in my coffee, which I happen to like with a lot of cream & a lot of sugar (figuratively.)  I've been using Splenda for several years with great results and decided to give Stevia liquid a try considering there's just not enough information about whether sucralose (Splenda) is potentially harmful for you or not.  All I can say is YUCK!  Disgusting!!!  If you only use a little, you can hardly tell you've used any.  And if you use more it NEVER gets sweet, but instead turns bitter.  I'd rather drink non-sweetened coffee.  I'm not sure how this stuff works with cooking and other uses, but since I only purchased it specifically to use in my coffee...what a waste of my money!  YUCK YUCK YUCK.
