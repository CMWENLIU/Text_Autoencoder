Honestly, this is probably one of the best chocolate bars out there.  As I'm sure most people agree they can eat this in one sitting much like any other candy bar out there and maybe most can it eat more than once a day.  What's deceptive is the nutrition for it!  What should be one serving is considered THREE servings.  Each serving is 200 calories and 15g of fat.  That means the whole package is 600 calories and 45g of fat!  An average build person should only eat 60g of fat a day!  So the amazingly great taste comes at a massive price and it's not worth it.
