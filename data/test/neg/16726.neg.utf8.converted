I am just learning about raw foods and in a workshop I went to, we were told that ALL almonds from California do have to be pasturized by law, but that it is only in California.  We were told that you can buy truly raw almonds from out of state, which of course means buying online.  They also do not have to lable the package that the almonds, or any other nut from California, are pasturized.  We were also told that you cannot buy directly from the grower because they cannot sell nuts without going thru their process.
