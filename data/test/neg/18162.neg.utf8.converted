I searched extensively online to find good sources of dragon well (longjing) green tea, and bought this Numi bag as well as more expensive tea from Sevencups, Teaspring, and Amazing Green Tea. This Numi tea was the least expensive of everything I bought. You get 16 OUNCES of this for the same price as 30 GRAMS (!) of Jipin grade from Amazing green tea. That's 15 times as much tea for the same price. I only wish it were as good, but the quality is far inferior. The Jipin from Amazing green tea has far more flavor, sweetness, nuttiness, and complexity. It really is amazing. I don't have a horse in this race (I'm just a green tea lover), but wanted to post my review here in case it saved someone else from buying this when it wasn't what they wanted. If you're looking for value and don't care much about flavor, this is fine. A little burnt and bitter, but drinkable. But those seeking a peak experience of what properly picked and pan-roasted green tea can be should search elsewhere.
