Whatever happened to Cal's Tupelo Honey? I bought it for years in the natural food stores locally. None of them carry it anymore. Trying to locate the company, I spent a futile hour searching the Internet.<br /><br />The label on my old jar says "Cairo, GA 39828". Not to be found anywhere on Google, white pages or yellow. After checking Amazon, I see that the label on the 22 oz. bottles says "Calvary, GA 31729". Same non-results on Google. The local retailer suggests that they may have been bought out. It troubles me that they are unfindable. What troubles me even more, however, is that the bottom half-inch of my current (and last) jar has crystallized. Tupelo honey should never crystallize, so my assumption is that it's being cut with some other, probably cheaper, kind of honey.<br /><br />If you're looking for tupelo honey, see the website operated by The National Honey Board. It lists apiaries in every state which produce many varieties of honey, including tupelo, often with links to those websites, and has useful information in addition. Cal's Honey isn't to be found. Too bad. It was a favorite of mine.
