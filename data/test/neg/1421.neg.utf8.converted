I relied on the ingredients listed on Amazon's site.<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Peanuts, Dry Roast Seasoning, Tapioca Dextrin, Natural Flavoring, Salt.<br /><br />Guess what? When the product arrived I read the laundry list of about 20 other ingredients.<br />According to the actual label the Dry Roast "seasoning" contains MSG.<br />Now I'm not that paranoid about MSG but if the product has it as an ingredient it should have been listed on Amazon.<br />I wish they had shown the nutrition label. It also contains added sugar.<br />What's wrong with plain dry roasted peanuts?<br />The taste is about what you would expect. Peanuts with a flavor coating.<br />I will not buy them again.<br />Also it is a 12 pack.
