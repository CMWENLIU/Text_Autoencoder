I ordered 6 of the 16+ honey.  I got 5.  One bottle of 12+ was substituted without any reduction in price.  The order was so poorly packed that the box collapsed and pressure was put on the plastic bottles of honey.  As a result the seals of 2 of the bottles were breached and several tablespoons of honey from each were leaked out inside the box.  WHAT A MESS!  I'll not order any more.
