I agree with Catriona about these bars tasting like a peanut bar and nothing like the advertised description. It seems like the company is trying to pull a fast one here by promoting these bars as almond, walnut and macadamia, especially when peanuts are listed as the first ingredient in tiny print in the ingredients list. Maybe they think that people can't tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts?<br /><br />I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK, but I have a hard time believing that the 4.5 star rating the product currently receives hasn't been created by company shills.<br /><br />It is a shame too, since the cranberry almond bars I also ordered were excellent and actually tasted like the description. If I had only ordered these I likely would never have purchased another product from KIND PLUS.
