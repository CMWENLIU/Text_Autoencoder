I purchased this tea once in the past, probably at least one year ago and liked the product very much.  I just reordered and something is seriously wrong with the new tea. I opened the package and there is an intense artificial smell of jasmine.  It seems like a bottle of perfume was poured into the package.  I brewed tea twice.  The first time seemed tolerable.  The second time, in fact, I threw the tea away.  I won't buy this tea again.
