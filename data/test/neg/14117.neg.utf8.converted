I have ordered the Maple Almond Butter multiple times, and two times, I received a bad batch.  The first time (jars), Amazon (excellent customer service) refunded my money.  The second time (squeeze packs) I decided to contact Justin's directly via Facebook.  Justin's told me that a batch of plain almond butter had been packaged as maple almond butter and that I should send "Todd" an email and they would replace it.  I sent the email, but never got a response.  When you get a good batch, it is wonderful, but for this amount of money, I'd expect the quality control to be a lot better.  I think they may be growing too quickly and they can't maintain the quality with the faster pace of sales.  It's very disappointing because I like the product when I get a good, properly labeled batch.
