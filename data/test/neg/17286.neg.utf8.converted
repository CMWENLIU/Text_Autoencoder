I'm using this to sweeten coffee; previously I used Truvia but decided to give SweetLeaf a shot.<br /><br />While I'm drinking, this tastes fine. It adds the requisite amount of sweetness and the coffee goes down nicely. But within a few seconds of finishing my cup of coffee, I'm left with an unpleasant strong bitter aftertaste that lingers for 10-15 minutes unless I rinse out my mouth with water. Truvia had a slight aftertaste but nowhere near as strong as this and nowhere near as lasting. I'll be switching back once I finish the SweetLeaf I already paid for.<br /><br />One thing that's worth noting: Ability to taste certain kinds of bitterness varies from person to person due to genetic factors. For example, some people find grapefruit intolerably bitter while to others it is pleasant; the former have receptors on their tongues that are sensitive to a specific chemical in the fruit, while the latter don't. It is entirely possible that the people giving this product positive reviews truly don't experience the aftertaste I'm talking about. So while this is definitely not the product for me, it may be worth giving it a try to test your own reaction.
