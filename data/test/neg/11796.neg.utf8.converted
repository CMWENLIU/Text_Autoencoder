I bought two 17.6 oz cans.  Both are marked with 12/2010 packing date and 12/2012 expiration date.  This coffee is absolutely bland, nothing like Effendi I have had before this order, from a different vendor.  Either it was stale before it was canned or there might be another possible explanation.  The text on either can is in Turkish and German.  The same brand bought before, from a different vendor, was in Turkish and English.  Perhaps, for German market, it is supposed to be bland but I doubt it.  The largest Turkish community outside of Turkey would not drink this stuff.<br /><br />I got full refund from Amazon.<br /><br />I strongly recommend to buy your Mehmet Effendi from another vendor and to make sure the text on the can is in Turkish and English.
