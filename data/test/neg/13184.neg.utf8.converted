Ok - I have historically liked Dove products. This is a body wash specifically for men. It seemed to work great after the first use (though I'm still not sure what "micromoisture" is).<br /><br />Problem is, after using it, it made my child's face break out. (No, I didn't use it on her). After touching her face to mine, the chemicals must have transferred.<br /><br />I normally read ALL ingredients of everything I use (laundry detergent, soaps, hand soaps, etc). But this was a new product, it was by Dove (I assumed they had higher standards), and I only tested it on a small area (my face & upper body).<br /><br />I'm so confused because Dove is the company that advertised gentle formula, pure ingredients, etc. But why are there so many malicious chemicals included in this product?<br /><br />* DIOXANE is a known chemical carcinogen (aka Sodium Laureth Sulfate, the first ingredient here)<br /><br />* PETROCHEMICALS petrolatum (second ingredient), derived from crude oil. As you would expect, it fills in your pores and doesn't allow skin to breathe.<br /><br />* ACRYLATE COPOLYMER is a synthetic polymer (plastic) which also comes from crude oil - highly processed, creates toxic by-products.<br /><br />* COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE  - known to irritate the skin, and cause allergic reactions in some people.<br /><br />* FRAGRANCE - sounds simple, but perhaps the most dangerous ingredient here. Due to deregulation, they are not legally bound to tell us what's really in it! Almost always contain phthalates,  chemicals commonly used to stabilize shampoos and liquid soaps, But they are "endocrine disrupters" which mimic hormones and may alter genital development, especially in little boys! When put in the lakes or streams, this chemical will cause male frogs and salamanders to turn into females!<br /><br />* POLYETHYLENE - also a Dioxane.<br /><br />* DMDM Hydantoin - preservatives that have the potential to release formaldehyde in very small amounts. Causes contact dermatitis, perhaps what caused the rash in my daughter's face after touching my skin.<br /><br />Simply put, it's RIDICULOUS that something as simple as soap contains KNOWN cancer-causing chemicals, and other insane chemicals that aren't safe!! And, why are we the only industrialized country in the world without laws to protect consumers and children?<br /><br />Many products, including some top-selling Johnson & Johnson products, are banned in Europe because of unsafe ingredients ... but shouldn't we have the highest standards of everybody? Why do we have the ~lowest~ standards?<br /><br />And, isn't it ridiculous that something as simple as soap is so politicized? Unilever (owns Dove & Axe), Proctor & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson each donate millions of dollars to politicians so they can continue putting unsafe ingredients in our products. Thank God we have politicians (on both sides of the aisle) to take their money and look the other way.<br /><br />Dove, please clean up your act.
