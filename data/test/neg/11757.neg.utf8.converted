I had been looking for an all natural moisturizer for a while so I ordered this.  First of all, it is very impractical.  You take a piece out of the bucket and then try to melt it between your hands as you rub them together.  It takes a while to get this to disintegrate.  Then your hands end up greasy feeling.  Back in the day, I use to use Palmers cocoa butter lotion and loved the smell, so I thought I'd like this product. Well, I personally didn't like the smell of this.  It was kind of a heavy annoying smell; to me anyway.
