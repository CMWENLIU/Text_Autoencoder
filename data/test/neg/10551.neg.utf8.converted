I am a Lapsang Souchong fan.  I enjoy the smokey flavor.  This particular version has nice subtlety to its flavor but lacks the "smoke" I desire.  I know most people are not fond of a "barbequed tea".  This brand may be one of the best for those who wish to test Lapsang Souchong but don't desire a lot of smokey flavor.  For true fans I would recommend the one from China Mist [[ASIN:B0000V1BEI Lapsang Souchong Whole Leaf Loose Black Tea].
