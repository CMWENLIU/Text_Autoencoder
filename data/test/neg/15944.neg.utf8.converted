i was so excited to order this candy as i havent had any for 23 yrs...when i was last in germany....and to my horror..this candy tasted like it had been saved for that period of time.....it was so stale....i was very disappointed. i love cadbury candy....but for the cost, this was not worth it.....guess i'll have to wait till i go overseas again.
