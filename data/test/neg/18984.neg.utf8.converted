I just cancelled my subscription for this.  The last box I opened did not have the  flavors count the label claims.  Half of the cans were turkey.  The turkey flavor has seemed to be adding up in my cabinet.  Now I suspect it's because I have been receiving more of the turkey flavor than of the tuna and chicken.  If you are going to be buying this, check when you open the box to see if it really is the variety of flavors you wanted to buy.  The cat likes these flavors but I'll be buying individual cans.
