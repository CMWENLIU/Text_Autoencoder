The new canister idea went a little too far, as there is also some thing different with the taste. They dont even taste like onion any more, very bland. Not the same French's that we have grown to know and love over the years. This is a true shame. Hopefully, some one will realize that and do some thing about it. If it isn't broken, don't fix it! Bring back the old caniser with the real original flavor please, my taste buds beg of you!! Thanksgiving this year will not be the same......:(
