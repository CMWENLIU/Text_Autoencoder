Krogers selld the 33oz bottle for $2.99 (no shipping) here it's $4 per bottle and $30+ for shipping.........what a profit when you consider the total weight is 6 x 33oz or 12 Lbs. USPS says this would cost (well packed because of the glass bottles of course) 14Lbs a whopping $9...+ or-<br /><br />wow............
