For those of you who have purchased this product previously, be warned. When they changed the packaging they also changed the formula. "jasmine flowers" are no longer listed as an ingredient, and you really can't taste them in the product anymore. Since that was one of the things I liked best about the product, I won't be purchasing it again. It's too bad because they had a great product that made it worth the high price tag.
