I ordered three (ugh!) of these sampler packages intended as gifts to people to whom I had previously given Keurig's.  What a disppointment to see that they come in distasteful brown paper bag packaging with a 90 day expiration sticker right on the front!  Shame on me for not reading all the details closer and the reviews ahead of time, which I now see have the same complaints about shoddy packaging and what appears to be someone's leftover flavors.  Buyer beware!
