The product received was a box of 25, with a small pack of 5 Mon Cheris. The small pack of 5 was perfect, the box of 25 was damaged. The chocolate had been allowed to heat so the chocolate melted and all the Kirsch had leaked out. There was no liquid in the package, no stickiness, and the cherries were dry so the product was damaged before shipping to me. I wrote a complaint, and was promised a replacement. Weeks went by while I waited for them to recieve a fresh shipment. This time the candy was shipped in a box with an ice pack, but the candy was damaged in the same way. I will shop elsewhere in the future, no longer trusting the quality from this vendor.
