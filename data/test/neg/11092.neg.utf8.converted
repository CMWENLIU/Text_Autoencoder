not only did I receive 4 flavors instead of the one that I ordered*just like the other reviewer* I couldn't use the vodka/cream flavor....the others were all diluted...lacking punch and flavor...<br />I added spices, capers, anchovies, olives, etc......I didn't need to spend $20 for sauces that I had to enhance.  I have made better at home, from scratch, for a few shekels.
