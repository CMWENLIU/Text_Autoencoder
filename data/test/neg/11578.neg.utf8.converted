After reading the ingredients, I was not happy. I expected truly healthy ingredients, as with Newman's Own products. It's been a while, so I can't recall exactly what led me to believe the contents of the bag were not much better than most other commercial pet food. If I believed it were a healthier option for my 6 cats, I would have continued to spend the 35 bucks a bag. By-product, meal, and added vitamins turn me off. I will continue to feed my cats IAMS (which is not really better, in my opinion, just 13 bucks less expensive) because they always want food available to them as I search for a reasonably priced and truly healthy food. I only feed my dog Newman's Own treats and food that I prepare myself. Sorry BB, I'll pass forever.
