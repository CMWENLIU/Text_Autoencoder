This seller by far is the only terrible seller I have dealt with from Amazon.<br />The Cat Chews arrived without any expiration date printed on the bags and most of them have changed to a very yellowy color. My two cats won't touch those with a off color. So, I have contacted the seller and someone over there told me to send them back for an exchange. I did that, and called the seller one month later since nobody contacted me and neither did I receive the exchanged product. After calling many times, I gave up and contacted Amazon.com. Since everytime, the person answered the phone told me that he can't do anything and the manager will call me back and he never did. After 5 of this phone calls, I decided I've wasted too much of my time and it's better to direct the issue to Amazon.com. And Amazon has made it so easy for me. They filed the claim and did the refund. I'll keeping shopping with Amazon, but not with this seller anymore. They are many other sellers carry the same Cat Chews.
