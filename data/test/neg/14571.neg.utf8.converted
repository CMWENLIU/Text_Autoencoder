When I purchased this product, I was under the impression that it was real coffee with mocha and not instant coffee with mocha.  This is quite a rip-off and I am taking the remainder of what I purchased back to the store or sending back to the manufacturer.  Finally, the taste is awful.  It is easier to make a cup of instant and add a little Swiss Miss hot chocolate and it would taste better.
