I'm sorry to say I was not exactly thrilled when I tasted this brand of "Branston" or ploughman's pickle.  There is a high proportion of "sauce" to veggies, and the flavor is blander than I like.  I also reviewed the Crosse and Blackwell Branston Original (much better, IMO) and would recommend it over the Heinz.<br /><br />I noticed that this is packed in Holland.  Don't know if that has anything to do with anything but seems odd.  The crunchy bits are not quite as crunchy as I like, and it's soupy, rather than being thick.  It's not a terrible product, but I believe the Heinz is higher priced than the C&B, so I'd recommend that for more flavor and crunch and less drips.
