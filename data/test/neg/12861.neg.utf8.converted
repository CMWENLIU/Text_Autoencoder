I've tried another brand of miracle fruit tablets during a party. All the guests put them in their mouths and the tablets nearly instantly dissolved. After 10 seconds or so, they were eating up lime wedges like no tomorrow.<br /><br />This one, in comparison, is like a standard hard tablet. Everyone sat around for several minutes waiting for them to dissolve. The end effect was not nearly as impressive, as the sour items still had quite a bit of tart to them.<br /><br />I will not be buying this brand anymore.
