Very Disappointed. Old, stale,soft and bitter. I bought for holiday cooking but would not serve to anyone in any form. Based on other reviews, it sound like quality control needs to be evaluated as product is not consistant. Not worth returning. I had better luck with the Azar almonds on Amazon and a better price.
