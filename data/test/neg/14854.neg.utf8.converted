I've not yet cured the gourd or even tried this product, so it might be fine -- but I would like to point out that I purchased this product the last week of Oct. 2010, and the sell by date on the Taragui yerba mate is Nov. 2009 -- a year out of date!  That's not quite how things should be done, I think.
