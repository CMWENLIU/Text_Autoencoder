This is not the first time I ordered this item, unfortunately, this time it came in a bag with a quarter size hole in it, creating a huge mess while i was trying to open an amazon box. The outside box was the right size, so I believe the couscous bag was already damaged before it was placed in a box. They should use heavy duty bags! To make the matter worse, Amazon does not accept this item back, which does not make any sense! I will not order it again.
