I am disappointed with this tea. I am used to Indian black tea such as Assam or Darjeeling.<br />This tea has no aroma and tastes pretty dull, nothing compared to the aroma and tastes you get from Indian tea. The quality of the product is great; good beautiful long leafs, but if you are used to Indian black tea then this would not give you the same experience.
