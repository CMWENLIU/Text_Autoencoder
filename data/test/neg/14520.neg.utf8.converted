I really like the idea of the Solofil cup, as I love the Keurig system, but haven't been able to find a grind of coffee that didn't result in a cup of mud.  Thought these would fix that problem, but it didn't.  So, I have ended up with some VERY expensive single-serve coffee, that is just okay tasting ... and still very muddy.  I'll use them up, but I won't purchase again.<br /><br />Sorry, but I can't recommend it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LL4YOM">EkoJava, West Coast Roast Single Serve Coffee for Solofill Cup, 25-Count</a>
