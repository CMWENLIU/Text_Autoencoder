I did not buy this product from Amazon, but did purchase it from a local grocery store. I typically buy organic, whole grain cereals and prefer their taste over sugary over-processed stuff. Not the case with "Fruitful O's"... this stuff tasted so bad it was inedible. It has a bitter taste, nothing "fruitful" about it. It left a nasty after-taste that lingered, kind of like eating dirt (not that I have done that lately). My goats did seem to enjoy it though, so I guess it wasn't a total loss. My goats also enjoy eating cardboard, so... go figure. I can't imagine any child liking this. I think I'll stick with Kashi.
