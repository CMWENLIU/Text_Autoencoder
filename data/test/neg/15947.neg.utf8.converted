Imagine ordering chocolate that is supposed to be from England and receiving chocolate wrapped in paper with Pakistani language(Urdu)all over it. Yes, it contained English translation but I didn't order candy from Pakistan. I ordered candy from England thru Trade Concepts. The candy is not "flaky" but rather stale and old and tasted like cheap milk chocolate. If this indeed comes from England, why do the wrappers indicate they are from Pakistan?<br />I also ordered the "Crunchie" (which is nothing even close to the Violet Crumble from Australia). These too are from Pakistan. The center is not flaky or crunchy or crumbly but rather stale and old.<br />If you advertise that something is "from England" that is the only packaging it should be in. Because of the Urdo all over the wrappers, I can only assume that perhaps Trade Concepts imports from England, removes the wrapper and then rewraps them in their own wrappers? I'm sure the FDA would be interested in this practice.<br />I see by some of the other reviews that I was not the only customer deceived.
