I bought these bags to go in our poo composter instead of tossing the bags in the trash.  Well, after several months these bags are not degrading at all, bio or otherwise.  The composter has RidX and the poos breaks find, just not the bags.<br /><br />Sooooo..... if you want a ok poop bag, these are as good as any other (although not as handy as the roll up type in the little carriers though) but don't expect them to break down in anything but your local landfill.<br /><br />Another down side to these bags; the bags are too small to be tied off tightly to seal in the poo so the trash can really smells.<br /><br />Since all this stuff will end up the landfill anyway, you will do much more good for the environment by reusing plastics grocery to pick up your dog waste.  Certainly plenty big and can be easily tied off to lock in the smell making trash day a much more pleasant experience.
