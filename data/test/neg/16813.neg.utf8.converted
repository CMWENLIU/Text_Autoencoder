Based on the previous review and some web searches this sounded like an ideal product to replace salted peanuts, chips, whatever as a snack.  I took one bite from a packet and forced myself to chew the styrofoamy like texture and rotten off-fish smell.  Later that day I tried to see if my dogs would eat them and got nauseous opening a packet for them.  No, they were smarter than me and just sniffed them and walked away.  This product may be wonderful for your health but I hope there is a tasteless pill that can do the same thing if we have to get health from this.  So if someone likes this stuff I have 198 packets that I would be willing to send free of charge to the first one to email me via amazon.
