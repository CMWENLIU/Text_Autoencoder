I've had a total of 4 shipments of this product.  2 shipments had quality fat and taste.  Thick nutritious fat clinging to the can. I had to put the product in the blender to blend it. I was impressed as this is how it should be. 2 shipments had poor quality. Very thin watery cans of product.  I even put the product in the refrigerator and it didn't thicken one little bit. That is unacceptable.  I have been debating on allowing another shipment to come with the hopes of getting a good batch or cancel my subscribe and save order for this product. I have decided to cancel and make my own coconut milk.
