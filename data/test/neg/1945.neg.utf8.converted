I've been using this tea for over a year. I don't know what happened but this last  order of six boxes is just awful. Did Good Earth change the formula? Don't know but I will not be ordering this again. They have ruined a formally wonderful product!! So disappointed! However, after notifying Amazon my full purchase price was refunded. Now that is what I call great customer service! Thanks Amazon!
