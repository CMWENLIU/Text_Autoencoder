These are terrible. I normally buy and love the Black Forest gummies but thought I'd try these because of the variety of flavors. What a disappointment. There is little to no difference between the supposed "flavors". They don't taste juicy, like the Black forest. They taste sugary and acidic but not fruity. Worst of all, there is an underlying bitter, chemical taste to them that just completely ruins it. They do look pretty, but that's about the only thing they have going for them.
