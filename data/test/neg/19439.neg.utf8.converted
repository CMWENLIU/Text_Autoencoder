As someone who eats soup almost every night during the fall and winter, I was pleased to see our local grocer carrying several of the new Progresso World Recipes Soup.  Unfortunately, the two varieties I have tried have been a real disappointment.  Like the Black Bean Jalapenos, the Tortilla y Pollo's seasoning is heavy on the chili powder and not much else.  Although a bit milder than the Black Bean Jalapenos, the Tortilla soup's broth is really little different in taste or consistency.<br /><br />There is little in the way of meat or vegetables in this particular soup which caused me to rate the product as deserving only two stars.  The can I opened had about six pieces of chicken, each measuring about 3/4" X 1/4" X 1/4"; a handful of black beans, a few corn kernals, and a piece or two of pepper.  I found this soup to be a significant departure from Progresso's usual quality ingredients and flavor combinations.<br /><br />In producing this soup, Progresso has committed a common error - assuming the flavors of Mexico and Tex-Mex foods are limited to chili powder; in the case of the Tortilla soup, there were not even pieces of jalapeno pepper thrown in to lend "authenticity" to the product.  I suggest Progresso review "Los Barrios Family Cookbook: Tex-Mex Recipes from the Heart of San Antonio" by Diana Barrios Trevino for the true flavors of Tex-Mex cooking. If attempting to produce a soup which reflects only Mexico's flavors, then Rick Bayless' "Authentic Mexican: 20th Anniversary Edition: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico" would be an excellent resource for Progresso to use.<br /><br />If you are looking for a soup that combines interesting layers of flavor and multiple ingredients, you would do well to look elsewhere. This soup reflects neither the flavors of Tex-Mex cooking or Mexican cooking.  If Progresso's other World Recipes Soups are as disappointing as the two I have already sampled, I may be changing my brand loyalty when it comes to soup.
