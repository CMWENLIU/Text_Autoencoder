Sounds pretty harsh but, if a local store did what Amazon is doing here, the authorities would be on them in a heartbeat.  Amazon describes this juice as "not from concentrate."  Previously, I was getting Mountain Sun cranberry juice from a local grocery store which was "not from concentrate."  It was expensive, over [..] a bottle but, cheaper than the health food stores.  Then, they changed to the cheaper version from Mountain Sun, made from concentrate, at around [...] a bottle.  I was delighted to see Amazon had the "not from concentrate" and at a good price.  My wife and I have bought from Amazon for years but, not food items.  We have always been very satisfied with Amazon until now.  When we received our first shipment of juice, I was shocked to see that the juice was made from concentrate.  Amazon was passing off the cheaper juice for the "not from concentrate" version and at a higher price than I can buy locally.  What a fraud and retail scam!  Amazon, I no longer respect you as a trusted vendor and will be much more cautious in buying from Amazon in the future.  I will also tell all my friends and family to be cautious when buying from Amazon as well.
