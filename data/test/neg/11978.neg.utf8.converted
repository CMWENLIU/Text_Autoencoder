When you have a cat that craves turkey and basically, all types of poultry, it stands to reason that he should love this one, right?  Well, with a quick flip of the tail and a nose in the air, it quickly went down the garbage disposal after a long argument!  Good thing I only bought one!  Can't understand this at alll either - he loves the Friskies general brand of turkey, but hates it in Fancy Feast.  Same company, you'd think this one would be better, not so!  Anyway, try it for yourself particularly if you have a fussy cat because they're full of protein and vitamins.  One of the best cat foods out there (they put Iams to shame!) for that.  They're healthy foods, improve their energy and coats, and overall health. Just have to pick and choose though because they certainly can surprise you!
