Since being introduced to gelato some years back, I set out recently to find a way to make authentic gelato at home. The process of doing so can be somewhat time consuming. Most recipes call for the creation of a custard base, which can sometimes be a little tricky to achieve without curdling the egg yolks, and also requires the base to chill for several hours (or more) before making the gelato. The finished gelato itself, then, will also need to sit in the freezer for several hours (or more) before it arrives at its perfect frozen state.<br /><br />So when I saw this product on Amazon, I was very excited about the prospect of shaving several hours off the process. I could not find an ingredients list, or much information at all, about what I would ACTUALLY find in the canister, but I made an assumption , and indeed was hoping, that the egg yolks in pasteurized and powdered form, along with the flavorings and sweetener, would be there so it would yield all the rich texture while saving time.<br /><br />My assumption was wrong. Here is what the canister holds, in order: sugar, Bellagio premium cocoa powder, natural flavoring. No eggs. Each canister contains two foil pouches (yielding about a quart of ice cream) and a small booklet that includes a recipe for making mousse in addition to gelato. It also includes ideas for add-ins, infusions, and mix-ins.<br /><br />Surprised but still hopeful and wanting to see how the recipe would turn out, I made it in my Delonghi gelato maker. Here is my verdict on the finished product: It is tasty (the chocolate taste is good and dense though more milk chocolate than I'd expected) but lacks the rich texture of gelato. It is more like an ice milk. I may see if I can make the recipe a little closer to the way I usually make gelato, by heating the cocoa mixture in the milk/cream, then tempering the egg yolks, and mixing them together. But doing so almost completely wipes out any advantage of using the gelato starter. I suppose it might save a step or two along the way, but it really will not save much time.<br /><br />I bought a two-pack of the Decadent Chocolate and a two-pack of the vanilla bean variety. In retrospect, I would not have bought them. But I will try making the mousse so that I can use up the remainder of my purchase. And I will probably try adapting the starter with egg yolks (as mentioned above) to see if it yields a truer gelato. But all in all, I am unhappy with this product and regret purchasing it.
