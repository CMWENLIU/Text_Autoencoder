Reading the reviews, I thought this would give a little kick to my coffee.  It doesn't do it, and here's why.  Even though the package says to limit to two per day, each shot only has 40mg of caffeine.  The average cup of coffee is around 100mg.  Energy drinks range widely, but 200mg seems to be in the ballpark, so two of these in a cup of coffee is still less than that.<br /><br />For those of you that get something out of this, great, but it's not comparable to an energy drink, imho.
