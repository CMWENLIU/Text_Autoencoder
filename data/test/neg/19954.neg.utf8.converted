HELP.. I am confused How can they advertise this as SAFE for a Diabetic ?????<br />.....I bet it tastes good..<br /> Not a critic but just so you have ALL the info<br />Whey low is Fructose,Lactose and Sucrose..<br />-- which is just the versions of sugar...so how do they make it Low Carb and good for Diabetics ????<br /><br />i.e Lactose - milk sugar<br />Sucrose - raw sugar or sugar beets..<br />Fructose- fruit sugar<br /><br />Also I am new at this but these numbers do NOT  work ; you only subtract FIBER from carb count to get effective Carbs...  you  DO NOT subtract the SUGAR as well<br /><br />here are the numbers on their site<br />Ingredients: Crystalline fructose,<br />lactose ( milk), and sucrose<br /><br />and how did they come up with these carb counts????<br /><br />Total CArb 4g<br />Fiber 0g<br />Sugar 4g<br />____________________<br />Total Carbohydrates 4g/servings<br />Sugars 4 g/servings<br />EFFECTIVE CARBOHYDATE COUNTS ............1G/SERVING<br /><br />Pleased do not be confused about this.. Check with your MD before using in a diabetic program.<br />I am offended by this method of marketing.........  !!!!!!!
