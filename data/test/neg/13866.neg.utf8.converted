Be warned: Amazon must have an old or bad batch of herb seeds. Only 4 of the 7 seed pods grew (the parsley, chives and dill never sprouted), and this is our second batch that had some fungus or mold in the purple basil pod. They have changed from the tablet nutrients to some liquid nutrients in a bag, two of which leaked (one was nearly empty and leaked all over the instruction booklet).<br /><br />The seed pods that did grow are growing wonderfully (more basil, mint and thyme that we can use), but it seems to be a shot in the dark whether you'll get a good batch.<br /><br />Based on the quality of this product, I cannot recommend purchasing it.
