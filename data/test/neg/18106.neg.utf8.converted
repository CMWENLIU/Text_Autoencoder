This product was terrible. We got the Mother's Day basket, it was dry, tasteless and tough. I don't know if all of Golden State's stuff is so bad, but ours was terrible. We are from California, we know what good dried fruit is supposed to taste and feel like. The fruit was highly treated with sulfites, and very dry and tough. It was tasteless, so I am certain it was at least two years old. I am surprised at all of the good reviews for this product, perhaps we have higher standards. It was good for compost, but I was afraid there were too many chemicals in it.
