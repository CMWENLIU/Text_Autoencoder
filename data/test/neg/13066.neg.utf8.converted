[[ASIIN:B007PA32L2 Green Mountain Coffee, Pumpkin Spice K-Cup packs for Keurig Brewers, 50 count]]<br />I am so very disappointed in the lack of flavor and aroma in the new packaging of the Pumpkin spice K-cup packs.<br />The packaging is different and it says "light roast".  This is definately not the same coffee that I've enjoyed so much over the last 2 years. I really hope they bring back the original flavor!!! What a shame!!!
