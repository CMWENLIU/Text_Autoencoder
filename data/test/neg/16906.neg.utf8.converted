I love Mio but I am confused as to why a pack of 4 costs $22 on amazon.com and people are buying it.  They are $3.65 each at my local Target store.  That would mean that it costs just under $15 for me to go and buy four.  Why are people ordering it online?  Unless I am missing something and you really get more than 4 individual bottles.
