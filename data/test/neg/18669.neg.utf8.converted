I've had a lot of excellent halva in my life. It's seems it would be difficult to spoil it, but not in this case. It is a disgrace to call this product a halva! Granulated Domino Sugar - yes, but not a halva. It has a lot more sugar than any other brand and all you can feel are crunchy sugar crystals when you're chewing it. Do not buy!
