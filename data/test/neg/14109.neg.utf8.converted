This stuff is one of the worst things I have ever had. It makes even the best of dinners inedible.<br /><br />To tell you how it tastes, it tastes like something in your recipe went bad, like you used chunky milk in your dish.<br /><br />I hate it with a deep burning passion, and would never recommend it to anyone who has taste buds.
