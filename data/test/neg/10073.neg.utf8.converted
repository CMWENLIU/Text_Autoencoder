I have previously ordered various green coffee bean types from a couple websites with good roasting success. I decided to try this product on Amazon for its good price and free shipping. However, I've tried various degrees of roasting from very light to very dark and cannot get this coffee to taste good. There just seems to be no flavor. I use a Nesco CR-1000.
