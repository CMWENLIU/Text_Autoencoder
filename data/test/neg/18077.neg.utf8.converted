We switched to Nutro Lite Dry recently, and it had very negative effects on our Black Lab. The food itself was being digested, but approx 8 hours after eating she would vomit bile. This went on for about a week before we did a search online on reviews of the brand and found a lot of recent reports saying this same Nutro brand was causing other dogs to have the same symptoms. In some cases, people with 3 dogs, saw all 3 dogs start vomiting after changing to Nutro. When all was said and done, I tossed out the remaining Nutro and went back to her previous brand. She has not vomited since. This is obviously not the case with all dogs, but keep in mind you may want to test this brand by purchasing a small bag before purchasing something large. I'm just glad our dog didn't have permanent problems.
