I am very disappointed in this product.  The first box was 75% hard, not a soft powder in each envelope.  When I called to complain, I got fast results in getting a new box.  The new box was 25% hard.  I do not blame Saco, but whoever stored it incorrectly or for too long.  The fresher envelopes did make great buttermilk biscuits.
