I haven't had Thai tea in several years because the restaurants make it too sweet.  I purchased this one and a green tea version.  I had the green tea version and I developed a migraine that required medical treatment.  I totally missed that both teas contained FD&C Yellow 6 food coloring, also known as Sunset Yellow.  It is not listed on Amazon's description for this tea, but it is on the package if you look at the picture closely.  I later learned that it can have several potential health issues.  There have been calls for the withdrawal of Sunset Yellow from food use from the British Food Standards Agency.  The Center for Science in the Public Interest has requested the FDA ban it in the USA.  Sunset Yellow is banned in Norway and Finland.  I have gotten migraines from other artificial food additives, mostly artificial sweeteners and food preservatives.  I try to be careful, so I only blame myself.  I read every review, but didn't look at the photo for this one.  The green tea version had it listed in the description, which I didn't read that closely.  Its package had a sticker over the ingredients, so I didn't notice it before I drank it.  Beware before you buy.  If you are looking for a healthy drink, this isn't it.
