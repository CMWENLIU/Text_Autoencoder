I USED to like Appian Way Pizza Mix when we were growing up, so I bought a box recently. Just last night, I craved pizza, so I was excited to build this pizza. My husband was with me and immediately told him the differences I saw in the crust. I remember having to let it rise, but not now, just add water and make the pizza. I was the type who loved to take the raw dough, dip it into the sauce and eat it as I was preparing. I knew the flavor was off just eating the dough plain. Next, I cut open the foil pack of sauce (was it not a can before?) and the smell and color were not what I remembered. I tasted the sauce and it reminded me of mexican food flavor (not knocking mexican food, I like it, but not when I want pizza) NOT pizza sauce. It had a orangish tone to it, not the red I remember. I knew in my brain that putting the pepperoni and chesse on it was going to be a waste, but proceeded anyway! Yep ... a total disappointment! One bite and in the garbage it went! I searched the net for someone to write to, but cannot find a customer complaint department!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  Save yourself! Run for the hills! The dough is worse than Little Ceasars (cardboard flavor), the sauce is disqusting tasting. I HAD to choose one star, but I wish they would provide negative stars!!
