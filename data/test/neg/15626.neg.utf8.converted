if i just would have taken the time to look a little more on Amazon, i found this SAME product, 30 bags instead of 24, for only $6.00 with free shipping- SAME THING FOR LESS.  i plan to cancel my subscription and order from the other vendor.  I think in this time of economic hardship that EVERY vendor should really take a look at what is out there and try to be as comparable as they can for everyone!  i am very disappointed in this. I would only consider to keep my subscription if the price was reduced!
