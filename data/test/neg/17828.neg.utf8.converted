I quit coffee some months ago due to atrial fib. but the great sale price & rave reviews seduced me.  One morning of this stuff & I'm twice as quit now.  Don't let the reviews fool you, this is Folgers quality.  If you are a  whole bean kind of person this stuff is a disappointment. Upside is I can happily go back to abstinence, for a couple more months anyway.
