I never even received the product.  I ordered 2 1/2 weeks before Christmas, and it was due to be received within a few days.  Not only did I NEVER receive it.  I was never even contacted.<br />  My credit card was charded, I waited, and nothing. Finally, 2 days before Christmas, I contacted the vender, they sent me some sort of form letter, and said they would credit my account.  Which they did, however, I felt it was handeled very unprofesionally.  No apology, nothing.<br />  If there was a problem, it would have been nice for them to let me know, so I could persue other options prior to the Holiday.
