My experience is quite different to most other reviewers, so perhaps it will be a helpful counterpoint.  I used Droste to make a test cake for my son's birthday, and it had no detectable chocolate flavor.  I then just tasted the Droste cocoa and found it awfully bland.  I picked up a can of Pernigotti cocoa from Williams-Sonoma: horribly expensive, but produced quite a good chocolate cake from the same recipe.  For baking, if you are a foodie, Droste will be disappointing.  If you are limited to supermarket selections I would look for a recipe that calls for melted chocolate, perhaps in addition to cocoa, and use Lindt chocolate: the result should be more chocolate-tasting.  If you have more money and/or resources, Callebaut cocoa (from Amazon or another mail-order place) is terrific, Green & Black also performs well and is popular with pastry chefs (it is organic, so look for it at organic shops or at Whole Foods), and as mentioned I found Pernigotti to perform well (find at Williams-Sonoma or a gourmet shop).  Hope this is helpful.<br /><br />An earlier reviewer commented that Dutched cocoas will produce more flavor: Dutching is an alkalizing treatment used to bring the cocoa taste forward.  All Dutch-processed cocoas are not the same, however, and have different pH levels as well as dramatically different flavors.  For more on this see Rose Levenbaum's "Cake Bible" or hit the Cook's Illustrated website.  Rose recommends Green & Black's on her blog, and Cook's Illustrated recommends Callebaut as the best cocoa they reviewed (they did find Droste to be the best supermarket brand), although of the three cocoas I suggest only Callebaut was included in the Cook's Illustrated taste test.
