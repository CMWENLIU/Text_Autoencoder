I bought a Keurig, couldnt get it to prime, and kept returning this silly product and getting a new one, only to not have it work either.  Then, LO!, I watched the online video and finally learned it requires a water filter that is not included with the product!  That alone is mystifying to me--why would an essential component not be included, like water filters for water pitchers??  Really, it includes a bonus pack of coffee that you cant initially use but not the filter that you absolutely have to have?!?!<br /><br />More disturbing, however, is why the absence of this critical component is not disclosed on the box (a la, "batteries not included" notices), or in the instructions, or even by  the two brain trust customer service reps with whom I spent 30-45 minutes on the phone with on 2 separate occasions!!<br /><br />Finally, I had to spend a day tracking down this essential-but-rare-and-not-included component b/c I have clients coming to the office tomorrow and cant wait for the online ordering process....  It turns out most of the various retailers dont know it's not included yet necessary, so none of them stock it on hand!<br /><br />Brilliant, Keurig!
