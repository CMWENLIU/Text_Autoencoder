at the current price of just under 42bucks, make at s/s about 86cents a can..factor in the can size at 5oz vs 6oz at local stores is 11.8% lower in weight, thus higher again in price..factoring out to 96cents a can...this is way to high a price. those who got it at 50cents a can is a decent price. i will wait til that happens, til then store sales will be the credo.<br /><br />and i agree with the review where there seems far less tuna in a can; press out the water and the can is 1/2 filled..you are buying lots of water, not tuna. sneaky, like a pound size can of coffee holds only 12 oz or so anymore.
