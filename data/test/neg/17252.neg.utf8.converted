we recently received a gift of your butlers famous Irish truffels, they are much to rich in sugar and the amount in the box for the price is a total disgrace, give me any cadburys anyday!! we are  so dissapointed!afraid you've lost a lot of customers on my side of the world! next time im in a shop i'll certianly wont be buying them!
