The candy necklaces I received were not the ones depicted in the photograph shown.  They were not the "Smarties" brand, had generic packaging, and were completely different colors than the ones shown.  When I complained to the seller, I was told that the manufacturer had changed their product, which may or may not  be true - but regardless, they should change the picture so that it actually depicts the true product they are selling.
