I bought this hoping the pro/prebiotics would help my daughter's tummy. Upon opening there was a distinct chemical smell. The earth's best rice I normally use has no smell whatsoever. But I wrote it off as the add ingredients. Within a half hour of drinking this my daughter shot it all back up. She was not sick. I tried again the following day and same deal. I'm sticking to the less is more approach and going with earth's best organics.
