I thought that this flaked coconut would be finer, maybe more shredded..I didn't mind the fact it was unsweetened, but I found it did not have much flavor and it  was much larger pieces.. more like it was chipped.. and I really don't know what to do with it now that I have it..Don't think I will order it again..
