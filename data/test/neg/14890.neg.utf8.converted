I bought this item prior to christmas 2011, and once it arrived i gave it to my dog, who (of course) began slobbering all over it.  He spent the next 2 days, after i threw the bone away, vomiting all over everything.  I dont know if i got a bad item, or if they are all like this, but i would strongly recommend going elsewhere for your pets chew-toy needs.
