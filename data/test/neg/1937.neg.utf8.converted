I was so suprized to see on the front of the box "Artificial Flavor." It also had Artificial flavor in the ingredients too. I couldn't believe such desceptive marketing. You think healthy good earth etc. I have been drinking this tea since the early 1980's. I had my first taste in the Good Earth Restaurant. Loved the ice tea version. I haven't had it for awhile and was excited to see it, got some and what a disappointment. A weird long after taste I never had before and a buzzy head. I sometimes will have reactions to chemicals or artifical ingredients. Unfortunately I won't be able to have anymore of this tea. Most likely others won't have the same reaction but who wants something with such deceptive marketing? I'll stick with other natural teas!
