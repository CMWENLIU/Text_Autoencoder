Dried strawberries are smaller than most - and as another reviewer mentioned - sweetened with high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />For a product that costs about $.90 an ounce, you would think that Stoneridge could've ponied up the extra $.02 per ounce for real sugar.<br /><br />In addition, they include propylene glycol (a less-toxic version of ethylene glycol, both used as antifreeze) to stop the berries from sticking to each other.  OK.... the effect of this is that they come across as "slippery" in your mouth, and not in a good way.<br /><br />Strange part is, the ingredient list on the package that I typed this from is different than the ingredient list of the product as listed on the Stoneridge website. Their website mentioned that they are sweetened with sucrose, for example.<br /><br />But the Stoneridge product we received from Amazon has HFCS.  And antifreeze.<br /><br />The disclaimer above says it all - "Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website."<br /><br />We won't be repeat customers.
