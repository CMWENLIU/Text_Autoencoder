I previously wrote a review regarding this honey and the store from which it came.  Why it was not published, I can only guess. Once again, in a nutshell, honey is inedible, gritty, like sand or glass. Touch of Europe will not take it back. Never had this problem before.  The consumer takes a huge risk and a leap of faith when ordering online.  This company via Amazon did not deliver.  What's worse, is that they will not make good on the purchase..$40 for honey!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Will never order from Touch of Europe again. Amazon should drop them like a hot potato...takes away their credibility.  Let's see if this is published.
