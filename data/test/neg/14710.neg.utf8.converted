I followed the directions (2.5min) and very few kernels popped before everything started burning.  I usually pop Pop Secret Homestyle brand (4min) and it produces a few duds at the bottom but without any burning in my apartment sized microwave.  Orville PopUp Bowl just didn't pop.  It just burned.  And I tried 2 boxes before I threw everything out.  No more Orville for me. Back to Pop Secret.  Nice idea, epic failure in execution.
