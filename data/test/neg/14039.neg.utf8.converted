I was hoping that I'd finally found a sour candy with a little kick, but Toxic Waste wasn't it.  The taste was fine but it wasn't any more sour than a warhead.  The package has a scale on the back ranking your toughness based on whether or not you can keep one of these in your mouth 15, 30, 45, or 60 seconds.  Please.  There is a little sourness for the first five seconds, and then it's gone...completely gone.  It tastes like a regular hard candy after that.
