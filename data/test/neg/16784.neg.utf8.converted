I'm reviewing the whole package when I give it 2 stars.<br />First, I love the Baconnaise. It's all I use on hamburgers now. No mayonnaise, mustard or ketchup. I'm getting ready to order more of it. Personally, I don't find that it tastes like bacon, but I really like the flavor.<br />The lip balm, don't really care about, tastes like the baconnaise but I don't use it.<br />Now the bacon salt. The flavor of the three I tried was pretty good. The problem is after only a few days after opening them, they became completely solidified. I've tried to knock the bottles on the countertop to loosen it, didn't work, opened them up and used a butter knife to break it up and it's really sticky. Even after breaking it up with a knife, when trying to shake it out, nothing makes it, it just sticks together. Maybe I got a bad or old batch, not sure, but I would not waste my money on the bacon salt again.
