I love the Diet Berry Energy Drink for all the reasons mentioned here. However, please note that the "diet" Berry Energy Drink is no longer available at all and anyone who orders the product pictured here won't get it.<br /><br />Much to my dismay, Steaz decided to eliminate the "diet" version and replace it with a "zero" calorie drink.<br /><br />A few weeks ago, Whole Foods folks told me Steaz just made a packaging change, so thinking it was the original "diet" version, I bought 4 cartons. Not wanting to lug them back to the store when I found out that the "zero" version was not the usual "diet" version in a new can, and hoping that maybe the "zero" version was acquired taste, I drank all 16 cans. Ugh. Awful stuff. I'll never buy another "zero" version.<br /><br />I was delighted to see the "diet" version available on this site and odered some. I've just returned it because what was shipped was the "zero" version, not the "diet" version. I thought maybe someone in a warehouse just packed the box wrong, but after time on the phone with the supplier and emails with Steaz, it turns out that the "diet" version won't be available at all.<br /><br />Someone needs to update the photo on this site.
