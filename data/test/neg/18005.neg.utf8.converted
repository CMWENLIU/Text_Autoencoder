This stuff is called "Cook's Organic PURE Vanilla Powder" but it's definitely nothing of the sort. First of all, anyone should be weary of a "pure" vanilla powder that isn't dark brown/blackish in color. That should be the first give away. Cook's PURE Vanilla Powder is a white powder, and anyone who takes a moment to read the ingredient list should not be surprised to find that the #1 ingredient in this "PURE" Vanilla powder is, in fact, sucrose. That's right folks, it's sugar. Corn sugar. Cook's calls this product "a revolutionary vanilla and the first real alternative to pure vanilla extract" but the truth is there is nothing revolutionary here, and this is a horrible alternative to a perfectly fine product such as pure vanilla extract. As white as this powder appears by looking at the jar, one has to wonder just how much vanilla powder is actually even in there. It can't be much. Or maybe they bleached it?<br /><br />Anyone willing to shell out $55 for 4.9lbs. of corn sugar with a splash of vanilla will be very pleased with this product, but if one were to actually care about their health and well-being, it would be wise to stay clear of this product and purchase some REAL vanilla powder or a vanilla extract instead. (They do make vanilla extract without alcohol, for those trying to avoid it.)<br /><br />What we can learn from a product like this is the importance of reading labels. Always read the labels of products you intend on purchasing. Lesson learned? This stuff's junk. Go with another product.
