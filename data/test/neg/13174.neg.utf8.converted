Of the major brands that sell 100% juice, the Naked Juice has to be the worst I've tried.  The taste was horrible and the smell was foul- comparable to sour milk. Two separate containers and both had the same taste and smell. I will be avoiding this product, and will sooner drink the plastic tasting Zico.  I would recommend one of the others, 100% juice brands as an alternative.
