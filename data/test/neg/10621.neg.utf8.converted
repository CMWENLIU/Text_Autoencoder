The food was rotten/old. Not sure if that's amazons fault but thank god they gave me a refund. It smelled absolutely horrible. I tried to give her a can, or let her 'sniff' it, that looked and smelled normal and she looked at me like I was crazy. I would say almost clawed my eyeball out. I would've never let her actually eat it but I heard cats can smell CRAP food. Maybe I was just unlucky but based on that I'm never purchasing this crap again.
