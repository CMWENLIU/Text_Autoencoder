As a Senior citizen and diabetic who has loved peanut brittle, this was not at all what I expected. It was too thick to simply bite into and chew. I had the fear of breaking my dentures. I expected "thin & brittle" It was even too hard to simply "break", I honestly had to take a hammer to it. Not an enjoyable experience at all. Although it was a gift from my wish list, it was a total waste of money. I definitely would not recommend this to a friend.
