I bought this "ice cream" last week, hoping that it would taste alright.  I count calories religiously and was hoping that I could find a product that tasted decent, because I love ice cream.  However, this ice cream has almost on flavor and the texture is grainy.  After tasting  this product, I would rather have good ice cream every once in a while and in a smaller quantity.  This ice cream WAS NOT worth the 32 calories per serving.
