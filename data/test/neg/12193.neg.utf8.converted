Well One day during work i had some of these, so i thought i'd order a big bag.<br />This is the only one i saw with Prime membership so i ordered it asap. I disregarded the 1 star review about the candy melting and stuff, hoping it was a one time thing.<br />Well when i received my candy, it was melted together in several blocks. It seems the candys broke and the heat made them combine  into big chunks.<br /><br />I wish they wernt in such big chunks, but they were still good.
