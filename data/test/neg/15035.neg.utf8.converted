From all the other reviews here, I guess I am in the minority, because I didn't like the taste of this honey. At all. Ack. I had been eating the Y.S. raw honey, and loving it, but after reading about the health benefits of Manuka honey, thought I should try it. Wish I would have saved my money. It just doesn't taste right to me--almost has a funny aftertaste to it--like plastic or something, which in my book, shouldn't be there. In fairness, I had my cousin taste it and she thought it was delicious...maybe I just don't have discerning taste buds. I will gladly pass this expensive jar of honey on to her...
