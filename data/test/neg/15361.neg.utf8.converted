Someone gave me these chocolates for the holidays and they are terrifice.<br />I thought that ordering from Amazon would be great but...<br />It's the dead of winter here and the contents was one hard white block or ..something. The expiration date was two weeks from the date they arrived.<br />I returned them but I think that I will have to find them in local stores.<br /><br />They are..the best chocolates I've ever had when they are fresh.
