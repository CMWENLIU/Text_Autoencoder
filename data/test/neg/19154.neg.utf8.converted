Nasty. Absolutely NASTY! I can still smell it and I wish I couldn't. I only put a few drops of the sauce in because I hated the way it smelled, but I was still willing to give it a try because some great tasting things can smell bad.<br /><br />Nope... it was just as bad as it smelled. Extremely unnecessarily powerful flavor... kind of like drinking soy sauce and salt together. I guess someone might like it if their taste buds are numb.<br /><br />I will never touch another Annie Chun's product again because of this experience. I don't think their taste testers have my tastes because that was nasty to the EXTREME!<br /><br />If you buy this, then good luck.
