I purchased Smart Basics Aloe Vera juice directly through Vitacost. Usually I purchase Lily of The Desert brand Aloe Vera Juice and mostly through Vitacost. This brand, Smart Basics however does not include citric acid in their ingredients label BUT it is there. This juice is very tangy. Lily of The Desert uses citric acid to help stabilize their organic Aloe Vera juice but in smaller quantities. Smart Basics is a decent aloe vera juice but the very fact that this brand does not honestly list the citric acid and uses a higher percentage is enough reason to switch back to Lily Of The Desert.
