I purchased a 24 oz. box of Whitman's Chocolates on sale for $9.00 at a popular and well known national drug store chain.<br /><br />Although the use best before freshness date stamp was conveniently missing on the side of the box, it did contain the words 'BEST BEFORE'.  Nonetheless, the chocolates were very fresh and desirable in appearance.<br /><br />The box is made of high quality cardboard covered with sturdy brightly colored yellow paper.  The interior contains sectional trays that house each chocolate in a dark chocolate paper cup.<br /><br />This was an impulse purchase because I was being a bit nostalgic about the brightly colored yellow box with the signature Whitman's Sampler design.<br /><br />These chocolates simply do not taste good.  There was not one piece of chocolate in the box that was pleasant to consume.  This is the 12th time I have had this happen, but childhood memories keep me coming back--not anymore.<br /><br />I am dissappointed that the chocolates are no longer of the same high quality they once were when I was a child.<br /><br />The box notes that the chocolates contain nuts (almonds, pecans, cashews, peanuts, and walnuts), but the nuts were so crushed that they were unrecognizable both by sight and taste.<br /><br />The chocolates contain a great deal of salt (salt, sodium bensoate, sodium metabisufite, and potassium sorbate)--truth in labeling.<br /><br />They also contain a large number of artificial sugars and ingredients, e.g., sorbital, vanillin articial flavor, preservatives, FD & C red #40, sulfur dioxide,gum arabic, and mono and diglycerides, etc.<br /><br />Do not waste your money.  Buy a brand that contains less than 50 ingredients. I rate these chocolates 0/5 for consumption, flavor, and taste.  I rate these chocolates 5/5 for packaging, appearance, and appeal.  Perhaps the manufacturers may want to consider spending less on packaging and more on the actual product.
