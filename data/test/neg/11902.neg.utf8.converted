Was very disappointed to find that this product has high fructose corn syrup in it.  I don't know if this is common for all icing colors or not but I guess I figured since it was Kosher that maybe it wouldn't have those type of ingredients.  Wish I could return it but doesn't pay off because I would have to pay for shipping to return.
