Yes, these bars are reasonably good and your kids will probably eat them.  But they are not "healthy".  Brown rice is good for you, but these bars are coated in sugar.  When its called "cane juice" its still sugar, and organic foods can also be junk foods.  Cane juice is the second ingredient, which means there is way too much of it in there to be "good" for your kids.  Don't let ourself be fooled into thinking this is a healthy choice  - its organic junk food.
