I bought two different flavors of Vita gravy, and I couldn't get either of my cats to even take a lick of them, despite how I served them. I tried to put some on their dry food, they actually didn't eat for hours until I replaced it with just dry food. I tried offering it up solo, to no avail. And I put some on a bit of lettuce, but they still wouldn't take the bait.<br /><br />I imagine it smells like plastic to them, but both my cats don't go near it after smelling Vita Gravy. I can understand Allstar not liking it - he's... special (which is why I call him "Allstar"). He's squeamish and weird and he only eats his regular food in small portions throughout the day; never more than a couple of bites at once. If I offer him wet food, he just licks the gravy from that and leaves the meaty portion to Agnes.<br /><br />Agnes, on the other hand, is a 20 lb vacuum. I've had to pull string out of her anus because she ingested it and couldn't quite push it out of herself. Come to think of it, she doesn't mind chewing on plastic either, so I'm not sure what about Vita Gravy is so unappetizing to her, especially considering what I've shared.<br /><br />I don't know if other cats go for it, but I have two VERY different cats of my own and neither will eat Vita Gravy. My advice: Bad buy.
