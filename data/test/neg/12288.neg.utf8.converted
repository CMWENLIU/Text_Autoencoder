I tried to cancel shortly after ordering this product to find that it had already shipped.  After receiving it the packaging was simply a plain manilla envelope and a box, no lining, no bubble packing.  One pop was completely broken off of the stick, there are several others with chips and chunks broken off floating around loosely in the individual package.  If I use them they will have to be opened and removed from the individual package.  I am not happy with any aspect of this order.  I won't be ordering again.  I paid for 12 expecting to use 12, unfortunately that won't be the case.
