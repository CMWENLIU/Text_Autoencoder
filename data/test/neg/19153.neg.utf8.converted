The good: This stuff is really well packaged and easy to make in the office. It comes in a biodegradable microwave-safe bowl, which is pretty awesome.<br /><br />The bad: It tastes nothing like pad thai.<br /><br />The ugly: It tastes awful, I don't know they managed to do this using natural ingredients - but it tastes very unnatural and leaves a lingering aftertaste. It will also help you continue on your way to hypertension and that first heart attack by giving you 60% of your sodium RDA in every bowl!
