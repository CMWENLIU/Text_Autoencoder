There's a strange orange-red oily film on the top.  It's really gross if you don't open the can before opening.<br /><br />I would send this soup back if I got it at a Thai restaraunt.  I thought maybe the first few cans were bad, but the whole case was like this.  It doesn't taste anywhere close to what I expect from Thai food.  Just oil, a bit of coconut, a teeny bit of curry.  It's mostly flavorless oil.<br /><br />There is barely any tofu or veggies.  There are so many much better choices out there.  Skip this one.
