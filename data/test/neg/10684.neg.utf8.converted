just what the title says. the jars are sooo small 8oz, i used one jar up for 2 batches of soup. 5 quart pot at a time. way too expensive for so little in each jar. i went online and found that you can easily make your own for a fraction of the price. just puree all kinds of veggies in food processor and add alot of salt, some pepper, ext. let sit in fridge and thats your bullion. add little bit to flavor soups, sauces, ext. preserve some in freezer and use the rest.<br />easy and way, way cheaper then these jars, plus homemade is fresh.
