The first ingredient in this formulation is mineral oil - olive oil is the fourth. I was underwhelmed by the results of using this oil; a little goes a long way but it basically coats your hair.<br /><br />I don't consider mineral oil a "nourishing" property. This oil only gave my hair some sheen. I csn't say it contributed to the overall health of my hair any and it definitely didn't diminish the winter breakage. I feel better adding a little extra virgin olive oil to my hair conditioner. That yields far better results.
