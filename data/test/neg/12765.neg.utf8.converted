I've bought and enjoyed Newman's Own products in the past, and I like that their profits are donated to charity.  And I like cookies of all types and flavors.  So, I requested these cookies ... Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps ... to review as part of the Amazon Vine program.  After receiving these, I gathered the family test team to try them.<br /><br />First the good.  The cookies are a little over an inch in diameter, and perhaps an eight of an inch thick, a good size for a snack cookie. They have a strong ginger and molasses flavor, which is critical for a good gingersnap cookie.  And the cookies are made from organic ingredients.  That about sums up the good.<br /><br />Now for the bad.  The cookies were very hard and almost unchewable.  They were a dark brown on top and almost black on the bottom, as in they might have been really overbaked.  The molasses and ginger had a harsh flavor, with an unpleasant aftertaste that takes awhile to fade.  Again, it was almost as if they'd been baked to the point of being burnt.  My wife, who loves the occasional ginger snap, immediately commented that these were the worst gingersnap cookies she'd ever had. My youngest son, who's never met a treat he didn't like, refused a second cookie.  None of my crack test team liked them or wanted more.  So I've eaten the rest of the bag myself, partly to see if they grew on me, and partly to make sure that it just wasn't a few bad cookies.  Unfortunately, they neither grew on me or nor got any better the deeper into the bag I ate.<br /><br />I'm thinking maybe I got a bad bag of cookies ... I have a tough time believing a firm with the deserved good reputation as Newman's Own would consider what I received to be something they'd put their good name to.  But I have to rate what I've been provided, and I'm giving them a generous two stars.
