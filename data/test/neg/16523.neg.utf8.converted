If you are expecting a cup of low carb macaroni with cheese, this is not it!  The cup consist of a powder with super thin (looks like broken up sewing needles) pieces of pasta (I used the term pasta VERY loosely).  Once prepared, it turns into a cup of gooey, gloppy substance with virtually no presence of pasta.  It was like eating a cup of super thick, gooey soup.  The flavor was not bad, but other than that this product is quite horrid.  If I was able to give it a no star rating, I would.  I'm so glad I only order one cup to try.  I will definitely not order it again.  That being said, I have had many other good products from the Dixie Carb Counters product line, so this product is an exception.
