I loved the cacao nib granola by 18 Rabbits. I also love cherries and vanilla, so I had high hopes for this stuff. Nope. I think there was maybe one teeny Bing cherry hiding in the first bag I opened. Then I looked into the other two bags for something cherrylike. Nope. Nothing. Very disappointed in that. The flavor is also rather bland, without a noticeable vanilla kick. Maybe it's a bum batch, but I'll not be purchasing this flavor again. I will stick with the fantastic Nature's Harvest granola varieties, also lower in calories and fat than many granola products out there and with a generous inclusion of fruit and nuts.
