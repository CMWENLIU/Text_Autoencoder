I've stopped buying Dingo products when I noticed that they were being made in China.  I was on their website, and they answered one of the posters that was concerned about it, essentially stating that they test the products rigorously and go through strict quality control.  That's a bunch of CRAP !! They started making them in China to SAVE MONEY, they are not about to SPEND those savings on testing and quality control. What they do is GAMBLE that the products will be okay, and if they aren't they just RECALL them, write off the loss, and it's just too bad for the poor little pets that end up with life threatening illnesses.  Our government doesn't do anything about it, because our government is OWNED by Corporations, far be it for them to interfere with the Almighty Multi-National Corporations.<br />  I'm not taking ANY chances with MY dogs, I care for them way too much, to buy something that was processed in some factory in China that processes everything under the sun, from car batteries, to baby food. If there's some cross-contamination going on, it probably won't be discovered until it's already too late for SOME pets.
