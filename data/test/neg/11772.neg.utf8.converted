These are delicious and hot, but they were very poorly packaged. About 70% of the rings are broken into small pieces. I paid for Funyun RINGS, not Funyun particles.<br /><br />If a vendor has so little respect for his customers as to not correct the problem even after other reviewers have also given negative reviews for the same reason, they are hopeless in my opinion.<br /><br />I should have heeded the warning, but unfortunately, these are hard to find. I rolled the dice hoping they'd addressed the problem, and I lost.<br /><br />I will not purchase from this vendor again.
