Everyone knows now that the brand name is San Marzano, but these tomatoes are not grown in this region of Italy nor are they from San Marzano seed. All in all, the product is a round, domestic tomato with added preservatives. What I don't understand is how they can say these are grown from San Marzano seed. If they were from San Marzano seed wouldn't they have an elongated shape rather than a round one? I'm also surprised at how many people think the DOP stamp on other Italian tomatoes are some sort of guarantee of quality. The fact is there are more cans of DOP Italian tomatoes being sold than DOP tomatoes being grown in Italy. You do the math. Most DOP products also have added preservatives and basil. I personally look for natural brands at my local Italian deli for the best luck with tomatoes. The best thing is to try several brands and decide for  yourself.
