I saw this in my inbox and I was ready to wake the kids and alert the relatives.<br />Then I saw the price. Yikes! Costco has Vitamin Water and Vitamin Water Zero on sale for<br />$13.50 right now (15/20). So I will just assume that Amazon hired a proofreader from the NY<br />Post and write it off to a rare Amazon slip-up.
