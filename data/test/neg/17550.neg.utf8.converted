I received this product as a gift. I have baked scones from scratch many times and have eaten other prepared scones and bakery scones. These scones, in general, are unremarkable - OK, but nothing extraordinary. If you truly know what a scone should be, please do not be lead astray by its attractive packaging or the gloating reviews it received.<br /><br />This scone mix does have some merits. First, its ease of preparation of just adding water made quick work and a marketable selling point. Next, the scones do bake up tender as a scone should be. The ingredients are on the whole, and for the most part natural without unnecessary stabilizers and dough conditioners. I applaud any baking mix today that doesn't resort to artificial ingredients or preservatives.<br /><br />This is a shelf-stable mix so therefore a crucial ingredient, like butter, is substituted with cheaper canola oil. This sacrifices flavor and texture. There was an insufficient amount fruit in the scone. Since it was a gift, I do not know the exact price for the product, but from what I see being sold at Amazon, it is not economical. You could easily make your own scones resulting in higher quality and quantity. Scones are actually simple baked goods because there is not much to them that requires much time. The simplicity of them makes them divine and something not to skimp upon.
