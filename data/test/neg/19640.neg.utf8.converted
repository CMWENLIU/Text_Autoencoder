I love french roast coffee, but this is probably the worst I've ever tried. There are distinct smokey overtones, unfortunately those smokey overtones seem to have been produced by a stack of burning tires. Never before have I tasted anything that was so distinctly like the smell over burning rubber. Seriously, I was super excited to find some cheap french roast but this is just awful. Splurge if you have to on something which is possible to drink more than a few sips of.
