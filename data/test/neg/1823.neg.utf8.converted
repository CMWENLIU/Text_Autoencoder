Do not buy these!!!!<br />And if you think you can ignore all the negative reviews, just because you so sorely wanted a pasta substitute, you'll be extremely disappointed. What's amazing is that even many of the 4 and 5 star reviewers admit to the things tasting horrible. But still, because they're labeled as 'noodles', some people will maintain a willingness to force them down.....such is the lure  of Pasta!<br /> I suppose you could freeze fecal matter and sell it as ice cream and  some people would choose  to eat it if they desperately craved ice cream and wanted to believe the packaging.<br /><br />These are shaped like noodles.<br />All resemblance to any type of real noodle ends there.<br /><br />Horrible smell....as noted here,gags many people.Smells like a fish that rotted in a beaker of benzene<br />Horrible texture....like a scary foreign body in your food.<br />No flavor (beyond the obnoxious smell) They don't really absorb any flavor either. The sauce just coats the outside, and in eating, any  sauce  quickly departs the  noodle surface and you're left with this disgusting mass of  slimy rubber  worms in your mouth. Even well rinsed, the weird fishy smell remains in your olfactory memory throughout the meal, thereby  eliciting a constant, low order,  gag reflex as you try to chew these things.<br /><br />Somehow I pushed the order button twice...so I'll be throwing out $60 worth of 'food',. Not sure I want them in my garbage can. I may have to drive them straight to the local land fill.<br />I didn't expect greatness from a zero calorie noodle, but I really hoped these things would  at least be a palatable substitute.....not even close.<br /><br />Proving again; there's no such thing as a free lunch.
