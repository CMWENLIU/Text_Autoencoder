They were giving away samples at Costco. My daughter is 5 and has never had a nut allergy but she did with this product. So even though she doesn't have a peanut allergy, she must be allergic to one of the other nuts in this bar. It started with major stomach pains then she started itching and got a HORRIBLE rash all over her body. Then her breathing sounded as if she was having an asthma attack (which she doesn't have asthma but that's what it sounded like). Luckily I realized it before she went to bed and gave her some benedryl but it was a very scary moment for us.
