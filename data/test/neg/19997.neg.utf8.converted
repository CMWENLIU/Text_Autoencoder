I purchase a case of this at a time as I drink iced tea in the summer and winter.  Previously Celestial Seasonings had a Blueberry Iced Tea and this new version is a Blueberry Ice GREEN tea.  I loved the old version and really do not like the new version.  The previous iced tea was really "blueberry" in taste, color and odor.  It was much smoother.  The new tea is simply not good - definitey not very blueberry-like.  I am exploring just purchasing their regular blueberry tea (not iced) from here on in.
