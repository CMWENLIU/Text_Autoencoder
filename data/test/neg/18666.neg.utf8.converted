I'm a big fan of Lapsang Souchong tea; have been drinking it since LBJ was in office. That said, Twinings version is dreadful. The tea itself seems to be of low quality, and as one other reviewer suggested, the "smoke" seems to be out of a chemistry set, very artificial, burnt, and harsh tasting rather than a rich, smoky taste. Maybe they smoke it over discarded tires.<br /><br /> My favorite Lapsangs to date have been Wagner's loose (now out of business, apparently), and Numi's tea bags. Unfortunately, Numi discontinued their bags a while back, and for some reason, their loose tea doesn't seem the equal, which is pretty weird. Still, Numi is quite good, and far better than Twining's pathetic effort.
