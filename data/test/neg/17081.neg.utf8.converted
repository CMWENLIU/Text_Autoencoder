I love tea.  I have at least 10 different types of tea at home at any time.  I rarely try a tea I don't like.  But this one (Russian Caravan) defies all rules - it's so strong (not as in "strong tea" but as in "strong flavor"), it's impossible to drink without some preparation.  One friend of mine calls it "camel feet" tea, and I'm afraid in this case, I have to agree.
