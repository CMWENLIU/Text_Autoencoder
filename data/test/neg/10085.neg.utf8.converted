Breakfast blend is no longer the mild coffee flavor that I have come to enjoy for the past few years. It is now a medium coffee with noticeable burnt flavor along with some bitterness. I don't know why Starbucks messed with a good thing but after reading that their new line of blonde coffees offers no taste at all I will now be forced into looking for a new mild blend of coffee. I bought mine from target with the new packaging that says medium. I hope Starbucks returns to the original formula that made Breakfast blend so good.
