Me and my girlfriend were eager to try these out as they had three foods we like:  marshmallow, coconut, and chocolate.<br /><br />These candies somehow were able to disgust us.  They tasted old and the marshmallow inside had the most vile consistency.  To top it off, you could NOT even taste any of the coconut.<br /><br />Now i have a box of these nasty things sitting my drawer, I wouldn't even give these to my least liked friends.  They are that terrible.<br /><br />These were truly a disappointment.  I now know better to blindly trust the judgement of other shoppers of Amazon even when they all say the product is great.<br /><br />Just remember next time you see all the reviews on a product that are claiming its the best candy ever....caveat emptor.
