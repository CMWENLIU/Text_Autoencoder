These protein chips definately weren't that great.  I can't say they were awful but they have a really grainy dry kinda taste.  I think they would be good with dips, but I have only eaten them plain.  I ordered the 12 pack and still have 11 boxes left lol.  I would recommend sampling them somehow, try 1 box if you can, instead of 12!
