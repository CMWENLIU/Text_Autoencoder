I had purchased the small boxes of this tea at my local market and thought it is the best Earl Grey tea ever.  So, I ordered the 100 count from Amazon.  While the packaging on the individual bags looks very similar, this is not the same tea; it  the worst tea I have ever had, with a strong unpleasant taste and does not taste like Earl Grey.  I am very disappointed and feel very ripped off.
