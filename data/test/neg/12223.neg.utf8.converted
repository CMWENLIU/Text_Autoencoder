Well, the good news is, it does what it's supposed to, making yogurt thicken to the consistency we tend to like it.  The bad news is, it's not much more than just simply super expensive powdered milk.  I remember long ago when dry milk was a staple that was given out at food banks, etc., and was a super cheap commodity.  Now, it's hard to find and extremely costly, but at least you get a lot of it when you do buy a box of it.  This starter is teeny tiny and makes one batch, more than doubling the cost of the yogurt.  Next time around, I tried a little gelatin, and it worked exactly the same way.
