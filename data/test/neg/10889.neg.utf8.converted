Now why would the description say it's a great alternative to milk when it contains milk by products!?! Annoying! Now I have to waste time returning it.<br />Update: This company was extremely difficult to deal with. They argued with me about it containing milk when it says right on the ingredient list that it contains a "milk derivative". When I refused to pay for return shipping they claimed to not know how to give me a shipping label. Their email responses did not even make sense much of the time, nor were they timely. After 15 emails and almost a month of being patient I had to file a claim with Amazon to get my money returned. Amazon credited my card within a couple of days and I'll just give the product to a food bank. This was not my usual experience in dealing with Amazon merchants. They are usually much better.
