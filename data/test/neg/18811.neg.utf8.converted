Ordered this as a gift for someone.  The box was supposed to contain three holiday flavors of coffee: eggnog, gingerbread, and french toast.  There were supposed to be 16 of each flavor.  The box contained 16 of the french toast, and 32 of the gingerbread.  No eggnog in the box.  Unfortunately, the gingerbread flavor is not good.  A couple of folks tried the gingerbread and we found it had an aftertaste that is not enjoyable.  So, a wasted purchase as 2/3 of the box is not going to be used.  Not worth it.
