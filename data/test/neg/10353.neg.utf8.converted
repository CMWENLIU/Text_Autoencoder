I initially tried this product because it seemed like a good deal.  I was very disappointed in the quality of the sun dried tomatoes.  Having previosuly purchased the California Sun Dried Tomatoes, I had high expectations.  The texture and taste of the roland did not compare and they were covered in tomato seeds.  If you are interested in better quality, I recommend the California Sun Dried Tomatoes.
