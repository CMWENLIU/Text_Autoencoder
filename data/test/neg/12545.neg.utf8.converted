These soups are listed in the gluten free foods. Please read ingredients. This is an example of incorrect listings. If you have celiac disease, as I do, do not assume foods that are listed in this category are truly gluten free. And, Amazon, please find a way to better regulate this. By the way, the one star rating has nothing to do with the soup, I cannot eat this, the rating is for the listing.
