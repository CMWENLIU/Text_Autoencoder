I've gotten Yummy Chummies many times before for my dog who loves them.  This time I ordered them on line and paid quite a bit more for them including shipping.  When I received them I opened them to give one to my dog I found out they were very hard.  Not soft and chewy as they advertise and I'd found them in the past.  :-(  I'm not sure I'll order them on line again.
