My husband and I are on Atkins and decided to try these "noodles".  I'd rather make "pasta" out of zucchini or some other veggie.  I prepped it as per the instructions.  I rinsed it longer than necessary, boiled it for a minute and then decided to pan fry it for good measure.  I made an alfredo sauce for it and tossed some in while in the pan since it's supposed to absorb flavors.  My husband took one bite and said no way.  He couldn't get past the texture.  I mixed it with the sauce and some grilled chicken, but had to stop eating it.  It made me gag after a while.  I tried so hard to like it, but just couldn't.  I'll wait a few weeks 'till I can have the low carb pasta.  This is totally not worth it.  Sadly, I ordered it from the Miracle Noodle site so I have several bags left.  I may try again, but most likely they will end up in the trash.
