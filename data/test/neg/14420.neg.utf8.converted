I've been a subscriber for three shipments and the most recent shipment of two bags was substantially worse than the previous shipments.  Many of the berries are black and look rotten and many are sticky and clumped together.  Very disappointing versus the previous shipments.  I noticed a few other people have gotten rotten berries as well.  Perhaps a rise in popularity is hurting quality.
