Why they call this Cafe Mocha is beyond me.<br />Yes, it tastes like watery hot chocolate with a hint of weak coffee.<br />But if you were to open the package, you won't find any coffee grounds,<br />instead you will find POWDERED COCOA MIX that evaporates when it fills with water.<br />Now I don't mind paying $10.00+ for a box of decent coffee,<br />but to find out that the pods don't even contain any coffee really ticked me off.<br />And with that, I hope to have saved you the trouble of ordering this junk.<br />Cheers!
