I purchased this tea, because I was hoping it was the bulk version of my favorite tea, this stuff:<br />[...]<br />which is sold by the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf (I have no idea if this is the same company that sells this product; which is from the Coffee Bean Direct). The other tea is incredible, this stuff is not as great. The smell of it is pretty identical to bubblegum, and the taste is just not quite as subtle or delicious, and also tastes a tad more chemically. The bottom line is that some may love this tea, I just prefer other varieties of Passion Fruit / Tropical Blend tea by a wide margin.<br />On the other hand, the price I paid for it seemed quite reasonable for 20oz of tea, and further each comes in a handy resealable pouch.
