I thought these looked perfect for training so I gave them a try.  The problem is that even in a sealed bag inside a separate sealed ziplock, the smell of these treats is unbearable.  We tried keeping them in the car, but the car would retain the horrible smell for days.  We eventually ending up keeping them in a sealed container in the back yard until the bag was gone.  If you touch them with your fingers, your hand will smell of them until you can wash your hands.  Disappointing as they are a perfect size for training, but I will not buy them again.  I wish they would make a similar treat without the odor.
