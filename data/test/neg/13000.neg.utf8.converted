so far i have bought the ran and meda watte varieties, as well as the supreme ceylon, several other Dilmah over the counter teas.<br /><br />this tea is more tannic and of lower quality than the dilmah ceylon i can get at our local indian grocery store. its is finely powdered in a nice tin, but its not in a sealed bag. thats a bummer when you have to  buy three and they sit around for a while
