Look at the ingredients, folks! How many different types of sugars and syrups are in there? If you think this is healthy, you are wrong!<br />Now if you want a sweet candy bar, this stuff is great. It does taste good, just please don't think you are doing your body a favor by eating these over loose, lightly sweetened granola or a bowl of fresh fruit or vegetables :)
