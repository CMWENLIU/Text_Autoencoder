I'm utterly baffled by the positive reviews for this product.<br /><br />Now I've been using Stevia for the past year to sweeten my coffee. I have no issue with the Stevia.<br /><br />I used to drink a lot of soda, and then a few years back, a lot of diet soda. Since then, I've been able to give up soda altogether. But my Dad who is diabetic, is absolutely obsessed with diet coke. I've been trying to get him to lessen his diet coke intake (which is 1-2 a day) but he just waves me off. So I did some research, read the reviews, and bought 2 packs of the cola and lemon flavor each. I tried both to see how they tasted and was totally confused by this tasteless carbonated water. There was no taste! It literally just tasted like carbonated water with a vague hint of some flavor. I can't imagine anyone WANTING to drink this stuff, let alone rave about it.<br /><br />Did I get a bad batch? My Dad will never be able to transition from diet coke to this stuff, cause this stuff is truly awful.<br /><br />So disappointing. :(
