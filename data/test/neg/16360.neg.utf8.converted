I ordered this item from this seller based on their good customer rating. With that being said, I recieved the order within a reasonable time. However, the items recieved were not as described. I got 12 boxes of regular baking soda, not fridge n freezer which is described. Worse yet, all 12 boxes were expired by 1 year. Stamped on the bottom was hh 2011. The order was in June 2012.<br /><br />To be fair, the seller appoligized & issued a refund without need of a return. As luck would have it, I found the item I wanted at just .89 cent a box at a local retailer! Just be aware of what can happen.
