As a red Twizzler addict I saw the "rainbow twist" bag in the store and just had to check it out.  I tried each flavor.  Allegedly, and even that is being generous, they are blue raspberry (huh?), watermelon, grape, lemonade, strawberry, and orange.  They all tasted pretty much the same to me.  The consistency is nothing like normal Twizzlers which tend to be firm - these are on the mushy side.<br /><br />If you're going to be bad and eat junk food like this at least it should taste good.  I threw the bag out.
