We had used this product for over a year, along with another leading brand.  Our cat is a bit on the heavy side, so 'weight control' really appealed to us.  The food IS low in calories, make no mistake.  But looking at the first five ingredients - the ones the food contains most of - is a horror show! " Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn Meal, Corn Grits, Ground Whole Grain Sorghum, Dried Beet Pulp".  Not a single reliable meat (only by-product meal) in the bunch, and two corn-based fillers in the top three ingredients.<br />Oh, Caesar ate this fine...though he often would take only small feedings at a time, he'd eventually finish most of it by tbe next mealtime.  After doing some research, I switched him to another brand that has better ingredients (no by-products and no corn based fillers), and he eats it passionately!  It has more calories, but we actually feed him less.  He seems to have a bit more energy too!<br />Please don't take my word for it, as I am not a vet or a scientist.  If you do a bit of research, I think you'll probably steer clear of this food.
