These noodles come packed in liquid. When I opened one of the packeges, I was assulted by a pungent chemical odor. Even after washing then in running water (according to the direction), the smell didn't go away. Even after boiling them for a while the smell lingered. After I mixed them with some sauce, the smell went away, but they were still unedible: rubbery and tasteless. I threw away all of them.
