These bread crumbs taste great and bake well.  I'm only able to give this product 1 star because the plastic bag which holds the bread crumbs inside the box, is not sealed completely.  There is a 3/4" gap at the top of the seam that runs up and down the bag.  I ordered this product thru the subscription so I received 3 boxes in one shipment.  All three boxes had the same gap (opening) in the plastic bag. This product needs to be completely sealed to ensure freshness and self-stability.
