I just got my Cuisinart Keurig in this past weekend.  I was really looking forward to trying this one so I bought a sample pack from a store.  I won't be buying any more of these that's for sure!<br /><br />I have to say - it reminded me of the International Instant coffees you find in the Grocery stores.  For as much money as the cups cost - just go buy those international instant coffees instead.<br /><br />I'm a big coffee drinker and this wasn't close to anything that I expected...YUCK!
