There is a way to "oil cure" olives, and once done, the result is a lightly salted, meaty olive that still has a lot of flesh. This isn't that olive. It is salt-cured. The result is a dried out, very salty, leathery skin. Once cured, they wash off the salt and put oil on the olives.<br /><br />There is a place for salt-cured olives, but not when the title is "oil-cured".
