My husband and I started feeding our dogs this food about six months ago based on good reviews on the internet. They never tolerated it well and were always getting diarrhea on and off. Last month there was a recall on this specific formula so we took our dogs off of it and their diarrhea was instantly cured and now they are doing great. I will never ever buy this brand of food again. This formula is hard to find online right now - I'm not sure they are going to sell it again. Sorry my dogs were guinea pig test subjects yet again for the dog food industry.
