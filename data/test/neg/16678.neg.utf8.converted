I might have missed the nutrtional information, but just as a warning to other - this is not a low carb food.  One serving has over 30 grams of carbohydrate.  Even if you subtract the 11 grams of sugar alcohol and 1 gram of fibre, you're still in the 20 gram range for each serving.  I'm not sure what the point of this product is, but if you are trying to find food for a low carb diet, this is not your product.<br /><br />I can't rate the taste or ease of preparation as we're not going to eat it.  Because, you know, even though it says it is sugar-free, it still has over 20 grams of carbs per serving!!!!
