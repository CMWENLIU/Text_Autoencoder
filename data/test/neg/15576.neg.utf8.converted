Please be aware that the 'Low Fat' variety of this product is NOT the same as the standard 'FriChik'. Whatever is removed to be able to sport the 'Low Fat' moniker makes a world of difference. Standard FriChiks are delicious while the 'Low Fat' variety are drier and less tasty (savory). I hope someone at Amazon will take notice and start offering the standard FriChik.
