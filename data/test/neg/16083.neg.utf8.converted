I know that it's ridiculous to write a review of bottled water. It appears that I am the first to review it as well. I have to say it though to save others from making the same mistake. The bottles do not stand up. The plastic is so pliable that when you remove the bottle from the case and try to stand it on a flat surface, it will fall over. No matter how I have tried to squash the bottle flat on a table, it will fall over. It's frustrating and annoying. I will never buy Aquafina again. I'm sure the plastic is "green" or whatever but I'd like it if the bottle would stand up.
