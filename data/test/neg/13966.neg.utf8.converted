Ive been searching for a chocolate coffee creamer for a while - when I saw this product on Amazon,<br />I couldn't wait to get it!  But sadly, I should have known better - to me, ALL the International Delight creamers taste the same, as if they all start with the same basic creamer recipe (which has a readily identifiable flavor) and just add in the extra flavoring for whatever batch they're making.  I also found this creamer to be sorely lacking in chocolate flavor.  When you pour it out, it has such a thick, dark look that it comes as a surprise that the creamer has such an underwhelming chocolate flavor.<br />I took the rest of the 288 creamers to work for everyone to use, and the box is still there after 3 weeks barely half empty.  Apparently even when free this stuff doesn't delight.  If you really want great chocolate flavor in your coffee, add some extra dark chocolate syrup - don't bother with this stuff.
