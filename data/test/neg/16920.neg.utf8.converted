Very low quality. Candy arrived in a plain, transparent plastic bag with no markings except stock number.  No country of origin, no brand name, no ingredient list, no description, no dates, nothing !  The black licorice (I really doubt it is licorice) tasted disgusting with an after taste that lasted for an hour.  The colored pieces were all smeared with the black licorice making the entire mess very unappealing looking.  The black pieces were also stuck together in clumps. I've had good licorice and bad - this is the worse I've ever had the misfortune of trying.  It was supposed to be Bassett's brand, a decent product, I can't believe it really is.  Also, another reviewer mentioned it looked like floor sweepings, I think they are right.<br /><br />One final question:  How can a 5 lb bag of candy have a shipping weight of 4.6 lbs ?
