The reason for 2 star is basically since the product return to the shelf, the milk is not foamy!  It is flat no matter how much I had shaken the creamer.  Also, I had purchased 2 and only received one package!  This one package came early, which was great but the 2nd package has not as yet arrived.  Why did not both package were pack together.  I used to enjoy this product so much that I did not mind the cost.  Now I am not sure.  Recommend:  Not sure either.
