I was disappointed in the packaging as the Oats were in a simple plastic bag that was overfilled and a plain cardboard box that barely held together.  When I opened the package, the oats spilled all over because the plastic bag ripped from the excessive bulge .  I had to do a bunch of unnecessary cleanup that could have easily been avoided with proper packaging.  Will not order any more oats unless vendor sends me a complementary package.
