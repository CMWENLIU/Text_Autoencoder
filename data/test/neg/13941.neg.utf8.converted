This product has totally fallen apart over the past year, it no longer comes out of the bottle in drops. It squirts out like mustard. It has all the sweetening power  of water. Complete waste of money. Used almost all of one whole bottle to sweeten one cup of coffee and still had to add a Splenda packet besides. Throwing out remaing bottles. Don't waste your money
