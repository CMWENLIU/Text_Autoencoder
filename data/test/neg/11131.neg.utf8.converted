The meat in THK dehydrated diets is not raw. It it would not be a human grade food if the meat were actually raw. The manufacturer told me that the meat in their food is "dehydrated" at a temperature that actually cooks the meat and that is how it is able to be labeled human grade. If this is the case, why use the word "Raw" over and over again in the advertising and ingredient list. It's not raw and it's not as good as raw.<br /><br />Secondly, and perhaps just as important, is that the consumer is paying for things their pet can't digest. The consumer pays for the very expensive dehydration process for VEGETABLES and other things that carnivores cannot digest and do not need. The only way to get the nutrients out of vegetables, fruits and seeds, and into a dog's system is to puree the vegetables and break down the cellulose or to COOK them. From I can tell, neither of these things are done to the vegetables. Ironically, the part of the THK diet that shouldn't be raw is, and the meat, which should be raw, isn't.<br /><br />The fact that a great deal of the honest kitchen diets are not digested is pretty obvious to people who feed it to their dogs. You can clearly see the celery, bananas, and other whole chunks of vegetable/fruit that come out in the stool. If you happen to take a look at the stool after a bit of rain has washed away the smooshy parts, you will see mounds of undigested vegetable matter that seem to equal 80% of the total volume. So not only are you feeding something that isn't being digested, but you are feeding lots of it. Why would you pay for something that is completely wasted?<br /><br />I know several dogs who are or were on THK who presented with hot spots, fleas, allergies, and other chronic conditions that didn't exist when they were on raw diets. I have seen it over, and over again.  After seeing what I've seen, I could never go back to feeding a dehydrated diet from this manufacturer. I do see some promise in the Ziwi Peak line and Stella and Chewy's, so you might want to try those out and stop paying for chunky veggies your dog can't digest.<br /><br />It is far less expensive to feed a raw diet of human grade meats and bone from your grocery store. You would probably pay 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of THK diets. You would even save money if you went with a pre-packaged frozen raw diet such as Primal or Nature's Variety. I know a lot of people feed THK because they are afraid to feed real raw meat, but I pray that will change. THK is making millions, and for that they should be commended. They shed blood, sweat, and tears to create a market for their food and I know that was hard work. But they are/were doing it dishonestly. On top of that, they have the gall to name themselves honest. Yikes.<br /><br />To THK,<br />If you care to tell us exactly what temperatures or radiation your meat is exposed to prior to packaging, and issue a statement that states your finished product contains non-irradiated, raw meat, I'll be happy to edit my review. Since meat begins to undergo chemical changes at 120
