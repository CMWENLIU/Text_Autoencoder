Getting syrups is a must to properly enjoy your sodamaker, which is a great buy. I have the Penguin model, and I absolutely love it.<br /><br />However...the Sodastream Sodamix Variety 12-Pack has let me down twice now. When I first ordered it, it came a sticky mess - one of the packets had burst open. I returned it. The second time I ordered it, the box was merely soiled. Another packet had been punctured. The rest were ok, and I didn't have enough confidence in them to return it for another variety pack in the mail.<br /><br />Make sure to never order this item with other items, lest they be damaged in transit. If you do, request that they ship it separately. You've been warned.
