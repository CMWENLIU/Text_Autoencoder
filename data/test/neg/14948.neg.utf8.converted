Well, just be sure that you dont mind ordering bulk and getting an entirely different product than you ordered!!! ~Amazon.com sellers' return policy doesn't allow returns. I ordered Palak Paneer cans in count 12 but recieved 12 count of Mughal Shahi Rajma.  A dish I have absolutely no interest in and never would have ordered.
