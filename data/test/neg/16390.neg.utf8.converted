This was a fine product. The amount of salt was recently reduced<br />by 30%. To me it tastes like a 75% reduction. It can no longer be called<br />a "SALTY STIX". The new name should be the "BARELY SALTED THIN DIET PRETZEL".<br /><br />I complained about the lack of salt and they stated that customers wanted<br />a less salty pretzel. They also sent me another case of the "BARELY<br />SALTED THIN DIET PRETZELS". More trash.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LS2PEG">HK Anderson Salty Stix, 3.5-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JRRUG">ANDERSON SALTY STIX BOX</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L7HZ8U">HK Anderson Ultrathin Pretzel Stix, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>
