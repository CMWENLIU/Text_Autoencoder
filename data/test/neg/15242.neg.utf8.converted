Splenda is the best-tasting artifical sweetener that I've tasted. So why give the Splenda blend only two stars? Two reasons: a recent article in the New Yorker revealed that some of the chemists who develop artificial sweeteners--at least, one who was interviewed for the story--won't eat them because they cannot predict the long-term effects, and they are apparently afraid that there will be unpleasant consequences. Not an unreasonable concern, given the checkered past of artificial sweeteners in general. Full disclosure: I eat Splenda (though not the Splenda blends) because I KNOW sugar is bad for me, whereas we still don't know if Splenda is bad or not. I'm taking a chance and I have to accept the consequences.<br /><br />That said, calorie-counting consumers who read labels know that when the company says "a half-cup [of the blended product] replaces a full cup of brown sugar," it applies to the calorie content, too. Which means that if you eat equal amounts of sugar and Splenda blend, you get more calories from the Splenda blend than you would from pure sugar. No kidding! Sugar has 15 calories per teaspoon, while the Splenda blends (white and brown) have 20 calories per teaspoon. Supposedly you can use less of the Splenda blend because it is "stronger" than sugar--but I can't tell it. I would just as soon have regular sugar if the Splenda blend has more calories, especially given the risks. Bottom line for me: Enjoy Splenda . . . but take it with a grain of salt.
