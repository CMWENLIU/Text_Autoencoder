Don't waste your money.  This is supposed to be Rosemary & Basil bread mix but it has only a miniscule hint of Rosemary flavor and forget the Basil.  Secondly, there is supposed to be a packet of yeast "in the box" but there was not a single packet of yeast in any of the four packages that comprised the order.  I called the company just to make sure that the yeast was not included in the mix itself and the "in the box" was a printing error but the Mama Leone's representative I spoke with assured me that a seperate packet of yeast should have been included in each box of bread mix.  The representative was also quick to say that four packets of yeast "...will be immediately shipped to you to make up for what you had to buy in order to make the bread".  Well.....it's been almost THREE months since shipment was promised and I have yet to see any yeast packets.  Don't think this small firm located in a comprably small town near Tulsa OK can afford to incur the displeasure of amazon.com customers since it would be my guess they may sell a number of their mixes over amazon's web site.  The missing yeast is a relatively small thing to me personally but the untruth regarding sending replacement yeast packets is not.  Poor business acumen is exhibited when a company can't be truthful in its' business dealings with customers.  Forget this one and save your money.  The mix doesn't taste as it is reported to taste and you may or may not have to buy your own yeast before you can even mix or bake the bread!
