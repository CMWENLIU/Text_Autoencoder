Quite frankly, we think this soup is disgusting.  There is no flavor to it whatsoever, and if I accidentally buy it, hoping a different flavor will be better, my husband (who eats ANYTHING!) just groans and chokes it down.  The only thing good about it is that it does have more "stuff" in it to fill you up, but just no taste.  After you dump about a pound of salt into them, they resemble something with some flavor, but not really.  It's healthy all right, but there are many other products out there that are just as healthy but have all the flavor as well.  If you don't like spices, then this is your soup.  However, since I make my own and we're more used to flavor, this one just doesn't cut the broth.
