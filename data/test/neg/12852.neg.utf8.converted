This crickets are a terrible value, have no flavor, and come in very small portions. Despite the advertised three flavors, I found all of the crickets to have more of a texture than a flavor and couldn't really distinguish between the advertised flavors strongly. I bought these Crick-ettes as a novelty, and for that they have served their purpose, but judging by any other criteria, this product is terrible.
