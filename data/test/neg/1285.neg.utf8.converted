My husband is originally from Germany and enjoys good hearty breads with hard crusts.  I order this mix from Amazon.com with him in mind.  Unfortunately we were disappointed because the bread did not rise as expected.  It did get a thick crust, but was not crusty like the breads in Germany. It was actually "tough".<br />I used the bread maker to prepare it and followed the directions to a T.  Perhaps the yeast was inferior.  Checked the date on the mix and it was not expired.<br />So I will not be purchasing it again.  In fact, I have the second two packages sitting on the shelf.
