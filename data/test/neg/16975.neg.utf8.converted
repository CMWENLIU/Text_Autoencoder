I'm reviewing the Organic Chicken and Egg Noodles soup.  I'm puzzled by the reviews that rave about the soup -- the only thing I can think of is that perhaps they are reviewing different kinds.  This particular soup is not worth the money.  You will need to get a magnifying glass to see the chicken.  The egg noodles are "okay."  You'll get lots of water and celery, so if you like that, then this is for you.  The flavor is good, but not better than the various canned soups you buy at the grocery store.  I'd say save your money.
