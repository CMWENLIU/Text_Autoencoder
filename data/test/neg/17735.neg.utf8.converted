This is only the second brand of Italian chickpeas I've tried. The first ones (not purchased through Amazon) were way better (but also way more expensive). These Roland chickpeas were similar to the other Italian chickpeas in flavor profile, but much more bland. Italian chickpeas (at least the two brands I've tried) are milder than traditional ones, but with pleasant grassy (a hint of green split peas) and earth notes. They don't make a great hummus, but they are great in chickpea dishes that are mildly seasoned. I make a chickpea-basil pesto that was the best ever when I used the first brand of Italian chickpeas. But when I used this brand, it was boring, and not as good as when made with regular chickpeas. Of course, beans may vary from batch to batch, but I'm not going to buy this brand again.
