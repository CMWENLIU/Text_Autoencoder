This basically tasted like the other much cheaper EVOOs at the grocery store. I've had better, slightly cheaper brands from my local organic outlet that were much tastier. I may not have used it to its full potential, but I definitely will not buy this again. I was on a diet that required high levels of olive oil and this was just as overwhelmingly acidic(fatty acids I know) as the cheap stuff. I'm writing this review now because I just found and threw away the second bottle that I had placed somewhere inconspicuous during a move.
