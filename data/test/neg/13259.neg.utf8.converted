This stuff is not coconut flour just like the other reviewer said  it is just ground shredded coconut, it almost is just a very fine shredded coconut (but still not very fine) Not at all like coconut flour! Do not make the mistake I did and buy it thinking it is, because you cannot return it.  It was a big waste of my money!
