I can't believe all the high ratings on these. Like one of the previous reviewers, my dog hates them. I'm not sure I would eat them either if I were her as they don't smell like Peanut Butter at all - though I wasn't willing to taste them myself due to the horrible smell.  My dog's willing to eat anything I've ever given her, food or treats, but with these she takes it from my hand and then spits it out on the floor.  For the first box, she would come back and eat it an hour later (while looking up at you thinking "you've got to be kidding me").  After that, she said "no more" - she just left them there and never game them another thought.
