I am a law student and my study schedule rarely works well with my two dogs. In order to keep them occupied, I routinely give them bones similar to these as "get away from me for three hours and let me study" treats. Each of my dogs finished its respective bone of this type within 15 minutes. They devoured them. While it is most likely not harmful that they swallowed the crushed bone chunks, it makes me worry. I will not, ever, give these bones to my dogs again. The reward, the time they spend chewing on them, is minimal while the risk, that swallowing bone chunks will hurt them, is higher than I prefer. In balancing these two aspects, these bones are worthless in my opinion.
