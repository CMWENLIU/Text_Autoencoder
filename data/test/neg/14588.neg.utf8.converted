I really wish I had read the other 1 star review before buying this.  I know it says 8lbs but when I saw that photo with the giant bag I expected to get that.  The 8lb bag can't fill up a bathtub.  That was the entire reason I bought these, to swim in them in the bathtub.  While they did taste good it just wasn't the same as my hopes.  So go ahead and buy this product if all you need is 8lbs but if you're wanting to feed them to a heard of cows you're going to need to buy multiple bags.
