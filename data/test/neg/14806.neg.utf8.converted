Like it's evil twin, the Lipton green tea variety pack, I found this product really tasteless.<br />Lipton either pulverizes their green tea, which is unlikely; or, they use the powdery bits left over from other tea producers who take the bigger leaves.<br />It may still have all the anti-oxidant benefits, but it lacks any gustatory interest.<br /><br />I only bought this because of all the rave reviews.<br /><br />If you want a great tea try Silver Needle Jasmine by Rishi. It is expensive, but because it's loose it lasts a long time and the flavor is truly celestial.<br />Other excellent teas come from Numi and Yogi brands.
