This coconut water is completely disgusting. I normally buy brands like O.N.E. and Vita Coco, but it has been hard to find them in stock recently. I've seen Zico, so when it went on sale at a local store I decided to try it. I didn't take the time to check the ingredients because I assumed it was like the other brands, pure coconut water.<br /><br />First off, this is "from concentrate". They defend this on their website, but don't be fooled. It affects taste, quality, and nutrition.<br /><br />Second, they add "natural flavors". There is nothing "natural" about a "natural flavor". It tastes fake and has a nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />This is by far the WORST coconut water on the market and I hope they will listen to consumers and actually make it "natural".
