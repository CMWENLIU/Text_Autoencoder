As a Prime member since Amazon started Prime in 2004, I buy hundreds of items per year.  This product cannot be returned.  The quality is--bad.  I can barely tell it is pepper.  My two year old grocery store pepper has better pepper taste and smell.  Bad luck?  Don't know, since I can't return the product and certainly won't ever order this product again.
