It is appalling to me that anyone would produce this product and sell it as food. What's more appalling is that people eat it and not only support the misguided notion that this is something that could be considered food, but even go so far as to say that they ENJOY eating it, AND DO SO ON A REGULAR BASIS. If this product were made of meat, I would be faced with no other viable conclusion than to think that it was made from the meat products rejected by a dog-food factory. But since it is not meat of any kind, what am I to think. . . ? Is this some kind of weird joke. . . ? What IS this THING in this can? And WHAT IS THAT SMELL? And this gravy of which they spake on the label, do they mean this slime? The slime that is more gross than spam slime? SO MANY QUESTIONS. . .
