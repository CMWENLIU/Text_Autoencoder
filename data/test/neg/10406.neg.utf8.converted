While I feel better throwing these away because I know in time the bag and it's refuse will biodegrade in a good manner the bags themselves are on the weak side. You get more than enough in this package but after tearing one off the roll they have a tendency to rip along the seams when I try opening them. There are nights where I have gone through 3 or 4 bags and other times I can go weeks at a time without wasting one. While I appreciate the concept I will be searching for another brand that can withstand my Hulk like strength.
