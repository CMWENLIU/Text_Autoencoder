I wanted to find a broth/soup base that does not have MSG. As it turns out after I purchased this product, I found out that MSG comes in so many different name, one of them being Yeast Extract, the number one ingredient for this broth seasoning. Just google "other names for MSG" and you will see.  I now stop using this product, and always scrutinize all the food labels before buying as almost everything prepackaged/canned/processed food contains MSG.  I now make my own broth from meat and vegetable. It's more expensive for sure, but well worth my family's health.
