I after 4 months of searching for this Magic twist kool-aid<br />was so excited to finally find it here on Amazon for my son,<br />who has autism and has had me and several relatives running<br />all over town to try to find it, and here it is! so I thought<br />the item they describe is not what you end up with at all.<br /> While at my sons holiday party at school today he told all his<br />little special needs friends he was bringing Magic twist to school<br />on Monday for them all to try.Much to our disappointment and shock<br />the package that was delivered today had NO MAGIC at all in it<br />What we got was Kool-aid Invisible...The same stuff I could have<br />bought myself from my local grocer.<br /> Shame on you Amazon due to your improper posting I<br />You have disappointed a class full of disabled children<br />who were so looking forward to Kool-aid Magic Twist!<br /><br />sincerely, magic-less kids in Minnesota!!
