I have a mild addiction to Dove Promises Dark Chocolate candies - but I had run out and couldn't find more at the store, so I got the closest match I could find, which where these Hershey's Bliss candies.<br /><br />Sadly, there's really no comparison. Whereas the Dove chocolates have a deep and satisfying chocolaty flavor and silky mouth feel, the Hershey's seem comparatively bland and waxy - almost not like chocolate at all, but instead some kind of cheap ersatz copy.<br /><br />My guess - and this is only a guess - is that this might be due to Hershey's recent switch to using vegetable oil instead of cocoa butter. If so, it was not a good move. Maybe it lets them keep their costs down, but true chocoholics don't mind paying more for quality!
