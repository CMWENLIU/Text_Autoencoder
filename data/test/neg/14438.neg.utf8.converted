<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LLXBCO">Gourmet Popcorn Seasoning Assortment</a>I got some popcorn and seasoning salt in the same package by/from Wisconsinmade.  The popcorn popped up quite nicely in my hot air popper.<br /><br />The seasoning salt was was much too coarse to stick to the popcorn--even when I used vegetable oil spray.  I bought a mortar and pestle to re-grind the salt down to a fine grain like the size of butter-flavored popcorn salt from the grocery store. When I get the mortar-pestle, I will grind the salt down to the size it should have been in the first place.<br /><br />It is an inexpensive product and not worth the hassle to send it back.  The popcorn seasoning salt likely the worst designed/made product I ever bought from Amazon.com.<br /><br />Admittedly, I have only tried one flavor so far.  The grain size was so far off the mark, I have no problems writing this less-than-positive review.  Man has been grinding salt for at least 5000 years, it is not that complicated to differentiate between rock salt, table salt and a finely ground powder.
