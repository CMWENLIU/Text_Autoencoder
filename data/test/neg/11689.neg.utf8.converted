The ingredient list hardly looks "pure".  Potassium Sorbate is a preservative... one that is bad for humans.  It is not "anti-microbial" as if that is a good thing.  And citric acid.  They have this big discalimer on their website that they don't add chemicals from a factory, that they are naturally occuring food chemicals. Citric acid is produced by using yeast on a substrate, usually cheap corn.  (not citrus, btw, that would be too expensive.  I guess that's subjective whether or not you believe that is a natually occurring food chemical or not.  But when a company makes a statement like that, and then puts parentheses in the ingredients list to explain the ingredients, puh-lease.  I don't trust this is good stuff for a second.
