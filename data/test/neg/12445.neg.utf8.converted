You can purchase this product at most any grocery store or YallMart for ~$0.25 each, which equates to $9 for this package.  The box weighs next to nothing, so shipping isn't the difference (should be a toss up without the storefront costs), so someone is making a great deal of profit from noodles.  Check the other soup packages with nothing but noodles and soup base, and you will find a similar trend.  Seems common food items are still the domain of brick & mortar stores.
