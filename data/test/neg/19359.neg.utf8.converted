Use a saucepan -- cut up the fruit, add a bit of water, cover. Steam for about 10 min. Use the immersion blender right in the saucepan or in a tall cup. Voila. Baby food! for about $20. I was worried too, but just gave it a shot, and it was a breeze and baby loves his applesauce! If you are doing sweet potato, just bake it for an hour first. It should be nice and soft. And about the same amount of dishes to clean as this thing. Plus it takes up less space.
