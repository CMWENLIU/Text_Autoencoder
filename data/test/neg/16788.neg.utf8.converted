I'm not writing this review of the food itself, which is very good, but about the recall. This product is part of the recent voluntary recall due to potential salmonella contamination. When I get a new bag of dog food, I pour it into a tub that's kept closed near the food bowls, for ease of serving and insurance against my dog getting into the bag. The bag goes into the trash. And for this recall you have to have the bag to be certain that your batch is or isn't involved. Without the bag, nether the manufacturer or distributor will do anything except to tell you, "when in doubt, throw it out." My feeling is that the manufacturer, knowing that I ordered during the time in question, should offer to replace my food, but that was not the case. If this weren't the food my trainer recommends, we would be changing brands.
