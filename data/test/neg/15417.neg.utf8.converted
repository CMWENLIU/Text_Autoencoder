This is a great product and often not always available in stores.  Good to be able to purchase in bulk.  I purchased this same carton of 12 Sweet and Low bulk boxes in March of 2011 and the price was $23.72. Now the price is over $64 for the same item, plus over $10 shipping!! Bottom line--as with any retail transaction, you need to determine whether or not the price is reasonable in relation to other sources of the same product.
