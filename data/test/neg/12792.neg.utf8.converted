I ordered Bergin Nut Almonds, whole raw in the 16 ounce bags.  I was disappionted because they were on the rancid side.  I should have complained, but I would expect their quality control department to check and taste before shipping.  I should not have to be inconvenienced by having to return or dump a product.  I have had good results with their cashews.  I just think Quality Control was not on the ball.
