"2% Kopi Luwak"  That's the key part in the description of this fake Kopi Luwak coffee.  For my money, 2% might as well be 0%.  Basically they have taken ordinary coffee beans, which may or may not be good beans to begin with, and put in 00.16 ounces of Kopi Luwak beans per pound.  That means this bag contains about 00.30 ounces of Kopi Luwak as it's a 200 gram bag.  My point?  Drinking a cup of this is not drinking a cup of Kopi Luwak, but just a very expensive cup of normal coffee, period.  Amazon should be ashamed to be selling this.  Enjoy your fake Kopi Luwak coffee.
