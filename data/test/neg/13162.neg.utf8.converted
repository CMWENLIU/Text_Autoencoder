I typically love the tartness of pom juice and used to like POM Wonderful.  I don't buy it often because it's so expensive, but recently needed some for a recipe.  I went to 2 stores and couldn't find it in the small bottles without some other flavor mixed in.  So I bought the big bottle, thinking "well at least I'll enjoy it".  Alas, no.  It tasted watered down.  More sweet than sour.  I even got a second opinion and that person agreed that it wasn't as tart as before.  I don't think I'll buy this brand again.  Of course, being less tart will appeal to lots of other people.  I'm only speaking for my own taste buds.<br /><br />I gave the same review on POM Wonderful's website, but it hasn't appeared.  It disappeared into the black hole of moderator-ship.  Maybe they changed their processing procedures and don't want anyone to know.
