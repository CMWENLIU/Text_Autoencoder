An American breakfast tradition is fading from too much competition for market shelf space and corporate mindset. Every market used to carry two or three brands of buckwheat mix. "Bob's" is the only buckwheat mix I can can find now in CA stores, and that's at a health food store. It does make buckwheat pancakes but they're dry, cardboard-like, very heavy, and not at all like the lighter, moister Aunt Jemima buckwheats that were my favorites for over 50 years. If you buy this to replace the discontinued classic Aunt Jemima mix, you'll be disappointed.
