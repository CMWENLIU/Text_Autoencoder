This Calif. company managed to use the San Marzano name in their brand name, but these are in no way, shape or form actually San Marzano tomatoes.<br /><br />They are overpriced and HORRIBLE.<br /><br />Do not buy this brand if you are looking for real San Marzano tomatoes, Progresso tomatoes are better for 1/3 the price.<br /><br />These people should be ashamed of themselves.
