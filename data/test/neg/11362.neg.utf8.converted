This coffee tastes and smells repulsive. I like the flavor of Kahlua and I love coffe. I love the international creamers Kahlua creamer. I thought this would be an obvious win. I brewed a cup and the smell was HORRENDOUS! I drank a couple of sips and almost threw up! It doesn't taste like Kahlua or coffee! DO NOT BUY THIS! YOU ARE WARNED! IT IS BAD!!!!
