The package states that there are "chocolate chunks" and "tangy" red berries within this granola.  Well,neither I or any of my friends could taste anything but a dry rolled oats concoction.  The fact that the company states it will donate an equal amount of money to a food bank for every bag purchased is exemplary but will not make any difference to me as the lack of taste will make certain that I do not purchase this product.
