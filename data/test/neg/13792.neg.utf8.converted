Well, not really.  What they have done is change the size, from the fantastic small size bites to big chunks.  As an engineer, I know exactly why they did it - its cheaper from an energy consumption.  The larger sizes are not as dried out, and so take less energy to get the surface consistancy right. However, this changes the overall consistency, and makes them useless for the sprinkler, the snacker, or the person who mixes them with nut.  So now this is no better than any of the other types of dried fruit.  Sun-Maid has made a serious error- if they feel its too expensive to dry them, then raise the price - don't get rid of the bite size bits we loved....
