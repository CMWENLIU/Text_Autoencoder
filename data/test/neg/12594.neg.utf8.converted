I was disappointed with the selection here - "24 count" sampler made me think I'd be getting 24 flavors to try.  Instead it was only around 9 or 10, with a few of each.  Seemed like someone just dumped them randomly in a box.  I didn't like most of these, and the donut house coffees of "chocolate glazed donut" and "cinnamon roll" didn't taste like they were named.  If you want to try out a bunch of different coffees, I wouldn't recommend this selection.
