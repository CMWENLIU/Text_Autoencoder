I've purchased bulk olives from Amazon twice before and they where great. These olives I just recieved today must be many years old.<br />The cover had some kind of brown crust on the threads.<br /> The olives are all discolored and slimy. Many of them are covered with spots and some are just mush.<br /> What should be green olives are a washed out tan color and the black olives are tan with black spots.<br />  These olives are clealy many years old and I don't think they are safe to eat.<br /><br /> The package has no sell by date but the lot number is 64 10620.<br /><br />I art a few before I reolized how nasty they looked. I'm feeling a little quezy and I hope it is all in my head.
