After purchasing 2 canister packs, at different times, I called 800-431-1002 (the number on the back of the canister)to ask why the formula was changed as well as the packaging..it is no longer offered in the tubs, but in little annoying, tear-open packets. The customer service operator was very nice, put me on hold for a couple of minutes, and then came back on the phone to verify that my opinion was correct. The formulas for the TEA and LEMONADE were changed. I gave him the bar code numbers and expiration dates on the both canisters. I will be receiving 2 coupons. Hopefully, the other flavors haven't changed.
