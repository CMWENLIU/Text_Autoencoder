I'm with the other reviewer who bought the regular container from their supermarket, then bought it from Amazon, and is now reduced to buying these micro packets of this flavor.  I also have to use 1 1/2 of these to make a 'good' cup of coffee.  This is the only flavor and 'kind' of coffee I like and now I'm having to pay extra for these micro packets!!<br /><br />I still have one "old" container and I have to take time to open and dump all these little packets into it to make these little things even somewhat convenient.<br />I'd rate this 5 stars if it was put back into it's old container!!
