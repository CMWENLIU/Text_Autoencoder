This brand of quinoa tasted very green/unripened.  I added chicken and mixed veggies and a partial packet of condensed chicken stock but the taste of the quinoa was too strong.  I've had quinoa lots of times but it never tasted like this.  It might work okay if you dumped it in a big pot of home made soup but I'd be concerned of ruining it.  I won't be buying it again and I'm not really sure what to do with the rest of the shipment.
