I buy many different types of coconut oil's. This one is one of the worst one's I've tried thus far.<br /><br />You expect coconut oil to smell like coconut's but it doesn't.It has almost no smell. The best way to to describe the smell is old/off.<br /><br />It doesn't taste like other coconut oil's either. I also use coconut oil as a lotion. This doesn't melt into skin like it should.<br /><br />Your better off buying another brand.
