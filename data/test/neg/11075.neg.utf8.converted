After reading all of the great reviews, I purchased these for my daughter.  Unfortunately I couldn't just buy one box, so I have way too many of these!  I like that they are light and safe for babies to eat.  However, the ones that I purchased were unflavored.  My 10 month old does not like them at all.  She'll play with them and then throw them on the floor.  This was a complete waste of money for me! Thankfully they weren't very expensive.  Maybe I would have had better luck if I had purchased these when she was 6 months old or if I had purchased a flavored brand.  I would advise you not to purchase these for babies older than 8 months.  If you do purchase them, you may want to consider the flavored ones.
