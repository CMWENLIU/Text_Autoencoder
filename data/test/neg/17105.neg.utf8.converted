On the seemingly endless search for a better alternative to traditional clay litters, I had high hopes for Green Tea Leaves Cat Litter due to the number of positive reviews regarding the product.  Upon opening the bag I found the litter had a pleasant woodsy-tea odor that was not overpowering. The pellets (they can't be called in any way, shape, or form granules) are lightweight and of a comparable size/consistancy to Yesterday's News cat litter (or rabbit food pellets). Upon pouring the litter into the pan, waves of dust bourgened from the box.  Although the manufacturer describes the product as "low in dust", it is anything but.  In fact it's worse than many clay litters. The dust didn't end after the initial pouring either; every time the litter box was scooped, the waves of dust made a reappearance. My poor kitties must have a hard time breathing everytime they dig in this litter, and it's probably one reason why they dislike it so much.  The other likely being the consistancy. The litter does clump well, and the odor control is good, however trying to put myself in the cat's paws I had to pose the question; would I rather walk on a sandy beach, or a rocky one?  The answer is obvious; sand, of course. Hence, it's not a big surprise to find that the cats really do not like this product. There is also alot of tracking of the pellets outside the box due to their light weight and size.  In summation:<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - pleasantly mild woodsy-tea odor<br /> - clumps well<br /> - lightweight<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - hard pellet-sized litter that annoys felines to the point they avoid the box<br /> - high dust<br /> - high tracking<br /><br />If the manufacturer ever makes the pellets into smaller sand-like granules I'd be up for revisiting the product, but for now the cons far outweigh the pros for my household.  Unfortunately, we have to give the product one thumb and two paws down.
