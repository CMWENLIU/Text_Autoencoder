I bought these all of the time from the manufacturer but was excited to see them from Amazon. Several have been infested by mold and unfortunately I took a bite before realizing this. They are not expired and I don't know why they are this way. I would send them back but there is no contact phone number that i can find for amazon and they do not return food products so i wasted $50 on these oat bars... has anyone else had this problem? Don't buy them they are not fresh!
