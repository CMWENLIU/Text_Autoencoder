My daughter is almost a year old and still breastfeeding. However, I had to have emergency breast surgery when she was 3 months old and she had to take some formula off and on during that time. I chose the Earth's Best brand because I like all of their other products. She seemed to tolerate it fine and we had no issues. Imagine my shock reading the Organic Consumers' email newsletter just now informing me that Earth's Best formula was found to have genetically engineered neutraceuticals (in the DHA). Apparently, Horizon Organic milk does too, which is very angering....if you ask me, if a component of a product has to be GENETICALLY ENGINEERED, that product is clearly not 'organic' and shouldn't carry the organic labeling.<br /><br />The only thing I will say is that the Earth's Best brand is a good brand, and I'm sure this product is still much better than all the conventional brands.....I would still pick this over regular infant formula any day....however, the organic label is misleading in a product that apparently contains GMOs. I don't want GMOs anywhere near my developing child, and until law passes that all GMO food be labeled, I guess you can't even trust organic food now. Buyer beware.
