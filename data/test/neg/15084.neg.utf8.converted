It's not quite as bad as I expected, but the Strawberry Delight flavor of the Frosted Mini-Wheats suffer most from how it looks, the unnatural pink color dyed into the wheat biscuits in such a way as to make them wholly unappetizing. Otherwise, it offers a sweetened taste that barely reminds me of real strawberries, at least to the point where you wonder what the point is to this variation from Kellogg's. One 42-gram serving, a mini-box, equals a higher-than-average 140 calories but only five are from fat. The other good news is that there is no measurable sodium and cholesterol to the cereal. I would think adding real strawberries or even dried berry variations would be preferable to this cereal, so I think I'll leave this as a pass.
