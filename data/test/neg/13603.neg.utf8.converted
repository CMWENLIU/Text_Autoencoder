Previously bought another brand and loved the bright flavor and somewhat firm texture.  Really added a lot to my dish.  I bought this brand as the other was unavailable, and will never do so again.  Better to do without.  It was bitter, extremely salty, and had the texture of soggy bread.  Ruined my dinner.  Seemed decomposed.  Opened the second jar I bought and it was the same. Threw them both in the garbage. Never again.
