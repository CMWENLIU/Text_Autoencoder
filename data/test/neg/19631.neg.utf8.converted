We have purchased these almonds before and enjoyed them.  Unfortunately, we just purchased them again from Amazon and were very disappointed.  The nuts were old, limp, and tasteless.  We opened all the bags and sampled many nuts; we couldn't believe the whole six bags were inedible.  They were! We E-mailed the company to inquire as to expiration dates and batch numbers so we could avoid getting a bad old batch next time.  The company ignored us.  Amazon did not.  They refunded our money.  Thank you Amazon.  Apparently, the SunRidge company does not care if they ship old nuts to Amazon warehouses.  Don't waste your hard-earned money on expensive old nuts!
