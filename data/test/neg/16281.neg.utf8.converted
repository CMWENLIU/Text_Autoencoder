From the picture it looks like there is a new bottle with the valve on the side. The one I bought had the valve on the top. Just like the other reviewer, not long after I turned on the hose, the knob popped off spraying it all over me. Luckily I didn't have my face over it, only my arms and legs got covered with it. Maybe it works well, but it's not worth risking your life for.
