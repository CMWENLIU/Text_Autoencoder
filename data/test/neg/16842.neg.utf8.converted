very disappointed with this brand and was indeed shocked to see some of the raving reviews turn out to be sooo wrong. Makes me want to believe that reviews are not really written by real people. Where can I start? it is a very dry and bland recipe with no taste, that did not cook right at all. We used to purchase and cook Flappin Jack Pancakes, and it was wonderful. This thing just tasted downright horribly bland. Our first attempt of following directions and using Buttermilk yielded nothing shy of gross pancakes - we tried it with regular milk and butter and that was not much better. I am sad to say that I bought 3 of these and should have never wasted my money. So, if you like fluffy, buttery taste pancakes that melts in your mouth, do not waste money on this piece of junk recipe.
