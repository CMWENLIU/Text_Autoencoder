I had to start a gluten-free diet so I purchased these crackers and liked them very much.  Last year I opened a box and noticed webbing in the cellophane package.  Upon closer examination I noticed many tiny worm-like creatures so I immediately threw the box away.  I didn't purchase them for a while after that but did recently buy them again.  I just went to pull a cracker out of the box and along with the cracker came a 3" piece of old wool yarn - I'm done!
