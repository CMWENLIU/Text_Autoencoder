As the description omits ingredients, they are listed on the packaging as: Plum Extract, Salt, Licorice; FD&C: Red #40, Yellow #5; Aspartame.<br />So if you are trying to avoid such ingredients for health concerns, you should shop around. If anyone knows of a source for a more 'natural' product, please reply to this post. Thanks.
