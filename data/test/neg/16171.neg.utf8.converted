At first, I was excited when I found this product, but that excitement wore off quickly... A juice-based energy drink?! Sounds great! I'm not a soda drinker and can't stand carbonation. Another thing which I can't stand, is the awful taste of this drink! I don't even know if it is effective as an energy drink because I couldn't ever manage to finish a whole can of the stuff. The first sip I took was utterly putrid. I tried mixing it with some mango nectar to cut out the terrible taste, but you shouldn't have to dilute your beverages to make them easier to consume!<br /><br />Save yourself (and your taste buds!) the horror and don't buy this drink. I have tried over 20 different energy drinks and this is the most foul one of them all! Ick.
