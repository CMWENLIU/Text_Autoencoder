First I have to say that I love Yogi tea. I love the messages on the tea bags and some flavors are remarkable! This one, however, is horrible. I guess if you love licorice root you will like it, but I do not. I tolerate the licorice flavor in the CALM Yogi tea because it really calms me before bed and makes me feel like I am floating on a cloud, but it still manages to taste good whereas this one does not.<br /><br />Please do buy Yogi tea and get the Green Tea Slim Life instead- terrific taste, which tastes like green tea with berries in it- a good flavor and not an artificial flavor to it. This Fasting tea has a bitter after taste, which is all licorice root. Stay clear of this flavor but do buy Yogi Tea. I feel transformed by the messages on the tea bags, as it is; so profound!<br /><br />Wise quotes from Yogi Tea by Yogi Bhajan<br /><br />"The universe is the stage on which you dance, guided by your heart."<br /><br />"The purpose of life is to enjoy every moment."<br /><br />"Delight the world with compassion, kindness and grace."<br /><br />"Laugh because that is your purpose in life."<br /><br />Happiness is every human beings birthright."
