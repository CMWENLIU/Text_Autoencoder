I have tried several raw cacao powders from different companies and this one was the worst. When mixed with moisture it becomes like mud. It was impossible to get a smooth dessert or cream using this powder and the flavor seems muted as though the intense chocolate flavor is missing. It was also more expensive than the other brands I tried. I won't order this product again. Very disappointed.
