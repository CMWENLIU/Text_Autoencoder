Product arrived(2 454g jars)with an expiration date 2 weeks from purchase date!Product did not look "right" and I did not use it. Contacted vendor and was told the distribution of almost expired product was due to AMAZON. Was told I would be receiving 2 new jars of said Product,although as of Aug.12,2011 still haven't received them.
