Cool idea for a product but the one I got is junk unless you don't mind a meat thermometer that jumps from 60 deg to 299 deg and back again within a few seconds and alarms every time it give an erroneously high reading, which is every few minutes.<br /><br />I purchased this product for my Father who has used it twice.  We tried all the tricks to get it to work, reset the transmitter and receiver, fresh batteries, moved the meat probe, etc.  Nothing worked.<br /><br />It has been more than 90 days since I ordered this product, so I called the Brookstone Limited Warranty Service at the 800 number listed in the manual.  A very nice but obviously frustrated gal tried for 25 minutes to find my order in the system but couldn't pull it off.  I asked her if she could just add me to the system since I obviously had a Brookstone product and a receipt from Amazon.  She said no, it doesn't work that way.  After speaking to her supervisor I was told I needed to contact Amazon for support.  Amazon said I had to contact the seller, TLC Stores.  I sent a email to TLC stores, well see what they say.<br /><br />As of this posting I have spent $65.98 for a product that doesn't work and over an hour and counting trying to get warranty service.<br /><br />For now I would say STAY AWAY FROM BROOKSTONE PRODUCTS!  My, albeit limited, experience has not been a positive one.<br /><br />If the situation is resolved I will update this posting and let everyone know the results of my quest for even marginally adequate customer service.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/27/11<br /><br />Brookstone will not warranty this item because I purchased it from TLC Store (amazon seller).  Brookstone only warranties their items to the "original purchaser".  Brookstone told me that by purchase this item from TLC Store "you effective bought this item at a garage sale from the original purchaser so the warranty is null and void."  I purchased this item thinking it was "new" with a warranty to back it up.  TLC Store has a 30 day warranty, or so I am told.  This effective took the 1 yr manufacture warranty and turned it into a 30 day warranty from some gal selling stuff from her garage.  I sent repeated emails but only received two replies neither of them came close to resolving the issue.<br /><br />Bottom line, this item is junk.  TLC Store has done nothing to help rectify the problem.<br /><br />2 LESSONS LEARNED<br />  1.  THIS BROOKSTONE PRODUCT IS JUNK AND THEY ARE UNWILLING TO BACKUP THEIR PRODUCTS.<br /><br />  2.  ANYONE CAN SET UP AN AMAZON STORE FRONT.  BUYER BEWARE, YOU MAY BE BUYING STUFF FROM SOMEONE'S GARAGE WHO<br />  IS JUST TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK AND DOESN'T CARE IF YOU GET SCREWED IN THE PROCESS.
