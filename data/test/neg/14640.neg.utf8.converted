After trying Torani's Vanilla and Cherry syrups and being very satisfied, thought that the Caramel would have to be good as well. WRONG! I have not found anything that it taste good in yet. It's awful on ice cream and yogurt, but I keep trying it in diffent drinks in hopes that there is something that it will be palatable in so that I don't have to throw three bottles away since Amazon will not refund this item. I know that taste is subjective, but honestly, I wish I could force feed this to those reviewers who convinced me that this stuff tasted good.<br /><br />Update and apology to those reviewers who rated the "plain" caramel syrup positively. After some research, discovered that there are two different Torani Caramel syrups: just "Caramel" and "Classic Caramel". The Classic Caramel is the one that Amazon is sending out to unsuspecting buyers and it tastes awful. Another reviewer has noted this in a different Torani review.
