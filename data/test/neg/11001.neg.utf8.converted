I saw this product on Amazon.Com and was excited because I have been<br />making my own Rice Milk and Almond Milk.  I thought that it would be<br />more convenient just to add water and have instant Rice Milk.<br /><br />The reviews were good and I ordered.  I cannot stand the taste of this mix.  I dislike giving negative reviews but I must to save other customers from perhaps making the same mistake.  The product is very sweet and has an unusual taste unlike that of homemade Rice Milk.  Why must the product contain so many ingredients? I will ask Amazon to approve a return of the product, or give it away.  Be careful about ordering this product.<br /><br />Paul Rowell
