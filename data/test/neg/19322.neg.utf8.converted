I like a fairly strong cup of coffee.  Since it's French Roast, and labeled as Bold, I assumed that Tully's version would be.  Unfortunately, to me, at least, it's pretty weak stuff.  It may be better if your Keurig can be set to brew a small cup size...ours is fixed at roughly 8 oz.<br /><br />I personally prefer:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZBW">Timothy's World Coffee, Rainforest Decaf Espresso Extra-Bold for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>,<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFT88">Coffee People Extra Bold French Roast Decaf for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a> and<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0GVAO">Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf Coffee for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a> for decaf coffee.<br /><br />For caffeinated, I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L444OQ">Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>],<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GQ220I">Coffee People Santa's Buzz K-Cup for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups</a> (when it's available), or<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZBM">Emeril's Big Easy Bold Coffee for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>.<br /><br />I think all six have much better flavor than Tully's French Roast.
