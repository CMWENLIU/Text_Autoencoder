I bought the 40 oz. or 2.8 lb. box at K-Mart for about $32 and change, with tax, here in New York. That comes to approximately $13 a pound!<br /><br />The thickness of the box gives the buyer the impression that it has two layers deep. It is only two layers across. They actually had the cheek to offer the buyer a thick box and stick in cardboard filler on the bottom half of it to create the illusion there was two layers.<br /><br />I am never buying this particular Whitman Sampler again, and I would recommend you do a very thorough price comparison, before you do as well.<br /><br />The chocolate is good, hence two stars, but the box was downright deceptive. So a big Bronx cheer for Whitman!
