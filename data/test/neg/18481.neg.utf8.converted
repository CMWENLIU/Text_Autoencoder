We fed our son only Earth's Best formula from the day he was born. We have used this product for 7 months. My last purchase I looked on the ingredient list and to my surprise the formula had changed. It now has "organic glucose syrup solids"...added sugar. Why change a great product by adding sugar? I now will be changing to another product and possibly no longer use organic because I feel the added sugar is more harmful. Thank you Earth's Best for 7 months of a good product. Now the doctors thank you for adding to the obesity epidemic and the increase in type 2 diabetics in the US. You have lost a customer.
