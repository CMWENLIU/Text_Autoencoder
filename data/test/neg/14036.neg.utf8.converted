I remain unimpressed and still waiting for the product to be delivered as a Christmas gift to my elderly parents.  While I paid for an expedited delivery date ($22.00)  the product remains stagnated in Maumee, Ohio (Toledo).  The commitment was for this product to arrive on the 21st or 22nd.  It now will not likely appear until the 27th.  I would not re-order from this vendor, World Wide <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DIXL6">Alaska Smokehouse Leila Bay Gift Basket</a>Gourmet foods.<br /><br />I guess I can wait until the Spring and drive up to see the Mud Hens play.  Unimpressed!
