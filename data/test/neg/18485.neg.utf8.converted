I had tried a different brand of Turkish Delight twice before. A co-worker brought it to the office from his trip to Turkey. It was so delicious that I needed to get some and I decided to order from Amazon as I could not find stores that carry it.<br />This Galil Turkish Delight is so sweet that I could not even eat 2 of them and they are pretty small. I tried to remove some of the powdery sugar, but still the same, which was surprising since it contains pistachio. After eating 2 of them it left me with some kind of sick feeling since they are too sweet. The other problem is that the order comes in 4 boxes, which means that I wasted my money since I could barely consume one box. I took one to the office and the other I gave to a friend of mine, but warned them that it is very sweet. The 4th box may end up going to the garbage as I cannot even think on eating this Galil Turkish Delight again. What a disappointment.<br />I would not recommend this product to anyone.
