I placed my order for 2 boxes of this Watermelon Laffy Taffy, with seeds. I didn't buy 2 pieces of it because I "thought" I knew what I was getting. I "thought" Amazon would be a more commitment oriented corporation. For what I recieved...... I got 2 boxes.... 64 laffy taffy's watermelon flavor, and it did NOT have the seeds. I wouldn't have ordered $56 of laffy taffy if I wanted the WRONG one. The picture on the website is definitely not the picture of the laffy taffy I recieved. I for one am very ashamed of the service I have recieved and warn all others to steer clear of this product if you are looking for the taffy with the seeds.... this is NOT the right one.
