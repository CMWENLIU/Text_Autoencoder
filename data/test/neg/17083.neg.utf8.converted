In the past year-or-so, I have used three cases of the original product... absolutely wonderful.  On June 2, I received a case of the new reformulated (ie,"watered-down") version... it is awful! This obvious attempt to cut cost has almost ruined the product.  Please change it back to get a re-order from me.
