My mistake for not spotting the word, "flavored," but this is really awful! I was expecting Blue Mountain coffee and instead got this foul tasting coffee-like brew that has no coffee taste at all. Is it hazelnut? I hope not - I have nut allergies. Whatever it is, it overpowers any weak coffee flavor that may have been present at the beginning!<br /><br />Checking the ingredients on the package, we learn that it includes Arabica coffee and "natural and/or artificial flavors." Digging around the Wolfgang Puck website, we first learn that it's "Light flavored coffee with the essence of the islands (Flavored)" and finally, "Coconut Infusion Flavored Coffee."<br /><br />I never would have guessed coconut.
