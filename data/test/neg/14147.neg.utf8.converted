One of my dogs had a bladder stone and needed surgery. After her surgery, the vet said to prevent the stones, she needed to be on Royal Canin Urinary SO for life. However, a year on the food and her small 12 lbs body (healthy weight) jumped to 19 lbs, which is obviously not healthy for her small breed frame. Her activity level did not decrease and there were no other lifestyle changes besides the food. Even though it prevented more stones, that much weight gain is really risky and dangerous, it could have lead to other health problems. Unhappy with my vet's suggestion to simply walk her more (she already gets 3 walks a day!)  I did my own research and spoke with a pet nutritionist (expensive but worth it). Well little did I realize that this food contains tons of fillers and inferior by-products! Main ingredients include pork by-products and corn grits! The nutritionist recommended that I switch her to a home cooked diet with supplements (multi-vitamin) and urinary health vitamins (cranberry, hydrangea, etc.) to prevent bladder stones and continue to have her urine checked at the vet on a regular basis. Two years later, she's lost the weight and has had no more stones! She also has more energy! Most of the time I cook for her and other times I give her Merrick canned dog food with her urinary vitamins.  I'm not saying this will work for everyone, but it certainly worked for my dog and I'm glad I didn't just accept this food as her fate and deal with the other health consequences that come along with being overweight. I would recommend that anyone with a dog who has issues with bladder stones to do their research and seek a second opinion about ways to deal with these health problems. Best of luck to you and your dog!
