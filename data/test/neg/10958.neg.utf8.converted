Well, I tried it.  I didn't like it, but I assumed it might be because of the fact that I've got strange tastes.  So I gave cans to my wife and daughter and they didn't like it either.  Different strokes for different folks, so your mileage may vary, but as for me and my family I'd say let the buyer beware.
