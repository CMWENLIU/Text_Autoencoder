The name of this product is "Disney Cars 8 Re-Useable McQueen & Tow Mater Rings".  However, the Product Features and Product Description sections both state there are 12 rings in the pack.  Specifically, there are 6 McQueen and 6 Mater rings.  I just received this product and there are only 8 rings in the pack; 3 McQueen, 3 Mater and 2 WGP.  Hopefully, I will be able to reorder more rings and get them here before my son's birthday party at school on Tuesday.  The features and description sections need to be corrected to the reflect the actual product being sold!!!
