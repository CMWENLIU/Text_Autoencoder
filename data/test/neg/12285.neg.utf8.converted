Take a look at the picture on the box and what do you see?  Big chunks of paneer and some liquid.  Well that's not what's in the box.  There are a few pieces of paneer and about 90% liquid with fat pooling on the surface.  This was a completed disappointment and I have 9 boxes to go.  Tasty Bite entrees are much better.  I don't care if this is the #1 brand in India - it's near the bottom of my list.
