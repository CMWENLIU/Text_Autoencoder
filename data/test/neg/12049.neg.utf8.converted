Kind bars taste great and pack a nutritional punch, but they pack another kind of punch as well.  On October 10, I bit into an almond/fruit bar and broke a front crown.  What made it worse (and more expensive) is that I was en route from Chicago to San Francisco at the time so the accident made it imperative to seek emergency dental care for a temporary crown in SF and then have the permanent crown made upon my return home.  Total sticker price for that Kind bar:  $1665, not counting the cost of the bar itself.  I called Kind's corporate headquarters in New York and was referred to its insurance company, Chubb, which declined to assist me with any of my bills on the grounds that the company was not negligent.  That's a matter of interpretation, I think, but rather than pursue silly litigation that would cost more than I've already spent, I think I'll just do my civic duty and warn Kind's buyers in the most public way I can think of to beware when eating these bars.  They're delicious, but they can break teeth.  Let the Kind eater beware:  caveat emptor, caveat vore.
