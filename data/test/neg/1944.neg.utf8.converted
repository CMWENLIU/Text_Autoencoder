Like many others I have loved this tea for decades, both my husband and I would drink it everyday.  We used to get it from Costco and then no longer could. Found it at our local Sprouts, but in a new purple packaging.  Went home to enjoy a cup with my husband and he took one sip and put it down and refused to drink any more of it.  I tried to continue to drink it, but gave up on it after about a half a cup. It really tastes artificial with very little of the beloved cinnamon taste. I am not even going to dontate this to the food bank as it is garbage and so it is going into the garbage.  The packaging was very deceptive "New Look Same Great Taste".  Sadly, I no longer trust this company.
