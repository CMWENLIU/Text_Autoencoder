These sounded too good to be true, and they were. The taste of these is downright awful! I've eaten a lot of protein bars, and while these seem to have fewer chemicals and more wholesome ingredients than most, they sure didn't taste like it! Honestly, these taste nothing like chocolate and really just taste like maltitol...
