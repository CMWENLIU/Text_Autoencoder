For several months now I have been ordering this by the case on subscribe and save.  Compared to other brands, I have noticed that some cans go bad really quickly once opened.  Also, I recently received a case in which at least several of the cans had coconut oil that had separated from the milk. I know that the white and clear parts of the milk often separate, but i have never opened a can of coconut milk and had a layer of oil on top.  Very disappointed.  Was hopeful because the cans are BPA free so I would like to stick with this company, but how can I justify the expense? We have just thrown away so many cans of it because we weren't sure it was good.
