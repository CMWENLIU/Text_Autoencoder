Either Celestial Seasonings simply forgot to update amazon.com, or else it's a deliberate omission on the part of Celestial Seasonings, but you should be aware that soy lecithin is an unlisted ingredient in this blueberry tea. It's also in all the "Zinger" teas I've checked in local stores and in other Celestial Seasonings teas as well. But it's not listed here on amazon.com in the "ingredients" section. I phoned the company last spring when I first noticed this "adulteration" because I couldn't imagine why anyone would add soy lecithin to tea! I've nothing against soy lecithin. Sometimes I add it to yoghurt, but that's my own choice. Also, the source should be organic (or from a reliable supplier like Lewis Labs), since non-organic soy is almost always genetically modified.<br /><br />Anyway, I phoned the company's customer relations department and asked what was going on with the soy lecithin. The woman had no idea what I was talking about so I explained, step by step, what I had found on a Zinger tea box I had nearly purchased that day. She said she had heard nothing about it but she checked her computer for company updates. After scrolling through many items, she came to a small notice in, as I recall, their in-house March 2008 entry (a year prior to my call), which stated that soy lecithin would now be added to selected teas; no reason was given. That struck me as very odd -- that even their own employees had not been properly notified. The woman apologized for the mix-up. That wasn't very satisfactory from my point of view but I let it go. That's all the info she had and it certainly wasn't her fault that her company obviously wanted to fly under the radar on this one.<br /><br />Since then, any time I'm attracted to a new Celestial Seasonings product, I first read the ingredients. They used to be a company I trusted -- not anymore -- although I still love their (as-yet) soy-free Bengal Spice; India Spice Chai; Nutcracker Sweet Holiday Tea; Sleepytime; Echinacea Complete Care; Vanilla/Strawberry/Rose Ceylon Black Tea; Moroccan Pomegranate; and Red Safari Spice.  But I now carefully check those labels too whenever I buy a new batch lest Celestial Seasonings have pulled a fast-one and added soy lecithin to them as well!<br /><br />Why haven't customers raised more of a hullabaloo over this? Probably because this company has indeed had our trust for many years (never mind that they've been sold to less trustworthy firms along the way!) and no one bothers to read their labels! Maybe now they will.<br /><br />(P.S. I'm a blueberry fiend and would probably make this my all-time favorite tea! -- but not with soy lecithin in it!!)
