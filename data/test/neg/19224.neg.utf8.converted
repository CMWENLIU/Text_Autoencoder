I've purchased Royal Oak Redskins in the past and loved them,  But, this order (2x40 oz. cans) is too salty to eat.  Efforts to reduce the saltiness ruins the taste that makes redskins our favorite.  And, e-mails to Royal Oak asking for advice/help have been ignored.  So, I'm stuck with five pounds of redskins that I'll eventually throw out.  I'll never by anything from Royal Oak again!
