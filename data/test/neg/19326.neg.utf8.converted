This is fine. It's just not all that.<br /><br />Perhaps if I had special equipment that would make it without getting little floaties in my cup, I would have given it more stars. (I used a fine mesh strainer and poured the boiling water through twice). And perhaps if I didn't get an unimaginable headache a half hour or so after drinking it...I might have gone for three stars. (Unsure whether this caused the headache--I have to try it one more time). But, the end result tasted like tea...nothing special and at 11.70 per bag--uh, I'd rather go for Celestial Seasonings if I want some caffeine-free tea-beverage-drink.<br /><br />SO if you have an espresso machine and want to branch out into tea, this might be for you--otherwise go for some loose-leaf and steep the hell out of it.
