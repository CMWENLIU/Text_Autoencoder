First off, the price on these is kind of weird. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZUFHW">Thai Kitchen Mushroom Medley</a> is 6 for ~$11 ($.74/oz, just over what I pay at the store) and this is more than double that price ($1.62/oz). If I were reviewing the product itself, I'd give it four stars. Charging double what it's worth lowers my rating a good bit.<br /><br />The Thai Kitchen Noodle Bowls I've had (Mushroom Medley and Roasted Garlic) are both very good for instant soups. I prefer the Mushroom Medley, though. To me, the broths taste very similar (though Garlic is slightly stronger) but the Mushroom contains dried shiitake mushrooms. The mushrooms add more texture to the soup and make it taste less like just broth and noodles.<br /><br />This is still pretty good, though, and if you can find them at a more reasonable price ($1-2) and/or don't like mushrooms, go for it!
