Have you ever served up a can of Pedigree wet dog food for your furry little friend and felt secretly jealous as you watch him tear into the vaccuum packed ration like a lion tackling a zebra? If only it were possible for humans to survive on such simple yet delicious means.  If only there existed small, convenient meals of comparable taste and price made just for us folks at the top of the food chain.  Well, if you're still pondering a suitable solution then look no further than Hormel Compleats.  The beef steak tips with mashed potatoes in particular are sure to delight even the most sophisticated palette. In this meal we find overwhelmingly grainy mashed potatoes paired up with bland steak cutlets swimming in an even blander sauce that I can only assume to be some kind of gravy. With this kind of savory goodness you honestly can't go wrong at this price range. To top it all off, the meat appears to be 100% free of any type of seasoning or flavor enhancement in general, so don't hesitate to pile on some of your own sauces and spices to improvise. Not since the US Army's MREs (Meals Rejected by Ethiopians) have we seen such sublime culinary innovation.  In other words, it's the best of the best! Pick some up tonight for the whole family and keep the Pepto ready my friends, because believe me when I say this is one meal that just won't stay down on its own!
