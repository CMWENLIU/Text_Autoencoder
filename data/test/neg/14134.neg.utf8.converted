After reading the product claims and ingredients on this product, I was intrigued by the promise of weight loss, but concerned about the presence of corn gluten meal as the #3 ingredient.  I contacted the company's staff veterinarian, who assured me it was a good source of protein.  With some misgivings, I placed my miniature schnauzer Cicero on this diet to assist in his trimming down about 2 pounds.  We had previously tried Wellness Weight Management, with no weight loss result and too many trips outside due to the high fiber content.  (Cicero had been raised on Innova prior to the Wellness effort at diet).  Not only did my pup not lose weight, he gained a pound in the two weeks he ate this, and developed a yeast infection which presented symptions in his right ear and on his back.  My readings confirm the suspicion that this was a direct result of the corn gluten meal, as he had never before had a food with any corn ingredient.  I immediately suspended feeding this product, sent the company proof-of-purchase verification for a refund, and conducted an exhaustive search of all-natural high protein foods without grains or filler ingredients which I would feed in controlled smaller portions, rather than another "lite" or "weight management" formula.  Am delighted to report that Cicero is doing beautifully on a combination of Innova EVO and Timberwolf Organics, and that Premium Edge refunded my purchase price in full.  To their credit, the manufacturer was immediately responsive to my emails and sent the refund check within a week.
