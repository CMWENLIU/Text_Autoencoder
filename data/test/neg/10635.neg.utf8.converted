Nutella is stocked by the pallet in Europe, but much less popular in the USA for the excellent reason that the NJ plant produces an inferior product. This stuff is edible, but it's too sweet and doesn't have a strong hazelnut flavor. Ferrero finished Americanizing it by putting it in a much smaller plastic container and adding trans fat. Look for the genuine imported product or try making your own chocolate peanut butter. (I've tried making a chocolate hazelnut butter, but it's hard to duplicate the Nutella flavor)<br /><br />Update: Nutella now contains "modified palm oil" instead of the partially hydrogenated variety. It's nice of Ferrero to shell out the extra .03 per bottle not to use a substance known to be somewhat lethal, but I expect the flavor hasn't improved, or we'd all be hearing a lot more about it.
