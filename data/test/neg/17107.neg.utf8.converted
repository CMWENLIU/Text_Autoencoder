Sorry to dash anybody's hopes here. I know the reviews are pretty glowing, but that does not match my experience. This litter is not good. The chunks are huge, which not only seemed to make it hard for my cats to use, but looked disturbingly like granola when tracked all over the room. And track it does... like crazy. Which defeated my reason for buying it. Thankfully, on a tip, I switched to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005D4NXI4">Dr. Elsey's Precious Cat Respiratory Relief Litter - 20 lb</a> and I highly recommend it. It clumps well, tracks the least of the six or seven litters I've tried, and as an added bonus is completely dust-free (since it's made for cats with respiratory problems). Hope that helps. I know what a frustrating process this search can be and am very glad to be finally done with it.
