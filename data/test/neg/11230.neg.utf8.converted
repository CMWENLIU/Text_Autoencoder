Very disappointing. Even 1 star is way too generous. This coffee is very weak, very bland...and, well, very bad. I read (and re-read) this product description, as I taste this coffee, wondering where the full-bodied cup with chocolate notes is?! No body at all and, most certainly, no chocolate notes. Wolfgang's coffees may be estate grown at high altitudes so that the coffee cherries may ripen slowly and happily, thus, allowing their unique flavors and aromas to fully develop blah, blah, blah, but the fact of the matter is that an infused dirty sock has more flavor than this "Chef's reserve", "Medium roast" atrocity. There must certainly be something wrong with the selection of the top 5% of the world's coffee production or Wolfgang's personal recipe has lost an ingredient or two because this coffee is simply AWFUL! Generic instant coffee has better (and more) flavor than this celebrity chef's gimmick.
