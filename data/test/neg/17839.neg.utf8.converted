I went through the trouble to contact them and indeed they are using BPA lined cans.<br />BPA is the same substance removed from plastic baby bottles, because it is rated dangerous.<br />Many countries have already outlawed the use of BPA.<br />To be fair, it has to be said, that more than 90% of all manufactures of canned products in the US use epoxies containing BPA<br /><br />[...]<br />They might be slightly more expensive, but you save your body a substance that acts in your system like Oestrogen.
