I bought these thinking that using bamboo was a great idea as it's highly renewable.  But these filters do not do a good job at keeping the grounds in the filter, which obviously is all important.  I tried using these four separate times and each time the filter leaked at the seam.  And it wasn't just the seam splitting.  They actually deteriorated at the seam's edges.  The combination of bamboo and paper pulp does not seem to be able to withstand the flow of hot water.  I use a pour-over method when making coffee, and I never have a problem with paper filters, so I'm confident that it's not what I'm doing.  It's the composition of the filters.  Maybe I got a bum batch, but maybe not.  I won't be using the 76 filters that I have left.  It's back to all paper for me.
