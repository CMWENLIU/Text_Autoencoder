I was looking for a tasty cracker that would go well with hummus or cheese or dip. These things taste like cardboard and turn to sticky glue after one bite. They have no flavor whatsoever. Not even salt or a good dip could save these molded wheat flour stamps. And if you think they're healthy, you're wrong: the main ingredient is "enriched wheat flour", which is basically sugar. Fritos are better for you than this.
