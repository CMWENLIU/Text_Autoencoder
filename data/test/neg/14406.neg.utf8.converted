I find it interesting that folks who like the goji fruit and believe all the hype are so dismissive of the illnesses and reactions to it that a lot of folks have had. I thought they tasted fine, and didn't associate the waking up at 4am in the morning violently and painfully vomiting right away.  I liked the taste and was eating a few before bed each night as I read. It's possible that the berries themselves cause it, but far more probable that they are contaminated.  What I find interesting about the illness is that it wasn't immediate. I ate them for a lot of nights before waking up in agony and spending HOURS vomiting. I would surmise that those eating them after boiling/washing them are probably not having the same issues. The package said it was okay to eat as is, however. And the if you search goji online, there are A LOT of similar stories. I also thought it interesting that the "organic" might not actually be "organic" if they are supplied from China and thereabouts. There are NO organic farms out there. They still use DTT.
