We used Pantry Pest for several years and it used to do a good job of controlling the occasional infestations of flour moths, but they've changed the design of both the box and lure and now they're crap.  The adhesive, while nice and sticky, has been shrunk to two tiny patches and the lure is a thin rubber square that you toss onto the adhesive instead of the former round packet.  The moths don't seem too impressed with the little square and neither are we. I'm trying other brands now, the Springstar one has generous adhesive and a square that seems to actually work for instance, Catchmaster is next. No more Pantry Pest for our house!
