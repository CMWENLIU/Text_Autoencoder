This brand has very little going for it. I'm a huge ginger beer fan, in fact I'm drinking one right now, and I have to say that this doesn't come close to the other ginger beers Ive had in the past including my personal favorite "Barritts." Very little carbonation and ginger "tang" put this on the same level as "Regatta's" diet alternative.
