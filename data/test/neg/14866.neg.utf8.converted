Until recently, this product was organic and extracted without hexane, a chemical solvent. It was that way when I purchased it from Amazon. It even had the USDA Organic Seal on its label. None of this is any longer true. Blue Mountain SFL is no longer organic nor is it extracted without the solvent hexane or acetone (nail polish remover). Apparently, Blue Mountain lowered the quality of its liquid sunflower lecithin, but not its prices.<br /><br />Luckily, the MySunflowerLecithin.com website offers another brand of liquid sunflower lecithin - Lekithos.  The website has several grades of SFL. It also has a powdered form, but it is only 95% sunflower lecithin. (I wonder what the other 5% consists of.) I will buy their organic and mechanically extracted SFL next time. It is more expensive but I refuse to buy it non-organic or any soy lecithin - non-GMO or not - organic or not.<br /><br />All SFL are non-GMO, as I think all sunflower products are - so far. Nearly all soy products now have GMOs.
