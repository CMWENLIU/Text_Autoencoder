I have an old cat. I feed him with wet food or dry food soaked in water. First, he doesn't like this flavor, second, he often vomits undigested food after eating this. Last, this food doesn't dissolve in water, it's very hard, and have something gel like. Also, my cat's waist has the color of this dry food, which is light brown. In total, I don't think this food is healthy and tasty for cats.
