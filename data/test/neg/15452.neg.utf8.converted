I ordered this because I love the cinnamon and strawberry flavors... but what I got was a mix of blueberry, cherry, and strawberry instead. Excuse me? That isn't what I wanted at all! I hate the blueberry, but regardless of that, it isn't what I ordered! I had these delivered for THIS? Not again, I think!
