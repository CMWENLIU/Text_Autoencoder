I just don't understand how these guys are trying to sell 120 bars in bulk for 115 dollars, while Amazon sells 10 bars for 7 bucks. Just buy 12 boxes from Amazon for 84 dollars. I really would like to see this product in bulk though. Nature valley sells 96 bars for 20 dollars. That's what I want from Cliff.
