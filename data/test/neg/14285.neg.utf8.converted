While attempting to locate Sunshine Raisin Biscuits, I found these on Amazon. They appear to be similar to what I was use to enjoying<br />with the Sunshine product. The similarity ends with the picture on the tin canister. The biscuits are over baked with burn marks on<br />both sides. They are frail and crumbly, not soft and chewy, with several biscuits broken into small pieces possibly due to the poor<br />manner of packing in their canister. What appeared to be the raisins was a dark rubbery substance that did not chew well, the biscuit<br />part was bland and after several bites I had a nasty burnt aftertaste in my mouth.  Spending $15.00 plus shipping on a tin of biscuits<br />this size only to discover it is undigestible and non-refundable. This was a disappointment.
