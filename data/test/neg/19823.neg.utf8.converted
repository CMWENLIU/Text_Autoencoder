I followed the directions precisely but the end result was the same as using other pre-made GF crusts using a GF flour blend, palm shortening, ice water, salt. The crust looks and feels flaky, but when the fork hits your mouth, it dissolves into a grainy, pasty mush you either need to spit out or drink a glass of milk to get down.<br /><br />I don't know what needs to be added to give it the elasticity and ability to hold together, but whatever it is, this mix doesn't have it.
