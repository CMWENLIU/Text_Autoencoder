I ordered a bag of this risotto a couple of months ago after reading the great reviews.  We cook quite a bit of it, so I always like to have some on hand, and the price for this product seemed very good.<br /><br />My wife and I used it for the first time a few days ago.  As she was cooking it up she asked me what the black things were.  I looked down and said it was probably just some husks or something like that.  She pulled one out and it was very clearly an insect, legs and all.  Stirring the contents of the pan turned up at least half a dozen of the little beasts and this was in just a 1.5 cup serving.<br /><br />I next looked at the bag.  It had no holes in it other than the one we had made to start using it.  I poured out more of the rice and saw that not only were there many more insects in it, but other "debris" such as a couple of pieces of corn and other random things that looked like they were the result of poor processing.<br /><br />Now, I know that you can't harvest food without having insects and other things in the rough product, but normally insects and debris would be filtered out in the processing stage.  I don't know if we got a bad bag, or one that contained all of the "goodies" left over from a full day's sorting, but it was extremely disgusting and has put us off from ever buying this brand again!
