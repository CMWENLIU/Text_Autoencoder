Let me preface this by saying that I rarely have enough of an opinion about a canned soup, one way or the other, to take the time to post a review about it.  But with Puck's smug mug on the can and the galling discrepancy between the pretentious language on the label and the swill inside, I couldn't resist.  Let's see: "Vibrant, innovative approach."  "Robust flavors."  "Trademark passion and uncompromising quality."  "The most delicious tastes to savor."<br /><br />This is by far and away the worst clam chowder I've ever tasted.  I've had better New England clam chowder at crap roadside diners in Michigan.  I've gotten better clam chowder out of Campbell's Soup cans, at a fraction of the price.  This is a thin, flavorless gruel with a few denatured potato cubes swimming forlornly among a couple of minuscule pieces of clam.  It doesn't even taste salty (and with 25% of the US RDA of sodium per serving, you'd think it might have at least THAT going for it).<br /><br />The fact that they pass this monstrous garbage off as "organic" and "natural" vividly demonstrates this company's contempt for the American consumer.<br /><br />Wonder if Puck has ever tasted this fine product that bears his name.
