My dog was on this food for a while because i like many other people thought the veggies on the bag meant it was healthy but what it really means is their is no substance just corn and wheat gluten and dyes to color the food to make it look like vegetables. Please take it from me, my dog was chewing holes in his skin because of this food,i spent $700 at the vet for anti-histimine shots and creams and visits only to find out from my groomer that it was the food i was giving her. She was allergic to the dyes in it. I started giving her California naturals and she looked like she gained 3 years of her life back. Shiny coat, healthy glassy eyes, good energy and happier than she had been in a while. She is 14 now and i will never buy her anything but wonderful food like Nutro, California naturals, Merritt.
