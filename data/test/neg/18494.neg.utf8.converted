I bought this stuff after  Tasters Choice hazelnut coffee was taken off the market in the canister.  This stuff is a can mostly of sugar ,three kinds, and coconut oils and a bunch of other unhappy things.  At the end of a long list of ingredients coffee was last, just before natural and artifical flavor.  But to add insult to insult the flavor is neither of hazelnut or coffee.  I'd return it if the postage was not so high.  I tried to contact the company from the phone number on the can and never recieved the promised call back so politely offered.  It would have been helpfull to have had the ingredients posted with the offering.
