The thing about the coffee is that it has no special taste to it that makes it the best in the world.  I bought this coffee after watching the bucket list.  Dont waste your money on this product it tastes horrible... in fact people in my office pitches in to buy it and they spit it out.  The taste was AWFUL!  For 50-90 bucks i would tell you to better spend your money on tank of gas or something.
