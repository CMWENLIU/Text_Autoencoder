I was excited to see a reduced calorie, high-fiber mac & cheese product, and with such good reviews. Unfortunately, this has no cheese flavor to it at all. If you read the ingredient list, you'll see that cheese comes after salt - uh, what? I didn't and bought this item and will end up throwing away the sauce mix packets for the rest of them and eating the macaroni with spaghetti sauce. I think maybe the people giving this good reviews are new to healthier food and belive it is supposed to taste bad. That's just not the case - you don't have to compromise on flavor to eat healthy.
