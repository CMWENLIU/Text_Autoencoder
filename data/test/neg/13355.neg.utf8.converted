The product is great.  Unfortunately, the company's extraordinarily difficult website makes purchasing Nespresso capsules all but impossible.  That difficulty requires me to pay 40-60% higher prices by forcing me to buy from 3rd party providers like Amazon or Ebay.  Nespresso's marketing strategy has created a BLACK MARKET in their Nespresso capsules.  I called their 800 phone number, it hangs up on me.  There is no customer support email to whom I can email my complaint, and their postal address is in England.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.  IT IS FAR MORE TROUBLE AND EXPENSE THAN IT IS WORTH !!!<br /><br />David Hall<br />Austin, TX
