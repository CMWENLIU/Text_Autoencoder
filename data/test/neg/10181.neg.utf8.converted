I mistakenly ordered this from this vendor, much to my chagrin.  Admittedly, I was very excited about starting Yerba Mate and was a bit impulsive.  I thought that I could trust Amazon to protect us from vendors who were out to rape and pillage their customer base.  Not so!!!  I just found this identical item at Traders Joe's for $4.99!!!!  I better smoke a cigarette, because I've just been screwed!!!
