Yes, I also got ripped off when I purchased this overpriced product. Let's be clear that Nespresso coffee is good. But I was suckered into purchasing this set of overpriced coffee capsules when it appeared as discount pricing together with a nice capsule stand. It was implied that I would be saving money, but as has already been adequately pointed out, the actual price here is double what the manufacturer charges.<br /><br />What disturbs me is that I tried to cancel this order before it was shipped. I have never had problems with Amazon before, but every time I tried to cancel (I tried at least 6 times), I got an error message that said to try again. Ultimately, the order was shipped (from Arizona I think) and I got it OK. But I cannot recommend this price or supplier.
