This is not the original Justin's!!  It is a blend with mostly almonds!!  When I first saw and ordered, I thought I was getting the same product I have previously purchased at Whole Foods or at Target.  I thought this was a great deal since the product was often unavailable and cost $10/jar. My first impression was that I thought it looked odd that I had to stir the nut butter from amazon, something I never had to do with the store bought variety. It wasn't until I read another's review pointing out the word "Blend" that I went running to my kitchen only to discover my mistake in not noticing the difference. Thank goodness my daughter came to the rescue and picked up a jar from Target yesterday.  If you want the original and not the "blend"  you will have to go to the brick and mortar store or order direct from Justin's themselves.
