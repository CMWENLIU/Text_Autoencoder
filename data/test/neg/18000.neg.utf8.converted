To each his/her own.  I was suckered into buying a case (and the regular ones) on a Friday sale.  I'm now trying to give them away a package at a time.  They are blended, pureed, formed into peapods, but NOT any remote resemblance of an actual green bean.  I hate them (although one of my sister-in-laws and parents have ordered 3 more cases).  Like I said--to each his/her own.  I personally hate them.  But if you like salt, perhaps you'll like these---grab a Brita pitcher before you open to sample.
