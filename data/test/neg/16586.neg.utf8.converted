I have ordered beans from Coffee Bean Direct in the past, and they have always arrived well-roasted and fresh.  I am very satisfied with the company's other coffees.  However...<br /><br />These Sumatra beans are noticeably earthier than the Sumatra beans I'm used to getting from my local roasters.  In fact, the "earthiness" is all I can taste.  There really is no other flavor involved.  I expect Sumatra beans to be mild, but these beans take it to a whole new level.<br /><br />I was able to salvage this bag by blending in about 25% of CBD's Dark Sumatra beans, but even that still doesn't make a satisfying mug of coffee.<br /><br />The two stars are for the speedy delivery (even on Super Saver) and packaging, but order a one-pound bag before getting this fiver.
