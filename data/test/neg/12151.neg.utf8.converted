It's not bad, per se. I wouldn't call it a mocha by any stretch of the imagination.  It's more akin to watered down hot chocolate.  And if you like strong flavored coffee, you're unlikely to detect the presence of coffee flavor in this K-cup.  I'm sure, given the limitations of what you can put in a coffee pod, this isn't a horrible failure.  But let's call it what it is--watery hot chocolate that may have a detectable coffee flavor.  Feel free to try this one, but expect to taste what I have described, and you won't be disappointed.
