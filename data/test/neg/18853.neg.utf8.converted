I got the peppered flavor and it tastes awful.  It's spicy as heck but the pepper taste is so overwhelming that it totally ruins it.  I got through about half a bag and not more then 2 pieces at a time.  Totally disgusting.  I like beef jerky and Jack Link's especially, just not this flavor.<br /><br />Anyone who is a health nut may not like this because it's loaded with MSG, though I think most beef jerky is.
