I have prepared this tea according to instructions and how I prepare every other cup of tea: Steep about 4 minutes. However, this tea is either dry or I got a strange batch because it becomes quite bitter very quickly. The sweet, floral jasmine flavor is present but again--with a bitter tinge. And I'm not about to start putting sugar in my tea.<br /><br />I won't be buying it again.
