I read the other reviews about the taste of this product being less than ideal but i shrugged if of as i was planning to use it in my brealfast along with oats. That first time i had a real eye opener. IT TASTES HORIBBLE at first. But since i ordered it i continued to use it in smaller doses.. went down to two spoons then three and stopped at 4 now. I have gotten accustomed to the taste somewhat but i cant see myself making a protein drink with this. I will have to put a lot of sweetener to make this platable which goes counter to trying to make a low calorie protein drink.<br /><br />Additionaly there is only about 11g of protein in 4 tablespoons so if u are a big person like me i wont be really getting enough of protein allotment from a serving of this stuff. I would no recommend increasing the serving size as there is quite a lot of fat per serving even though there are no sugars. And again the amount of sweetner needed to make it taste drinkable would cancel out the benefits.<br /><br />I also tried mixing it with another protein drink i have that tastes good as i felt that i could get the best of both worlds.. the fiber of this this product + the taste and high protein content of the other. It tastes ok but why waste money on two sets of protein. Just get a better product and eat more veges. I am sticking to my old product. Will never buy this again.
