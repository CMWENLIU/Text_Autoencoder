I bought this last year to go along with my new home espresso machine. I love Ghiradelli dark chocolate so I was really excited to try this in my cafe mochas. However, there is little to no chocolate flavor and it just tasted overly sweet. Try Hershey's Special Dark syrup with your mocha's it's much cheaper and has more chocolate flavor.
