We have now gone through 4 formulas, and here are our conclusions.<br /><br />Similac (non-organic): They use cows which have been given growth hormones.  Seriously, even most non-organic milks in grocery stores do not use growth hormones.  Our baby spent his first four months off the growth-charts until it finally dawned on me to check into this.<br /><br />Similac Organic: Our baby liked this one, but then a NYT article revealed that this formula has a significant amount of cane sugar added - no wonder he liked it.<br /><br />Earth's Best: We really struggled with the transition from Similac to Earth's Best.  We went through a 2 week transition of 3/4 Similac, 1/4 Earth's Best...with a slow increase in the Earth's Best.  Even to our adult taste senses, it had a fishy odor and taste (likely the DHA, which is supposedly taken from seaweed for this brand).  And it NEVER WENT INTO SOLUTION.  We would constantly have to interrupt his feeds to check and see whether the nipple was clogged - being a baby, he would suck and suck -- even when no milk was coming out.  Our baby developed eczema - I am not convinced the formula caused the problem.  Babies get eczema.  But after trying everything else (detergents, lotions, soaps, etc) and reading some reviews questioning whether Earth's Best caused eczema, we decided to try one more formula switch.<br /><br />Baby's Only Organic: "Now here is something I can add to my coffee when we run out of milk," says my husband.  It has a wonderful smell of oatmeal.  No transition needed, our baby finished an entire 8oz in one sitting.  It goes into solution better than both the Similac and the Earth's Best.  No GI distress or constipation when we made the switch.  I agree with other reviewers that it is annoying that the canisters are small, but scoop for scoop, it is less expensive than Earth's Best.  Just waiting for Amazon to have a "subscription" discount.  I highly recommend Baby's Only!
