I bought this as a gift subscription for my daughter and her husband who like a strong flavorful coffee.<br />This is what she said "Hi Dad, I am sorry to say this but the new coffee is awful. It tastes like watery boiled green beans. Can we send it back?"<br />So, be warned, just because it says it's "Italian" doesn't mean it will be flavorful. I'll have to get it replaced now. Disappointed.
