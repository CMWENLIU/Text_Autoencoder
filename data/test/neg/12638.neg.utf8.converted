Acai Mango Zinger was one of my favorite teas EVER.....until I ordered this product from amazon, based on the picture of the box I recognized well.<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BRUE54/ref=oss_produc,<br /><br />The picture shows the regular Acai Mango Zinger, but what I got was Acai Mango Sweet Zinger Ice.  So I thought, how bad could that be?  Actually pretty bad.  The stevia makes this tea too sweet (for my tastes) and covers up the nice Acai Mango flavor.  What a shame.  I might as well be drinking sweet tea.<br />The other problem is that I contacted the merchant about this error, and still ... no reply.  And Amazon policy says I can't even return it.
