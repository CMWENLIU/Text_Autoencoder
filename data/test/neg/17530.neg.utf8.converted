I don't recommend this product at all.... I was tricked by description.. But this product is low quality and tastes really bad. I paid 12 bucks for this thing... I wouldn't eat it even if I had paid 100! I heated one package in the Microwave and the smell of the whole apartment was terrible... I didn't take the warning for real and tasted it... and .. EEEEEK!
