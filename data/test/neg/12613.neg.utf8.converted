I placed the order on 12/6/09 and here it is 12/31/09 and I never received it. When I tried to track the order UPS does not have the tracking number in the database cause the number is bogus. for some reason I cannot contact the merchant to tell them what's going on so I have to dispute the charge on my credit card.
