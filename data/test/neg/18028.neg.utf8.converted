I have been buying Gingerbread house kits for several years at Costco and have always been happy with them. This year they changed the style to the one I'm commenting on. I was disappointed with the Santa's House & Toy Shop. I bought two kits and both had broken pieces that I had to glue together before I could even begin to assemble them, not to mention the candy canes that were obviously broken before they were even packed in the kit.  Also, the pre-printed sides were backwards, leaving me to have one rough side exposed with the windows facing inward. I guess I was spoiled with the previous kits I've bought, never a problem with any of them. I usually buy three kits every year. I assemble them before Thanksgiving and as part of our Thanksgiving day tradition my three grandchildren decorate them.<br />Regardless of the quality of the kit, the kids enjoyed them which is all that<br />really matters.
