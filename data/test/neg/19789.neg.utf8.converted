So far, this Crepe Myrtle has not shown one flower, nor the potential for any flowers, and, in fact it did not look good when I got it, about 30 days ago.  I will provide an update if it starts looking healthier and beautiful like the picture.  Product did arrive quickly.  Also, the greenery is not near as full as the picture shown.
