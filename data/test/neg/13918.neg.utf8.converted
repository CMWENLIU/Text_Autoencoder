I have been a big fan of McCormicks Lemon and Herb Seasoning, I use it as a low fat/calorie seasoning for my cucumbers, cabbage, fish popcorn. I loved it. Then they came out with this "Perfect Pinch" Lemon and Herb. It tastes nothing the same. In fact I can not even taste the lemon at all and the other "herbs" have zero flavor in my opinion. Bring back the old seasoning. I just ordered the origional flavoring without the "perfect Pinch" on Amazon. Don"t waste your $$$ on the "perfect Pinch" Lemon and Herb.
