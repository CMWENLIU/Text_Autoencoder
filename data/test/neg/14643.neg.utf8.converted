I purchase a lot of products from Amazon. This is the first time I wanted to return an item and these are not returnable. The product is not sampling of the flavors but appears to be a box of all the flavors they couldn't sell individually. There are so many multiples of flavors I would never use (ie: 4 cinnamon, 3 peppermint, 2 watermelon), this is a complete waste of money. And, it didn't contain any of the flavors I most wanted to try.
