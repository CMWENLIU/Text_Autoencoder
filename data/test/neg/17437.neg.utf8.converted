"Planters Dry Roasted Peanuts" - when I first ordered they were good and crunchy and it disappeared from my house fast and so I ordered the second package and I really feel for ordering. The peanuts were old stock and did'nt taste good or cruncy. Disappointed with amazon, did not expect this from amazon.<br /><br />Since all these S&S come in three packs, it is a waste of money. Better to get one from local stores atleast if it is not good, I will not waste lot of money like I do with amazon.
