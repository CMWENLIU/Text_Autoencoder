This is the first gluten free flour I tried, and I foolishly bought flour, and some different muffin and cookie mixes of the same brand. I ended up thowing most of it in the trash. Its aftertaste is extremely off-putting.  I've heard theories about what causes the nasty taste in this flour, but am not interested in any explanations, since I have no intention of rationalizing the bad taste and forcing myself to eat it anyway.<br /><br />Since then, I've tried some gluten free products that are not bad and taste fine, so I don't see any reason to ever buy Bob's baking mixes of any kind.  They should do something about their blend if they want to stay competitively in the business.  I would give it fewer than one stars if that were an option.
