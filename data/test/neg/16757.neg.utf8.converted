I just got my order and sure enough I was confused to where my boxes were-Instead of 108 k cups- I got a 18 ct box, not the 108.  I emailed the seller and they will not honor their error. They offered me a return label or $15 off my order that I placed. They said they will be correcting their mistake on the title.  Dont they have to honor it??
