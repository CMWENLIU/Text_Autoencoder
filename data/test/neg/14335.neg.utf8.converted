I purchased this product (3 packs) to make Sushi for our family of four.  The Nori or Seaweed Wrap is very small, a little less than 2" x 4" which makes it very hard to make a simple California Roll with crab, cucumber, and avocado.  Once rolled it wasn't quite big enough to cut, but also made a much bigger single piece of sushi.  The sticky rice was exremely sticky and we had more rice than what the 10 sheets of Nori could take.  Don't recommend for family dining unless your family is looking for a snack and some sticky fun, however, may be perfect for the single person with time to play or only likes a single item in their sushi.  I'll buy the bigger sheets for sushi next time...
