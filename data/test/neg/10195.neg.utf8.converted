This is a poor excuse for coffee - even for instant coffee. I was looking forward to trying it after hearing good things on the web - unfortunately, I was disappointed. I tried this coffee using the specified instructions, and also tried using less water. The best I can say of it is that it is weak garbage. It is almost like drinking hot water - but with a foul taste that will leave you longing for a real cup of coffee. If you want fast coffee, allow me to suggest a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQSMPO">Keurig B60 Special Edition Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a> instead.
