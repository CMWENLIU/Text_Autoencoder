I was delighted when I found another sweetener that seemed to be based on stevia and not aspartame or chlorine (clorinated sugar, that is, as in Splenda). But after I used up my first box, which was not the most enjoyable experience (had a bad aftertaste), I decided to boycott the stuff.<br /><br />The mix of erythritol and rebiana goes through a patented process that is controlled by the same big companies that manage aspartame. Some of it starts out with stevia but the same could be said of Splenda and sugar; the whole ends up being truly artificial in substance. Just say 'no'. Look for a stevia sweetener that consists of stevia, not some big company's invention.<br /><br />The stuff I'm using now is absolutely wonderful. It's called SweetLeaf.
