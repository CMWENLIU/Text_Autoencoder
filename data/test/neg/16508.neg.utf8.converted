We researched cat foods to find the best, and Newman's is one of the best.  The problem is that I can buy it for ~$9.60 for the 3lb bag and ~$13.70 for the 4.75.  It was not easily found at local stores, but definitely worth the effort. I hope Amazon gets a little more realistic in regard to pricing this line
