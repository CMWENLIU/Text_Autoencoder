My overall impression is that they are dry, dry, DRY, DRY!!  Get it?. They have a very strange sort of powdery texture...and a lot smaller than they show on the bag or than any garbanzo bean I have ever tried. The sea salt flavor tastes a lot like roasted, salted soybeans...I was hoping it would be better than that. All of the other flavors are contained in a crunchy coating on the outside of the bean. The cinnamon tastes very cinnamon-y without being sweet. The chili is slightly spicy. The cracked pepper tastes little different to me than the sea salt flavor. I will not purchase again and made the mistake of buying a mixed case......not cheap either....wonder if I can just boil them back to life?
