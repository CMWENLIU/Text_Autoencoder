In all the advertisements I've seen for the new canister, French's claims this packaging will help the product stay fresh.  I suppose that might be possible, IF they were fresh in the first place.  When I opened the can and tried one, they were already stale - no crunch to them.  I don't know if it's a problem with the way their seal binds to the plastic or what, but it isn't working.  I won't buy this container again.  I hope they don't phase out the old ones!
