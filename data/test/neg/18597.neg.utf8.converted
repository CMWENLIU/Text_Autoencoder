When I subscribed for almonds, I took my time and read the ads. I was looking for some that were roasted but unsalted and without added oil. When they arrived, I realized that they were coated with something that included MSG! I was looking for a healthy snack, NOT MSG. The MSG was not mentioned before I made the purchase. I kept them, but I was not happy and I cancelled my subscription immediately. I would still like to arrange for some healthy nuts to arrive periodically by means of a subscription arrangement, but now I am very hesitant to sign up for it. Who would imagine that someone taking care to avoid oiled and salted almonds in favor of plain roasted ones would be pleased to get them coated with MSG??? Not me!
