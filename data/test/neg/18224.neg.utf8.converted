Okay, so I'm a FEMALE and I was out of deodarant, so I used my husbands this morning, which was this brand.  I was dressed beautifully today, took a fresh shower this morning and put on a brand new, beautiful blouse.<br /><br />Around 12:30 p.m., my co-workers were eating subs.  Im talking to a co-worker and I smell a whiff of onion, I assume it's the subs.<br /><br />IT WAS NOT THE SUBS...IT WAS ME!!  OMG, I WANTED TO DIE.<br /><br />I have never had a deodarant not work like this.  I work at a desk.  I went out for lunch today and I was sitting in the hot sun.  When I started to sweat, that's when it all went downhill.<br /><br />I was paranoid ALL DAY, I kept putting on lotions, etc. to try to mask the onion smell, I just couldn't believe it!  How horrible! I asked my husband does this work for him and he said NO, that it only works for a few hours and he has been meaning to buy deodarant with an antiperspirant.  That made me feel better!  (I didn't share the gross details that it did not work for me--I was too embarrassed).<br /><br />I read the product label and it says that athletes, etc. use this for protection...WHAT THE HELL???!!  This product failed me after 4 hours and I am a very clean female, who showers twice a day.  How awful.  I pray my co-workers assume it was onions on the subs and not me!  I never want to see this product again. How devastating.
