I recently tried this cookie and the Ginger flavor.  They were both disgusting.  The texture was similar to a protein bar.  The flavor of the chocolate one was very weak, contrary to the label, which states that it has a rich chocolate flavor.  The other one was very spicy, with no sweetness to cut the spice.  Not a pleasant experience.  I didn't finish either of them.
