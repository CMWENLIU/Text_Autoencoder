Purchased an entire case of 12 boxes and signed up for 6 month renewal on item. I didn't foresee a problem going through 12 boxes in 6 months.  However, when they arrived the use by date is only 3 months out and the cookies must have been overheated, because the white powdered sugar is non-existent (cookies have a brown glazed looked). The cookies do not taste bad, and I'm hoping they are not. This item is not eligible for return, so I will just have to use these up within the next couple of months and cancel the subscription.
