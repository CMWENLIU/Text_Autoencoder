I only gave this tea a star because I couldn't post a review without at least one. It really rates ZERO stars.<br />I had loved Good Earth Original Sweet and Spicy Caffeine Free Herbal tea from first sip, and it quickly became my favorite. When I was suddenly unable to find it locally, I was excited to find it on Amazon and ordered 6 boxes, with more to be sent automatically. Alas, the feeling was not to last. I was SO disappointed in the tea!<br />I happily made a cup as soon as it arrived, and something was off about the smell. Then I tasted it, and all doubt was gone- it was NOT the same tea. Reading the ingredients on the box, I discovered ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR as the 3RD INGREDIENT! UGH! No wonder it was so awful! YUCK! It was so bad, it bears repeating... YUCK! It actually gave me a headache (similar to MSG). Don't buy this tea if you liked the original. It is no longer "all natural"!<br />I emailed a polite inquiry to the tea company about the change in recipe, and still have gotten no response.<br /><br />Customer service at Amazon was wonderful, as always, and promptly issued me a full refund, and I donated the tea to a local charity.
