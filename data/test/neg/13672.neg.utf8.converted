I blame myself for not turning the bag over and reading the ingredients, but I thought these were something else. This item was in the produce section of Walmart and since I love sugar snap peas....well you get the drift. Let me tell you that these are not baked sugar snap peas! They are greasy cheeto-like green things. The put me in mind of those fried potato sticks in the can as far as taste is concerned. These crisps should be in the potato chip aisle along with all the other greasy fattening chips, and not with the produce to make the consumer think she's getting a nutritious baked snack.
