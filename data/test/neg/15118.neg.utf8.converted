The title for this product clearly stats "Low Fat Milk", which in my world means 1% milk. In the description, the product is listed as "Reduced Fat Milk", which is 2% milk.<br /><br />The product I received is 2% milk. I'm not going to return it, because that's just more trouble than it's worth. Buyer beware!!
