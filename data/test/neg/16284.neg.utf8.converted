PLEASE research, on the web! This product nearly killed my dog! All of Dogswell jerky treats are Poison!! Made in China! This Dist. does not seem to care he is killing our pets. Fda told me 70 dogs have died from these kind of dog treats. BEWARE! I have over 1,000.00 in vet bills. Amazon please don't sell this line to us, talk with the FDA,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AJ1ULS">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken Breast,15-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> find another product made in the USA, before more of our furry friends get sick or die.
