The texture of Annie Chun's brown rice is much better than gogo rice.<br /><br />Texture is very good. It is like white rice. Texture of GOGO rice is<br /><br />more rough. Taste is ok, not strong. If you like smell or taste of<br /><br />brown rice, buy gogo rice. If you don't, you may buy Annie Chun's.<br /><br />6.3-Ounce is not enough for me. GoGo rice is 7.4-Ounce.<br /><br />And mostly time, it cost more than gogo rice.<br /><br />Annie Chun's rice is more expensive, but less rice, and weaker taste<br /><br />and smell.
