Just an FYI: Juicy Fruit "re-engineered" their flavor in 2003 after getting criticism about the amount of sugar in the gum and it's NOT the same as the Juicy Fruit you chewed as a kid. Now it's got aspartame (artificial sweetener) and the taste is overpowering and bitter.<br /><br />When I was a kid, I loved the taste of Juicy Fruit so much I wanted to *eat* it, not just chew it. Not anymore. Now it just tastes like every other sugar-free gum on the market- too mushy, too soft, artificial "tang", and too weirdly sweet.
