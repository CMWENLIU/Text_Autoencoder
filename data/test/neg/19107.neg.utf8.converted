I have to respectfully disagree with the other reviewer here. I have no problem with the unsulfured darkish color of them, but they really don't taste like anything but sugar.<br /><br />Part of that could be because of the kind of apricot (not California?), but I wish the product was clearly marked in terms of the kind of apricot, since as anyone who likes dried apricots knows, there is a big difference between Mediterranean and California apricots.<br /><br />In any case, these are simply sweet and sugary lack the fruity tartness of even Sunmaid brand apricots. I hope I can find someone to give them away to because, as much as I love apricots, I can't eat these.
