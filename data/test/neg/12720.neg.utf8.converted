Not great, too much of this stuff is still way too readily available up to this day in 2011, so even though it's from the 80's, there still no real nostalgia. Perhaps doing other foods like doritos or Pepsi but with their OLD logos would have been much more fun... although that would probably be a lot more expensive.
