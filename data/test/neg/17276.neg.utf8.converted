I've grew the catnip in the past and had never experienced any problems. But this time was different... I've ordered Ferry-Morse Organic Catnip Seeds and planted half of them indoors. Same gardening process as I used in the past. However, the catnip seeds didn't germinate. I've tried again, and still nothing. What a rip off!
