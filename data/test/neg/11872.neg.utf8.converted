I kinda assumed that buying bulk saltines from Amazon would be cheaper than buying in a store, but I should have done my research first. My local Vons had them for half this price (admittedly it was a sale, but not some crazy clearance price. Maybe 20% off). These are great saltines but go buy them elsewhere.
