My cats love these treats and they are getting hard to find in the store. However the price is way too high. I paid over $4 for each of these and I can buy them at WalMart for $2.93 when they are in stock. I am very disappointed because I thought I was buying a 10 pak and not a single bottle at that price. I won't buy them again through Petco. My cats will have to adjust to something else that is sold at a more reasonable price.
