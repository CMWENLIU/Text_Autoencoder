so i thought i'd give it a few weeks before i gave my review on this tea.<br />the 1st week of drinking this, my skin actually broke out more.<br />i figured maybe things would get worse before improving as it IS detoxing my skin and probably toxins had to come out.<br />2nd week, i applied the tea to my skin as well as drinking it 2x a day. there was an overall glow,<br />but i was still breaking out more than before.<br />3rd week - i stopped applying it to my face, and just drank 2x a day: breaking out like crazy.<br />so...<br />it's not really working for me. really disappointing. but glad i gave it a try.
