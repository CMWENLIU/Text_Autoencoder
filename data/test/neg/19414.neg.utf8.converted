Come on now.  how can you make a 20th anniversary deluxe edition without having the original version.  Not to say it is not a great movie but hey there is no need to edit the movie just so you can show it on disney channel.  I mean no offense but did the producers of this movie say hey why not edit it like a CD so we can sell it at walmart.  Come on where is the love of a good movie.
