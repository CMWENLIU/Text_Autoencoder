I don't like to return the items in general.  because I usually spend some time researching and reading to make sure the product that I order is up to my expectation. This light coffee didn't make coffee at all. I used the pod in my commercial Cuisinart one cup coffee maker and it gives me too light cup of coffee, one that you can see the bottom of the cup. Besides, these are not returnable nor exchangeable. I've never been so disappointed with Amazon.com product that I decided to comment on this product.
