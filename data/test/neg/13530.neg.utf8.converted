I'm just getting into making my own sausage, and bought this kit to try breakfast links.  However, it contains corn syrup solids.  Corn syrup is one of the many terrible things I've removed from my diet and will never add back.  Returning it immediately.  I'll buy casings on their own and try a recipe from scratch.
