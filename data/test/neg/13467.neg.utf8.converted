I received the order as expected and the label stated that it was strawberry pancake mix. On opening the first canister, I found that it contained BLUEBERRY pancake mix. I also opened the second on and found the same. I can only assume the third one is also blueberry. The blueberry was nice but I would have preferred what I actually clearly ordered.
