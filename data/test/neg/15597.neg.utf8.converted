I read the other reviews, and since some said things about it being very spicy I thought I'd give it a shot. I love tea, and especially spicy chai. This stuff is called classic chai, but I have never tasted any chai that is anything like this. I have at least liked if not loved all the other chai teas that I have tried except this chai. My lady is a coffee lover, and we frequent many different boutique coffee shops and even the mainstream ones like starbucks. I have tasted so many varieties at these establishments, and in other places because I have been searching for one that compares to this one place I visited on vacation that served me chai that was so spicy that it kind of had a peppery burn that warmed my throat, it was delicious. I have tried most other varieties available at grocery stores too. I had hopes that this gamble would pay off, but alas, it sucks to the point that it is in my opinion undrinkable! Yes that is my opinion but, you should keep in mind that<br /><br />IT CAN NOT BE RETURNED!<br /><br />I would suggest that the company offer samples or sample size packs for sale so people don't get stuck with nearly a pound of tea that is NOT AS DESCRIBED AND NOT RETURNABLE.
