During the big $25 Kraft promotion, I bought this to have something in the house for when my niece visits... kids like Kraft mac and cheese, aunties would prefer to serve something a little healthier. So I figured with the price incentive, this was an OK compromise. I'd tried it before, and it was fine. And I do love me some mac and cheese (even this lowfat version) in my weaker moments.<br /><br />Well, not this time. One of the boxes was kind of crushed in shipment and the macaroni was spilling out, so I thought "what the hey, I'll just make it for dinner." Ugh! Big mistake! Utterly disgusting. Unlike the reviewer who said the cheese sauce barely registered, I found it to be completely overpowering, and it had a horribly bitter chemical taste. I practically had to choke it down, and eventually I just gave up and threw it out. I have no idea if all the remaining 5 boxes will be just as bad, and I'm afraid to find out. I hope others who purchased this product at the same time will weigh in with their experiences.<br /><br />I'll definitely be sticking with Annie's. Wish I'd noticed that promotion before the Kraft one.
