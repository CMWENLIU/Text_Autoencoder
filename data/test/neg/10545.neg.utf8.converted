This product came highly recommended by my friends and the vet so I decided to purchase a 30lb. bag for my 6 month old puppy. I fed it to her the first day I got it after inspecting the good 'til date and for any contamination. Within a few hours, she had blood in her diarrhea after I took her for a walk. My dog has never had diarrhea in the month that I've had her. On top of that, she was constantly gassy throughout the day after being fed this product. On my 2nd walk with her, she had diarrhea again despite not being fed anything after the first episode. I took her off the food and her stool returned to normal. I fed this to her again today and she's passed liquid stool once more and is extremely lethargic and gassy right now. Amazon was nice enough to take care of my problem, but this item needs to be pulled. After my pup's issues, I did some more additional research and found many consumer complaints filed with consumer affairs regarding several of Natural Balance's product including this one. It's possible that I received a bad bag, but I don't know....I'm just really bothered by the similarities between my experience and what other's have posted.
