I tried this litter at the suggestion on someone's suggestion in the grocery. It lasted a long time for him and his multi-cat household and locked in all the odors.  Unfortunately, it didn't work well for me.  Kitty didn't mind it and there was no dust flying up when I scooped out the stinky solids and fluffed the litter(huge plus), but if I didn't change it every 5-7 days, the yellow-soaked grains would start to smell stale and then downright stinky.  The stuff costs too much for that.  I tried Fresh Step Extreme instead and that stuff is amazing.  Of course, I have to contend with the dust, but again, Kitty doesn't mind it and it smells fresh and masks the odors of the waste as I remove it.  I only change it once every 3-4 weeks, but I do clean her box everytime she uses it.
