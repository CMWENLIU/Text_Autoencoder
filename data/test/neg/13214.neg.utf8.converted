These bulbs DO have a lovely, bright light that is much warmer and enjoyable than the traditional eco flourescent bulbs with their cold blue light. That's what I usually hated about the compact flourescents, so I was super excited about these bulbs. But with Amazon's terrible packaging, plus Earthmate's equally terrible packaging, I got *3* of 6 bulbs broken on arrival! What a waste. I have a baby around and besides the inconvenience of a return, it's dangerous to have these shards pouring out of my package as soon as I open it. Not to mention apparently these things are toxic once broken. So a big fat thumbs-down on this purchase, despite the beautiful light of the remaining three. I will be looking for another site to purchase them from, one where the packaging has a better reputation. On Amazon's good side, though, is that the customer service was very helpful and I got a full refund with one phone call.<br /><br />Yeah, PS - It's hard (impossible?) to find anywhere to dispose of BROKEN mercury-containing CFL bulbs. So I tried to contact Earthmate to figure out what to do. Guess what - no phone number on their website. Not even an email address unless you want to be a wholesaler for them! So a word to the wise...NEVER TRUST A 7-YEAR WARRANTY FROM A COMPANY THAT DOESN'T HAVE A PHONE NUMBER!!<br /><br />I did some detective work and these lights are made by a parent company called Litetronics (not to be confused with the apparently reputable Lightronics). Their number is (800) 860-3392 if you would like to pursue a similar complaint.
