First off I am no tea connoisseur, although I do enjoy a good cup of tea prepared under the right conditions. I was disappointed, probably because of higher hopes, but the tea leaves I received are almost powder form like in tea bags. High quality leaves when it comes to appearance are complete leaves or almost complete. I'm not sure what quality the other reviews are talking about.  Second the taste isn't to my liking, seems rather flat, but again i am no connoisseur.
