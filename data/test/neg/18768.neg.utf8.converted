I have been enjoyng the Special K Protein cereal for at least a year but Kellogs decided to "improve" it, and I say, Yuk.  The "Extra" means they've added extra sugar! Now it does taste like cardboard, but cardboard that is sickly sweet.  Another case where corporate America is determined to keep America's sweet-tooth in high gear.  Thanks Kellogs, for making a good product bad.<br /><br />Update:  A good, less sugary low-carb, high-protein substitute for this cereal is Hi-Lo Low Carb Cereal by Organic Milling, which is also available on Amazon.  Hi-Lo has 1/7 the sugar of the Special K, more protein and more fiber.  And it tastes better.
