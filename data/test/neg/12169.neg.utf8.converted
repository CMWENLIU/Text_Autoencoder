Mine stopped working after about a dozen uses in about a year and a half. Now, when I turn it on and insert the probe into a piece of meat, the temperature jumps to 199 degrees within a minute or two -- and that infernal piercing voice insists that my "entree is ready!" The unit is older than its one-year warranty, but since I'm sure that the product was designed to last longer than one year, I called the company and asked that the warranty be put aside, and that they do the right thing and replace the unit. The agent said they couldn't because their policy says they can't. I tried to explain circular reasoning to her -- but I did not succeed. Hung up and threw the thing in the trash.
