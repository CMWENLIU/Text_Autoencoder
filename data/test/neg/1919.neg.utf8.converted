The pop-up bowl sounds like a great idea, but evidently they rushed it to market before all the bugs were out.<br /><br />The first bag I cooked was fine, except the instructions for opening the bag are far from clear, and even after you figure out how to do it it's a lot of trouble and makes a big mess.<br /><br />But the second bag evidently sprang a leak - it sprayed bright orange grease all over the inside of my microwave, even into the tiny vent holes inside the top and side. I always watch popcorn carefully while it pops, but I could not see the grease spray until after it was done and I opened the door. Cleaning it all out was a horrible ordeal, and I'm sure everything I cook in the microwave will come out smelling like popcorn grease for weeks.<br /><br />They released this product too soon. It needs serious redesign. I will not buy it again.
