I purchased two cases of Native Forest Coconut milk and received the Sir Lanka-sourced product.<br /><br />It is thin, with hardly any fat. It's not suitable for cooking with, since it is too watery and does not have the richness of other brands of coconut milk. Thai Kitchen's coconut milk is much thicker and flavorful.<br /><br />The only upside is that I can use it undiluted in a shake, where I normally use 1:2 coconut milk and water. That's how thin it is, straight out of the can.
