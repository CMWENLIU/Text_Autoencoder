We had high hopes for this since we love Annie's crackers and pasta.  Alas, these snacks are a horrible healthy replacement for gummies.  They may be healthy for you, but if your kids aren't going to eat them (all the grown-ups whom we've had try them dislike them as well) it doesn't really do much good.  Too bad, we really wanted to like these things.
