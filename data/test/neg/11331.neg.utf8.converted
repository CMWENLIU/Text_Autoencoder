Hi<br />I was excited to learn about the benefits of coconut water. So...I bought a case from Amazon.com.  The next day, I took my cold coconut water out of the fridge and took a sip...UG...it tasted really really off. I dumped it down the drain and to my surprize and disbelief, it look like a small animal liver was stuffed in the box. I'm very serious when I tell you this! I took pictures and my father-in-law was actually there when this 'thing' drop out of the box.<br /><br />Got a call back from O.N.E when the saw the pix I sent them.  They asked me if I wanted more coconut water and I said NO. They said this has never happened before.  I still feel sick to my stomach after what I saw.<br /><br />I'm going to dump the rest of the water in my garden as I just can't bring myself to drink the water!
