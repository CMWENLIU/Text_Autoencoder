I'm surprised to read the other reviews for this product...I was soooo excited to find my favorite Honey Nut Clusters on Amazon after searching for so long in the grocery stores where I live. I could not contain my excitement the day I knew that they would be delivered!  I got home to find 3 beautiful boxes with that memorable little squirrel smiling at me... I had to have a bowl immediately!! As I poured the clusters into my bowl...I thought to myself "hmmmm...this doesn't look quite right"  I procedeed with faith that it had just been so long since I had seen the cereal.  As I took my first bite I knew it was too good to be true... "THESE ARE NOT THE HONEY NUT CLUSTERS I KNOW AND LOVE!!"  I continued to eat hoping that I was imagining it or that it would just take a few bites to set in.  But alas...Honey Nut Clusters truly do not exist anymore.  This cereal is more like Honey OAT Clusters I do not see NUT Clusters.  I even checked the other 2 boxes to insure that the first one was not just a bad batch.  So to all those Cluster lovers out there...I am sorry...but the end is here :-( RIP Original Honey Nut Clusters!!! You will be missed!!  As for those of you in search of the next best thing...Let me introduce you to Honey Graham Oh!s and you can get them at a grocery store near you!
