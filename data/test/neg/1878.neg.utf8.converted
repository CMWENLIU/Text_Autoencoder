This product has a bizarre chemical taste. If you let the glass sit in your sink for an hour, it gives off an unholy chemical, perfume odor, which cannot mean good things for what it's made of. This has got to be made from some inexpensive chemical filler that tastes like chocolate for 20, minutes then reverts to its revolting base.
