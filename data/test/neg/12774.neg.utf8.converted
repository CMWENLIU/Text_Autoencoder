These cookies are awful. Amazon packed them in a padded envelope, so I figured I'd have a bag of crumbs, but every cookie was whole because they are as hard as rocks. The batch I got was full of burnt and blackened cookies. I ate half a cookie and threw the rest away.<br /><br />I thought I might have got a bad batch, but many other reviewers reported the same thing. I generally like Newman's Own foods, but there is nothing redeeming about this cookies.
