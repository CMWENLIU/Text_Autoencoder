First off, each can only makes two 6oz servings.  So this is a rather expensive cup of hot chocolate.  The flavor, at least to me, is terrible, it is mostly sugar and red dye.  It is a novel idea that might appeal to small kids but adults will find it sickeningly sweet. As mentioned above, it is rather expensive for what it is.  Only thing I like about this are the coffin shaped cans.
