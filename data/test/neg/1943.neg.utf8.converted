I am a big fan of Good Earth Sweet and Spicy Tea.  In July I ordered a pack of six 18-count boxes of caffeine free Sweet and Spicy tea bags.  I often give boxes as gifts.  The flavor of the tea from this order was not good.  Initially I thought maybe only one tea bag was bad, but each bag I tried had a bad taste.  I asked a friend to try one of the bags and she had the same reaction and said it did not taste like the Sweet and Spicy Tea she was accustomed to.  Perhaps this was a bad lot or the box is old.  However, the expiration date is 10-Mar-14.
