This is not pure cane syrup.  This is simple syrup (water and sugar with preservatives) made from cane sugar, unlike Lyle's Pure Cane Syrup.  You can make Monin's product at home yourself by mixing equal part sugar and water over light heat (and skip the preservatives).  Calling this product Pure Cane Syrup is like calling sugar water with maple flavoring "Pure Maple Syrup".  If you are too lazy to make simple syrup then this product is for you.  At this price, this product is not worth it.  Do not be fooled (as I was).
