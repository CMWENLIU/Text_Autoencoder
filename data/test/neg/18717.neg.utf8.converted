These were yucky! An old product that should have been thrown away and used as a write off for the manufacturer. The expiration (Best used by) date was only two weeks from the date I received them. I had not thought to check the date until we tried eating them and ultimately had to throw away. Totally wrong to sell old product. Be careful!
