I always purchase bags on board to pick up my puggles poop. I normally buy the blue bags but decided to purchase the colorful ones because they were a couple dollars cheaper at the time. I guess these bags are defective because I have had a few of the bags open on the wrong end and my hand went all the way through. This is not good when you are about to pick up poo. So I don't know if it was just a bad batch or what but I will definitely go back to buying the blue bags as I have never had a problem with those ones.
