I used to love the 70% rockstar juiced. When it changed to 50% I was disappointed, but it was still satisfying; definitely the best tasting energy drink on the market. The new 10% tatses like they simply replaced the juice with sugar water and citric acid. Terrible. I'm done with rockstar as soon as the stores run out of the 50% stuff.
