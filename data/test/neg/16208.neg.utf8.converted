I found Barry farms through amazon and ordered 46 oz of sorghum from their website on 6/25.  After my third email requesting a tracking no. I received an email from postal service stating that the product was being mailed on 7/2.  No responses directly from Barry farms.  I received my order and it was 32 oz quart jar and my invoice states 46 oz. I emailed them again.
