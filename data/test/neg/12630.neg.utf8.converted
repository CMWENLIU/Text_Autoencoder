I was looking forward to a rich chocolate taste in my coffee, but I was NOT impressed with this one.  The coffee came out sour, and no matter how much sugar I added to my cup of coffee, it still had a very sour chocolate taste.  I've since added a tablespoon or so to our full pot of coffee just to use it up, and it's okay that way, but I'd soon as rather not have it included, quite frankly!
