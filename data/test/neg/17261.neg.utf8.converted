I ordered this item because when I've purchased it from a local store it clearly states, no alkali. This description says produced with no alkali, however when I receive the item, on the can, it says with alkali. And I can't return it because it's a grocery item. I will just be throwing this junk in the trash. The whole purpose of me coming online to buy this is because I want a pure cocoa powder that has no alkali, hence it's in it's more natural form and higher in antioxidants. I do not want to purchase things that have been altered. ridiculous. I will not make this mistake twice. I can't get this locally anymore without the alkali. I wanted the product pictured, the can with the white label that says Fat Free Wondercocoa, not this tin brown can which is the second picture. Why the two different items Amazon? the whole purpose of putting pictures and descriptions up are so the customers know exactly what they are getting when they buy from you, especially on items that can't be returned!
