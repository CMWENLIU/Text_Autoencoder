Bought this to use in my classroom - first time I tried it, I used the usual amount of water I would normally use to the usual amount of coffee.  I ended up with a semi-dark colored cup of water with a bit of a coffee taste.  It was absolutely not worth the $6 I spent on it at Publix.  Hate the thing.  I now just use the coffee cup itself as an extra - even that was chipped when I took it out of the box.  :-/
