This potato salad is 50% sauce now. The can I opened today consisted of a few potato slices swimming in an unappetizing amount of sauce. The label should at least warn you to drain this product well. Unfortunately, I was using it for a recipe (featured on the can) that featured smoked sausage and bbq sauce. It came out (per the maker's instructions) like bizarre soup. For three times the price of a can of sliced potatoes this should be better. The upside is maybe this will drive me to make the stuff myself.
