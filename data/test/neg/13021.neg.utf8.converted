I have been roasting green coffee beans at home for nearly a decade. Costa Rica Tarrazu is my favorite bean. I did not find this brand of this variety of coffee to be as flavorful as beans from my usual supplier. It roasts well. In the roasting process it swells more than my favorite brand but that is not a problem - just an observation. I thought free shipping might save me money over what I had been paying but the disappointing lack of flavor has convinced me to go back to my usual supplier. Unfortunately, they do not sell through Amazon.com
