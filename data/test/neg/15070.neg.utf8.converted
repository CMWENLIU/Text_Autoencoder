Contains only Tongol Tuna (wild caught) from Thailand, and spring water,  so IS low sodium. However, it is NOT solid (or even chunk) tuna as described! You get what you pay for, and this tuna is a good example of that because it is cheap (about $1.70 a can) and looks it. Tastes ok but is really more like the grated tuna we buy our cat than the grocery store tuna we buy ourselves. Not recommended! For real quality tuna (albacoare) try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EF3E5Y">Crown Prince Natural Solid White Albacore Tuna in Water, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NO6EA2">Crown Prince Natural Solid White Albacore Tuna In Spring Water, No Salt Added, 6 Ounce Tins (Pack of 24)</a>.
