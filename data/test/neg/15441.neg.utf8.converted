I should have gone by previous reviews and passed on this item.  The lollipops were just about all broken.  I had about 2 good ones out of a dozen. They were wrapped in bubble wrap, so I have to wonder if they were broken before even shipping..  I don't even want to be bothered with trying to exchange them.  I'm pretty disappointed.
