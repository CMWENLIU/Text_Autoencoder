I don't know if all these wonderful reviews are from people who work for this company, but I would never recommend these! I love Hapi Snack's Wasabi Peas, but they're expensive and hard to find. I was thrilled when I saw these. However, they have a strange "fake" taste and worst of all, they are like eating rocks - LITERALLY! Every fourth or fifth pea I tried to eat was a solid rock. I actually chipped my tooth. My dental work is going to cost me a lot more than what I saved on these. They're not that hot, either. If you like Wasabi Peas try some other brand. These are not worth the $11+ shipping. I've never left a negative review like this before. But buyer beware.
