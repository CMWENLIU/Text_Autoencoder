After reading the reviews and seeing the ads on TV, I couldn't wait to give these a try--BUT--I think they are terrible!<br />They are dry and very chemically-tasting.<br />The only reason I gave them two stars instead of one is that they do have 5 grams of fiber each.<br />I will not buy these again and really wish I hadn't wasted my money on them.<br />Hopefully, the chocolate peanut butter variety is better but I haven't tried them yet.
