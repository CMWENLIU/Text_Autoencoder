This formula along with a whole bunch of other "Organic" formulas are made by PBM [...]<br />They recently changed their formulation, and have not changed the packaging, so you must watch your cans carefully for the ingredients change. My baby knew the formula was different and refused the new cans, got really gassy too.<br />I've called PBM Organics twice, first time they denied the change of formula. Second time they admitted it.<br /><br />The cans do not say anything like new formula or give you any indication of this. Whey is no longer the first ingredient, and Corn syrup solids is very high on the list.<br /><br />Very shady practices by PBM. Beware.
