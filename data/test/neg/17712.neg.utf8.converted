I am very disappointed having just opened a can.  The consistency is thinner than I like and paler in color.  The taste?  I thought I could past the overly acidic impact but I can't.  I will probably throw away the whole order or 12.  It is unredeemable.  I ought to have stuck with the brands I know and prefer such as ZIYAD and YEHUDA.
