These berries are mediocre at best. The berries aren't that good, and the chocolate is more like chocolate topping than real chocolate. We ate them, yes, but will definitely look elsewhere next time. Incidentally, my friend just told me that Shari's Berries is owned by the same company that owns ProFlowers. I do like ProFlowers, but will be boycotting them and all companies affiliated with them due to their continued support of Rush Limbaugh's views.
