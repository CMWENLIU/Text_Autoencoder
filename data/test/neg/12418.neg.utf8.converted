I sent this basket as a gift, the person who received it was appreciative of the gesture and so did not inform me of the quality of items until a much later date, almost six months after I had sent it. Her main complaint was that when she opened the packets of Godiva biscuits the chocolate coatings separated themselves from the actual biscuit and the biscuits crumbled in her hand. Since the Godiva Chocolate Brand has been one of favorites, she was completely turned off with the rest of the basket and basically dumped it in the garbage. I guess that these baskets are not in any great demand which would explain the fact that they had been packed sometime in the past and left to go stale in some corner, and then sold to some unsuspecting customer.
