I am a big fan of the high quality of Celestial Seasonings products and their usually good tea blends.  This particular blend does not make the cut. I want to like it but somehow the coconut does not really work in this tea.  The aroma is artificial coconut, and the flavor is a strange somewhat musty coconut flavor without noticable chai spice.  Drinkable but an eccentric blend--perhaps a diehard coconut lover would find this appealing.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Love the moment and the energy of that moment will spread beyond all boundaries."
