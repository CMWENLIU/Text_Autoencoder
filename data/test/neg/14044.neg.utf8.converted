I bought one of these and one of the mana potions for fun--was going on a trip to meet up with some friends who would appreciate such items.  Here's what we all pretty much agreed on:<br /><br />Visual:  Small but very attractive packaging.  Pretty much exactly what you might think a health potion would look like in real life based upon many popular games.  Smaller than expected--but then it more easily explains how your character in World of Warcraft, or 'toon, could carry 40 in one backpack.<br /><br />Taste:  Also explains why your 'toon refuses to drink another one for several minutes, even if it means dying.  Dying is preferable as long as you still have the aftertaste.  Think cough syrup, only without the benefit of alcohol or drugs.  Very glad it came in 50ml bottles--one good sized swig and it's gone.  After a short period of time, however, one starts to think it wasn't that bad.  An appropriate support group could probably help with that mild problem.<br /><br />Effects:  Works as advertised per friends who drank it (I drank the mana potion).  They were able to stay up as late as they desired, were able to concentrate well, and noted no adverse effects the next day.<br /><br />Active ingredients: Per their website, contains 25 calories per serving, includes Vitamin C (100% RDA), B1 (80% RDA), B5 (80% RDA), B6 (1600% RDA), B12 (100% RDA) as well as caffeine and enzymes.  Caffeine content roughly equivalent to two Red Bulls or four cups of coffee.<br /><br />Bottom line: Works well, but based upon the caffeine I would not recommend for children or anyone else you wouldn't hand a pot of coffee to and expect them to drink it all.  Really shouldn't be listed in toys and games, but rather with food or energy drinks.
