My rating is actually a "ZERO" but I had to choose between 1-5.  I will never order from this site again.  I ordered the Fukien Tea tree.  My order was delayed, which is not a big problem and not why I was disappointed.  But when the tree finally arrived - it was the wrong tree, I received the Gardenia tree.  The Fukien has the very tiny little white flowers which produce small red berries.  The Gardenia has larger flowers (which I do not like).  I was not happy that since there was a delay in the shipment of the Fukien tree - someone took it upon themselves to subsitute a different tree.  Did they think I would not know the difference???  If I wanted the Gardenia - I would have ordered it.  This shipment was returned the next day.  Hopefully I will be refunded in a timely manner!!
