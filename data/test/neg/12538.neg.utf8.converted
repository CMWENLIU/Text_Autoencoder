Wow - this is easily the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. I am a huge fan of soy products - I drink Silk, I eat vegan cheese of all flavors, I love soy yogurt - I've even dined on tofu dogs. I'm not a vegan (or even a vegetarian), I have an allergy to milk. For the most part I have been able to find all kinds of great substitutes for milk and dairy products. Because of all the great reviews I decided to give this a shot. First of all, let me just say that the amount of money you are supposedly saving is at best a stretch of the truth, and at most a blazing lie. I live in a relatively small area (where grocery prices are normally really jacked up) and I can find Silk and many other brands of soy, rice and almond milks for this price or less. So you probably are not saving as much as they claim.<br /><br />Now, on to the taste. It's not just that it's bad, it's that it's SO BAD my stomach is still turning. I'm not sure why other reviewers are giving it a good rating... maybe they're of the mindset that if you buy something vegan it has to be gross, which may have been true 30 years ago, but simply isn't the case today. I've had all kinds of dairy free foods that were fantastic - milks, breads, yogurts, ice creams, puddings, sauces, creams, etc. and they all tasted great. There is no excuse for the taste of this. I'm not joking or exaggerating at all when I say it tastes like old baby formula and stale cardboard. And I know it's not just me - I tried this stuff on three other people. Two of them got as far as smelling it and then refused to taste it (good move since it tastes worse than it smells) and one of them braved up and took a drink... and then pulled a face and wiped his tongue on his shirt. My mother suggested that I try to cover up the cardboard taste... couldn't be done. Then she suggested I try it in baking... but there is no way I'm putting THAT taste into cookies or cake.<br /><br />And please don't misunderstand and think that maybe I just don't like the taste of natural soy because I assure you that I do - I love roasted soy nuts, they're great. That is NOT the taste I am describing here, this is something else. Seriously, old baby formula and stale cardboard...
