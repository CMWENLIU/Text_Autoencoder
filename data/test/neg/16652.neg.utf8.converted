I have a Keurig B60 and have used it with a variety of coffee 'k cups' for several months now.  I was a little disappointed in the Tully French Roast.<br /><br />Now let me quantify that I  I tend to like my coffee "light and sweet".  I also find French Roasts to typically be among my least favorite types of coffee.<br /><br />I do sometimes opt for a bold cup of java.  However, I find the Tully French Roast to be more bitter than bold.  I've tired different cup size setting on the Keurig, but the Tully French Roast keeps resulting in a bitter cup of coffee.  It really had a burnt taste to it.<br /><br />I went so far as to run the same k cup through the Keurig twice to see if the Tully coffee was simply too bold for my taste.  I realize k cups are not intended for re-use but I was trying to figure out if the coffee was just too bold for my taste or really just bitter.<br /><br />SEE TIP AT BOTTOM OF REVIEW.<br /><br />While the second cup of coffee was on the weak side, it was still drinkable....however, just like the first, it was bitter.<br /><br />Where the Keurig is concerned I have found the best bold cups to be the Newman's Own Organic "Extra Bold" and the Emeril's "Big Easy Bold".<br /><br />Again, while not a huge fan of French Roast, I liked the Timothy's World "French Roast"; that brand is what you would expect, a nice cup of bold coffee.  The Tully's - just bitter.<br /><br />TIP:  While you probably don't want to reuse k cups as a regular practice, it does not hurt the machine, so if you like your coffee mild or want to cut down on costs, here is what you do.  Brew a cup of coffee using the k cup of your choice.  Then, go through the brewing process again: simply leave the used k cup in and lift and reclose the handle when the unit displayed 'Ready To Brew'.  This is best done with the small cup setting, otherwise your coffee will not be mild, but just plain weak.
