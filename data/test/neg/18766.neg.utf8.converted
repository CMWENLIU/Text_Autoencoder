Normally, I don't add reviews to Amazon, but after seeing the reviews for this cereal I just had to. My wife and I started dieting and eating healthy within the last year and have changed most of the foods that we eat. Our diets differ in the sense that I watch my caloric intake and my wife is on a low carb diet. I picked this cereal up for her at our local grocery store a few months ago and decided to try it myself because it does have really nice nutritional value listed on the box. However (and this is the main reason for my review), it tastes totally horrible!! I noticed that there was not only a few people on here stating it tasted great and wonderful and they saw flowers blooming, the sun come up and so forth when they ate some. The only conclusion as a clear thinking adult is that these people are used to eating saw dust or whatever comes out of their paper shredder normally. To sum it up, if you want to eat this cereal because of its nutritional value then go for it. That's a great and noble reason and I'm with ya, but PLEASE do not tell other unsuspecting people considering whether or not to purchase this product that it tastes good.
