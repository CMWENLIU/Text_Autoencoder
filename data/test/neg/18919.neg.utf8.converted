My dog, a German Shepherd, didn't think much of these. Her favorite treat, chicken jerky dog treats from a store that starts with "C" and ends with "ostco", she scarfs up very quickly and with real excitement & enjoyment. These Blue Dog treats she sniffs and won't take.<br /><br />They do LOOK tasty to me though, to the point where I want to take a bite. Maybe I would like them more than my dog does.
