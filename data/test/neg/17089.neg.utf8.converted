Let me add my outraged voice to the others.  These 'moresells' were re-formulated by Nestle's accountants and they basically went down the list of ingredients and replaced them by something cheaper that would serve the same chemical purpose.<br /><br />Gone is cocoa and chocolate and vanilla and what we have instead is a concoction of unsavory stuff:<br /><br />Sugar<br />Partially Hydrogenated Palm Kernel & Palm oils<br />Milk & Nonfat Milk (less than 1 gram... ie. a few molecules)<br />Soy Lecithin<br />Artificial flavor<br /><br />So per serving that's 9 grams of sugar and 3 grams of Unsaturated-Hydrogenated Trans-Fat (the worst kind), 1 gram of saturated Fat, with a paper-clip sized dose of milk.<br /><br />I can't imagine feeding such junk to my children, any more than I would give it to my husband who'd I'd like to live another 20 years.  Not only are these morsels unhealthy, they don't taste good and are cloying and waxy on the tongue.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger/cookie maker
