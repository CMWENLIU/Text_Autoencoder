I love Oreos and I love chocolate so I took a chance on the chocolate creme Oreos.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed with how they tasted - the chocolate flavor was just strong enough to throw off the taste of the cookie, if you can understand that.  I would personally stick with the standard Oreo double stuff cookies - the creme does not compete as much for a place in the taste and it is a nicer compliment to the overall flavors.<br /><br />I won't be getting this variety again, but I definitely will still get Oreos!
