If you are looking for a refreshing non-kosher soda pop, look elsewhere. Jones soda only comes in kosher, which means that the consumer is paying slightly extra to cover the rabbinical fees involved in the certification procedure.<br /><br />Most consumers do not want kosher certified products, and do not even realize when they are purchasing kosher certified products.<br />Jones soda should sell a non-kosher version of this product, for a reduced fee, for people who are not Jewish.<br /><br />I emailed Jones soda asking if it's possible to place a special order for a case of non-kosher Jones soda.<br />They replied with a smart-alec one word answer, "No".<br />This was a smart-alec response to my email because I asked one or two other questions in the email which were not "yes" or "no" questions.<br />For example, I also asked how much Jones soda spends per year for the kosher certification, and how much of this fee is passed on to the consumer.<br /><br />In other words, based on my experience, I'd say that if you email Jones soda with questions about the kosher certification issue, expect a smart-alec response.
