I have been a fan of Anna's cookies for years and the ginger have long been my favorites, so when I saw this price I jumped.  Too fast.  The shipment arrived in about 10 days (awfully slow for such a huge company, IMO) - cookies appeared to be well-packed in their own little case.  However we opened them to find that each and every box, of twelve, contained cookie crumbles.  Not one single cookie in shipment arrived unscathed; OK, I guess, to crumble on ice cream, etc. - but definitely not what we'd wanted.  Returning all 12 today; we'll see how Amazon handles that.
