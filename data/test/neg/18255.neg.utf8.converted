Why post a picture of items you are not selling?  I get very frustrated with sellers who use a stock photo of general items instead of the actual items they are selling.  It isn't difficult to take a picture of the actual item - or search for a stock photo of the actual item you are selling.<br /><br />What is even *more* frustrating is that they don't bother to list the flavors you are buying since the photo is not accurate.<br /><br />The picture shows six different flavors of Activate.  I actually thought I was receiving all six since Activate has many more than six flavors.  I thought THAT is what "variety" meant.  I received three bottles each of four different flavors.  Are they relying on their legal disclaimer to diffuse their laziness?  "Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented..."  Even so, that does not say the PRODUCT is different than the picture.<br /><br />I bought this product because I saw the Exotic Berry flavor at Wal-mart.  Tried it, and thought it was pretty good.  But I don't live near a Wal-mart and have not seen it elsewhere.<br /><br />I rate Amazon's employee who posted this item with one star since I don't see another way to rate the seller right now.  If I easily find a way of rating the seller, I will change my star-rating here.<br /><br />The Exotic Berry flavor is fine.  It is the only flavor I have had.  The other flavors shipped in the box are Lemon-Lime, Orange, and Fruit Punch.  Had I known that Blueberry and Pear were not included, I would have purchased a different package from Amazon - one where the employee bothered to find the right stock photo of the item being sold.
