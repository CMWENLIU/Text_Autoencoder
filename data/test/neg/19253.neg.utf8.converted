So I had just finished my third 1KG box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X65FC">China Green Tea Special Gunpowder 1 Kilo (1000grams or 35.27 Oz) Guaranteed Authenticity</a> in the last year and decided to see if this Davidson's was any better.  To my dismay, it's not, but it sure costs a lot more!  After four brews with the Davidson's, I'm very dissatisfied.<br /><br />First off, the color of the gunpowder pellets are no different between samples, but the Davidson's uses bigger pellets, meaning bigger, older fan leaves.  The Temple of Heaven (ToH) gunpowder green uses smaller leaves, so when you brew there appear to be many more leaves because there are.  The Davidson's often has several leaves and their attached stem rolled up into a single pellet.  The Davidson's also has significantly more dirt, dust, and loose stems in the package.  In fact, it looks like I got the bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />****  Your Quality Control Is Terrible, Davidson!  ****<br /><br />The idea that it is organic should have some impact on the flavor, but the Davidson's is more bitter, and the tea is orange/yellow after 3 minutes of brewing in RO filtered water heated to 170-180F in a French press.  The ToH tea is a greenish yellow, and has a better flavor with less bitterness.<br /><br />Overall, I am very unhappy with my Davidson's purchase.  The ToH gunpowder green is better quality for less than half the price!!!<br /><br />When compared to the other gunpowder green tea options available, Davidson's Gunpowder Green Tea is a 2 star gunpowder green tea for flavor that loses a star for poor pricing and very poor quality control.
