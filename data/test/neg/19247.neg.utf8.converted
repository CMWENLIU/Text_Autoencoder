It's okay.<br />It's doesn't suck.<br />It's the worst gunpowder green I've had.<br /><br />I drink a lot of tea.<br />I like green tea even if it's bitter or grassy.<br />I have a mustache.<br /><br />It doesn't expand the way gunpowder is supposed to BLAM!<br />It's not wrapped properly.<br />I'm not talking about the packaging.<br /><br />The packaging is GREAT!<br />The price is okay....probably too high for the quality.<br />They ship it lightning quick.<br /><br />THE TEA:<br />flavors: bitter, acidic, slightly fruity, very smokey (like the hibiscus of green teas), not pleasant aftertaste.<br />mouthfeel: oily, thick, dark<br />look: bright green - almost radioactive green with a heavy brew, light green and kind of smokey with a light brew.<br /><br />I've had very good gunpowder before. This is not very good.<br />If you're a tea pounder (guzzleguzzle), get it.<br />Otherwise, stay away.
