These flax seeds were not of good quality. They were small in size, lighter in color and when you grind them up the result is a dry husk affair. I'm very disappointed and I have four bags of them!<br /><br />I've ordered these before and they were a good quality but apparently Red Mill's quality control is deficient to let these pass through.
