Quality of the peanuts are okay (on a quality rating scale of okay, good and fine) but the size of the peanuts are the smallest I have found in my local grocery chains.  I only buy this brand when I am desperate...so if you are desperate, buy away or if you are a fan of small, okay peanuts then look no more, you have found your peanut utopia.<br /><br />Otherwise, keep on looking....
