These lollipops were not at all like the ones I saw in the pictures. They were really small, the color was not as bright, and the edges were not ruffled, they were plain circles. I felt deceived. Also, I received most of them broken because the bad packing. I would not recommend this product to anyone. They are too expensive for what you get. Amazon should make the sellers show a real picture of the product.
