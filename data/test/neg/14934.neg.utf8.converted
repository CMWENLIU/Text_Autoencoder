I don't think I have a particularly sensitive palate, but this was truly undrinkable.  I couldn't detect any flavors of pumpkin, cinnamon, or nutmeg.  Instead, it had a strong plastic and metallic taste, with a clove overlay.  I like some of their other Sugar Free syrups, but the Pumpkin Pie one was noxious.  Try to taste a sample before you order a huge bottle.
