I have been trying to find a good brand of jerky that I don't have to order online.  I finally tried Jack Link's original.  Way too sweet, doesn't taste like meat, and most of the pieces don't have the texture of meat.  At times, I thought I was eating plastic.  Or some soy meat-substitute.  I couldn't even make it through the whole bag.  I miss the original Pemmican..., before ConAgra sold the brand and it got ruined...
