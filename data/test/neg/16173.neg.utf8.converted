These dried mushrooms are called "funghi porcini" on the label, implying that they are of Italian origin. Nowhere in the product description is the country of origin listed, as it is with more scrupulous retailers. I took the chance and bought these based on the name, discovering later that these mushrooms are a product of China. Actually "China/Yugoslavia", which is even worse as it suggests not only questionable harvesting practices but that the mushrooms have been sitting around since the early 1990s.
