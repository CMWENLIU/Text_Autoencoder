7 of my 12 cats began vomiting while on this food.  None of these cats have sensitive stomachs.  They have never vomited on any other food.  I took them off of the food and the vomiting stopped. Thinking that maybe, just maybe, it was something else making them sick, I put them back on the food, gradually.  The vomiting resumed.  I cannot recommend this food.
