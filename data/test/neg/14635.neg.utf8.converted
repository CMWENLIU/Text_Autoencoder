A bisque is defined as "a thick cream soup made from shellfish."  While this soup understandably lacks the shellfish (it's salmon after all), it also inexplicably lacks cream!  It's got milk and vegetable oil (which predominates) instead, and it is not a concentrate!  What a disappointment in taste, especially as we are fans of Bar Harbor's delicious chowders (salmon and clam... haven't tried the lobster).  Pass on this if you know what a bisque should taste like.
