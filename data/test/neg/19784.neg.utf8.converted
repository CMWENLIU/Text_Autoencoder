I love all natural or organic products that are good for you.  This Mrs. Mays Trio Blueberry product seemed to be such a product.  The taste is good.  I like the combination of berries, seeds, and nuts.  But when I received the product, the image shown on the webpage description is not the same as the product I received.<br /><br />The actual product is VERY small -- only 1.2 ounces.  About twice the size of a 5-stick pack of gum.  Certainly NOT worth about a dollar each!  In fact, it is not worth even 50 cents each, in my opinion.  The image on the website shows a 1.7 ounce bar.  What I received was 1.2 ounce bars.  That's about 30 PERCENT smaller than the advertised product.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was not happy at all.  I was deceived.  I do not believe a 1.2 ounce bar of nuts is worth close to $1 in cost.  Although I like the taste and nutrition, I would not consider purchasing this item again unless the cost falls to around $5 for a 12-pack or $10 for a 24 pack. That's about the most I can justify paying for what you get.  Right now, the price at amazon.com is $23.57 for a 24 pack -- or about $1 per small 1.2 ounce bar.  Outrageous.
