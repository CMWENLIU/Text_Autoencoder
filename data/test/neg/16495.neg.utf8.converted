if the 5star rating is as a bell curve, and 3 = average; then these are a 2, just below average. in grading systems around a c minus.<br /><br />they are not bad, but then they are not good either. hormel is not a mexcan food company and must consider the masses they sell to. this product is geared for the masses, bland on the mexican taste side of cuisine.<br /><br />the tomales are individually wrapped to prevent sticking to one another; hence not too hard to figure out the corn tamale is on the mushy side of the chart. the innards...well, as the old commercial went...'where's the beef?' this product is nearly all about the corn meal tamale and not about the minuscule insides.<br /><br />we bought just to check them out. we will eat them, but will not order any further.
