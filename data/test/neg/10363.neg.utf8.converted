I loved the Goya Maria crackers which I bought initially in a supermarket in Florida.  Since this product was seldom on the shelves in my hometown supermarkets,I decided to buy direct from Goya and ordered a carton of 24 packages. Each one I opened was overbaked and brittle. I eventually threw them all out because there was no way to reach the factory. I did buy a package recently when it was available in the supermarket. I feel somehow that the factory was happy to unload some unacceptable batches on an unwary customer.
