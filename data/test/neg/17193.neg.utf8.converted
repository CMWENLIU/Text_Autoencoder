I was expecting a milkier, richer taste but this tastes just like plain whipped butter or even just plain butter, but less salty. When the bottle arrived, the cream contents looked strange because the cream had a marbling color of neon yellow and white; not a uniform white, milk color shown in the picture advertised.  The cream settled to the bottom of the jar and also looked lumpy. I might have received a bad jar, or the contents might have chemically altered due to heat in transit, I don't know, but the cream was not at all what I expected.  It did not taste like the clotted cream I ate when I was in England and did not have a smooth texture.
