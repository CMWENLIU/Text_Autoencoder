If you have read any of my other product reviews you may think I only write negatively about the things I purchase at Amazon. With hundreds of purchases and limited time I figure the good products don't need my help but the mediocre or poor products waste unsuspecting folks hard earned money. That bothers me so I rate this brand of dog cookies only 2 stars.  I have purchase most of the major dog cookie brands as I am pretty particular about what I feed my dogs. This cookie is over priced for what is in it and how small they are. There is no steak or meat used for flavoring only beef broth and grains, which is fine but the price for a small bag compared to other brands that use ground meats for flavoring is out of line. The ingredient list was missing online so I took the chance they might live up to the Steak Frites name and price. They smell good and do have wholesome grains and no fillers but so do many other brands that give you more for your dollar. The cookies are quite hard and I would not recommend them for senior dogs who have dental problems or missing teeth.
