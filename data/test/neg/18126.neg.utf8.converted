In general, it aggravates me when people leave packaging and performance feedback as product feedback, so apologies, but this is a SAFETY issue. This is canned food! I have ordered this several times from Amazon, and EVERY time cans have arrived dented. If Amazon doesn't get how unsafe this is and start packaging appropriately, it should get out of the food business. I will not order again. I do highly recommend the product, which is the best tasting tuna ever and is produced by a US company in a sustainable way.
