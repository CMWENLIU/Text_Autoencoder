Why buy this product?  You can get a variety of ground red pepper (and turmeric, cumin and everything else) in bulk elsewhere for significantly less.  For example, I buy red pepper, turmeric, marsala, coriander, etc in bulk at an Indian market for next to nothing (when compared with the product above).  A 7oz bag of red pepper is $1.99, which is a typical price for bulk spices in that volume.
