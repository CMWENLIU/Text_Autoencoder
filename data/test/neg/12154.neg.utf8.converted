I purchased this as an alternative to the popular Japanese furikake because the Asian version incorporates sugar in all of their varieties, which I don't like. However, my glee at finding a sugarless version was soon cut short once I was able to inspect the contents in person. The ingredient list boasts of sesame seeds, seaweed, and pickled shiso leaves, but the last two ingredients are so disproportionate as to negate the necessity of even listing them except to highlight possible allergens.<br /><br />Seasame seeds, sesame seeds...both black and traditional versions...with a flake here or two that might be seaweed. Not that my tastebuds could tell. You're honestly just better off buying a bottle of sesame seeds and tossing in a sprinkle of salt.<br /><br />While not a direct commentary on the company itself (I really like their umeboshi), I think it's sad that they felt the need to Westernize this delightful condiment by eliminating or reducing the tastiest parts.
