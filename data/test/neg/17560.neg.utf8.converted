I couldn't send this product back because I had to open it to take a look at the product.  On first glance, I wasn't impressed at all.  Perhaps I was expecting to be wow-ed and was disappointed instead.  The candy was damaged.  I am hoping no one else played around with this candy before I received it.  The box it came in was cute with its little bow.  I'm afraid to eat the candy because it looks like its been handled.  It's not worth the money.
