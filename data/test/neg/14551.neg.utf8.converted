This was one of my most disappointing deals ever on Amazon. I won't go into my experience with the seller. I tried the yeast to make a Russian drink called Kvass. The yeast acted like it was dead. There was a sick, yeasty, moldy taste to the result. All the equipment was sanitized, but this didn't make any difference. Never Again.
