I have sensitive skin and have a tendency to breakout easily when using most body washes. Personally I've always loved Dove's products, especially the ones for sensitive skin... and I'm going to keep using those and toss this.<br /><br />Dove's Men + Care does an awesome job lathering up and cleaning. The smell isn't the least bit offensive and it washes off cleanly. It doesn't leave your skin feeling itchy or dry, which is very nice, and does leave your skin feeling soft<br /><br />However after using it I started to breakout. I looked at the ingredients and saw a whole heck of a lot of things I've never seen in my previous body washes and soaps. Out of all of the stuff in it, I'm not sure what particular ingredient it is, but there is something in it that I am sensitive to and had to quit using it.<br /><br />So other then being allergic to the body wash, it does a great job cleaning and the smell is quite pleasant. If it didn't break me out, I'd continue using it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cleans well.<br />Lathers up great.<br />Smells good.<br />Well priced.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Broke me out after a few uses.<br />Has about three times the ingredients as my normal body wash that doesn't break me out
