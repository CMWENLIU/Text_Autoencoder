I thought this was a fair price for these mushrooms, but was quite disappointed.  I soaked the mushrooms, as advised and then added them to a soup.<br /><br />The next trial was in a risotto.<br />The mushrooms lack flavor in general.  The stems of these mushrooms are quite inedible; they are very tough and have to be trimmed after soaking.  I would not recommend them and wouldn't repurchase.
