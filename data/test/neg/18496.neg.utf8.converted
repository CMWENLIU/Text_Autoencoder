My wife and I each eat one ounce of walnuts daily and have for years.  We love them and appreciate their health benefits.  And for years, we've been buying Diamond brand walnuts from Sam's Club (currently about $12 for a 2 lb package, which use to be about $17.50 for a 3 lb package).  We thought that surely there were better walnuts available, so we ordered the Good Sense Organic Walnuts from Amazon.  Diamond brand has a lot of broken, shriveled and black colored walnuts.  The Good Sense Organic Walnuts are WORSE!  I would rate the Diamond walnuts 3 stars, just good, not great.  The Good Sense Organic Walnuts that we received are barely edible (small broken pieces, shriveled pieces, and dark colored pieces) which is why they've earned two stars.  By reading the reviews, we must be the only unlucky people that have ordered these walnuts.  My advice:  If you want big fresh delicious walnut halves, avoid these!  (Neither of us work for or are associated with Sam's Club or the Diamond nut company)
