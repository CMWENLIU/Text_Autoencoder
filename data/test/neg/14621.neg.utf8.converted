I purchased two types of stevia to try to move from using artificial sweetener to stevia. I read recommendations for this product so I decided we would try it. This really has a strong aftertaste of alcohol and chemicals. (I was disappointed because we had two bottles of the stuff. My bad.) I threw it out because no one would eat the food that it touched.<br /><br />FYI - I prefer the Stevita Stevia Supreme because there is no aftertaste with it.  I wish it was in liquid form too because that would be helpful.
