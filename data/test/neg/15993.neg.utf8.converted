The Orange Cranberry bars taste very similar to Fig Newtons; however, they are a tad bit chalky. I really liked the soft texture and the cocoa flavoring, but I couldn't taste any of the cranberry orange. I like the size and shape of the bar. It's not too big or small. In terms of nutritional value, I compared it to my preferred Luna bar. The Eat Think Smile bar is 51g and the Luna bar is 48g, so they are almost the same size. The calorie count is comparable (Luna 180 vs. Eat Think Smile 200) and fat content (Luna 5g vs. Eat Think Smile 6g), which is good. Where it falls short is in vitamins. My Luna bar has 20% vitamin A, 20% C, 30% iron, and 30% Vitamin E. The Eat Think Smart Bar has 0% vitamin A, 6% vitamin C , 6% iron, and no vitamin E. I am sticking with Luna.
