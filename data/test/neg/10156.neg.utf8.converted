I have been feeding my Grandson this formula for a few months.He enjoyed the taste and I thought it was the best formula out there. Now I heard on the national news that it has dangerous levels of arsenic in the brown rice syrup.What next!So after searching for another good formula,I came to the conclusion that there isn't any.I finally came across a site by Jenn Savedge that had a homemade baby formula recipe.I'll give it a try, looks good to me.Sad that there isn't better formula's that don't have corn and soy or brown rice.
