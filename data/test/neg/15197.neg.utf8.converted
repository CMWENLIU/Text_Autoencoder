After receiving the package I was hoping my three cats would eat it and get healthier. Well none of them would even look at it. Not even hungry stray cats that live outside of my house would even touch it. For the fairness of all consumers that are interested in this product. I will write out the whole sentence that appears on the back of the package and what has been crossed out. "Look for Ziwipeak  'Cuisine' in convenient pouches and easy-tab cans and Ziwipeak treats and supplements at leading natural pet stocklists. The Ziwkpeak 'Cuisine' range is produced in NZMAF-licensed 'PET FOOD' factory &lt;cross out begins> using ingredients derived from animals that have been passed as fit for human consumption in their raw state. &lt;Cross out ends>" I do not care whatever excuse Ziwipeak may present but this non-human grade food is not what I am willing to spend extra money for health of my cats. I have wasted money and I have no way of returning it.
