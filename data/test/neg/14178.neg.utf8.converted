My dog loves Dogswell sweet potato chews, which I recently learned are made in China.  I had hoped that these Sam's Yams would make a good substitute. However, these are much tougher, really like rawhide, and my cockapoo has no interest in the product.  I'm not even sure she realizes that it is something to eat.  Maybe it would appeal to a larger dog that enjoys chewing.
