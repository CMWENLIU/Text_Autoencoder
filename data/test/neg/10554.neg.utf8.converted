Revolution makes a green Earl Grey tea but this item is mislabelled.<br /><br />This is a fine Green Tea but it is not Earl Grey.<br /><br />I ordered 6 so now I am stuck with something I did not want.<br /><br />This is the second time this has happened to me with Amazon.<br /><br />Another time I ordered what was described as "12 Packs of Coffee Filters<br /><br />with 40 each." I received one and Amazon told me it was a misprint.<br /><br />No compensation was offered.<br /><br />Amazon needs a proof reader or needs to stand behind the descriptions<br /><br />of items they sell.
