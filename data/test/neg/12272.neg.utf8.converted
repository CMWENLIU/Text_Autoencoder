The texture of this cake was very moist but that was about the only thing we liked about it. I made it exactly as instructed on the box. My husband and I both thought that it had an "off" taste to it, however, the odd flavor was hardly noticeable while the cake was still warm. I would liken the flavor to something that was artificially flavored.  The next day it was very evident. I didn't frost it so there was no icing to hide nor change the flavor.  The first thing I noticed was how heavy (almost bitter) the chocolate flavor was. I LOVE chocolate and am not usually opposed to very rich chocolate but this wasn't rich in a good way. It made me wonder if the overwhelming chocolate flavor wasn't meant to mask the odd taste, if so it doesn't work.  Though we didn't like the pamela's cake mix we LOVE the Pamela's Chocolate Frosting (see my review on it).
