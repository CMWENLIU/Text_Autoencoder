I ordered roses from Amazon earlier this month for a birthday on the 22 of January 2011.  I opted for a delivery date of 21  January 2011. The shipment arrive via UPS on the date requested. The delivery, from Pro Flowers, began on the morning of the 20th. and arrived at my residence at approximately 3:31 P.M. on 21 January 2011. The temperatures on the beginning date and ending date were at or below zero. Needless to say I was not happy with the condition of the roses as they arrived at my residence. I would certaninly call into question the time line associated with the delivery of such perishable items. In the future I will rely on a local florist for such transactions.
