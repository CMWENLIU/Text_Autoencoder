I thought it was just a fluke, but I tested it several times.<br /><br />This stuff COMPLETELY annihilates my stomach.<br /><br />Everyone's body is different, so I can only speak from my own experience.<br /><br />I kept forcing myself to take it because it has a ton of vitamin C in it, but the stomach pains were so bad I had to stop.<br /><br />Only other thing I can say is that i was using a half a teaspoon or less towards the end and it still hurt my stomach.<br /><br />I cant recommend or not recommend this product because I don't know if it will hurt your stomach. And if it doesn't, then rock on!!! That is a lot of vitamin C!!!<br /><br />As for the taste...as long as you mix it with something sweet you wont notice much difference in flavoring.
