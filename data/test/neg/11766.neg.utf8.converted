I tried to give this this 0 stars but I had to give it at least one.  This stuff is so nasty.  It tastes nothing like peanut butter but a bit like soy sauce.  Three of us tried it numerous ways, on toast and crackers, with jam, etc, and couldn't get over how awful it was.  Anyone who says something good about this product probably works for the company.  I'll take a jog and eat real peanut butter before I save a few calories or fat grams and eat this stuff.
