Jim Herr, Founder, says (see above): "All natural. [...] delicious taste of nature's finest potatoes, cooked in small batches in pure vegetable oil and sprinkled with just the right amount of salt. Specially formulated for extra crispness, they are thicker and keep their crunch longer - perfect for dipping or snacking. We think you'll agree these are the tastiest, most wholesome, potato chips you'll ever munch."<br /><br />Not sure why he thought we'd agree (unfortunately the great humanitarian recently kicked the bucket, so we'll never find out), but whatever the case may have been, look at the "pure vegetable oil" part. Know what it ACTUALLY is? "Soybeen or cottonseed or both" etc. -- wonder why the founder didn't specify this exact detail when offering his BS about "pure vegetable oil".<br /><br />Nothing pure about vegetable oil: it is usually highly processed oils with bad fat profiles. Now, the best thing here is that cotton isn't even a food crop, so when you consume cottonseed oil you fill up on who knows what kind of fertiliser and what not. This great Christian businessman sure knew how to get rich selling poisonous crap to the masses.<br /><br />PS. Even when it's not cottonseed oil, "vegetable oil" is something to avoid, as it's something cheap, chemically processed. How chemically? Well, like cut up beans are drenched in hexane that leaches out oil. Hexane is a neurotoxin. FDA requires neither to disclose nor even test for the presence of hexane in foods. Bon appetit, suckers.
