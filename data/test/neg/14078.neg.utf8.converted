I didn't realize when I bought these that they were made in China.  In fact, I fed them to my dogs until someone looking at the package pointed it out to me.  I'm a little leery of buying dogs treats from China and other developing countries since the melamime incident.  Who knows what oversight there is on the production.  So, now I order *only* Snook's sweet potatoe dog chews from Healthy Happy Pet (through Amazon).  These are organic dried sweet potato chunks made in the US and my dogs **love them**.  I also get Sam's Yams but the Snook's are nice and crunchy.  I got a small bag for my sister's Shih Tzus and they loved them as well.  If Dogswell would find a place in the US to make their products, I'd be willing to buy.  But as long as they are made in China-- won't do it anymore.
