This was a staple to my lower carb diet, loved it with walnuts and a sprinkle of Truvia floating in almond milk. Yum! Now, it is OFF my shopping list. I did find an alternative at a local health food store and it's very good, comes in 4 flavors http://www.amazon.com/Nutritious-Living-Vanilla-Almond-Cereal/dp/B0081SMO7K/ref=sr_1_11?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1344600644&sr=1-11&keywords=low+carb
