The picture shows: cheese straws, a jar, fake grapes and fake leaves. None of these were included in the package. There were no instructions on how to prepare the pasta neither here nor on the manufacturer's website. The quality of the products was very poor. It's not worth $62.18 at all (the items probably cost $15.00 at your local grocery store). I'll be asking for a refund and let you know if I get one.<br /><br />Update: I did get a refund. That's why Amazon is great!
