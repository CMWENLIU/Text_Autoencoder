Intellectually, I totally support this hemp mix.<br /><br />Unfortunately my mouth is in total disagreement.<br /><br />Great ingredients, but man is this stuff tough to choke down.  To be fair, I feel like I was spoiled by some of the all-natural whey protein isolates out there in terms of taste, protein content, quick absorption rate, and ease of mixing... but as I started dabbling in vegetarian diets periodically I sought out alternatives to animal products (especially dairy) just to see how my body would react.<br /><br />I heard a lot of good reasons why I should give hemp a try (most notably the complete BCAA profile), but I just can't convince myself to buy this again.<br /><br />The name of the 'flavor' is almost meaningless to me, as it tasted and smelled like sandy fish-food.  I had trouble getting it to mix well by hand or with a batter-powered drink mixer, but even in a blender (where I added some berries/bananas sometimes to mask the hemp mix), it still had a rough sandy texture and awful taste.  To make matters worse, comparing the protein content of whey or even pea protein to this hemp doesn't help.... it's just not as concentrated.  And that fact combined with the small canister size and awful taste/texture kind of killed this for me.<br /><br />I feel bad bashing this stuff because my only reason for not liking it is just personal preference (though that's the same reason I don't eat dog food either).<br /><br />The ingredients themselves seem to be cared-for and thoughtfully combined, but I just can't recommend it unless you're someone that has been using other hemp/soy products in the past and have become acclimated to them.<br /><br />My advice for any omnivores like myself who are vegan-curious is to start with a high quality pea protein (Olympia Labs has a nice one), and go from there.
