When I ordered this product, I had no idea that it was being shipped from England! But I got it quickly. The tea itself was disappointing. They call it "The Strong One," but I couldn't tell the difference between it and regular PG Tips. I used the Special Blend for years, but they stopped making it, so I tried this one. It costs a lot more, and I have to use two bags at once to get the strength I like. PG Tips, why did you do this to me?
