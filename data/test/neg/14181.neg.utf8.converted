Well I thought this looked like the perfect treat for my huge dog and his even larger Great Dane friend.  They need big treats you know! Neither one of them would touch it (and I gave them a couple weeks) and when I tried to give them to other dogs, they turned their nose up too.  Just didn't work for us or our wide bunch of doggy friends.
