It's too expensive!  I bought this Caf&eacute; French Vanilla, Sugar Free, Decaf (4-Ounce) on August 17 by Amazon and I paid $18.97 dollars for 6 packages. What happened? This item it's not available in stores anymore and this unique option it's too expensive. I love this coffee but I will never pay $49.95!
