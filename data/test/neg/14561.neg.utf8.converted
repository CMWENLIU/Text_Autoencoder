I first bought this product several months ago when searching for a "natural" gum without artificial ingredients.  I just received a new shipment of the gum in February 2012, and they've changed the name of the product from Richochet to Xyla - but the name is not all that has changed.  The ingredients are completely different, and it now contains titanium dioxide and artificial flavors.  I am really disappointed that the company chose to change the formulation - why mess with a good thing!!  The Amazon website doesn't reflect the new ingredient listing - it is still showing the old one.<br /><br />I will be returning the new recipe!
