One of the four flour bags broke in the box and spilled EVERYWHERE.  The mail guy had a trail of flour follow him in.  There was nothing inside to guard against broken flour bags from sprinkling white powder all over my apartment lobby, the elevator, and my kitchen table.  The entire bag was lost.<br /><br />Maybe it's not so bad.  I'm sure the USPS has no need to worry about packages leaking mysterious white powder.
