The Sour Patch Kids I bought recently are larger, softer and taste differently than the ones I ordered in the past.  They are not sour, and the bags are missing the loose sour powder.  They taste like a cheap knock-off of the Sour Patch Kids that you buy in the smaller bags in the grocery store.  I'm not sure if I will buy them again, but I can't recommend them.
