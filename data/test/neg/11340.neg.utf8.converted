I just bought 24 packs of ONE Coconut water (11.2 oz)because of a great buy @ $1.10/ea.  However, I must say they ALL had a sour after taste. I was really surprised. I've tasted most, if not all, of the major brands and this was the worst. They were probably sitting in a hot sweaty warehouse and management needed to move the product, thus the great sale price!<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars for the great buy and the fact I didn't get sick.  After reading the freshness dates of the 2 cases, I noticed it was set to expire in 2 months from the day I recieved it. I'm gonna chaulk this up as an old batch. I will taste this brand again with at least 6 months left on the expire date and see if it makes a difference. I will update my review then.
