i usually buy these at my local ocean state job lot for a dollar a pack,or 6 bucks a case but they were all out so i thought i would buy them here! what a ripoff at 6 bucks a pack, and they are stale too! ocean states cookies tastes like fresh baked, these taste like they were in the tardis for 2 regenerations! i'm not very happy!
