I was one of those people who was looking into all things raw. Imagine my delight when I found out that you could eat chocolate like a supplement by eating raw cacao nibs! Well, like all new things, it's best to wait to purchase until you have all the facts.<br /><br />Raw cacao is high in oxalic acid which inhibits absorption of calcium. As well, raw cacao contains theobromind,<br />theophylline and caffeine which all mess with your central nervous system, gastrointestinal system, cardiovascular<br />and endocrine system.<br /><br />When I ate these, I got the jitters and headaches. I thought that I would suffer through the jitters, the dirt taste and the sudden addiction to chocolate in the name of "health." It wasn't until Kevin Gianni of Renegade Health did a piece about how he no longer was going to recommend cacao because of health issues he was getting after he praised it, that I started looking into if I should consume any more cacao. I got sick of being jittery so I quit and haven't looked back.
