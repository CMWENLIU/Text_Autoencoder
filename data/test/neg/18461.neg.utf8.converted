To be honest, I have never written a review, not matter how good or bad a product I received was. I never had the time and never bothered. Today, I write my very first review of a product that I have been feeding my precious son since birth. He is now 2 years 4 months. I could never breastfeed him exclusively due to bone density loss and I did massive amounts of research and tried out tons of different brands before deciding on this organic formula from Earth's Best and since then, even though he is now a toddler, I still use the Earth's Best infant formula and supplement with other child vitamins.<br /><br />I was trying to re-order again in bulk from Amazon when I noticed for the first time the controversy over DHA/ARA extraction by the use of toxic hexane of which Hain Celestial which manufactures Earth's Best is guilty of. To understand my utter complete fury, you must know that I live in Singapore and I quite literally pay international shipping for every can of this formula (and wade through customs declarations, tests and tax levies) to bring this milk to my son. In Singapore, this can of milk is also available but in highly limited quantities and even more princely prices (yes, even after the tax, customs and shipping, it still costs less than US$68 which is the going price per can here). Calls to Hain Celestial customer service drove me further up the wall when first, a lady said the hexane was only in trace amounts and less than what the FDA approved. Then, reaching another lady an hour later, the story was different. She said that the hexane solvent method was the only method approved by the FDA to extract the DHA/ARA from non-toxic algae and soil fungus. A third occasion and Hain's customer service informed me that there should be no hexane detected in the product but on further probing admitted that she was not aware if the formula had undergone independent third party tests.<br /><br />To me, this is crazy. The formula was marketed as a pure organic product and we pay premium prices (especially me!) for a premium product. To find that that they have taken such short cuts is completely unacceptable and the worst thing is that, it turns out that most of the other organic formula companies do this exact irresponsible thing and keep quiet about it. The only company that does not is Baby's Only - it uses a water based process to extract their DHA/ARA from eggs(compare this to Hain's claim that the hexane method is the only one approved by FDA and one wonders why Baby's Only hasn't been hauled up by the FDA yet). My son is going on that pronto once I can get a shipment to Singapore. Unfortunately, Baby's Only is not available in Singapore (not even at princely prices) and my son is going to have to continue ingesting his Earth's Best formula in the interim.
