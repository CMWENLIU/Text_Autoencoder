Please DO NOT waste your money. It looks like a bag of noodles, dried, but is actually a very small amount of gross, gelatinous noodles in a bag full of water. to cook it, you drain the pasta, rinse with cold water and put in a boiling bowl of hot water for one minute. I thought after they were "cooked" they'd be less disgusting, but, alas they were even more gooey and gross. Eat a big salad or some oatmeal to feel full. This was so freaking gross and now I have six bags of the yucky stuff in my cabinet. Too expensive for something that doesn't work and is gross as well. It did make me feel full, but only for about 30 minutes and then I had digestive issues for a week.
