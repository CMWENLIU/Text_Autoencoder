I have ordered this product many, many times and was always VERY pleased with it.  However, the last shipment, ordered in January 2010 was altogether unsatisfactory.  This shipment had little of the expected wonderful flavor and sweetness; I opened two of the six containers and both are different than all previous orders.  I do not not whether the formula has been changed or whether this is a failure in quality control.  I do know that I will not take a chance and order this item again.  I plan to report this issue to Amazon so that they are aware of my experience.
