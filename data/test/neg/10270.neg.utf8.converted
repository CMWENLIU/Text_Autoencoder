Requires 2 capsules to make a good cup of coffee over, 8 oz or more. If you follow the directions on your CBTL machine and use just 1 you will end up with watered down and weak coffee. Using 2 caps is just not economical and defeats the whole purpose of the design. K-Cups are better for coffee then these little cups that only hold 1/2 the coffee needed for the job. Making 10 or 12 oz coffee with this is really just hot water.
