I gave this product the highest rating when I first reviewed it.  Now I have found out that jasmine flowers are no longer one of the ingredients. Why the best ingredient would be removed is beyond my comprehension - oh, I just realized it probably has something to do with money (duh).<br /><br />I can't recommend this tea. Now I make my own jasmine tea (with flowers). I hope the company returns to their original recipe.
