Of the 12 cans shipped 11 of them had very, very serious dents in them. I'm not talking dings, I talking serious dents.  So dented that I truly thought of throwing them away.  My husband stopped me though because at $5 a can he felt that it was too wasteful.  In my local grocery store, items this dented are put into a reduced price bin, because they usually don't move otherwise.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C4HZ00">Cento San Marzano Certified Tomatoes, 28-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>
