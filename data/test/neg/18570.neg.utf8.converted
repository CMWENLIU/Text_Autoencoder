I tried this product recently because I was DESPERATE! The grocer was out of Taster's Choice and I really needed my COFFEE! I saw this Clasico stuff and thought that since Nescafe also makes Taster's Choice, maybe Clasico would taste good, too. It doesn't. It tastes like instant 'coffee'. Their Taster's Choice does not like taste like instant (see the reviews). On the space-time continuum of coffee taste, there's instant on the low end, brewed on the high end, and in between, there's Taster's Choice. Clasico is on the crowded low end of instant 'coffee' (oxymoron: instant coffee). Taster's Choice is almost in the brewed category and shouldn't even be called instant.<br /><br />I made a cup of Clasico. It tasted so bad, I immediately threw the whole jar in the trash. I bought it out of desperation, but that didn't mean I had to drink it. Some people genuinely like instant 'coffee' and that's ok. If you are an instant 'coffee' fan, listen to the other reviews and try this. But if you truly prefer brewed coffee, but want the convenience and savings of instant, try Nescafe's Taster's Choice.
