Ok, so I used to love Nutella until the formula was changed and I can now detect more oil than hazelnut.  Yuck.  Soooo, I searched and found Guido Gobino Gianduja Cream.  Holy Cow!  Very rich, with a deep hazelnut flavor with just enough sweetness.  It's the grown up, sophisticated version of Nutella.  Google this product and  don't be afraid of the price.  It's worth every penny!!!
