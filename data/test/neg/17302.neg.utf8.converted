This product tastes great!  But not without a price.  :-(  I reviewed the label and even though it advertises itself as "no butter", the popcorn still uses plenty of other oils.  Like palm oil which is an all-natural ingredient, but also one of nature's fattiest substances.  It's not as unhealthy as butter, but it's still pretty bad (especially if you're like me and eat 5 servings (the whole bag) in just one sitting).<br /><br />Alternatives:<br /><br />- Orville Redenbacher's "Light Natural" is a better alternative, offering a pleasant taste but with just half as many calories, half the fat, and approximately the same amount of sodium.<br /><br />- Bearito's No Salt/No Oil and Healthy Choice Popcorn are other alternatives, although I don't think they taste as good as Redenbacher's "Light Natural" brand.  (Bearito's and HC Popcorn are also much more expensive; almost twice the price.)<br /><br />I won't be buying anymore of Newman's brand, but I'll definitely be buying more of the alternatives listed above.  :-)
