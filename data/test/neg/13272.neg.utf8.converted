I brought home two bengal kittens (12 weeks old) and after a bunch of research, decided on this dry food by Wellness.  It offers high quality meat, excellent ingredients overall, low carbs, etc.  The problem is that neither of my kittens will touch the stuff.  This seems to be a common problem too, because in the latest "Bengals Illustrated", they gave Wellness a very low rating in terms of desirability to cats (i.e., how much they like it).  Too bad. Also, one must consider the recent recall of Wellness food (their canned food actually, but same company).  Can we trust them?
