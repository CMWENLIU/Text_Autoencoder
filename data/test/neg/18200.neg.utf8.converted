I have purchased hemp seeds many times, and count them as a large part of my diet. I typically purchase the Manitoba Harvest brand, but the price on the 5 pound bag with Subscribe & Save was unbeatable. The hemp seeds I received looked and smelled normal, but sent my GI tract into a nightmare. I thought it was a fluke, and had nothing to do with the hemp seeds, so I ate them again a few days later, when I was feeling better. Within 30 minutes of eating, I was vomiting profusely, with terrible stomach pain. I wonder perhaps if there was some ecoli (or similar) bacteria on the seeds. I tossed the rest of the $50 bag. I won't buy Nutiva brand again.
