The rolling mat is very cheaply put together, not impressed at all with it, wish I'd gone for a non-bundled mat, might have gotten a decent one.  The nori is vile-tasting; I normally love nori with my sushi, but no one in my family, including me, could stand the stuff; we all ended up cutting the nori off (peeling left a residue on the rice) and eating the maki with a fork instead.  A day in the fridge only strengthened the bad nori flavor. Awful stuff.
