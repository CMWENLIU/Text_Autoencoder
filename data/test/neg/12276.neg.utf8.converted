I have only been recently diagnosed gluten intolerant (about six months).  I have learned very quickly that opinion on taste is extremely subjective when it comes to gluten free items.  What one person raves about another person will discard rather than eat.<br /><br />I tried this because others have given it good reviews.  In my opinion and my daughter's it is too grainy and has too much bean flour in it.  The bean flavor is too strong.  I am using the left over product to mix in with other flours.  I much prefer Pamela's product.
