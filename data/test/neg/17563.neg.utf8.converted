I'm a huge fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTMLM">Ezekiel 4:9 cereal</a>, which is absolutely delicious (especially hot) as well as wholesome. Ezekiel 4:9 bread (which is sold frozen) is also pretty good. But their spaghetti? Not so much.<br /><br />First off, no matter how much you boil it, it has a rough texture that takes away the great aesthetic virtue of spaghetti: that delicate, wrap-around-your-fork silkiness. And then there's the taste. It's difficult to describe (one favorable reviewer compares it to a bran muffin); in any case, it's a distinctive flavor that, in my opinion, does not play well with pasta sauce. And if spaghetti won't go with sauce, then what's the point?
