I don't normally buy energy drinks (I never liked the taste, caffeine, or the way they settle on my stomach.) but I had the opportunity to sample this product and thought it was certainly worth giving it a try.  The Red Rain berry flavor is delicious.  Yet, 2 ounces is not more than a couple of swallows.  It did not leave any after-taste at all.  However, I'm sure most people wouldn't buy this product just because they think it tastes good.  The taste is secondary to the desired results of an energy boost.<br />I sampled one bottle and I can say that I did not feel any boost of energy at all.  On the bright side, I didn't get the jitters either like most caffeine/B vitamin energy drinks.<br />So, ultimately, as it is currently priced, I would be much better off buying a Coke and taking a B vitamin.  I'd save about ten dollars.
