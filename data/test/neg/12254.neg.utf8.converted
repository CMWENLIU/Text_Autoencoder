While the variety was interesting, the description was highly deceptive. The weight was listed as 5 pounds, but adding the weights from the candy included yielded only slightly more than half of that, at 2.8 pounds. There were, as claimed, more than 30 pieces (35), but only six were full-price/size chocolate bars. Much of the rest was cheap filler, not the full-sized pieces touted in the description. For example, there were several types of gum included, as well as small pieces of taffy, and many items weighed less than half an ounce (in one case, a tenth of an ounce). The actual value of the candy appeared to be $10 to $12, at most, and the presentation--thrown in a printed carton with a single sheet of crumpled paper--was certainly not worth the rest of the price. Many items looked shopworn due to this poor packing, and all brittle items (such as Necco wafers) arrived in fragments. Anyone receiving this as a gift would assume that the giver spent about $15 on it, not $40. I feel cheated.
