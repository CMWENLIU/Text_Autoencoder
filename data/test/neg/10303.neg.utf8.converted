If you are just looking for a tea, the flavor is nice, but each bag contains only 20mg of kavalactones, which makes this a very economically unsound source of kavalactones, the stress-relieving chemicals in kava. I have tried this using 4 bags, and the effect was negligible. You may have better luck with this product than I did, but just don't have high hopes of the effect being akin to that of traditionally prepared kava or quality kava extract like Gaia kava.
