This Lady brand duck sauce is the same you get in some Chinese resaurants but to me it's NOT sweet or flavorful at all.  I don't recommend this product especially for the high cost of shipping on something you cannot return.  I thought this would be something to compliment the excellent tasting hot mustard packets by Lady brand but this duck sauce is just liquid goo/cornstarch with no flavor.  2 thumbs down as I think I can find another brand somewhere.
