Not all New Mexico red chile is the same!  We real New Mexicans know that you'd want Hatch chile for the best enchiladas, Luna County chile for a pot of chile con frijoles, and real nutty, sweet Chimayo chile for the best Carne Adovada on earth.<br /><br />Who knows that this stuff is?  It's a passable generic but if it was the 'good stuff,' Corona Real would at least know that it's illegal to spell chile as 'chili' here in New Mexico.<br /><br />Sure, this stuff makes an OK recipe or molido sauce, but for a true cognoscenti, it doesn't cut it.
