I was looking for a French grapeseed oil.  That is what I wanted.  I was fooled by the name and the fact that the product description makes no mention of the country of origin.<br /><br />Now, Chile is a leading exporter of agricultural products, and I am not critical of their products.  I am critical of how this product is marketed.<br /><br />Taste: Three stars.  The can I received looked to be a retail reject (dented).  The flavor was neutral as expected.  The color was slightly greener than others I have purchased, which I disliked.
