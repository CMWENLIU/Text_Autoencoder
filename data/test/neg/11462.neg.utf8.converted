I bought this product after reading all the favorable reviews.  I loved that the product was organic, with no added sugar or preservatives.  But when it arrived, I found it to be too thinly sliced and too dehydrated -- not at all soft or chewy like the dried mango I usually get.  It also wasn't very flavorful.  Maybe it was just a bad batch, but I won't be ordering it again.
