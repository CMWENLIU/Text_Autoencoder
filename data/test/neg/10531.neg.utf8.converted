I made VitaMuffins in a muffin top pan with some oil spray which garnered eleven muffins following the per cup instructions.  The cooking time was reduced to about 16 or 17 minutes using this method in my stove.<br /><br />As these are a low calorie "diet" muffin I didn't have unrealistic expectations about flavor but still found them a bit bland straight out of the oven. It left me wondering what was with all the hype? I put the remaining muffins in the freezer and found that after trying another they were better tasting frozen with the addition of a little help from two teaspoons of Trader Joe's Organic Chocolate Moo syrup and low calorie whipped cream; much more flavorful, a treat...TJ's Choc flav syrup is delicious.<br /><br />But I had some some ..err... grumbling stomach issues in the hours after eating the muffins. I don't eat a whole lot of diet processed foods, especially the newer ones, so I didn't connect my symptoms to the innocuous seeming VitaMuffin the first time.  I didn't know anything about Erythritol, a sugar alcohol that can cause gastrointestinal upset for some people; but I have learned. And yes, I know, the ingredients are clearly listed on the product page here. Caveat emptor! to me. I can't rate VitaMuffins beyond "I don't like it" in any case.  I'm passing on my left-over muffins and mixes to my sister who doesn't have these sensitivities.  Even without my adverse reaction I wouldn't consider these something worth a repeat purchase.
