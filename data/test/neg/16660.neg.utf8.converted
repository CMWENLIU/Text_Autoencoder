I've ordered the same type of cookies from Jakeman and bought Dare Maple cookies and never did they arrive like these ones did.  When I opened the boxes every single cookie was broken!  I am so thankful I had the idea to look at them before taking them to my daughter's school.  I could not bring these cookies, they were too broken.  I would not recommend purchasing these online.  In addition, the cookie is very sweet compared to other similar cookies.
