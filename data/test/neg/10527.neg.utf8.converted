This supplier made it sound like there were 10 packages in a box for over $13.  It was for one box of Pretz Salad that I can buy in the store for $3.19 per package.  I thought I was getting a case for $13-not one box!  Don't be fooled!!! I am returning this purchase!  This is a delicious product when you pay the right price for it.
