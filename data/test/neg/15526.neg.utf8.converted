6 months ago, I subscribed for a monthly "Tart is Smart Tart Cherry Juice" product.  Originally the cost for a 32oz. bottle was $16.99.  One month later, the cost went up to $18.99 - and now it is $25.99.  The product is not worth a $9.00 increase per month.  Lower the cost and I might subscribe again.
