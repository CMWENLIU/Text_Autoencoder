Even though convenient, the "Hot Cocoa" really isn't exactly what is says.  It is more like drinking colored water.  It really was so bad, that my partner tore open the cups and placed the powder in milk.  It took 2 k-cups to make one 10 ounce cup of cocoa.  It was okay then, but it's much easier to get some good ole` fashioned Hershey's chocolate and make a cup that I would just crave.  Besides, living close to Hershey, where the air constantly smells like milk chocolate, supports my local economy!
