While these taste good, they are far too messy. I am consistently challenged by them in attempting to avoid both (1) getting crumbling granola all over my desk and floor and (2) having the chocolate melt all over my fingers. I have had granola bars my whole life and I am well aware of the crumbs they can generate--but these bars will send granola flying just by opening the wrapper and the chocolate on these bars melts instantly upon any bodily contact (like fingers). I bought these as a snack of convenience, which they most definitely are not.
