I have used this salt for years, but recently my local groceries have stopped stocking it.<br />On the one hand, it has a fantastic grain size for party mixes, popcorn, spice blends, and deserts. No iodine, and little anti-caking made is an easy choice for many recipes.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is not a specialty, gourmet salt. $11 for 8lb, is over TWICE the 2.11 per box I was paying at Safeway. Add shipping, and I'm sure there is a better choice.<br />Just grab any pure salt ( not Sea Salt please, unless it time traveled back from 50,000 B.C. ) and grind it by hand until it is very fine. Volia!
