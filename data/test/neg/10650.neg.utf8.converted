i first found out about these bags several years back and before i found them available on amazon.  i have been using them for at least 4 years and while i love the concept and the product lived up to the expectations at first, my last two batches have really made me wary of their use.  i have a 40 lb dog and a 70lb dog.  i agree with the reviewer that sometimes with the medium sized dogs with a bigger, messier amount, the size of these bags doesn't quite cut it.  however, i carry extra and just use another if there is a larger deposit.<br /><br />to my dismay, my biggest beef has been with the reliability of these bags lately.  the last two orders of 4-packs that i have ordered have split open, either along the seam on the bottom or just along the crease on the side.  it's happened several times that i am just walking along and the poop flies out from the bag behind me, in front of me, off to the side, wherever, due to a burst seam.  i cringe at the thought of a bag bursting open and getting fecal on my leg or on my dogs.  my dogs are well trained, loose leash walkers who flank my legs so it's not like there is crazy activity on my part with regard to momentum/inertia.  i thought double bagging would be a solution but have found that even triple-bagged, the seams burst.  i think i have found a replacement biodegradable solution and am sad that i cannot stay with this product.<br /><br />i am not sure if the recipe for the starch bags has changed over the years or if i am getting really old batches (just like rubber bands, every product has a life-span) but due to my reluctance to get poop on my person, i have to switch away from these.
