Really bad all the way around. The flimsy packed box was dumped on my stoop with a gaping hole, and some packages missing. Fortunately the UPS man did not get much enjoyment out of these crackers. No real shrimp flavor, more like a fishy after taste. I couldn't give these things away to family, or co-workers (which says a lot, because nurses will eat anything). This was money wasted. The whole box went to the trash.
