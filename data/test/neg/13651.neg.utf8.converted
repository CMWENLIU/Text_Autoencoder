My 7 year old beagle loves this food. When we first got it i mixed with her old food for 2 weeks, she would eat all of Orijen before her old food. Her stool was fine during that 2 weeks, but once we were out of her old food her stool became liquidy that it was impossible to pick up. Now it has been 7 weeks and we see no sign improvement... still bad diarrhea.
