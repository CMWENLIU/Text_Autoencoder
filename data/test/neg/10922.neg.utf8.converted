I have been a doctor for 50 years. In that time there are now probably 1000 times as many medications and 500 times more medical procedures. Every one of them in order to be accepted has to undergo what is called a double blinded, placebo controlled study. An appropriate number of patients have to be recruited. In the case of Lipitor it was 10,000. 5000 took Lipitor and 5000 took the placebo, which looked exactly like the Lipitor pill. None of the patients or nurses or doctors knew who got what. All of the patients were seen often and after 5 years Pfizer broke the code and discovered that the Lipitor treated group had 50% less heart attacks, strokes and death. Every pill and every procedure has to be tested this way if it is to get on the market. FRS has never been tested this way and never will. The beneficial effects of this product depend on the placebo effect. If you believe something will benefit you because you have read many + testimonials there is a very good chance you will experience a benefit. Of course drinking a potion and expecting to, and then feeling better is a piece of cake compared to the potion actually curing cancer or healing an ulcer. You wouldn't want to go to your doctor when you are very sick and get a placebo. FRS depends on + comments of users and the celebrity endorsement of one of the greatest athletes in history. Does Lance say he won the Tour de France because of FRS? If he did would that be cheating?<br />Cleaves M. Bennett MD
