While I am very pleased to see Nespresso machines available for sale on Amazon, it is very counter-Amazon that this supplier is being allowed to offer Nespresso coffee capsules on Amazon at such inflated prices and slow shipping times. One is supposed to be able to go to Amazon for better pricing and excellent order fulfillment/delivery.<br /><br />This supplier charges twice the amount that you will pay buying directly online from Nespresso (and from a much larger assortment as well!). Also, Nespresso express ships them in a matter of days versus weeks from this supplier.<br /><br />Nespresso coffee is excellent! The Nespresso system is one of the best additions I ever bought for our kitchen. However, while it could make sense for you to buy the machine here on Amazon, please do not buy the capsules from this supplier.
