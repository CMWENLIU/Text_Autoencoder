What a total BUMMER!!! :(<br /><br />My little Jack-a-Bee LOVES these Chicken Chips, but unfortunately they are made in China (Thank You Amazon Reviewers for bringing this to my attention!) and since we love our dog we won't be buying any more these as Chinese manufacturing quality is suspect, to say the least.<br /><br />I wish the SmokeHouse people would address this issue and try to assure people that there is some sort of quality control is in place.<br /><br />So disappointed.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger/dog lover
