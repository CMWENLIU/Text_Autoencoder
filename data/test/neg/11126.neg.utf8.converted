It really annoys me when searching for gluten free products, products like this show up! You come across it on the list and get all excited thinking you found something new! You scroll down to the allergy listing and it clearly says wheat free! So you go to the ingredient list and the first ingredient is wheat flour! This is not the only product that amazon.com has done this with! You have to really read though everything before ordering!<br />For companies, If you process it on shared equipment with an allergen, it is not free of that allergen even if you cross check every ingredient you put into it! If you run it down equipment that previously had the allergen on it you are causing cross contamination and therefore can not rightfully label the product free of that allergen! On the same note, you need to disclose on all packaging that it was processed on shared equipment so those of us with allergies do not get sick by eating foods that appear safe but are not!
