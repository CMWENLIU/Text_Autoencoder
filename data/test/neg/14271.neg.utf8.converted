Bought a bag of this, hoping to get my cat away from the grains, rotten meat and other garbage in most commercial cat food. My cat has never been finicky, but she wants nothing to do with this food. I even tried another reviewer's idea of putting the food through the food processor with a bit of water, but the cat smelled it and still didn't want it. The search for a better cat food product continues. I gave it 2 stars only because it's a cat-health conscious product, but maybe it should be 1 star since my cat won't eat it.
