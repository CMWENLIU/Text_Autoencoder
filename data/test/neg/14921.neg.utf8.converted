I bought these from another vendor and spent $22.00 which was a waste of money.  They DO NOT TASTE ANYTHING LIKE THE OLD DELFA ROLLS.  I am 49 years old and ought to know what they tasted like.  Don't waste your money, the product isn't bad just not what I was looking for in a retro candy and craving from my youth.
