These cookies were DISGUSTING!!  It tasted like two dry crackers with a tiny bit of dry frosting in the middle.  I couldn't GIVE these things away!  Once anyone tried one, they'd hand the whole package back to me.  I ended up just having to throw them out.  They're SOOO gross.  These things don't even RESEMBLE a cookie.
