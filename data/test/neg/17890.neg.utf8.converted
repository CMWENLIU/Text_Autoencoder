This review is for the Duck & Pea and Venison & Pea formulas only.  I haven't tried the other Natural Balance formulas, though to be honest, I'm afraid to after the awful experience we had with these two formulas.  Both of these gave my cat terrible diarrhea and vomiting.  I initially wanted to try an allergy diet because my cat has itchy, waxy ears due to something--it's not mites so I thought maybe it could be allergies.  It made sense to me to try something grain free, with limited protein sources to rule out some things.  Unfortunately, the only conclusions I can draw from my experiment are that, either he's allergic to duck or venison (don't think so) or green peas (maybe?) or I got a bad batch, OR there's another ingredient that doesn't agree with him (carageenan? flaxseed?).  I did call the company, to see if they had any idea what was going on, and they recommended that we should keep trying and tough out the diarrhea for 4-6 weeks, until he 'adjusted.'  Yeah, right--like that wouldn't kill him from dehydration!  I hope this company takes reports like that seriously, I know they've had quality control issues in the past, and their foods were involved in the recalls.  My goal was to improve my boy's condition through diet, not put him in the hospital.  I'll be donating the rest of these cans to homeless animals, (and praying they can stomach it, 'cause I'm not 100% sure it isn't a bad batch).  Meantime, he's back on Eagle Pack Holistic canned foods, and feeling so much better.
