I love the product, however I returned it as the shipping was outrageous -  I just could not use "gold dust" I paid over $50 for a $5 item!  It was sent by the most expensive means, which was not necessary at all.  I have told others about my experience and they just could hardly believe that a little can of spice would be shipped in a big box at that price!!!  Oh well, buyer beware.
