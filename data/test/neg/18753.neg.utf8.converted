I've been enjoying carrot juice for years -- home made in my juicer and also another well-known brand sold in the produce department, which is also good. But recently I purchased Lakewood brand and was so disturbed by the taste that I thought the bottle of juice had somehow gone bad. Thinking it was an isolated incident, I didn't say anything about it when my boyfriend bought two more 32 oz. bottles to use in a recipe we planned to make this morning (a wonderful "pumpkin pie" smoothie made with carrot juice, sweet potato and dates). We were making a large quantity, to serve to friends, and it turned out these bottles of juice were terrible too, so we had to scrap the whole plan. There is a real "twangy" almost metallic taste, bordering on rotten carrots. I don't know if it's the pasteurization process or what, but this brand of carrot juice does *not* taste like carrot juice. I would hate for people to buy it and think they don't like carrot juice due to how this tastes. I don't know what their process is, but the end result is very icky. (Sorry, Lakewood -- I really don't like giving bad reviews! But this stuff is not good!)
