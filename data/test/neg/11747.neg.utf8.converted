The name is misleading as there are no truffles listed in the ingredients. However, there IS a hard chunk of porcini mushroom in the bottle. Perhaps my palate is not sophisticated enough, but I didn't detect anything special in the taste of this oil. In fact, there is a strange synthetic smell that may be coming from the plastic spout. I even refilled the bottle with EVOO and microwaved it in order to release the mushroom flavor, but nothing changed. I guess I'll spend the extra money for some REAL truffle oil.
