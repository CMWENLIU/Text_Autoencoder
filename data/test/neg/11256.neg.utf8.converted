I love Tim Tam's, and I searched when I found Pepperidge Farms was coming out with them. That version I can cheerfully pass by. I don't share my Australian ones, even the kids know not to ask. The difference? The original has a very light crumbly cookie, the center melts when exposed to hot liquid into a sublime smooth rich cream and the outside chocolate has so little wax it will melt in your hand. Even several months old Arnott's Tim Tams are better. The US version by Pepperidge Farms has a stiff chocolate coating, a thicker cookie-less porous, and the center leaves a greasy mouth feel. Very disappointing.<br /><br />If you have not tried Arnott's Tim Tams, these are a pleasant creme-filled cookie covered in chocolate and probably good for chocoholics.
