I've tried several brands of gluten-free pizza crusts, I bought the Ener-G as my latest product exploration.  Being a huge fan of many of Ener-G products, I thought this one would be a slam dunk hit.  How wrong I was.  The Ener-G pizza crusts are too thin, dense, and heavy, with very little taste.  You would think "thin" and "heavy" would be contradictory, but that's what I really mean to say.  By contrast, the Kinnikinnick pizza crusts are light and fluffy, with such an outstanding declicious flavor.  I would strongly suggest buying a single package of the Ener-G pizza crusts from your local health food store first.  I made a mistake trusting Ener-G on this product before I bought a whole case of it.  It was an expensive lesson.  But, nonetheless, a huge thanks to Amazon for offering so many gluten-free products.  Here in the US, we are just starting to become familiar with how many people are affected by gluten.
