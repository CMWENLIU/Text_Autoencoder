I have been vegetarian for about 5-6 years and generally I can eat about anything.  I may not love it, but I can eat it.  First, this stuff smells horrible.  They say to rinse them to get rid of the smell.  You can't completely get rid of the smell.  It smells like rotten fish or something. Second, the texture of this stuff makes me literally gag. I couldn't even swallow it, I had to spit it out.  If I want pasta I will eat pasta or even spagetti squash. But this stuff is not even edible in my book.  If I could give it -stars I would.  If your one of those people who have to try something for yourself, go to Whole Foods or a health food store and get just one pack first.
