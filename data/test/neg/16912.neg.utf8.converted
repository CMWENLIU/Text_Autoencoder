We have been customers of the reduced fat version of this product for 7 years.  Our son is now 8 and a very picky eater (which is why he was drinking this product in the first place).  He is also on the thin side, so he was getting about 800 calories a day from the milk, which he really needs.  But the formulation has changed from a reduced fat (2%) to a low fat (1%) version.  The taste is noticeable and he will no longer drink it.  It seems ironic that a company who sells whole milk, half and half and heavy whipping cream would eliminate a 2% milk product.  I applaud them for coming out with a lower fat, lower sugar variety- but they could give their (very) loyal customers the option of buying the original version.  I have contacted Horizon and suggested they still provide the 2% product, but they said they "were not taking suggestions at this time".  Nice, eh?
