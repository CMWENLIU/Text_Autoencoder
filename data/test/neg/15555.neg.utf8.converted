I've been gluten free for ten years.  I'm o.k. enough that I can slip up a little and only get a little sick:  what that means is that if something isn't entirely gluten free, it will make me sick for hours, not days.  That's made me tolerant of food that isn't entirely gluten free--I'll eat the not-entirely-gluten-free food for a couple of days, and then start having a reaction, not realizing that is what is happening.<br /><br />This is only sort of gluten free.  You might be able to eat it a few times with only a little bit of distress, but then it will get worse.  If you are a celiac on a long-standing gluten free diet, you will slowly get sicker again.<br /><br />And, your risk of getting colon cancer later in life will go up dramatically, which is apparently what happens to celiacs who eat little bits of gluten throughout their lives.  Just because it's not really making you sick, doesn't mean it's not doing damage.<br /><br />Avoid this, and don't feed it to celiac kids.<br /><br />Edit:  On the gluten-free listservs there are discussions of people getting sick from this.  Erewhon has confirmed that they run oat cereals on some of the lines, so if you are a celiac who can't tolerate oats (which I am) this is bad stuff.<br /><br />Also, they make this in a facility that processes wheat, so it may be legally gluten free (20 ppm or less), but not actually gluten-free.  Mixed facilities can have 10 ppm wheat in the air alone.
