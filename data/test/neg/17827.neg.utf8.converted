If you like real mayonnaise, you're not going to like this.  This is more of a flavored oil "mayo".  Might as well get Miracle Whip.<br /><br />Really, it's a different taste and texture, it's just not Mayonnaise.<br /><br />So like the other reviewers, if you hate real mayo, try this or Miracle Whip.
