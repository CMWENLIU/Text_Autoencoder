Look at the picture people IT'S not Gunpowder Green TEA!<br />The Gunpowder tea it called that as it resembles Smokeless Gunpowder!<br />The tea leaves are rolled in to VERY TIGHT round Balls before steaming. And while that looks like a good Green tea it is clearly not Gunpowder TEA!<br />Witch is far more expensive as to the quality and additional steps in preparation.<br />That is ordinary Green tea. Might taste good but that is not Gunpowder Tea.<br />Witch because of the extra step of rolling is far stronger and better health befits.<br />As for organic?<br /><br />Well if there lying or mistaken about WHAT it is as a tea why would you trust it to be right about it being Organic????<br /><br />You have bean cheated.<br /><br />So anyone here interested in buying a bridge in Brooklyned  ???<br /><br /> Or some nice beach property in Nevada ?<br /><br />I will give Davidson's Tea Bulk the benefit of the doubt that they are not Lying just wrong as they did show pictures of the product.(normal green tea)<br />Now I have seen that they do offer Real Gunpowder Tea in other offers,BUT I will not buy any products from company that knows so little about there own products. As if there honest but mistaken because there ignorant of what they Sell that makes it worse than if they knew what they were selling and just lying!!<br />Stupid is regrettably Forever!<br /><br />No excuse one should know what one sells.
