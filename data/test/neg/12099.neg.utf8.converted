I ordered Caribou Blend and they sent me a box of 80 Daybreak Blends, which was nasty tasting and a medium blend. I could not return it because it was not unopened in its original packaging (I had tried a few cups, thinking I would like it if I kept drinking it). I'm halfway through the box, too cheap to dump it, but ordering more because I can't take it anymore! Watch out, I'm not the only one who's had this happen to them.
