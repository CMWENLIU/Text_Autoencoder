My sisters is in end stage renal failure. She had a companion dog to ease her soul as she waits for a kidney. The holidays came and the house got crowded and her dog Harley may have been fed a few extra of these treats. He died of kidney failure. We didn't know about these treats causing kidney failure in dogs. Two days ago my roommate had to lie on the floor of the animal hospital and cradle her Dalmatian Zoe as she felt Zoe's heart stop in her arms. She was in kidney failure from these treats I ordered for her on Amazon. Dont buy this. It's not an urban legend. It's very real and we can't get these companions back now. If you want to treat your dogs you can trust Blue Buffalo brand products. If they have even suspect a tiny problem with their products they will do a voluntary recall to keep your pet from harms way. Nestl&eacute; Purina Pet foods will continue to use every legal trick in the book to keep this poison on the shelves. They pay victims an average of 100 to 3000 dollars to cover their vet bills and sign non disclosure forms. Hush money for families that can't afford the costs these treats caused.
