I was under the impression when I purchased this item that it was several bully sticks and that in no way ONE stick would originally cost almost $70.00! I thought that this was one heck of a bargain at $15.00. I was wrong.  I received ONE bully stick, about two and a half feet long. I would be more upset but it appears that my dog does enjoy, after some encouraging, chewing on it. It may not last her longer than it takes me to finish this review, but at only $15.00. I can't be too upset. I am however disappointed, feeling somewhat mislead by the picture. If I would have paid the original price they have posted, that would have been a much different story.<br /><br />I'm rating this item only 2 stars, no more because of the reasons mentioned above, but no less because even though it's no great bargain, it still seems like a fair price for the product I did receive. If I would have I known that this is only one item, I most likely would have not made this purchase.
