I ordered these chocolates directly from Xylitol USA.  They had turned white on the outside, something I have known in the past to be a sign of age.  I ate 4 anyway and got a belly ache.  I am used to using xylitol daily in my tea, so it was not an issue of not being used to it.  I called the company and was told the chocolates were fine, that the white coating happens sometimes in shipping.  Funny, I've never received any other shipped chocolates that turned white, have just seen it before on out of date chocolates.  I told her they gave me indigestion and she said people should eat no more than one a day because they contain a lot of xylitol.  Shouldn't that be a warning on the package?  So I tried just eating one.  Belly ache again.  And I was denied a refund or even a discount on my next xylitol order!  Guess they don't want my business.
