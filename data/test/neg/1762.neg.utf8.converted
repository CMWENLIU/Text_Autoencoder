My husband recently has had to go on a "no salt" diet, and his favorite restaurant is Outback, so I ordered him this steak seasoning.  The first time we used it, we both thought it was very bland - the steaks tasted like they had been cooked with nothing.  We doubled the amount we used the second time, and it was still completely tasteless.  The third time we dipped the steaks in egg and used this seasoning as a breadcrumb-style coating (nothing added to it, just a bowl of this seasoning), and the steaks were STILL completely tasteless.  I threw the rest of the giant tub of colored red flecks in the garbage.  Did I just get a really old batch or what?  What a waste.
