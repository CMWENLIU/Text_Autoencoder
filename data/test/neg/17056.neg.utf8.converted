I hate giving negative reviews and sometimes people are just Fuss-buckets but I am not--so read this review knowing that I'm not big on complaining. I cook and bake A LOT. I do a lot of my own Gluten Free Recipes so I'm no novice.  I've used a Ready Made Gluten Free crust (EnerG Foods Rice Pizza Shells) here from Amazon that I pre-cooked and it's not too bad as long as you pre-cook with Olive Oil before you add the toppings and then again, after. I wanted even better--so we ordered these Bob's Red Mill Pizza Crust bags. I have made this 2x now. The first time I followed directions to the T and it turned out rubbery and gooey. The 2nd time I read EVERY review and followed the extra instructions. My Husband and I are sitting here with full bellies from this pizza--because we ate the yummy TOPPINGS, only. On an EFFORT note: It doesn't take that long--cause you let the dough rise -while you are making the chicken and onions and garlic & peppers, etc for the pizza. I even pre-seasoned the dough & forked it & oiled it and cooked it and made sure it was VERY flat. After 15 mins, I grabbed a bite of the crispy dough-before I added the toppings and it tasted like...DOG FOOD biscuits! (Now, on a side note--how could I know--you ask--well, doesn't EVERY kid taste their doggies food and you don't forget that taste) Anyway, Toppings were yummy---and I don't mind a little more effort on the crust if it taste SUPERB--but DOG FOOD PIZZA CRUST is NOT what I would recommend to ANYONE. On that note--we did feed the rest of the crust to our doggies. Bottom line--we are going back to those pre-made crusts.  The rest of the bags?  Garbage!
