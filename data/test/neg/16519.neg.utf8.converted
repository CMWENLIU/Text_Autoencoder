Contrary to other reviews (which sold me) I did not find these anywhere near the quality of the ones I miss so much at Costco.  They have a grey-ish tint to them which is unappealing.  They were tolerable the first day out of the can but the texture degrades immediately thereafter (hence the organic?).  If they are not used before the third day I think that you will be completely disappointed.  I found that they turned to mush and turned an even darker shade of gray.  I made sure that I had them in an airtight storage container, in the frig, in all of the liquid that was contained in the can.  The color you see on their label is most assuredly not what you will find inside.  If I could return the more than 1/2 case I have left, I would.  And I made sure to cancel the auto ship.<br /><br />P.S.  This is only the second review I have ever taken the time to write on this site in the entire 10+ years I have been shopping on Amazon. (The other was a 4-star positive) I was utterly dissatisfied with these hearts of palm and have no idea what I'll do with the balance.
