I ordered these gumballs because I thought they might be interesting with the three flavors. The turkey flavor was just horrible. The pumpkin pie flavor was good, but not as good as I thought it would be. The cranberry was just okay.However, the thing that made me the most disappointed was the fact that I got about 15 disgusting turkey gumballs, and only seven pumpkin pie and cranberry.
