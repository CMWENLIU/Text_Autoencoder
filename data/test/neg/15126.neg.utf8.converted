This milk contains carrageenan. Carrageenan is a type of sugar which is found in seaweeds, and generally used to make the milk thicker and creamer. Although it is largely used in food, there are growing concerns about its safety (see: [...] and the body of scientific work published by Dr. Joanne K. Tobacman)<br /><br />There is a big dispute going on about carrageenan's safety. However, for me, it suffices to say that carrageenan is "the" drug of choice to induce inflammation on mice ears, whenever scientists want to test for anti-inflammatory agents.<br /><br />The fact that it can induce such a powerful inflammation process, plus all the recent scientific work showing evidences that long term use of carrageenan is harmful to our gastrointestinal system , are enough for me to avoid using it myself. Imagine then, using it on my children!!!<br /><br />I wrote to Organic Horizons asking why they used carrageenan on their milk for children, and I got an answer saying that "silk soy milk" was safe, and bla, bla, bla. Apparently, their customer service representative didn't even bother to replace the "silk soy milk" for "chocolate milk". They probably receive so many of these inquires that they don't even bother to personalize the answers any more.<br /><br />Well, I am not buying this product anymore and decided to post this review because I think more people should know about carrageenan and decided for themselves, whether they want to consume it or not. I believe carrageenan shouldn't be used in food anymore. Especially on those claiming to be organic and targeting our CHILDREN. I am switching to Organic Valley.
