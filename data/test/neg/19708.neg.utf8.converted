I read multiple reviews prior to purchasing this product.  Most all of them RAVED about this product, so I was really anxious to receive the shipment so I could try for myself!  What a letdown!!  They aren't at all crunchy... You could kindly call them "soft and chewy" or describe them as they seemed to me, more "tough and spongy".  After eating part of one, I threw the rest of that one away.  Then I gave the other 17 in that box and another whole box of 18 away {As I said, I was impressed with the reviews I had read and kind of over-bought!!).  The general feedback I got was maybe 50-50.  Some liked them, but alot had the same opinion as I did. The actual taste was OK... it was the texture that killed them for me...  Just one opinion from Oregon.
