This is the same exact thing as horse bedding/wood pellets. From a feed shop, you can get a 30-40 lb bag of wood pellets, aka "Feline Pine," for 7 dollars. What is Feline Pine charging you?<br /><br />UPDATE 10/11/2012: This wood pellets have worked very well for my cat but now, like other reviewers are facing, my cat won't go number 2 in here, although he is still using it to urinate, but I think he's urinating less frequently too now. I'm definitely worried. I think the hardness of the pellets are whats causing him to not use his litter box as much, although he has still never gone outside of his box either. Luckily, he is an indoor/outdoor cat, I let him out for 4-5 hours late in the morning and I've seen him use the bathroom outside almost every morning, so at least he's not holding it in. Going outside is also whats contributing to his reduced use of the litter box, but even on days he doesn't go out, I don't find much in the litter box. Either ways, this problem needs to be addressed now. While googling, I came across how gardeners are having a difficult time keeping cats out of their mulched garden beds and that sparked an idea...I think mulch would make a fabulous substitute for these wood pellets. I will use the mulch the same way I use the wood pellets - litter box, johnny cat liner, 5" deep layer of mulch and update. Either ways mulch is as dirt cheap as wood pellets, the only thing is it might hold the smell of urine a little more than the pellets so I'm probably looking at replacing the litter more frequently. Still, at the insignificant price of a ginormous bag of mulch, this is not an issue.
