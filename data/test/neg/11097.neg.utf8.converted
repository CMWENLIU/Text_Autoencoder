I was hoping this cereal would be delicious. It is not delicious. It is awful tasting. I should have known it was going to taste bad because I had eaten and not liked Kay's BBQ Snack Mix. I like the idea for this cereal and that it is gluten free. that is not enough to make it edible. The soy gives it a weird aftertaste that I can't tolerate. If you don't like soy, you probably want to avoid this cereal (soy is the first ingredient). This might taste better is the soy protein was replaced with whey or rice protein. I did get a refund, so that was good.
