I try to maintain a low carb diet most of the time, and was excited to find these. When I tried them, I thought they were absolutely horrible.  I could get past the smell, it's really not that bad.  I could not get past the fact that I felt like I was eating unflavored gummy worms.  I almost gagged.  I mixed these with alfredo sauce, broccoli, and chicken.  Maybe they would be ok with something that has more of a bold flavor?  Unfortunately, I'm not willing to try them again to find out.
