I used to buy 1 & 2 lbs - smaller packages which I was very satisfied with the Quality.<br />At this time ordered 1 Gallon and I am quite Disapointed as quality of Coconut oil is not NOT the same. It looks more transluent (less white) and even at room temperature oil is VERY soft (almost runny) also it has LESS coconut fragrance .... I will NOT buy this package again.
