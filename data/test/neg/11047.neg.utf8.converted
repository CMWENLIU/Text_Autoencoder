I recently order a 6-pack of Pero - hopefully to find a substitute for the Postum I have been drinking for over 50 years. Let me tell you -- Postum it's not! It tastes awful, and the aroma (smell) is even worse. I mixed just one cup, took one sip, flushed the rest down the drain and gave away all six cans. Taste and smell, of course, are individualistic and arbitrary, but if you're looking for something as close as possible to the now extinct Postum, don't waste your money on this one!
