This has been my favorite K-Cup coffee for well over 9 months now, so I was very excited to be able to buy it on Amazon in large quantities at a reduced cost.  Unfortunately, while the flavor is still my favorite, I've had terrible luck with the K-Cups themselves.  Every second or third cup I brew leaves loads of coffee grounds in the cup.  I've had this happen on occasion with other K-Cups over the two years I've owned my Keurig, but NEVER to this extent.  I don't know if the foil cap is the cause of the problem or what, but it appears that every time the pin punctures the K-Cup it leaves a much larger than normal hole that causes the grounds to end up in the coffee.  At first I thought maybe it was a problem with my brewer, but I've used 4 other varieties since the problem began and I've had zero issues with those.  Obviously it's a issue with this particular product.
