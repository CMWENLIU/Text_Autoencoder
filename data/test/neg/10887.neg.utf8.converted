Go with beef bones or marrow bones.  The salt they put in the pork bones and other chemicals to keep them from rotting is horrible for your dogs.  Smell one next time you go to feed one to your dog, its disgusting and it smells 100% man made.  Smell a beef bone, they actually don't smell bad at all, there not toxic as pork bones are.<br /><br />I had given these to my dogs twice, the first time it slowed them down, like us eating 2 combo meals from Mc Donalds, the just lounged around and didn't do much, had a touch of diarrhea.  I didn't think the bone had anything to do with it until I gave them the 2nd bone 2 days later.  They both got sick this time, couldn't drink enough water and was vomiting out over control.<br /><br />Its just not worth it with all the other alternative out there and on Amazon.  Please find something better.<br /><br />I use marrow bone I get at my grocer, I freeze them and give them to my dog.  Keeps them busy for a solid 45 minutes and they have never gotten sick.  Either that I have used the beef bones, the ones smoked and dried.  They work well and are safe for your dogs.  Check out my reviews if you like I have some on dog treats.
