Every other ingredient is a processed sugar; it contains partially hydrogenated oil (number one cause of elevated LDL cholesterol); TONS of processed milk products and by-products. I don't see whole grains anywhere. This is stuff is crap. If you want to be healthy and lose weight, try fruits and veggies, WHOLE grains, and exercise.
