Gritty texture, doesn't mix well, hemp bits get stuck in teeth. The package recommends adding it to yogurt but that turns the yogurt into a gritty inedible slop.  I'm afraid to use it in pancakes for fear it will result in grittiness. It's just a terrible excuse for "protein powder", I'm not sure it can called that.
