I like the original pop chips, and I love tortilla chips, so when I saw this product I thought it would be a slam dunk.  But no.  These chips taste very....off.  They taste like no other tortilla chip I've ever tasted.  Nor do they taste like the original pop chips.  They have an odd cardboard texture with a weird aftertaste.  I would avoid this stuff.
