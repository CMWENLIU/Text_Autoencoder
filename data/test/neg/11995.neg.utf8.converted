I rarely buy packaged food, but I wanted to make Paula Deen's corn casserole for Christmas.  After making the bread, I tasted it.  It was horrible.  I'm from Alabama, so I'm not used to sugar in my corn muffins or cornbread.  I looked at the ingredients and found that the mix contains 3 forms of lard.  I don't eat meat, so I chucked the bread and made my own cornbread.
