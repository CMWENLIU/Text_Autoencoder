This is high quality curry for next to nothing. Three pounds for the price of four little bottles. I go through a pound a month. To preserve freshness keep it in the refrigerator.<br /><br /> 8/5/2011 Update: This has been out of stock for quite awhile. Glad to see it's back,  I've since tried Marshal Creek and Sun brand. Neither came close. All the rest were way too expensive.<br /><br />5/22/2012 Update: A different company bought the brand and completely changed the formula (the lable is the same but without "D&D Gold Product"). There is so much very hot chili pepper mixed in that it completely overwhelms the curry. More than two tbsp of curry in two gallons of vegetable soup makes it so hot it's nearly inedible. Too bad! This used to be really good curry. I can't recommend it anymore.
