I love Red Vines and all of their products and I give them 5*.  I am giving Candy Bandits a 1* because they literally are Bandits.  I'm serving over in Afghanistan right now and I wanted to get some red ropes.  I didn't notice the shipping total for this product until after I had already had it shipped.  The total for the box of red ropes was $39.99 and the total for shipping was $37.05.  I didn't realize this shipping price because I ordered other items at the same time.  But $37.05 for shipping is uncalled for and outright robbery on their part.  To make it worse, they used a USPS FLAT RATE BOX.  My family sends me packages all the time in the USPS Flat rate box and like it says, it's a FLAT RATE!  They added an extra $20 dollars to the price of shipping because it's to an APO.  Good product bad service, find a better vendor for this.
