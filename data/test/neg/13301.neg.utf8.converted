We used to eat these a lot, and I think they are delicious.  Sorry to be unfair, but I wanted to say that these things are LOADED with sugar- just look at the nutrition info: 25 grams of sugar per serving, 1/4 cup- which you could easily eat twice that much. One serving has almost as much sugar as a candy bar (usually around 30 grams), and as much sugar as an 8 oz serving of coca cola.  Imagine if you eat a double serving- that's like downing a whole bottle of mountain dew or noshing on a king-size snickers!<br />I do think cherries are great for you, they have lots of antioxidants, vitamins, and a small amount of fiber. no sulfites which is good. They are better than candy, I suppose, but sweetened so much, this isn't the healthiest snack.  Just seems like everyone is raving about how healthy these are.  I used to think that, too, but then I actually faced the music.<br /><br />craisins are the same way, actually even worse.<br /><br />So while it's better than some chemical laden, corn syrup sweetened concoction from a gas station, these are a far cry from healthy.<br /><br />why can't i find unsweetened or lightly sweetened cherries at a decent price??
