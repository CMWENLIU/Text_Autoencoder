I'm not sure if this product really USDA approved.  The aroma and taste are extremely weak.  I can't hardly feel any ginger in food I added to. I chose this over my regular premium brand (Simply Organic Ginger Root Ground USDA Organic, 1.64-Oz. 3Pack $12.89)hoping to save money. Like the old saying; you get what you paid for. Never make same mistake again.
