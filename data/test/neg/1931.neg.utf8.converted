I purchased the 6 pack of Good Earth Caffeine Free Sweet and Spicy. I was shocked when I compared the ingredients on the boxes I received to the ingredients listed on the Amazon website. Website states "100% Natural...No artificial Flavors". On the website, "Natural Flavor" is the third ingredient. On the boxes I received "Artificial Flavor" is the third ingredient!<br />Good Earth was recently purchased by the Tata Beverage Group. Apparently they have chosen to enhance their profit on what used to be a quality, 100% Natural product by using inferior ingredients. I'm sure as educated consumers become aware of this change, this item will rapidly drop from it's #2 selling position at Amazon. As always, Amazon's customer service<br />was excellent. They refunded my total purchase price for the item. Guess I'll donate the product to a local food bank.
