I was really disappointed when I opened this package up.  Over a third of the crackers are already crushed or cracked or even slightly burnt on the edges.  I am using them for S'mores favor bags for a birthday party and it's too late to send them back and try to find other individually packaged graham crackers.  I had enough to do what I needed but what a waste of money on the rest of the damaged goods.  I guess I can make a graham cracker crust out of them.....
