I generally don't write bad product reviews, but in this case I'll make an exception. I switched from using sugar in my coffee to agave due to the low glycemic index, but also because it seemed simple to use, and the liquid is much easier to dissolve if I wanted to use it in a cooler liquid, such as iced tea. This was the first agave I ever purchased, and I am now a big fan. However, that is IN SPITE OF this Xagave product, NOT because of it. The bottle design for this agave nectar was beyond frustrating to me. The design of the bottles included a clear plastic top, which came off completely, and a little nub with a hole on it that you pulled up so that you could squirt agave out, and then pushed back in when you were done (kind of like an old-school water bottle), and then you put the clear plastic top back on again. There is NO way this design was actually tested by a conscious living human before it was putt into production. You could not use this product without leaving at least a tiny bit of agave around the spout thing every single time you used it. The next morning, you left a little more, and so on and so forth, until the top of the bottle (including the little plastic top thing) were so disgusting and sticky that I actually started to dread my normal cup of coffee every morning. I literally counted down the days until we were finished with this product (yes, I refused to waste it by throwing it out); not because I planned on quitting agave. No, only because I wanted to quit making a sticky disgusting mess every morning with my coffee. Honestly, I can't believe I'm the first one to complain about this. Am I the only one who received this type of dispenser top? Is this some sort of elaborate agave practical joke?<br /><br />Bottom line, I like agave. Strongly support it. I hate this bottle. In my nightmares, a giant version of this bottle leaves sticky puddles of disgustingness that I get stuck in until the end of time. Until the bottle design is changed, don't buy it. I've used other agave and it has all tasted just as good. Buy one that won't frustrate you with each use.<br /><br />Note: If the bottle has changed in any way, someone please comment on my review and say so, and I will change my review to reflect that. As of today (09-14-11), one of the pictures Amazon is using looks like it has a different dispenser/tap than mine, while another picture shows the same tap I had on my bottles. A flip-top would basically solve all of my complaints; I switched to a different brand (Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Blue Agave), and the flip-top design is perfect.
