I was really excited to try these and then when I opened the bag I was thoroughly disappointed. They don't smell like they would be dried berries; in fact they smell more earthy than berry-ish. Himalayan superfruit the package says.... These berries have barely any taste at all. I did not enjoy them. Then of course I pan around to ingredients and notice "product of China". I know the Himalayas run to China but still, why is it that it seems almost everything comes from China now? Given their terrible enforcement for quality control in everything across the board, including food production, I don't want to be eating any product coming out of China. Their terrible quality water supply and even worse air quality are enough for me to frown on anything edible coming from China. Not to mention their consistent history for allowing chemically tainted foods to be consumed by their population.
