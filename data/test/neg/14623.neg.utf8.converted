SweetLeaf SteviaClear liquid does not taste good at all.  I purchased this to make cookies for my brother's girlfriend Mary who has a medical condition that doesn't allow for her to consume sugar or carbohydrates.  She uses a lot of Splenda, but Splenda can cause an array of problems (formaldehyde on the brain for example).  I thought Stevia would be a good alternative to try.  I wasn't expecting to like it myself because I don't like sugar substitutes such as Splenda or aspartame, but I thought at least Mary would like it.  I thought wrong.  This product has a nasty bitter aftertaste that tastes very similar to fingernail polish remover.  It's horrible.  Mary did not like it nor did anyone in my family.  I tried the Stevia in cookies, tea, and coffee, but nothing was able to mask the nasty aftertaste.  I would recommend steering away from this product and so would Mary.
