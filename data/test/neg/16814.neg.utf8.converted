This "chowder" claims to be neither New England nor Manhattan -- i.e., no milk/cream and no tomatoes.  As an old clam chowder fan, I'm willing to try something new, but this was not a success.  Most disastrously, they brag about using sea salt but they use too darned much of it.  The salty taste lingered throughout dinner.  We still have five cans of this, so next time will make it with milk or half-and-half and see whether it converts into a decent New England chowder.  The clams and vegetables seem okay, if only one could taste them better.
