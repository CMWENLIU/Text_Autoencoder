I used to buy a bag of these like every couple of months for my two mini poodles... I loved these because they make their breath smell better and good for oral health. But on one  particular occasion I gave them each one and all of a sudden Mischa(my 2 year old poodle about 7/8 pounds)  starts jumping around hysterically and at first I didn't really pay attention to her I thought she was just excited but after a few seconds I knew something was wrong. She had one of these denta stix lodged in the roof of her mouth between the opposite sides of her teeth.. So I had to dig it out of her mouth... It was a very scary experience... Her mouth was bleeding a little from it being stuck in there. I don't know if I purchased a pack that was expired or if it had gotten stale... I have no idea but that was warning enough and I knew from then on I would not be purchasing any of those denta sticks again. Before this incident I loved denta stix but I was always uneasy about how hard they are but I know they are supposed to be like that in order to keep their teeth clean... But.. It scared the crap out of me and my little Mischa. It is weird because Pineapple ( my male mini poodle who is about 8 pounds and 3 yrs) has never had that happen to him when he has dentastix... But I just wanted to let you all know.. Just in case.. Better to be safe than sorry.
