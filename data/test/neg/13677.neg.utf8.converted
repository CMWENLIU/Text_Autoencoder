When I bought this snack I was expecting dried snap peas, which is what they lead you to believe from the packaging. However, they are a far cry from this. They are really a smashed blend of many ingredients bent back into a pea shape. There are a few benefits like fiber and there is some sort of pea in it but overall there are still some poor ingredients in my opinion, especially when I was expecting dried snap peas. Also, the flavor was very bland. Almost like cheerios, or a stale corn puff. Somewhat overpriced too, although I bought them from the grocery store not Amazon. I wouldn't recommend them.
