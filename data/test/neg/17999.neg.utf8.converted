These are a little salty, a little greasy, and a little 'powdery'.  The taste is not bad, BUT, I did have the strangest sensation after eating a couple handfuls - I don't have any known allergies or 'texture issues' with food whatsoever, so it was really bizarre:  they started to sort of taste prickly, like the outer part was sharp or rough, and it was unpleasant to continue eating them.  The closest thing I can compare is imagine chewing on a mouthful of roasted peanut SHELLS.  Very very weird.  I wouldn't buy again, not worth it.
