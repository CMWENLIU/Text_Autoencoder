I hate to give this a low-star review for a mistake that Amazon made in the listing - but as a vegetarian, I was very disappointed to see that this ramen had beef extract.  This was missing from the listing - I wouldn't have purchased it if the ingredient list was complete. :(<br />The noodles themselves are fine - just not the bouillon packet.
