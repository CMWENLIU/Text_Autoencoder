My husband and I both had the same reaction to the apples - WE SPIT THEM OUT. I had to check the packaging to see if there was some bizarre chemical they used to process it as the nasty chemical taste overwhelmed everything - and lingered in my mouth long after I spit out the apple. I wish I could return these because they'd go back in a heartbeat. I've been too reluctant to try the peach or cherry yet. I hate to throw out food, but may make an exception for these. To bad.
