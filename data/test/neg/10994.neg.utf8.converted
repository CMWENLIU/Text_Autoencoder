Even though these beans seemed fresh, they had terrible flavor. They were way worse than the average navy bean from the bulk bins of my local health food stores. After cooking one batch, I ended up throwing the rest in the garbage.<br /><br />I've been frustrated by the uneven quality of beans from my local health food stores. Sometimes great, sometimes terrible -- often the beans are very old, even though the stores I shop from are busy and have high turnover of beans. So I've been on a mission to find a mail-order source of consistently great beans. For navy beans, these are not it -- or at least this batch wasn't it. (Note: I did like Eden Foods kidney beans, so I'm not criticizing the brand.)
