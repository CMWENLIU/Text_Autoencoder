And thankfully I was on the tail end of the color cycle and almost time to schedule an appointment or I'd be seriously ticked. I've only used it twice and I'm practically back to my natural color and the gray is out in full force! The shampoo arrived in a padded envelope, but also wrapped in plastic. Mine hadn't spilled over as others have mentioned, but there was a strong odor just opening up the envelope. The shampoo is very thick and gooey and doesn't take much to get a good lather going. It seemed to clean well enough, but my hair felt dry and wanted conditioning - which it normally doesn't need as I don't blow dry much. I'm going to stick with the color safe shampoo I've been getting from the salon, and free or not, this product is headed for the dumpster.
