I've been using Pamela's products with great success, ordering a case of the bread mix from the Amazon online <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZFMEQ">Pamela's Products Wheat-Free & Gluten-Free Bread Mix, 19-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> grocery every month.  But in November, the bread started to have a very strange chemical after taste and also gave both my husband and myself serious digestive upset.  I made a few more loaves to see if it was just one bag of the mix, but no, it seems to be a recurring problem.  We also purchased a bag of Pamela's GF white cake mix from the grocery store recently and it had the same noxious taste and smell.  What's up?  I have three cases of the bread mix that I plan to return to Amazon for a refund.
