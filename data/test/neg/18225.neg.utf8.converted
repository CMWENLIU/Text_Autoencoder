The only deodorant I've tried that didn't work at all.  Smells good for a few minutes but doesn't protect long.  Feels slimy on application.  I like the regular Degree but this stuff is a joke.  The display says that astronauts use this stuff and if that's the case then the space station must smell terrible.
