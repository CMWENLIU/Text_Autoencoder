I ordered this product for our vacation home in Colorado. We arrived in Colorado December 16th and this coffee maker stoped working January 3rd. It is now January 13th and I have yet to talk to someone from the company after being put on hold for over 40 minutes 4 different times. I love the concept of the K-Cup but they need to fix the water pump on this machine and fix the way they handle customer service and returns.
