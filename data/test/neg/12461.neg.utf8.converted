Our dog, 3 years old, loves sweet potato wraps.  She loves the white meat wrapped ones and<br /><br />these are not that quality.  These have dark meat dried so hard that the meat shatters and<br /><br />the sweet potatoe is so dry I have trouble trying to cut them...guess this is why our<br /><br />small dog cannot get them chewed.  Medium to large dogs probably could handle these.
