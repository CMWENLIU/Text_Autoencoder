I live in a remote area where I cannot get these great products. I ordered two different kinds of this cereal and all 6 bags of the oat bran flakes smelled very rancid when the bags were opened. It is not returnable as I later found out. Warning, buy cereal close to home not online, it was an expensive lesson. The chickens will eat well this week.
