I ordered this product when it was on sale a while back, and got the 6 pack of boxes. After brewing a few tea bags, I thought the Red Goji/Raspberry flavor was indeed there, but the low amount of tea in each tea bag, didn't deliver almost any kind of caffeine lift. Each tea bag has very little tea in it. I called Lipton to complain, and the nice lady on the other end, pointed out that each tea bag has 1.2 grams of tea in it. (My box actually says 1.3g)  Hmm, I thought, how much tea by weight does an average tea bag of green tea have? My unflavored Meijer green tea bags have 2.2 grams of tea! The other two flavors of Lipton tea I bought also have a lot more tea in them when compared to the Red Goji/ Raspberry Lipton Tea. The Lipton Lemon Ginseng tea has 1.7 grams of tea, and the Orange passion fruit & Jasmine has 2.0 grams of tea! Why on earth has Lipton shortchanged the amount of tea in the Red Goji Tea? Just add some more green tea Please Lipton! This product is a disappointment!
