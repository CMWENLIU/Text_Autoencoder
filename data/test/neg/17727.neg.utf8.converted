This product sounded so great. I started taking about two to four tbls. a day. After a week my lips started swelling, then the inside of my mouth started feeling strange and my tongue was very sensitive, then I started having what I thought was heartburn (which i never get) I would feel pressure in my thoart all the way down to my Solar plexis, By the end of the second week it became so intense I knew something was wrong with me, I just didn't know what. I thought "I"m having an allergic reaction"(I'm not allergic to anything) so it took me awhile to catch on, the only new thing I added to my diet was the hemp hearts. I quite taking them, in one day  I started feeling better, by two days, started feeling normal again.<br />So just be careful, people can have an allergic reaction to this.
