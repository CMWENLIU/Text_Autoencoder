I like McDougall's soups and was taken by the concept that they<br />are virtually non fat and provide fiber etc I am most disappointed<br />to find the manufacturer attempts deception of the consumer by<br />listing the nutritional values for one serving, whereas, in fact,<br />the values are for half a package. McDougall has lost all credibility<br />for me and I will not be purchasing again. It is offensive to treat<br />consumers in this way.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017U08M2">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Vegan Split Pea Soup, Lower Sodium, 1.9-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)</a>
