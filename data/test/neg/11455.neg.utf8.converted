Green Mountain recently (and inexplicably) discontinued their "Hazelnut Cream" brand. I came here hoping to pick some up, and ordered two cases. Much to my surprise, what was delivered was not "Hazelnut Cream" -- which other reviewers have noted is the best of all flavors -- but just plain "Hazelnut," which tastes like a mix of liquified dirt and bitters.<br /><br />In short, do not expect Hazelnut Cream -- you will be getting "Hazelnut," which tastes horrendous.
