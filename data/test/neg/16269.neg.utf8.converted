This Kashi cerael is made with non-organic grains(all non-organic grains have fungicide and pesticide residues and some are GMO).The first ingredient after the grains is sugar.Canola oil is a low-grade,cheap GMO oil, plus people with dairy allergies note: it contains nonfat dry milk.I'll stick with organic oatmeal at about 1/10 the price and yummy with chopped fruit and nondairy milk!I'm wondering if the reviews were all written by Kashi employees.
