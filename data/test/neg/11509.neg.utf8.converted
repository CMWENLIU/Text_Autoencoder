Bought this seasoning from a local store and used it tonight on chicken tenders.  I was very disappointed.  There was hardly no spice at all, it was just very salty.  I would have been better off using ground red pepper and some of my own spices to reduce the salt.  When I read the back of the cannister for the ingredients, the first one named was salt.  I doubt if I will use this again for anything.  Way Way toooooo salty....I like more herbs and spices to reduce the amount of salt.
