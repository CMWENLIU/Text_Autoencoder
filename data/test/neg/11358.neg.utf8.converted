I was pretty excited to receive this flavor, as Kahlua is one of my favorite flavors.  Upon making the coffee, my wife walked through the kitchen and asked if a skunk has sprayed outside of the window.  The coffee gives off a VERY strong aroma when brewed.  If you like a strong cup of coffee, this one is for you.  As the earlier poster stated, I didn't get much of the Kahula flavor that I was hoping for.  Not sure if I'll even use up the cups due to the aroma that is created when brewing. Out of all of the flavors I have tried, this is probably the worst.
