Unless this is a misprint, they are charging almost double plus high postage for the same pod tea you can get elsewhere on the net for much, much less. They are charging approx. $41.95 for 48 pods. Elsewhere the pods cost between $9.95-13.95 for 24 pods, plus $7.49 postage. Most other places also waive postage if you buy more than $50,00 worth but this place doesn't. Either this is a misprint and it's $42.00 for four packages of 25 pods each (96 pods) as it is at the cheapest site I found on the net, or this is a massive ripoff. Hope it's the former.
