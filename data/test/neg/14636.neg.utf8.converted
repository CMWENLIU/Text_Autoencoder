I actually liked the taste and texture as they were pleasant.  But I warn you that it's exactly what the ingredients list says: tapioca thickened water and milk with a touch of salmon.  Fishy taste, not much salmon, lots of thickening.  Way too expensive for what you get so I won't repurchase but it's edible so we'll finish it.
