We were thrilled to find that Dark Chocolate Peanut M&Ms were available and happily ordered the 56 oz size.  Unfortunately, that's where our happiness ended.<br /><br />The M&Ms that we received were not in the resealable 56 oz bag, but in three regular 19.2 oz bags.  We received them with other light items, also ordered from Amazon.  The box that the product arrived in was unharmed and undamaged, and so were the other items.  However, the M&Ms had obviously been crushed and melted before being packed.  It was obvious when we picked up one of the M&M bags that the candy inside was all stuck together.<br /><br />Not only was the candy we received not as described in its quantity and packaging, it was not in any acceptable condition.  This is the first bad experience I have had with Amazon.  We will be ordering from Amazon again, but not from Bice Wholesale.
