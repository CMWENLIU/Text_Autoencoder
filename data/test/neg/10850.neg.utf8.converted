I'm very disappointed when the company promised our offices they were a USA company, then I find out that they are actually manufacture in CHINA, and only distributed in the USA. I no longer will buy any Dogswell products.  With so many dogs dying from dog products made in CHINA, it is essential to only buy from USA companies who have a GREAT track record. I no longer will buy dog products that are made in CHINA.<br /><br />Write to the President and Founder of Dogswell,  Marco Giannini
