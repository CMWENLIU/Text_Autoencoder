The Leonidas chocolates being peddled in the USA bear little/no resemblance to those available in Europe. After enjoying Leonidas in Germany (Aachen and Munich) for many years I placed an order here in New York State. What I received was (a) crudely presented boxes of (b) thick, hard-shelled (c) anonymous flavoured cream centres. With the exception of the coffee creams (which were more or less as I remember them from Europe) the rest of the box seemed to consist of two undefinable centres. Extremely disappointed with this order. The Godiva selection my mother received for Christmas was FAR superior in every respect -- packaging, presentation, appearance, texture, taste. I won't buy Leonidas in the USA again.
