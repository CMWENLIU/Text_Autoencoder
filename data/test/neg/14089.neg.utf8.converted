These are truly delightful cookies, but happily they are not addictive because this manufacturer (family owned or not) is pricing themselves right out of existence. In 2005, one could find them for less than $17/12 pack. In June of 2010, I bought them from Amazon for about $32 for a 12 pack. Now (Sept 2010) they are listed here at essentially $60 for the 12 pack. Almost a 4x increase in price in 5 years and doubling in a few months is beyond the pale. They've become a caviar that I will live without.<br /><br />9/10/2010 - to be fair to the company, the huge delta on price is because Amazon no longer carries this item but it is now through a seller. I discovered a local supermarket will provide them at $32.50 for 12. Dare Co is not culpable.
