I was really looking forward to giving the kids at my son's birthday party this ice cream.  The packages arrived quickly, but I could tell the ice cream "bars" were in bits.  I opened one package to take a look and the ice cream was in fact shattered into little pieces.  And the inner packaging was sliced open in two places, possibly by a machine or razor.  It just didn't look right and I didn't feel comfortable serving them to the kids.<br /><br />Now, this is probably not a problem with the seller, but perhaps they want to evaluate their vendor for these products.  I just didn't want anyone else to have this same experience.  Thankfully, Amazon makes returns easy...
