Sticker on invoice: "We care about your satisfaction with our products and service. If you have any concerns or questions about your shipment, please call us toll free at..."<br /><br />Who would think that getting coffee could be so difficult?! We had a problem and it had been arranged that the coffee would be exchanged. They sent a Fed Ex label and off it went. After 2 weeks, a call was placed to check status. Emma (Pres) relayed the shipment would go out immediately and apologized for the delay. Thought it was done...  A few moments later, Anna calls back and goes into some diatribe with my wife not knowing what coffee is.  If the president of the company resolved the issue, why is someone else from the company calling to stir it up?!<br /><br />Another call back to speak with Emma and she apologized for the actions of Anna. The coffee and a "for your trouble" gesture would be sent along that day. They are located cross town about 10 miles away and most shipment are next day...nothing came.<br /><br />A week passed and still nothing. Another call. Emma relays that it should have been taken care of and will call me back next day to confirm. Next day came, went...nothing. We are quite disappointed by this company. They got the $$ and we received empty words.
