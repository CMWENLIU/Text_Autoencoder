I love having Ginger Ale to drink especially when my stomach isn't feeling well so I tried to purchase this and see how I would like it. It was nothing like I imagined it to taste like. It has a real taste to the actual ginger root and I was highly disappointed because it was nothing like what I expected especially with all the positive reviews. So Buyer Beware that this product has that ginger root taste to it. And now I am stuck with the bulk that I purchased, so I'll look into giving it away to friends who may enjoy it.<br /><br />I got this sadly comment back from some bored person:<br />Nowhereman says:<br /><br />Six of your eight reviews are one star. Perhaps it is merely poor judgment in purchasing decision making. Maybe you need to see someone for Postpartum depression. Any attempt at defensive rebuttal might help provide insight into the psychological origins of this hostility and help a professional to diagnose if you need education or treatment. Run, don't walk to caregivers. They can help you sort it out as I am uniquely unqualified to pinpoint the exact nature of the problem. It would not hurt to take English as a second language in either case.<br /><br />My take on your reply to my review: TOO BAD, if you don't like what you read you are free to move on. I don't post reviews for entertainment purposes as you seem to be evaluating and insulting comments posted. Before you judge someone from a petty post of review please keep in mind it does not give you the person's lifestyle nor psychological origins. I work in the medical field so if anyone needs help that is for you to seek, I also have two special needs children so please education does run deep in this household. Keep your comments to yourself. Sadly after what you have posted it's obvious you are in need of some Jesus and the love you lack in life. God Bless!
