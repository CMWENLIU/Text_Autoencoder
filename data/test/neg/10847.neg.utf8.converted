Read the small print you will see the words 'MADE IN CHINA' - Ask yourself the question, would you eat a chicken product from China yourself? Be careful what you give your best friend, he trusts you. Now I am not one to want to hurt a companies products by bad mouthing them but I am not happy that I gave my dog chicken products from China, maybe by accident, I didn't see the small print (and it is VERY small print), as yourself the question too, if they made the words 'Made in China' bigger and on the front, would anyone buy this? If I am proven to be wrong I will be fair and remove this review but my Vitality chicken strips have the words 'MADE IN CHINA' in tiny print on the back.
