I AM NOT A ROSEWATER EXPERT BUT I MUST SAY COMPARED TO THE OTHER ALL NATURAL ROSEWATER THAT I BOUGHT THIS ONE PALES BY COMPARISON. IT HARLDY HAS A SCENT AT ALL AND TASTES LIKE TAPWATER WITH BARELY A HINT OF ROSES [IF ANY, IT COULD HAVE BEEN MY IMAGINATION SINCE I WAS EXPECTING A SCENT AFTER ALL]. OF ALL THE INFO THAT I'VE READ ABOUT ROSEWATER AND ABOUT HOW IT SHOULD SMELL THIS ONE DOES NOT MAKE THE GRADE. PRODUCER SHOULD RECONSIDER THE PERCENTAGE OF ROSEWATER TO DISTILLED WATER. VERY VERY DISSAPOINTED.
