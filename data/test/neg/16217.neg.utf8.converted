I've been very happy with Coffee Bean Direct, which is why I'm so disappointed by the poor quality of this blend, which I only bought because my usual blend (Nicaraguan Shade-grown) was out of stock.  Upon opening the bag, there was hardly any aroma at all, and the taste is bland. I've had other brands of Sumatra, which is normally a stronger coffee, but this was just awful... like the brown water that diners try to pass off as coffee.
