Sells sells individual cans for $4ish so I thought I was getting a great bargain for a case of 24.  Came out to about $1 a can and $1 a can is all they are worth.  The taste is too livery and dark in color.  They tasted ok but nothing to rave about.  Tried only 1 can.  I'm going to donate the rest.
