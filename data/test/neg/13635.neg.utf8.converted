Rev. Sylvester Graham created the original Graham crackers as part of a diet based on the theory "that one could curb one's sexual appetite by eating bland foods." [Wikipedia; "Graham cracker" accessed 21 MAR 2011].<br /><br />These crackers are true to the spirit of Rev. Graham's intent.  They are devoid of flavor, and possess the texture of the most delicate particle board.  While nutritious in the strictest sense, there is a surprising amount of salt (130mg or 5% of the "daily value" per 28 grams of cracker).  While not noticably salty, it baffles me why they bothered to add salt when they had clearly passed on any other flavor.<br /><br />And eating even one suppressed any urge to take pleasure in life.<br /><br />Don't bother, unless these are going to be used as some form of punishment.<br /><br />E.
