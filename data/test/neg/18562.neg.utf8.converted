I spent days trying to find decent coconut water/juice in order to make shakes, and since I'm a health nut, I try to control my sugar intake. Every coconut water product I looked at is full of sugar, and this brand is no different. An amazing 29 grams of sugar per can. Also, this product is only 70% juice! What's the other 30 percent? An average can of soda contains 30 grams, for comparison. I know they make unsweetened coconut water, but I can't find it. Why in the world do manufactures feel the need to sweeten things that are already fine and sweet? Alright, maybe a little sugar, but 29grams? I'm drinking this because I care about my health and don't want to drink soda! Leave it to them to take something perfect the way it is, and make it just as bad as soda! Don't wonder why they don't post this nutritional information on the product page; they don't want you to know it.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a decent enough product if you don't care about unnecessary sugar intake. Very sweet, but these manufacturers don't understand that you don't need to add so much sugar to a naturally sweet product! There IS a market for unsweetened coconut water, guys.
