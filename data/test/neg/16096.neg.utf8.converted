The product in and of itself is great.  The chicken bouillon has great flavor and works well in recipes.  But, I called the manufacturer of this product today (Nestle USA) and they told me that they do not have halal certification for this product here in the United States.  Therefore, it is not halal.  The man told me that they do sell a milk product called Milo, which can be found here in the US as halal.  But, this product is not halal.  I just wanted to write this review because the message behind it is so important for my Muslim brothers and sisters out there.
