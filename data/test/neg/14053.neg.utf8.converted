I have had this product a few times before, as well as, the Calm (which tasted the same but carbonated).<br />The last time I had this, I went to sleep and woke up at 2am with heartburn worse than I have ever encounted (I dont have heartburn EVER and actually had to decipher whether it was a heart attack or heartburn) and also very bad diarrhea. The first time I tried Trim, it made my stomach kind of gurgly but thankfully not as bad as last night!! I am sure it worked to loose weight though...Buyer beware if you have a sensitive stomach!
