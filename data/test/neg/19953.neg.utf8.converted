First of all, let me say that I have been using whey low exclusively in my iced tea, and have totally replaced sugar in my kitchen with this product for several years.  I thought is was great, and I can say that of it tastes indistiguishable from sugar.  However, a few weeks ago my 12 year old son was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.  We are supposed to count carbs in order to figure out how much insulin to give at each meal.  When we used the effective carb count that the whey low product states on its packaging to figure carbs, his blood sugar shot up immediately.  We have tried it several times with the same result.  I have to conclude that this product is making false claims about effective carbs and being a low carb product.  I won't be buying anymore.  Sorry it took me so long to find out.  It's probably why I couldn't lose weight even though I thought I was counting carbs all this time.
