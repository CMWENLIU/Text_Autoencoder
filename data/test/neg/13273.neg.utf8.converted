Today, I discovered that the Wellness company (Wellpet) was recently acquired by Berwind [...], an investment management company with a portfolio primarily consisting of coal mining and chemical corporations. My personal beliefs are very much centered around conservation, the environment, and supporting clean and sustainable energy industries so to find this news out is quite a blow. I actively try my best to avoid supporting the dirty industries of this world, therefore I'll no longer be buying Wellness products as difficult as it may be:<br /><br />For the last 6 years I have fed my cats Wellness dry & wet cat food with excellent results.  Last year, my cat Isaac passed away. He was a special needs cat since a kitten and as an adult cat, many vets told me repeatedly that I should probably put him to sleep due to his condition (various over the years: arthritis, megacolon, leg paralysis, neurological issues, & urinary tract infections). Isaac wasn't supposed to live past 16 years old but thanks to a Wellness diet and lots of love, he lived to the old age of 22.
