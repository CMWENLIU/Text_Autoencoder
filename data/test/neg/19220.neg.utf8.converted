Given that I have received orders from Carter and Holmes in the past, I was surprised and unimpressed with this order. C and H when ordered from directly has extraordinary packaging methods,the items arriving in stellar condition. This little orchid was in terrible shape; had root rot and required immediate help. The packaging appeared to be hastily done with the seedling just rolled up in some newspaper.<br /><br />That said, I am experienced with orchids and have saved this plant and it is doing well. My reason for going through Amazon was to receive the particular Phalaenopsis I wanted that was no longer available on the Carter and Holmes site but was listed as available on Amazon. I shall have to hope it is really what I wanted.<br /><br />Secondly, the shipping fee is less than if you order from Carter and Holmes and I was curious to see the comparison. After this experiment, I would highly recommend one order directly from the vendor and spend the extra money. Sorry to have to give this negative review, but it is the truth.
