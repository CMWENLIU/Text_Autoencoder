These dog treats sounded so wonderful.  Didn't know they were made in China!  Wrote email to SmartBones and they assured me the product is safe. I will never trust animal products made in China.  So many products for dogs are made there. My dog hasn't gotten sick from the bones.  I suppose each consumer must make the choice for their own animals.  I looked for the Smartbones on several sites and didn't see China on the ads.  Seems like homemade might be better.  There is nothing like made in the USA.
