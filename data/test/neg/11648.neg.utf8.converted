I really like the normal Donut House coffee K-Cups, and as a chocolate-lover I was excited to try the Chocolate Glazed Donut version.<br /><br />It is simply the worst coffee I've ever had.  The chocolate flavor comes from that fake liquid-based cocoa alcohol flavoring, and it overpowers the coffee and leaves an aftertaste that lingers for hours.<br /><br />I do not recommend this flavor in any way, unless you like alcohol in your coffee -- in which case, I'd still recommend adding a little of the real thing to the normally great Coffee House coffee that Green Mountain is known for!
