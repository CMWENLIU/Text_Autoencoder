Little over priced for what it is. The lights are way too bright, so if you do not have a room to put it in, you will get a headache from the light. Where they show it sitting in a kitchen, I believe it to be very impractical.<br />I haven't had mine long enough yet to get any product from it, but the plants are growing nicely.
