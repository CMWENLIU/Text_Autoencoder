I purchased this oil for sauteeing. It worked great at first but when I got to the middle of the jar I found a plastic film that is apparently mixed in with the oil. I will no longer be using this for cooking, and as the return window has expired, I will likely be using it only for my skin as a moisturizer. Horrible product, buyer beware.
