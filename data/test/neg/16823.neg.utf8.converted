Here's the email I sent to the company after I read that it contains soy lecithin: I talked with your representative on the phone who was unable to tell me if the soy lecithin in your hazelnut dark chocolate and almonds is from GMO soy.  Since 93% of all soy is genetically modified, I'm assuming that it is a GMO.  GMOs (genetically modified organisms) have never been tested for safety in humans.  In animal studies, they have been shown to cause organ damage and infertility.  Monsanto, one of the companies that produce GMO seeds, infiltrated the government to get approval for it's products.  GMOs have been banned in many European countries.  Most soy, corn, canola, zucchini, breakneck squash and Hawaiian papaya are GMOs. Organic products cannot be genetically modified.  I've returned many items, when I found soy in the product or lecithin.  I couldn't read the label on your product on Amazon, so I didn't realize that it contains soy lecithin.  Lecithin can also be made from sunflower seeds, so it is possible to have healthy lecithin.  Please let me know what you find out about the soy lecithin in your chocolate.
