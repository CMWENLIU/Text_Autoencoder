THE DESCRIPTION ON THE PRODUCT WAS 24/1.5 OZ BAGS. I THOUGHT THIS MEANT I WOULD GET A QUANTITY OF 24 BAGS OF M&M'S. IMAGINE MY SUPRISE TODAY WHEN I OPENED THE PACKAGE I PAID FOR TO FIND ONE BAG,YES ONE BAG!!!!OF MNMS. I AM VERY VERY UNHAPPY. YOU NEED TO SPECIFY THAT THIS WAS FOR ONE BAG OF MNMS. THIS IS HIGHWAY ROBBERY AND I WILL BE CONTACTING THE SELLER. RIDICULOUS!!!!
