Even though there is a statement right on the front of these packages of gum that claims "Gluten Free", I don't believe this gum really is.  I bought a pack of Peppermint from the health food store that my daughter and I both chewed (we are GF/Celiac) and we BOTH reacted to this gum.  We both tried it again a few days later, thinking perhaps it was something else we had eaten, considering this gum says Gluten Free right on the front.  The reaction was WORSE the second time around!!!  This company sources their Xylitol from China, and almost all the companies I looked at online that you can purchase Xylitol from also make lots of Wheat Gluten----so I am assuming some sort of cross contamination at the source of production in China, for which this Spry company does not test for!  They are obviously just assuming that the product is 'naturally' gluten free and taking unreliable China's word for it----at the expense of customers with Celiac disease who get sick from this product.  Very disappointed.
