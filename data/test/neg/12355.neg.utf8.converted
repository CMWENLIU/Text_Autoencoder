Total disaster.  I ordered two boxes of Land O' Lakes creamers and both boxes contained many erupted creamers.  Since I live at an APO address, it was not worth the postage to send the creamers back. I ended up washing the survivors in a strainer and used them.  I guess you can imaging the foul smell.  Poor packaging.
