I received this product as a gift.  I was so excited to use it.  However, I'm sadly disappointed with this product.  The puree is very weak!  It takes far too long to blend the products, having to stop many times to stir the contents because it doesn't blend evenly.  The only nice feature is the clean-up--only one bowl to wash.  This is totally overpriced.  I wouldn't even buy it if it were under $20.  Save the money and use a blender.
