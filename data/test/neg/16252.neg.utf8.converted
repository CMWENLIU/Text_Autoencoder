I was so excited to finally find this in a store near me.  I ran in, paid my $6.99 for a pint and dug in with a spoon while sitting in the car.  All I can say is I was seriously disappointed.  This is chocolate flavored water ice.  The chocolate flavor isn't enough to satisfy any type of chocolate craving.  Even at 32 calories a serving I thought it was a waste of the calories. I had a few bites then put it down to try and let it melt to get a little more flavor. It wasn't any better.  I pitched this in the garbage, having probably eaten only a dollar of my seven dollars.  Here is what I learned from this experience: if it sounds to good to be true, it probably is. Don't waste your time or your money.
