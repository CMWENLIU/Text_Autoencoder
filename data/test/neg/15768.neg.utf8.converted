.. But she clearly isn't an ambassador of taste. I really wanted to like this tea, and had every reason to believe I would: it's organic, and organic foods tend, in the main, to taste better. The ambassador line of tea touts itself as "biodynamic" (a marketing term for sustainably produced) and is fair trade certified, which is wonderful. Sadly, it tastes slightly less good than, say, a dustbin of sweepings from a woodshop floor. As a connoisseur of tea, I have tasted somewhere in the vicinity of 4 or 500 varietals, and can't think of a single one more flavorless than this one. Into the compost pile goes this $20 worth of tea. Don't suffer for a good cause: buy another brand of tea, and if Moseley's mission is important to you, just donate directly.
