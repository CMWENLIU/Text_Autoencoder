This is good cocoa, but you'd almost have better luck just opening the K-cup and stirring it in. I have found that if I make it as per the box directions, I'll have about 1/4 of the cocoa still inside the cup.<br /><br />Also, you do not want to do this on the large cup size - it will be so diluted that will not want to drink it. I make it using the middle sized cup and use 2 k-cups.<br /><br />I got this on sale for $7, so it wasn't too bad of a price, but I think in the future I will just stick to buying a container of hot cocoa.
