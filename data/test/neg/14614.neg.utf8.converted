I ordered the pictured product of York Peppermint Patties that showed the candy wrapped individually, in the round.  The TWO packages I ordered came packaged with the mints wrapped in the new individual envelope packaging.  I spent MUCH MORE than I had wanted and then didn't get the product I ordered.
