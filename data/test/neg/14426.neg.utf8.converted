I was not aware of country of origin when I ordered this.  I avoid all China goods due to their use of dangerous poisons in many products.  Amazon does not allow returns of groceries or I would sendt it back.  Claims to meet USDA guidelines for organic foods but how can that be believed with China's recent history of poisonous products.
