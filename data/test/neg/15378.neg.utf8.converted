Others may love this k cup but I found it way too bitter.  I have to admit I don't drink that much bold coffee but have had a chance to try a few others and don't care for this one.  My Keurig only has the 8oz capacity and I took a cue from other users and run the bold k cups through twice to make 12 to 16 ounces depending on the type coffee.  Well even if I run this through twice at a total of 16 oz it is still too bitter... just not my k cup of coffee I guess but I do like Donut Shop and Newman's Own Extra Bold.
