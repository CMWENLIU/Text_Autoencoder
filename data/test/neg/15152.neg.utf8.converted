I love Vita Coco and I like Rihanna but this flavor is just terrible. I like all of the other Vita Coco flavors except this one. When I first tasted it, I immediately checked the expiration date to make sure it did not go bad. Then I tried a few more hoping I will eventually like it and convince myself that Vita Coco can't possibly be this bad. But in the end I came across a bottle that just had a very foul taste so I decided to throw all of the remaining drinks away.
