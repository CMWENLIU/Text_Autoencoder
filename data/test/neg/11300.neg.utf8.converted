These are not the clusters you may have been used to.  They would more appropriately be called oat clusters because the good old honey nut clusters are no more.  Set your expectations and they may be a suitable replacement.  The texture of the clusters is very different and the taste is slightly different.  The flakes taste more of fiber than I remember, but that may or may not be the case.
