yes it is tea of some sort, who know what sort of tea, but numbness??? where??? I made a pot with 8 teabags, very strong, thinking to approach with caution, well after the whole pot of tea, nothing stimulating, nothing numbing in the least,(if you want numbing try kava kava tincture) no nothing!!! I am very sensitive to stimulants and this does not have any of that sort of effect, really a drag, don't know what they sold me, but not the real thing, I have been to Peru, I know what the effects  are suppose to be, what a let down....
