This would have been a nice gift if it had been packaged properly.  The candy is just dumped in a box that is not sealed in anyway.  I placed the box, which was still in the Amazon box, away for wrapping and within one day the ants had found it (and ants have never been in this area before)and were all inside the candy box.  Just a warning to anyone that orders this product, when delivered make sure that you bring it in immediately, open the box and seal all the candy in plastic bags for safe keeping till time to give the gift.  I just assumed that since it was a food item that it would be packaged properly.
