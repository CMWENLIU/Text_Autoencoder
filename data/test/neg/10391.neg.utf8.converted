If you are looking for a substitute for the discontinued Kraft hot drink mix Postum, Pero doesn't taste much like Postum.  Postum had a much smoother, slightly sweet taste.  Pero has a  bitter flavor, which to me tastes like stale coffee.  If you are a coffee drinker and want to cut down on caffeine, a good decaf coffee tastes much better than Pero.<br /><br />By the way, Postum was made from from wheat bran, wheat, molasses, and maltodextrin made from from corn.  The ingredients of Pero are malted barley, barley, and chicory; so it is quite different.
