I love tuna. I eat a LOT of tuna. I hate this stuff, and I'm not really *that* picky.<br /><br />No texture, or more accurately, almost the texture of wet cat food. Speaking of cat food, thats about what this looks like.  Taste? no. Or perhaps stale, formless food substance.<br /><br />I've tried a few cans from various places in the pack, all the same. This is the worst tuna i have ever had.
