I expected a cheese wheel labeled "Wisconsin" to taste somewhat good however it was a strange dark orange color, did not taste good and the rind stained my cutting board. I did not want to waste food and throw it in the trash so I put it in the refrigerator however due to the taste, that is precisely where it ended up.
