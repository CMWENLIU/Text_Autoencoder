Just a warning....these chips are Not gluten free as they claim to be.  They clearly state on the back of the<br />package that they are manufactured  in a facility with wheat. After I snacked on the Nut chips, I did not feel<br />well for several days, since I'm gluten intolerant.  [[ASIN:B004T7YLBO Blue Diamond Nut Chips, Nacho,<br />4.25-Ounce (Pack of 6)]]
