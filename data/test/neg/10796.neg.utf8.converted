OK to good flavor. Better deal than the rest they sell on Amazon mostly because you get a full 16+ ounces.  Flavor? I'm spoiled because I used to catch and smoke my own but still good. The more I eat the better I like it.<br /><br />I might not find a better value, all considered I'll buy more of this unless I can find better product/value.<br /><br />UPDATE! UPDATE:<br />I ordered this brand again, this time I looked for the expiration date.  I looked very carefully both on the box and on the sealed gold package.  As I have ordered almost every brand Amazon sells and they ALL have a expiration date ranging from 2013 - 2016 but NO DATE on this one.  I was going to sign up for a subscription,  NO WAY now.<br />It doesn't taste like it's 10 years old but who knows?
