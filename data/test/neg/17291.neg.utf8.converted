I use Truvia, the best tasting sweetener I've ever tried.<br />Reading the reviews (suspicious), I decided to try SweetLeaf.<br />What a disappointment! The after taste is worse than Equal or Sweet&Low.<br />Bad, bad, bad!<br /><br />Thanks to the great customer service from amazon.com, I was able to get a refund.
