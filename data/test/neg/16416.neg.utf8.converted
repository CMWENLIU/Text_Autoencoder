This product is packed with sugar - this was not clear on Amazon - I will not be using it and as it is a foodstuff, I cannot return it, even unopened.  BTW the label was damaged and not even the same as in the illustration.<br /><br />In common with most organic consumers, I choose organic as a healthy as well as a more ecological option.  So why do so many organic food producers use so much sugar.  It may be organic sugar but it is still sugar and it is not healthy. Please food producers, use something low-glycemic if you need to add a sweetener, there is no excuse now with the availability of Agave flakes, xylitol or even stevia.
