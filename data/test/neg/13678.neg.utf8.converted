I enjoy the Nature's Hollow jam/preserves so much--am having some right now between typing, the blueberry over Fage yogurt, and it's so good--that I figured I'd give the sugar-free syrup a try.<br /><br />Um. Not so great. I made high protein waffles and I usually use either natural applesauce, a homemade berry compote, or Smucker's sugar free breakfast syrup on these babies. Today, I chopped up strawberries and used this syrup. So disappointing. The flavor is slight,slight. A hint of mapleness. The sweetness is okay. The texture is watery.<br /><br />Now, I can live with a ightweight, watery texture if you pump up the flavor. :) But this one, not so much. For now, I'll stick to my Smucker's sugar-free (though it's not perfect, it's been the tastiest fake maple syrup that has a genuine thick consistency). Or, occasionally, I just cave and have real maple syrup. (I'm not on a low-carb diet, I just try to avoid sugar when possible.)<br /><br />I think this may serve better to use in fruit mixtures to then top waffles or pancakes or to flavor plain oatmeal. This syrup will sweeten stuff up with a light maple flavor, and while it was kind of a fail on my waffles, I can see that this might work better to flavor my slow-cooked oatmeal. That's why this gets 2 stars instead of 1 star: Whilte it failed for me as a good syrup for pancakes and waffles, I suspect it will be good as a maple flavoring agent. And this one is way better than the Maple Grove Farms one and the DaVinci one. For low-carbers, worth trying, even if not very satisfying substitute for the real thing.<br /><br />I hope Nature's Hollow reformulates the syrup adding more maple flavor and thickening it up a bit. I'd retry their product if they did.
