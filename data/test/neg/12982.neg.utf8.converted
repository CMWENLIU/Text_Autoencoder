I'm certainly no expert on the anatomy of cows. Nor are my dogs. But everyone noticed when suddenly our long-time favorites, Cadet's Beef Tendons, definitely changed. For the worse. We don't buy them anymore - whatever they are now.<br /><br />For over a year, I would order a new 1 pound bag about every six weeks. We have a Papillion-mix and two purebred Dachshunds, who are insanely hardworking chewers. Obsessive, possessive, and picky, too. Well, with those three and the frequent visits of the extended family's dogs, those tendons were hugely popular and went fast.<br /><br />Like I said, I'm no expert, but I can describe what we used to get: long, thick, chewy but tough, slightly moist, meaty, rope-like things, with occasional shapes that definitely resembled my limited understanding of tendons. I even have some experience with beef shin tendons, having also frequently purchased Butcher's Block "Grand Royale" beef shins for my girls. Those came complete with the tendons, which I carefully remove with a knife to create two treats out of one.<br /><br />So a few months ago, the much-anticipated regular delivery of "tendons" arrived, we were stumped to find flat, dry slabs with sharp edges that look like old jerky. They look NOTHING like the old beef tendons. And my dogs completely ignored them. I though it was a fluke. After two more orders of the same things, I gave up.<br /><br />I can't say what part of the cow the "new" "beef tendons" are, but I can say that my dogs can't stand whatever they are now, and we no longer purchase anything from Cadet.<br /><br />I'm awfully disappointed - those original tendons would keep my frauleins happy and distracted from picking fights with the mademoiselle for hours. So far, we've found nothing nearly as good.<br /><br />TL;DR BREAKDOWN:<br /><br />Product went from:<br /><br />- Thick, meaty, chewy, semi-moist, ropey, treats my dogs chewed for hours, even days<br /><br />to<br /><br />- flat, stringy, sharp-edged, dried-out slabs that look nothing like the previous treats, and my dogs won't touch 'em<br /><br />What happened?<br /><br /> For a pretty good replacement I recommend Butcher's Block "Grand Royale" real beef shins for dogs, but do be a wise consumer and price-check, for you might be amazed at the difference between vendors. Also, fyi, they're messier and more . . . livestock-like, but if your dogs loved the old Cadet tendons, they'll probably like the Grand Royale. Mine do. But we miss the easy-peasy big bag of Cadet tendons. :(<br /><br />If they change back, somebody please let me know!!
