I wished I had seen the entire ingredient listed here before I purchased these treats.  I try to avoid dog treats that have corn glutin, soy, corn syrup etc. These treats have it all. I am very disappointed. I thought they would be true jerky, but they are junk. It's crappy treats like these that cause our pets teeth to rot and to put on too much weight!!  I don't know if I feel comfortable to even give these to less fortunate animals!
