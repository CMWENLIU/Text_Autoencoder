My box of Skybars arrived from UPS in a pristine box. Inside it looked as if someone had stomped the box with a boot. Everything was scattered and in some cases torn up. I have reported this to Amazon, but so far have received no reply. This is the first time ordering from Amazon that I have had a problem.<br /><br />This will not keep me from using Amazon since this the first transaction to be unsatisfactory. But I wish Amazon would address this problem more quickly.
