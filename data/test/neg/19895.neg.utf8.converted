Made the big mistake of buying Meow-Mix.<br /><br />Cat vomited (as all cats sometimes due) after eating Meow-Mix. Unfortunately the cat vomited on carpet. Usually unfortunate but no big deal - just clean it up. WRONG! Meow-Mix has red food dyes that will not come out - even if you start cleaning right after the event. We have tried three different cleaners and a carpet machine. We still have two big red/pink stains in the carpet.<br /><br />I called the MeowMix customer service number and asked for some help on how to clean their red dye out of the carpeting. They told me to use a carpet cleaner - Really? Wow. Insightful.<br /><br />I asked them why they put in apparently un-cleanable red dye in the cat food when they know cats are virtually color blind (for reds apparently) and when the cat pukes it is going to ruin their customers carpet. They said market research indicated the human buyers prefer to see a red, meaty, color and their was nothing they could do about it.<br /><br />Yeah, how about not putting the red dye in or using another red dye?<br /><br />Through almost and entire 25lb bag of MeowMix out in the trash and purchased Iams which is no issue to clean up.<br /><br />Thanks for reading. Don't buy MeowMix unless you live outdoors  .
