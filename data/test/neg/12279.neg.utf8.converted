This is very gross tasting! I made cookies with this as the only substitute in my normal recipe (trying to make them more healthy), and they looked perfect, and the texture wasn't too bad (a little crumbly, maybe I should have added an extra egg or added a little more xantham gum), BUT the aftertaste made them just about inedible to me. My boyfriend thought they were ok (not great, but ok), but I think he was just being nice. I baked a small test batch and threw the rest of the dough out, they were that nasty.<br /><br />Some people seem to love it, based on these reviews here. I'm trying to go all gluten-free for health reasons, but I'll keep searching for a good all-purpose flour mix that's gluten-free and doesn't taste like beans for when we want the occasional baked treat. I think Pamela's is made without the beans. This particular mix is not a winner in my opinion.
