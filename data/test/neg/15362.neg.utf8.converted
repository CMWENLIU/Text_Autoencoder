What I got was 6 flimsy cardboard containers of buttermilk shrink-wrapped and no bubblewrap in between box and item, resulting in a total mess of powdered buttermilk everywhere inside the shrink-wrap. 3 of the 6 buttermilk containers were dented  and two of them had the lids off when I got it. Buttermilk powder was everywhere. How do I get a refund or the items sent in cans as the description read? This item is not shippable in flimsy cardboard containers. It must be mailed in cans. That is what I was expecting!!!!!
