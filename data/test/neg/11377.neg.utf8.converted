Wow this is truly horrible. The cereal taste like the cardboard box it is in, chemically, and it becomes almost instantly soggy after adding the milk creating this slimy texture. After chewing it, it does get stuck in your back teeth which is also annoying so it is definitely not on my to buy list. Contrary to their picture on the box, it is not filled, but rather a thin line of chocolate is drizzled inside. What are they thinking? Did they not have anyone in their facility try it out before mass producing it? NOT RECOMMENDED
