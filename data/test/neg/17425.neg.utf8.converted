My girlfriend and I picked up a box of these from Costco, and had high hopes that they'd be delicious, natural crackers.  We are very open-minded about natural foods and most of the stuff we eat is very healthy and natural.  Well these crackers just taste burnt and bitter; they have the right ingredients, but the flavor just doesn't work.  We have previously bought, and still buy, the Crunchmaster Multigrain Crackers <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YJBLMM">Crunchmaster Multi-Grain Crackers Gluten Free 20 oz.</a>, and have found them to be the BEST natural, gluten-free, multigrain crackers on the market.  We're going to stick with the Crunchmaster crackers, they have a fantastic flavor, are very healthy, and go with everything great (cheese, dips, peanut butter, you name it).<br /><br />Another reviewer here noted that these taste like "burnt birdseed"; couldn't agree more, they were a huge disappointment. If you do decide to try these crackers, be sure to buy a very small box, then you won't feel as ripped off when you realize they are borderline inedible.
