I'm not very happy with this coffee.  It is bitter and astringent, and the aroma is odd. The aroma is harsh and smells of bitter citrus.  I got this coffee to try as a replacement for the exorbitantly overpriced Starbucks VIA Ready-brew instant coffee. The Nescafe is not nearly as good as the Starbucks instant coffee unfortunately. The Starbucks VIA is smooth, has a pleasing aroma, and tastes pretty similar to Starbucks drip coffee. It also dissolves easier than Nescafe, since it is a finely ground powder instead of crystals.<br /><br />I recommend avoiding this coffee or trying the Original blend instead of Gourmet roast. Also, regarding the other reviewers who said this coffee is not available in local stores, their reviews may be outdated or they live in weird places. This coffee is available in most of my local grocery stores.
