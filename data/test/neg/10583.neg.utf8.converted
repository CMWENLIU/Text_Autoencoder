I bought a case of these for my granddaughter at college. After I ordered, I told my wife what I had done. She informed me that these sell for $0.36/ea at Wal-Mart. This price was $0.63/ea.<br /><br />Okay, dear, I'm a dweeb. Should've asked you first.<br /><br />Save your money folks. Shop local on this one.
