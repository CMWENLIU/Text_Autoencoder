I purchased one pound of Now brand stevia extract for $63.61. The overly large container is labeled "Better Stevia" "Certified Organic". Ingredient:Organic Stevia Extract Powder. I found I needed to use at least five times more stevia powder to get a similar sweetness as the Kal brand. I returned it for a refund.<br />Avoid this. Buy:[[ASIN:B000VRSR84 Pure Stevia Extract Powder - 3.5 oz - Powder]
