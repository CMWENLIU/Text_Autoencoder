I received these two 50 piece bags of Reese's Snack Assortments a few days ago and I was VERY disappointed.  They are all smashed up, crushed, crumbled basically obliterated.  AND there's NO ASSORTMENT to speak of, both bags consisted primarily of OLD, busted up Reese's cups, with a few Reeses's Pieces & Reeses's Fastbreak bars intermingled.  The ONLY edible product were the 6-8 Reese's Pieces mini bags, the Fastbreak bars were "DUST" & the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were covered with a whitish powdery film, (this happens when candy/chocolate is "OLD" and/or out-lived it shelf-life!)  DON'T waste your money, it's bargain priced for a reason, it's OLD, CRUMBLED, and tastes TERRIBLE!
