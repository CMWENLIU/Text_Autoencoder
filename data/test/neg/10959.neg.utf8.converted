I had such high hopes for these but, as another reviewer noted, they taste no different than store-bought maraschino cherries.  As an added bonus for the store-bought variety, you don't have to wait very long to enjoy them, whereas these will take a couple of days to be processed and even more time before they arrive at your door.
