When my Keurig Platinum finally wore out, I reasoned that a "commercial" unit might be a good long-lasting replacement. I used some of my Keurig loyalty points and bought an OfficePro direct from Keurig at half price. From the start brewing was LOUD. I mean like starting a blender or bean grinder loud.We have a fairly large house and it could be heard in the upstairs closet, as far away from the brewer as you can be and still be in the house.I called Keurig, and a tech listened to the machine over the phone. She agreed it was the loudest coffee maker she'd ever heard, but after a conversation w / a supervisor told me that the machine was performing as designed. Since I was within the 30 day window, I returned the machine and replaced it with an Elite model. Keurig was good about the whole thing, even sending me coupons for enough k-cups to offset the return shipping. I suggested that they make a note in the product description about the above-average sound level, but I doubt that happened.<br />  If you're planning to use this machine in an environment that is naturally loud, it might be a fit, but in any kind of a situation where a normal level of sound is expected, the OfficePro, while producing a good cup of coffee in a timely manner, is, IMHO way too noisy.
