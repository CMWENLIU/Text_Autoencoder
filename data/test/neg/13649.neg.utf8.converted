We were unhappy with the food our breeder used. High percentage of corn. After reading lots of labels, in theory this seemed to be just what we were looking for. We went through a careful, slow transition, but this turned out to be way too harsh on our Havanese's GI tract. He ate it just fine, but we would see a progression to larger and more greenish stool, then loss of form until he had a true liquid event. That was the end of that!<br /><br />For anyone with a toy breed, if you would like another option, we eventually transitioned over to Wellness Small Breed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AN2PUE">Wellness Super5Mix Adult Health Small Breed Formula Dry Dog Food</a> . This turned out to be both a food he loves and the transition was effortless. He is behaving very puppy-like @ 3 years old which I feel is a good thing. The Wellness  food brand was never part of the 2007 animal food recall list for melamine (rice gluten) and is corn, soy and wheat free.
