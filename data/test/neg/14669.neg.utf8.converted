I'm surprised to be in the minority on this, but the Vanilla flavor of VIA is just too sweet.  It tastes like liquefied marshmallows.  I couldn't even finish the first cup, and I also gave one to a colleague with the suggestion to add a little extra water and maybe a little milk to dilute the shock of syrupy coffee, but she couldn't finish hers either.  I love a Vanilla Latte made at Starbucks, and am also a fan of the Vanilla brewed coffee, but I wouldn't purchase the VIA (at least the vanilla flavor) again, and I gave away the remaining 4 packs. I am still on the lookout for an excellent instant coffee, so if I try any more flavors, I'll update this review.<br /><br />Update:  Also sampled the Carmel flavor which unfortunately I also find overbearingly sweet.  What a bummer.
