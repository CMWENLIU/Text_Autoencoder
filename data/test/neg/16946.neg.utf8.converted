Concerned by the relatively high price, but loving dark chocolate covered coffee beans, I ordered 1 pound. Not only was the product high in price, but the shipping was top dollar. Many of the chocolate drops did not contain coffee beans and the taste was strictly mediocre compared tp pther available products. The package is cheap, not resealable and difficult to seal at all. Finally, the company is not very responsive and took 11 to 12 days to ship the product after they had the order. The deficiencies are in this product and not with Amazon!!!!!
