Celsius drinks claim to be "negative-caloric", which is to say that you actually burn calories by drinking it.  Hmmm. . . Sound too good to be true?  Well, of course it is.  It's low-calorie because it's made with Sucralose (Splenda to the average consumer) and it promotes weight loss because its a combination stimulant (taurine) and diuretic - so basically, it works on your body like any over-the-counter diet pill.  That said, the Raspberry Acai flavor does taste pretty good, but it will be up to the individual to decide whether or not any potential benefit justifies the downside.<br /><br />Unlike many other reviewers, I actually liked the taste - I thought that it was a smooth blend of green tea and berry flavor.  However, there is just enough of that artificial tang at the end to tip you off that it's sweetened with Splenda.  But the absence of any fizz or overly harsh flavors made it easy to drink - which is good because it comes in full-size cans and leaves you feeling pretty full (i.e. just shy of bloated) afterward.<br /><br />So is it any energy drink or a diet aid?  It's a little of both.  Most of the crucial ingredients are lumped together into a single line item (i.e. their secret, proprietary mix), but taurine is listed and the caffeine content is obvious.  I found that while Celsius could beat back an afternoon energy swoon, it didn't really make me any more alert or focused - just instantly awake, albeit in semi-zombie form.  This effect came on quickly and did last for a couple of hours at least.<br /><br />Now for the bad news - the "crash" effect that a lot of these drinks try to pin on their competitors was overwhelming with Celsius.  As a little bit of background, I'm a grown adult in good health and am very caffeine-tolerant.  However, during my testing of this product, I made the mistake of drinking two cans about three hours apart and ended up unable avoid my first all-nighter since college.  I was completely awake and pretty functional throughout, although I wouldn't have operated any heavy machinery at the time.  But by the morning, I was suffering headaches, muscle twitches and even a flutter in my chest.  I'm completely sure that this was all temporary side effects of the outrageous amount of stimulants and not permanently harmful, but it was still enough to make me wary from that point on.<br /><br />So, the bottom line is this - if you're looking to occasionally avoid getting sleepy mid-afternoon at the office, or if you need to stay up late once in a while, Celsius may be an option for you to try.  As a prolonged weight-loss regimen, I wouldn't take on the potential health risks in order to grab at some too-good-to-be-true advertising come-on.  There's still only one way to lost weight and keep it off, and it ain't fun and it ain't quick, but it works:  eat better, eat less and exercise more!
