I'm baffled by the good reviews here.  It does taste gluten free, but it's GROSS.  It has no flavor, but it's full of cholesterol and sodium.  Not sure how that happens, but I couldn't even get my kids to eat this.  If you're used to flavorful food, skip this or plan on adding additional flavoring.
