Please be careful when choosing this food.<br /><br />My dog, a Lhasa Apso, pooped out blood with her stool when I gave her this food which was contaminated with Salmonella. We took her to the Vet and she became very lethargic for 2 weeks after the incident. The entire ordeal was a nightmare.<br /><br />I sent it my receipt with the production UPC code to the company for a refund over a month ago and have not received any acknowledgement from them.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />PLEASE VISIT DIAMONDPETRECALL.COM FOR MORE INFORMATION AND UPDATES.<br /><br />05/04/12<br /><br />Diamond Pet Foods, manufacturer of Taste of the Wild Pet Food, has issued a voluntary recall of limited batches of their dry pet food formulas manufactured between December 9, 2011, and April 7, 2012 due to Salmonella concerns.
