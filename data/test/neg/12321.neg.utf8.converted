Dog owners beware!  Although most dogs like these treats (and they are a good price for the amount you get), please use caution.  Smokehouse, a chinese exporter, was involved in the massive contaminated treat and food recalls last year.<br /><br />If you can't afford the healthier and safer free range treats (such as lamb ears, kneecaps, tendons, etc), you can instead find some great recipes to make your own dog snacks.  Or buy a Kong and shove some doggie snacks in it, or smear a dab of natural peanut butter in it... it will keep your dog busy and is good brain stimulation.<br /><br />If you absolutely must buy these Smokehouse treats, be sure to CHECK THE CONTAINER FOR BUGS.  The last one I saw had some of the most disgusting gray beetle-looking bugs crawling into and around the treats in the jar. Also, keep your empty container (or at least the label) for a couple months in case your dog does get sick.
