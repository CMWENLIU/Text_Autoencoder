Here's a list of ingredients:<br />water, malic acid, propylene glycol, citric acid, sucralose, acesulfame k, red 40, yellow 5, blue 1, potassium sorbate.<br />Quite a concoction of synthetic chemicals.  The acesulfame K even has an Acceptable Daily Intake established by the FDA.  It's not really something people should be consuming at any level.  The rest of the ingredients are almost as bad.  Red 40 and yellow 5 may cause hyperactivity in children.  Potassium sorbate is a mold inhibitor for long shelf life.  Propylene glycol is basically radiator fluid, but is also used in personal lubricants and to lubricate enema nozzles.  Sucralose is just chlorinated sugar.  There's less than 2% natural ingredients on the list.<br />I think I'll pass on this corporate concoction of non-nutritive chemicals.
