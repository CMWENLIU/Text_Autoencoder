I thought this looked like a pretty good deal for 10 ice cream sandwiches.  One review talked about what a good deal it was, and I agreed, so I tried.  I found that I paid $11 for ONE single ice cream sandwich.  I am in the process of filing complaints and trying to get this fixed, but considering that another person posted with the same problem, I am suspecting that this is something of a scam.  If it isn't a scam, then they have poor quality control for their shipping.<br /><br />The single package I got looked good and was foil wrapped.  Unfortunately I can't eat it until the dispute is resolved.  Oh, and it took nearly 3 weeks to get that one packages sent via extremely thin packaging that left the ice cream smashed to bits by the postal service.  We'll see how the resolution goes, but I don't expect to order from this seller again.
