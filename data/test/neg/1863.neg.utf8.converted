Have had this brand a year or two ago and it was creamy, delicous, and good.  Then I ordered Rolands organic coconut milk for a great price on Amazon and really enjoyed it as well-- thick, creamy coconut flavor.  When it was time to reorder Rolands I found reviews stated that quality had changed, so I thought I'd return to a brand I trusted.  It seems the quality of many have changed recently, not sure why.<br /><br />In this specific batch, the milk was a bit more watery and oily.  I just use a portion of the can daily in smoothies, so when I refrigerate the remaining milk, the distinct oil separates and forms a hard layer on top.  Whereas, previous coconut milk would behave more like unhomogenized milk, and thick cream would collect on top (not a slab of "butter").
