These did not taste good to me.  They were almost chalky and did not have a good flavor.  The mint tasted strange.  I'm disappointed since I enjoy other flavors of Larabars.  I would pass on these and get the cashew cookie, or apple pie if you want something sweet and that tastes great.<br /><br />Edit : This review is for the chocolate mint flavor obviously
