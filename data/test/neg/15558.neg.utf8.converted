I'm a cereal fanatic, but I've got celiac so I have to choose gluten free cereals. I bought this as a substitute for Rice Krispies so that I could make my favorite cookies, which require that type of rice cereal. The pieces in this cereal are a bit bigger than Rice Krispies. I'm not sure if it was the sweetener or the brown rice, but the flavor just did not appeal to me at all. So I didn't even bother trying to make my cookies. I actually threw out most of the box, which I never do, because every time I tried eating it, it just didn't taste good. I tried it with regular milk and almond milk (I thought maybe the almond milk would flavor it better, nope). I did not have any sort of gluten-related reaction to it. I just didn't like it, and neither did my non-celiac husband.
