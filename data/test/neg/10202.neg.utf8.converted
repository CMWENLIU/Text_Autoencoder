If you are buying this rather than some other bag of cotton candy, because you want CC "balls" like bunny tails for EASTER - DON'T! this is one rectangular chunk of CC, not to mention, there is no fluff about it.  It is a solid, compact piece with pale colors occasional in a bite but mostly it's all white.  Pull it apart in a chunk and you might get a stripe of a color in there somewhere but not always - its often just white.<br /><br />I accepted the title and the picture and bought it figuring I might have to reshape a bit but I would likely get slightly mishapen bunny tails in bright spring colors. None of it is true - including the FLUFFY part.<br /><br />Not Fluffy<br />No spring colors - a little bit of really faded pink and really pale blue<br />No balls - one thick compact chunk<br />No cotton tails in any regard, just a complete and utter LIE<br /><br />Tastes alright if you don't mind it not being fluffy, like cotton candy. I've bought bags of cotton candy before so I'm not naive, they are not as airy as a plastic tub but they are usually cotton candy like.
