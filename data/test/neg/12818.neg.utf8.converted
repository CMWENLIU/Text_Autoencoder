Like the other reviewers, I agree that dog treats made in china are potentially poisonous, and should be avoided at all costs.  My dog is too precious to me to even take the risk.  Chinese people eat dogs, they don't care about yours.  I urge all consumers to send emails to Waggin Train AND Milos Kitchen and let them know these products are NOT ACCEPTABLE to Americans.  There's no reason why hard-working Americans can't make tasty dog treats, and we would make them with love instead of poison.  I WOULD pay a little more if these treats were American.  Rachael Ray has a terrific line of dog treats, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007Y7TRJ2">Rachael Ray Dog Treats Nutrish Soup Bones Long Lasting Chews - Real Chicken and Veggies Flavor</a> which are made in USA and my lil Daisy LOVES them!
