The buyer should be aware that MSG is on the label. Since the<br />label does not distinguish between the noodles and the packet,<br />it is not clear whether the packet contains it all.<br /><br />It is also high in palm oil, and I would guess that this<br />is the noodles.  If I had been aware of these<br />features (there was no contents information) I would not have<br />purchased it.
