The item that Nutricity ships is not true product description on the Amazon web site.  This water is not from New Zealand but bottled somewhere from muilt-sources and has a bad smell and tastes bad.  Nutricity  refuses to honor my complaint that the item is not as described and will not refund my money.  BUYER BEWARE! The one star review is only becuase you have to put at leaset one to post a review, so my review should have no stars.
