I stumbled upon the benefits of Mauka Honey while researching methods of treating the acne I have suffered from for 20 years. Testimonial after Testimonial claimed an almost miraculous reaction to this honey. I tried using it as both a wash and mask. Within 24 hours, I had numerous white heads all over my face. 24 hours after that, I had giant red, painful cysts forming under my skin. I thought perhaps this was just some initial purging so kept at it for two week, but it only got worse and worse. After stopping it, my skin started to clear up.<br /><br />The honey itself is sweet and tastes great. Although I broke out significantly, the parts of my face that remained clear do feel smoother, so I suppose for anyone who does not suffer from acne, it might be a nice skin care product. For anyone else, use great caution.
