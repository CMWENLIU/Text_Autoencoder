Delighted that the shipment arrived one day early, but disappointed when I opened the box and discovered the bag had arrived already opened. There was Farro all over the bottom of the box.<br /><br />When I went to the Amazon website, I learned that this item is not eligible for return. There was no link to contact the shipper or the supplier for a replacement.<br /><br />I am hoping this review will generate a response from someone. I will upgrade the review to five stars when this issue is resolved. I would like a new bag of Farro, please.
