worst coconut water ever, period.<br /><br />I saw them in my local BJs and thought of trying it, the taste was horrible, had an artificial flavor to it which remains in ur breath for some time. I thought of trying after my 6 mile run, and even then I couldnt drink it. had to return it and then bought some good coconut water from a local asian store (realcocowater) and it tastes much better and doesnt have any artificial flavor like this.<br />I would not even give it a one star if possible.<br />Dont buy this, its a waste of money
