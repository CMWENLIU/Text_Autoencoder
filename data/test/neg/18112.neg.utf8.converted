I bought this product specifically because it was for HULLED rather than PEARLED barley.  The picture shown is clearly HULLED and not PEARLED barley.  The description clearly states that they HULL (not pearl) the barley.  But, of course, what I received was PEARLED barley.  Seeing as I planned to use this for a specific recipe and held off on trying it for over a week waiting for this to show up, I'm a little peeved about this.
