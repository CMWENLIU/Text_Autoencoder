This is my wife's favorite flavor K-Cup.  Unfortunately out of a box of 24 K-cups, probably 5-6 yield a cup full of coffee grinds.  We've tried 2 separate orders from Amazon (2 boxes each, so 4 total boxes) and this happened pretty consistently.  About 20-30% of the cups of coffee were ruined due to being filled with grinds.  I don't know if this is a temporary thing, maybe there's a bad batch, but I'd stay away from these K-Cups until they fix the problem.  Too bad, because as I said, it's my wife's favorite flavor.
