Do not be tempted to use these as a substitute for white chocolate just because they're cheaper!  There is a reason they do not use the word "chocolate" on the package, as there is NO cocoa butter in them.  In fact, the only natural ingredient listed is milk.  This is reflected in the taste, which is very artificial.  I tried to use these in a cookie recipe recently and ruined the cookies.  They did not melt properly and every one fell off the top of the cookies.  I will never use this product again and will tell everyone I know not to use them either.
