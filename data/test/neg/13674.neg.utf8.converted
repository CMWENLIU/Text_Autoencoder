To each his/her own.  I was suckered into buying a case on a Friday sale.  I'm now still trying to give them away a package at a time.  (You want one???)  They are blended, pureed, formed into peapods, but NOT any remote resemblance of an actual green bean.  I hate them (although one of my sister-in-laws and parents have ordered 3 more cases).  Like I said--to each his/her own.  I personally hate them.
