Well, I'm not one to leave bad reviews.  But...... these berries made me sick to my stomach.  I'm sorry to say that I will NOT be buying these berries again.... nor will I be buying ANY goji berries again.  After doing some research online I have found out that a LOT of people have had the same reaction.  If you're going to buy these berries, be careful.  I did see that one of the berries turned a bit gray as well....  I wasn't impressed.  :(
