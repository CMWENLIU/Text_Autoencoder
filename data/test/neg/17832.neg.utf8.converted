And the're not good cookies.  They are just cookies.<br />The chocolate chunks are not big.  Well that's because the cookies are not big.  Just this side of bite size.<br />Our batch was over baked.  Dark bottomed and dry.  Well that's only one batch out of 100's.<br />They are not organic.  They are not gluten free.<br />The ingredients are basically what Chips Ahoy have.  Except these have been given the rainforest alliance certification seal of approval.  What?<br /><br />I'll tell ya, I've never had a bad batch of them thar Chips Ahoy I tell ya.<br />So iffin I'm a gonna splurge, I'm not gonna force down these little dry cookies.  I'm gonna get me one of those 4" big moist chocolate filled hockey pucks down at the bakery.
