the product purchased was david sunflower kernels. although the product date was not expired it tasted very stale, rancid. it is my guess this product was subjected to extreme heat or some type of poor storage. i ordered two cases, twenty large bags. we are "slogging" our way through it even though it doesn't taste fresh. it even smells stale. i doubt i order from you again as a result of this experience. my last order was fine. what happened here? new supplier? it is not acceptable product. i don't understand the difference in quality between these two orders. you won't have repeat business if you ship this kind of stale product. i have told friends of my experience. don't you realize you not only lose my business but the fact that i share my experience with friends and family means they too will not order product that is shipped in this unacceptable condition. it is a hassle to return items. i was willing to make purchases when there were no problems but once this happens I no longer am willing to go through the hassle. It costs money to ship returns. Shame on you.<br /><br />esther jones
