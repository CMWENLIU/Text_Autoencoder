In my opinion, two reasons to avoid this brand: Genetically modified ingredients (soy and canola ingredients) and MSG (yeast extract, autolyzed yeast extract). Not to mention non-organic dairy (antibiotic milk, anyone?). Makes them no better than Campbell's. Support non-GMO (i.e., organic) foods!<br />Thanks to the commenter who listed the ingredients.
