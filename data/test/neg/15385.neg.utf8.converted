So, I previously purchased the "chunk" version of this product [Native Forest Organic Pineapple Chunks, 14-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)] since I love pineapple, and they were delicious. The chunks were of a nice size, and even my cat kept bothering me when I ate them, as he apparently liked the sweetness of them.<br /><br />Then I saw this version, labeled as "crushed." The picture basically makes it look just like smaller chunks than the "chunk" version. But it's not. Instead, it's like this awful kind of sludge or mush, and for some reason it comes from a different country than the "crushed" version, and doesn't taste as good.<br /><br />In my opinion, stay away from "crushed" and go for the "chunk" version. I've also now ordered the "mini rings" variety to see how those are.
