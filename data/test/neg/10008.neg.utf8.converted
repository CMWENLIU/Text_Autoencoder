This would make a nice kitchen ornament, but not for $50.<br /><br />I bought this manual drip Melitta because I thought it looked nice and it would make better tasting coffee. It does make good tasting coffee. But, the lid does not fit securely on the pot, you only get 3 real cups of coffee (as measured with a real cooking measuring cup), and you need to fill the filter cone 2 times if you want 3 real cups of coffee. You must wait about 3 minutes before you refill the cone for the second time. OK, so that is about 6 minutes of wasted time attending the brew just waiting for the coffee. The pot does not keep the coffee hot enough for me. I like the coffee to stay hot until I am done with that serving. After brewing is finished I need to microwave the first cup for 30 sec. My next cup would be 40 sec and the last cup 50 sec.
