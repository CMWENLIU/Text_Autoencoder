I have subscribed silk soy milk for a long time and decide to try this brand.<br />However, I received the item and found there is no straw attached on each bottle.<br />I can not imagine how to drink each one.<br />Amazon doesn't let me return it.<br />I have emailed customer support and will update the review.<br /><br />update:<br />first contact: Amazon offered 40% off, it is unacceptable because I still can not drink the soy beverage.<br />second contact: Amazon will send me another pack to replace the "no straw" pack.<br /><br />update2:<br />the new arrived pack still have no straw.
