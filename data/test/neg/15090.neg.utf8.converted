I was expecting something a little more snappy and a little less sandy. The flavor was okay (I personally love strong ginger flavors, which I am yet to find) however, they were too sweet for my tastes. I don't know, but it seems like Americans have a strong taste for excess sugar. It would have been better if there was less sugar and more spice, as well as less sandiness and more snappiness, imho. For those who like chocolate, try the extreme chocolate cookies, but be careful as they may cause burning of the stomache; esp. if many are eaten. Not my favorite Pamela's product.
