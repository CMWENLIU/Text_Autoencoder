All customer service is signed by Ron Manz, President, but it's not him. Any number of customer service agents are 'round the clock claiming their solutions are his. The product was fine, and arrived quickly. However, it was frozen when it was claimed fresh, and customer service was to give me a refund, again by Ron Manz. None arrived. After inquiring, "Ron Manz" said he "forgot," and sent me a credit receipt via email. That's not a refund, even though  "Ron" asked me for my Credit Card # once again. My bank account still shows no refund. Avoid this company like the plague, folks. They're misrepresenting themselves and their products.
