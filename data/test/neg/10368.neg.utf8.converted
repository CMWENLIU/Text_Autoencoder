This is a wonderful tasting water, however, it does NOT ship well..... the water is packed so poorly that when it arrives you will have a soggy box containing water that still has the security stickers on but is missing water.  It must sit somewhere getting hot because the water (when shipped in bulk) tastes like plastic if you can even get a bottle that isn't leaking.  DO NOT  waste your money.  It's a shame because the water is an extraordinary quality water, but it just does not ship well with the current packaging.
