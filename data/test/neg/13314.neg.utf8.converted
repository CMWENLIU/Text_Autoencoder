I love Tasty Bite as much as the next occationally lazy vegan but this was gross. It tasted nothing like Pad Thai and I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth for hours. Even when I tried to add lime juice, hot sauce, and bean sprouts it didn't come close. I just learned it's worth the time and effort to make your own from scratch. So worth it.
