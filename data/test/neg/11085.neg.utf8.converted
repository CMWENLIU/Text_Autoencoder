I enjoy grilling and making the related side dishes like baked beans etc. I am guilty of using at least 2 or 3 bottles of liquid smoke each month. After finding this product on Amazon I thought I would give it try. I have used several products from Colorado Spice and they have been good. This product was clumpy and does not sprinkle like a pinch of salt or anything else. If you try to rub onto or into meat it turns to a sticky paste which sticks well to your hands but not the meat. The smell is strong hickory and so is the taste (to strong or maybe the paste is too thick) I am back to liquid smoke. After 40 years of cooking it is still the only item that consistantly works.
