As soon as the ingredients were mostly GRAINS I read no more.  The first 1-4 should be PROTEIN, not grains. Granted, the first item is 'organic' chicken but after that it is downhill! It's not easy relying on a profit making company to make food for our pets. I make homemade for my 7# dog, but not easy for an 80# dog, who is boarded frequently. Kennels are not equipped with a fridge. DRY is last on the 'to feed' list. RAW is best, but expensive. Saw Dr. Karen Becker on YouTube speak about how to read INGREDIENTS. Read [...] reviews, trying to be sure I am doing the right thing, like all of us. The major food companies are ruthless and deceptive. Our pets are dying prematurely due to vaccines and diet. Research best you can, make food yourself. A dog CAN eat RAW organic chicken backs/wings. COOKED causes bone to splinter. Newman's Organics is full of GRAINS and too carb heavy. Weruva appears to be the best CANNED food, as it is 'human grade.' So far, Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free Healthy Holistic Chicken Dry food is the forerunner.
