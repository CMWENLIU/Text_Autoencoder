The new formula 70% Lindt chocolate bar is terrible. Nothing at all like the old formula which was one of my favorites. I wrote to Lindt about this and they responded that marketing research found more people preferred the taste of the new formula bar.<br /><br />I wonder if they used the same company that recommended "new coke", that British Airways change their tail design, and that Citibank start issuing their PDF statements on 7x14 paper size!<br /><br />Yes, the average American prefers a Hershey bar to most other chocolate, no surprise there. It's what we grew up with. But they're not going to pay $2 for one in a fancy dancy euro-style package.
