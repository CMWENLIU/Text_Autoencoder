My 2 labs absolutely love bully sticks and I've ordered bully sticks from Amazon prior to this order.  I decided to go with these as the price was right, well now I know why the price is right-these things are very thin or skinny and they have a stink that's stronger then the normal bully sticks.  My 2 labs gobble these things down within a few minutes that's how thin/skinny they are.  And the smell of urine is strong!  Will go back to the sticks that are a thicker and less stinky when this batch is done, which should be just about now...
