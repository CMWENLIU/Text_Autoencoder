Well, this is the biggest disappointment that I've had with a food product for quite some time.  The original Propel Kiwi-Strawberry powder was, to me, the best tasting water additive on the planet!  Finally, I was able to drink quarts of water without forcing myself to do so.  The powder dissolved easily in my 16 ounce water bottle and the flavor was just sweet enough.  I have a sweet tooth and this stuff was awesome!  But some dumb focus group participants decided that ten calories per packet were just too many calories to allow in their diets each day. Ten bottles adds up to only 100 calories! Really?  Did they only ask anorexics?  The new version clumps in my water and has a bitter after taste.  I have to add my own artificial sweetener to get it to taste like the old version. That's way too much trouble for something that's supposed to be easy.  I even called Gatorade and begged them to bring back the other version along with the new but they said they wouldn't do it.  I am now looking for a replacement to Propel powder.  Mio Berry Pomegranate is real close and you can add as much or as little as you like.  I still mourn the passing of the original Propel powder but what can I do?  Marketing people are idiots and always will be.
