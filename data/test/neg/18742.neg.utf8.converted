Originally I had bought the "full-sodium" Miso-Cup soup packets that contained 690 mg of sodium and it tastes identical to what you would get at a restaurant.  When I saw the reduced sodium packets, I was excited because Im always looking for more healthy alternatives.  This Miso Cup reduced sodium is disgusting.  It not only has no flavor but the bits of soy and whatever else is in there, doesn't get soft and just floats at the top of the soup like rocks.  Now, I have a huge box of these soup packets and am not really sure what to do with them. I've tried preparing it different ways, but still haven't been able to finish a single cup of it.  My advise? Go for the full-sodium Miso-Cup.  Yeah, it has more sodium, but it tastes great and is high in protein, vitamins and minerals.
