I recently found out that Special K and ALL other Kelloggs products contain genetically modified corn. The pesticide found in GMO corn has been found in the blood of 93% of pregnant women and 80% of their unborn babies in a recent study. I will never eat a single spoonful of Special K again. Unless of course Kelloggs decides to change its ingredients to non-gmo like it has done in Europe where GMOs are banned!
