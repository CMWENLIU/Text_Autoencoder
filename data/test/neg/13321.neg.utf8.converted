The bread made from this stuff is TERRIBLE!  Crusty, Dense, Sweet!  Can't make a meat sandwich out of it because it is so sweet!  Try Gluten Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich or French Bread & Pizza Mix, they taste like real bread!  Like I said, it's sweet and has an overpowering flavor that ruins anything you try to do with it.
