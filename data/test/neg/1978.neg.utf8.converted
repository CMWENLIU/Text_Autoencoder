Poor Charlie...<br /><br />Hard to get the phrase "New Coke" out of my head.<br />I always bought Lindt because of their quality and consistency. Very, very Swiss.<br /><br />I have been enjoying this chocolate bar for the past twenty years in Europe and the USA.<br />We just finished our old stash of Lindt Excellence 70% dark chocolate bars. I went to the store for more and noticed on the outside of the bar the words, "NEW RECIPE." It should say, "RUINED PRODUCT."<br /><br />The bar has what appears to be a lighter color, less snap and definitely less depth and body of cacao. The great flavor is gone. Now the chocolate liquor that used to slowly melt off the back of the tongue, flowing down your throat is replaced by a thick wax that reminds me of Hershey.<br /><br />On the back it says:<br />"EXCELLENCE 70% COCOA is characterized by a warm brown hue and a light fragrance of cacao. Experience this new milder recipe the balances smooth dark chocolate flavor with a surprisingly rich and creamy texture."<br /><br />MANUFACTURED BY:<br />LINDT & SPRUNGLI (USA) INC.,<br />STRATHAM,NH 03885<br /><br />the old bar said:<br /><br />Manufactured  by:<br />LINDT & SPRUNGLI SAS (France)<br />DISTRIBUTED BY:<br />LINDT & SPRUNGLI (USA) INC.,<br />STRATHAM,NH 03885
