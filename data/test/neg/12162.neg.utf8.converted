I love mudslides (the real ones), but this coffee doesn't come close to what you would expect it to taste like.  There is a detectable coconut flavor (barely), no choclate flavor at all, and a strange aftertaste that really kills the deal for me.  I really like most of Gloria Jean's coffees, but this one is at the bottom of the list for me.
