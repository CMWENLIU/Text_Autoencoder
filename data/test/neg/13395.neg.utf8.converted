I purchased these without having seaweed snacks before, but really liking wasabi, figured we'd give them a try.  I tried them, my husband tried them, and I even took them to work to see if I could find someone who would eat them.  No one found anything redeeming about them.  Just nasty.  Now, I have waited too long to return them, so I guess they will be thrown in the trash.
