I received the green pouches as illustrated, and the price for a full pound of tea was very attractive. The Amazon listing currently (Sept. 2011) describes this Assam tea as organic. Nothing on the package indicates this is so. However, the company's website states that this and nearly all of their teas are USDA Certified Organic.<br /><br />I have been drinking tea for some decades, and keeping notes to remind myself of favorites. I expect a quality Assam tea to have an appealing aroma and a complex flavor with hints of malt. This product failed to deliver. This Two Leaves & A Bud product is flat and uninteresting. It has little aroma and has little taste at all. The package I received was probably old inventory, long past its peak. Older tea does not go rancid; packaged tea simply looses its aroma and flavor as it ages.<br /><br />This Assam tea had mostly whole leaves, not the smaller fannings or dust-like particles you sometimes find in bargain-basement teas. You can add boiling water and infuse up to 3.5 or 4 minutes without causing excessive bitterness, but you get very little of the classic Assam flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: Bland, with little flavor or aroma. I might buy another tea from this brand, but only if I knew that it was fresh inventory ... and that it had received good reviews.<br /><br />Options: As an alternative for bargain hunters, Ahmad brand Kalami Assam tea can be purchased for about $10/pound in South Asian and Middle Eastern grocery stores. This inexpensive Ahmad tea is not great, but it is more appealing than this tea. Of the more upscale packaged brands, I recommend the Assam offerings from Peet's, especially their Assam Extra Fancy. I wish you fun and good luck in your tea tasting.
