OK. I was all puckered up to really like this version of smoked olive oil (I thought the one I'd been guzzling was the only one in the world!). I figured at the rate my family consumes The Smoked Olive's local brand (they literally put it on almost EVERYTHING!), it might be worth saving a couple of bucks (after shipping it wasn't so much cheaper after all). I was excited the day it came (like 10 days after my order) and got out some of my homemade, wood-fired oven baked ciabatta bread. A big sloppy dip (I like olive oil) on a hunk of bread entered my mouth and... what happened to the smoke? There wasn't a whole lot of smoke to begin with, but the initial flavor literally fell off. Like some poorly executed wines that just have no character. Yeah, I'm spoiled and prejudice living in Sonoma County where the best artisan foods are found. I guess this is a perfect example of "you get what you pay for".
