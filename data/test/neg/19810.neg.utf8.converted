I bought some juicy juice from Target recently.  It had "Product of China" on the package.  I won't take the risk of giving Juicy Juice to my children let alone given all the recent problems coming out of China involving poisened pet food, toothpaste, etc.  Why take the risk?  People from China living in the U.S. would rather not eat or drink anything from China.  Take it from me - I am Chinese and all of my Chinese friends say the same thing.
