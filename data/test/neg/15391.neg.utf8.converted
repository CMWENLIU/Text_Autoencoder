I adhere to a low sodium diet (&lt;1,500 mg daily).  I ordered this cereal not realizing that it contained 190 mg of sodium per half cup serving. The product is advertised as having no artificial flavoring and no preservatives.  This claim is misleading because salt is the mother of all preservatives.  Perhaps sodium is used in this product only for purposes of artificially enhancing the flavor and not as a preservative?  If you have been off the processed food grid for a awhile, you will probably find, as I did, that this cereal has good flavor and texture.  However, because of the comparatively high sodium content, I will not purchase this cereal again.  There are other good tasting zero sugar cereals on the market with no or low sodium content.
