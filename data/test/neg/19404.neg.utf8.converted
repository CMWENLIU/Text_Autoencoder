I've been eating these rice cakes for a year now and they're excellent. When I saw that I could buy them online by the box, I was thrilled because the sesame Seed ones aren't easy to find in the local grocery stores.<br /><br />Although they arrived in a timely manner, they weren't packed well enough to cut down on breakage. That wasn't the worst part though. Having eaten these for a year or more, I've had fresh ones from the local stores. The ones I received here didn't taste fresh and sometimes tasted stale.With rice cakes, that makes a big difference.<br /><br /> I think I'll keep to the local stores and take my chances at fresh packages.
