Well, I am very dissapointed in this package as I got ALOT of the "same" coffees that were of different Brands(and they were mostly regular coffees).  I got ALOT of the "Bold" coffees which I cannot stand.  Some of the coffees were outdated.  The oldest was outdated September of 2011 (so far).  NOT ONE cocoa, NOT ONE Apple Cider, NOT ONE Iced Coffee, NOT ONE Iced Tea.  I got very few of the flavored coffees which is what I was hoping for and I really wanted the Cocoa and Apple cider.  I have a 7yr old daughter who would have LOVED the cocoa!  And I couldn't wait for my husband to try the Apple Cider that he loves.  The only thing good about this package is that it came fast (of course, that was thanks to Amazon Prime shipping).  I will not order from these people again unless they make it RIGHT with me!!!  Had it been a good shipment I would have ordered over and over again, as I entertain alot.
