I ordered these as stocking stuffers for 4 children (4 each of 3 designs).  The company, however, sent me a box of 12 candy dispensers shaped like the Wii-mote.  I have to say that they were helpful in this regard.  Although it took them several days to respond, they sent me a UPS label so I could return the Wii dispensers.  I was not happy, however, with several things.  First, they told me they could not do an exchange because this item (Nintendo Kliks) was out of stock.  That was only a week ago and it is still listed here on Amazon.  So either they lied to me or other customers are potentially ordering this item and won't receiving it.  It also really messed up  my "stocking stuffers" plan!  The other issue, is that this company tried to convince me to keep the 12 Wii-mote dispensers since supposedly they cost more than the Nintendo dispensers, so the price I paid was an "excellent" deal.  This added extra days to the process because I had to reply that I was not interested and then I had to wait for them to reply to my email, etc.  I would not order this item from this company without first checking with them to make sure it is in stock.  Update:  1/13/10:  This item is still listed on Amazon as "in stock"!  I think this company might have lied to me about them being out of stock b/c they didn't want to pay return shipping on the Wii dispensers and then pay again to ship the correct item to me.  I'm VERY disappointed. I DO NOT recommend this company, at all.
