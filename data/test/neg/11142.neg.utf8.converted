I've ordered the 12 inch thinner sticks for my dog before and he loves them.  I ordered these by accident last time (wasn't paying enough attention!!) and although the dog still loves them they smell incredibly bad!  The longer, thinner sticks no not have this bad smell (unless you stick them right by your nose I suppose).  As soon as I opened the pack of these sticks the smell infused the entire house and when I gave the dog one his paws carried the horrible smell for days afterward.  I finally put him in the sink and washed his paws.<br /><br />I'd recommend the longer 12 inch sticks over these simply for the smell.  I ended up just throwing this pack out and ordering the longer ones.
