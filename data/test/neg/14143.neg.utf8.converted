This product has recently been shown to have zero difference from normal pastas. In fact every single scientific study that has been done has shown the same thing, even the box itself admits to having the same amount of carbohydrates as "normal" pasta in the Gov't mandated nutrition information box. The ad copy then goes on to try and say that by some magical "patent pending" process it "protects" most of the carbohydrates that there is exactly zero science or proof to back up anywhere. In short, this product is a complete and utter lie, not only is it disingenuous for people who are trying to lose weight, it is actively dangerous for diabetics who must keep accurate track of their carbohydrate intake to avoid death.<br /><br />Buyer Beware!
