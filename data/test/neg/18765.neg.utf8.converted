I am looking for ways to increase protein intake--so I jumped on this cereal--and bought four boxes. The minute it was delivered, I poured a big bowl. This is a huge disappointment. Cardboard has more flavor. It's wretched. I am sure there are many other sources of protein that you don't have to choke down. I hope reading this review will save you the trouble and expense...
