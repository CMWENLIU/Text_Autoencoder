I bought a 3 pack of these because of the reviews and I thought.....blah.... the organic milk is kind of watered down and bland plus where's the chocolate milk flavor? For being high in calories and sugar (180 cal. 27 G of sugar) I was expecting some major chocolate flavor but not so. My suggestion is to buy a smaller pack before you buy in bulk to see if you will like it. I wanted to like them but I didn't.
