I was really excited to find a grain free food that was fairly affordable. Unfortunately, my cat will not touch this stuff! In fact my other cat that does not have grain issues won't eat it either. I think some of it has to do with the fairly large, square shape of the kibble. It is almost like dog food. Other than that it is the taste. The only way I can get my cat to eat this food is to put it through the food processor to break up the large pieces and douse it with water to make it seem like wet food. (My cat has always eaten dry food so it is not a dry/wet issue). By the way, although this food says it is grain free, it does still have grain in its ingredients. This is really deceiving and I am not sure why they are able to label this food as grain free. This purchase was a total waste of money and I will look for another brand and hope that my cat will eat it without the need to doctor it.
