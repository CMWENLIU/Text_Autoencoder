Healthy Choice Chicken Dumplings Soup. TRUST ME, This soup is HORRIBLE. Does not taste like any soup I've Ever tasted. No Chicken Flavor. Taste more like the metal can. Vegetables are hard. Heating the soup longer won't make the vegetables softer. Dumplings are more like a flour ball, no flavor. I'll never buy healthy choice again. Zero Stars.
