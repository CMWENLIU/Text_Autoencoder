I had ordered this item expecting something of quality to arrive, having tried similar wares from Costco. I was severely disappointed. The chocolates arrived in terrible shape, flaky, dry and truly tasting noting like what they should. There was absolutely no difference in taste between the chocolate outer shell and the inner fruit core, it all tasted like sugary cardboard. After digging deeper in the pack and observing it was all the same, there was little choice but to dispose of this excuse for good dark chocolate.I don't normally go through the hassle but I thought I had to reach out and demand for a refund, even attaching a picture of the contents of the packaged chocolates. My two complaints were met with absolutely no reply, no refund, nothing.<br /><br />I have put this one down to a learning experience, do NOT buy food via mail order. Very difficult to return (especially from this vendor).
