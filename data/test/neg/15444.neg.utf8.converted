I've been using Fleischmann's Bread Machine Yeast to make bread in a Panasonic bread machine for a number of years.  I recently purchased a package of Red Star Baking Yeast on Amazon, to try to save money.  I was very disappointed with the Red Star yeast and have just discarded it.<br />Using the Fleischmann's yeast, I need 1 1/4 teaspoon to make a perfect small loaf of bread in 1 hour and 55 minutes.  This amount of Red Star yeast produced a rather pathetic un-risen loaf, so I gradually increased the amount of Red Star yeast to 2 1/2 teaspoons.  Although I was able to get my bread to rise more by using this higher dose of Red Star yeast, the loaf had more of a square shape than a rounded shape, it had a coarse texture, and it tasted "yeasty."<br />I've gone back to using Fleischmann's Bread Machine yeast.  Although expensive at about $8 per 4-oz jar at the local supermarket, it seems to be worth the price.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KWEZTO">Red Star Baking Yeast, Vacuum Packed, 2 Pounds (32 ounces - 908 g)</a>
