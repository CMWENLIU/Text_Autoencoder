I purchased the 50-count package of the decaffeinated coffee. While the taste is delicious, I found that a number of the k-cups had broken seals that resulted in coffee grounds exploding in the Keurig Brewer. I've spent way too much time cleaning my brewer when this happens and have had to discard at least 20% of the k-cups. The other k-cups that I've purchased and used, e.g. Coffee People's Donut Shop caffeinated coffees have worked flawlessly.<br /><br />When you have to discard that many defective k-cups, its a lousy deal.
