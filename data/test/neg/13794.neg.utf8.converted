In all seriousness, these are really wonderful and are a nice change of pace from raisins when adding to oatmeal. Some people may consider these a bit on the sweet side by themselves, but for those people adding them to oatmeal, you can almost go without adding brown sugar if you add the right amount of these. As of this writing, these are considerably cheaper on amazon after you factor in super saver shipping compared to local groceries!<br /><br />Edited 10/21/10: As one other reviewer has mentioned, Sunmaid has changed these and not for the better. Although they haven't bothered to change the picture of the fruit pieces on the front of the packaging, they're making the pieces MUCH larger. If I wanted large pieces, other manufacturers already do that. What I liked about these were that they were small bits good for putting in smoothies, on oatmeal, as something to put in my trail mix. If I have to chop this stuff up, I'm on the verge of just buying a food dryer and doing it right.<br /><br />I wrote in to SM and got a very canned response. They said it was due to the small pieces "sugaring", whatever that is. One intelligible thing they WERE able to tell me that this change wasn't an error in just one batch. It's a permanent change. It's too bad because the small pieces were the one differentiator of this product from every other dried fruit on the market.
