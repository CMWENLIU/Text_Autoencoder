I thought this was the same stuff I had purchased before, but actually, I had been buying Mrs Leeper's Corn Pasta. The De Boles stuff is okay, but not great. My wife and I find that Mrs Leepers is easier to cook, has a nicer texture (less likely to come out pasty) and a stronger corn taste (which I like, but others may not). In the future, we'll go back to ordering Mrs Leeper's, but I would say it's a matter of taste, not an inferior product per se (it's not like we'll be throwing this away, we just won't reorder).
