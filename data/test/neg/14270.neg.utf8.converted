We switched to Instinct dry from Evo because it has just as much protien but costs about $12 less per bag. When you buy as much cat food as we do (we breed Maine Coons) that adds up!<br /><br />Well, we used Instinct for several months and the cats really liked it.  During this same time period we started having problems with loose stools and poo that smelled extra-noxious. Seriously, when one of the cats would go it was as if an entire football team farted in our living room. We thought maybe we had gotten giardia in the house, but the tests came back clean.<br /><br />Finally, we put two and two together and tried switching back to Evo dry. Within a day the cat poo odor dropped to a normal level of stink.<br /><br />You may not have this same problem with your cats, but I'll spend the extra money on Evo, thank you.
