Normally we use Florida's Crystals Organic sugar in the plastic jugs.  We were nearly out of sugar & decided to order 6 bags of this sugar since we were in a pinch.  When it arrived & I opened the box (light as a feather was my first warning), I was floored.  The bags were flat not filled like the picture.  They are the exact same bags Davidson's uses for most of their bulk teas.  However they are not filled.<br /><br />Okay, it says it's a 16 ounce bag.  If I wasn't on a organic sugar shortage I may have paid more attention.  You are paying for 2 Cups of sugar!  That's it.  Think about it.  Not only that but extreme waste in packaging.  I think the bags could hold 4 times the amount of sugar.  It's a shame I didn't think to take a picture of those paper thin bags of "bulk" sugar.<br /><br />The final insult was the mess it was to get the sugar out of the bags.  It stuck to the sides & in the creases.  Trying to get it out of those spots left the counter & floor with a fine coat of sugar.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars over 1 because the sugar is organic & at least that is something.  There is nothing special about it. If this is the only choice I have for organic sugar, I will settle on this, but I will not be happy - at all.
