I love this stuff! but, this sellers price is unbelieveable. That equates to well over $7.00 per box! I can get them at my grocery store for $5 a box .. and even that was expensive.<br /><br />I used to buy them on amazon for about $3 per box, shipped to my house. Unfortunately amazon stopped selling it altogether, let alone under the save + subscribe umbrella. So, I have stopped drinking this great product!<br /><br />Oh well. ... will find some other caffinated thing to dump in my water.<br /><br />Dont waste your money supporting this seller, whatever you do
