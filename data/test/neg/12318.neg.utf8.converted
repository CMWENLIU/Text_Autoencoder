i was thoroughly and deeply disappointed with this 'creamed coconut' specifically for one reason:<br /><br />the back of the box says to just combine it with water and 'allow it a minute to soften.'  i just don't understand how they could write this.  i waited for a few long minutes, and it simply softened, by the tiniest bit, around the edges.  the rest, perfectly solid.  so i left it for about four hours, by which time my cake had cooled, and still, it was utterly solid.  depressing.  eventually i pureed it in the food processor... and it even then did not reach the desired consistency, but at least i could pour it over my cake and give it the mild coconut deliciousness i wished for.<br /><br />i would only recommend this product to someone who had absolutely nothing else to use, so please do not buy this if you have another option, like organic cream of coconut.  this only gained two stars from me for being organic.
