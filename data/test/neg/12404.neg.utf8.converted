Bentley's Unflavored White Tea used to be the best white tea ever. Subtle delicious flavor. They used to have the green labels back then. When they moved to the black labels, the quality went down. Now they have a third version with a new black label, which is even worse. It takes two bags to make a cup and the taste is no where near the original. I've tried writing to Bentley and have had no response from them. I'm cancelling my subscription.
