I bought a supply of these "ginger chews" to help with nausea during treatment with radiation and chemotherapy. I thought the calories were high and the "hot" taste was more like pepper. Looking carefully at the contents, I discovered these chews contain only 8% ginger! The sugar and tapioca (aka manioc root) are what add the carbs. They are tasty, but contain too little ginger for optimal results and taste. Unfortunately, I still have many small boxes of this product. They will make nice stocking stuffers for Christmas.<br />Roman Vanasse, Green Bay, Wisconsin.
