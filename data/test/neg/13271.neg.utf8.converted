Having received a Keurig for Christmas, I was looking for a good "black tea".  I'm puzzled because these K-cups got high marks from other reviewers.  I ordered the minimum 2 boxes from Amazon Grocery and find the brewed tea to be rather bitter.  I have to wonder if Amazon Grocery stored the product too long, or perhaps at too high a temperature.<br />I'm going to attempt to return this product because it's just not very good.
