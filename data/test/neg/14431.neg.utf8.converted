Give me a reason to buy from you? Nespresso website is half the price. 0.57/caps and 6.95 for shipping.<br />Total is .70 per caps shipping included and yours is 1.22 per caps for the same quantity!<br />I usually buys on amazon because I find good deals.<br />You should revise your pricing or change business.<br />I'll update my review if you change your prices to be at least cheaper that Nespresso themselves.
