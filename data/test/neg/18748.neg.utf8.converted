I hope I don't need to tell anybody what baking soda is, or the myriad uses for it. It has been around forever and just always works like it is supposed to. However, what we have here is a listing for a 16oz prduct with a picture of a 1 lb box, that says it is an 8oz product in the description with a shipping weight that verifies that fact. Bad listing, needs to be corrected before you are forced to eat a return shipment. if someone corrects this, please feel free to flush this review.
