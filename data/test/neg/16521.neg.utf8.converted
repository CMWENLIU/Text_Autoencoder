Why is this ramen $40+ for 8?<br />Don't get me wrong, its a wonderful ramen -- i would say i prefer this over the Shin ramen brand.<br />But walk into any asian/korean supermarket/grocery and you can get a box of these ramen for $20 for 20.<br />Well, you can even buy a 5 pack for less here on Amazon. Something seems wrong here..
