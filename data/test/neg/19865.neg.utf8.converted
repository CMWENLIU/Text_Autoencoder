I am a dyslexia specialist who tutors children.  I ordered this candy to use as a reward for my students.  I was very disappointed in the poor quality of the candy.  It was hard and seemed stale.  It was so hard that my student could not bite it with his teeth, but had to use scissors!  The taste was also poor.  My fourth grade student spit it out!  He has enjoyed gummy bears and gummy worms, but would not eat this.  My seventh grade student ate one, with difficulty, and said they were really bad and not to bring any more.<br />I thought perhaps it was stale, but the expiration date on the box said August 2012.  So I concluded that this is just very poor quality.  I threw the remainder in the trash.
