If these people are just going to resell the Trader Joe's product, that is fine, but they should not be so greedy. Sure, buy it and resell it so people not near TJ's can get it over the web. Just don't rip those people off when you do it. Don't buy this when it is so absurdly marked up in price by these guys.
