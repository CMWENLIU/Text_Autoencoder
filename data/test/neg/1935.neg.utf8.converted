I have been drinking Good Earth Sweet & Spicy tea (herbal) for years. It has been my favorite herbal tea for as long as I can remember, and I traditionally have a cup after dinner. When Costco stopped carrying a few months ago, I turned to Amazon and got six boxes in one order. Big mistake. Since the manufacturer has changed hands and the box went from light brown to purple, the tea also got seriously degraded. The difference is astounding, as I still have old tea bags from the last manufacturer and was able to directly compare. There is a distant hint of the old flavor that I pine for each time I take a sip, but what I am mostly met with is a harsh and unappealing flavor, and the longer it brews it just gets grosser rather than sweeter and spicier. It's tough to explain in words this distinct difference in flavor but trust me, it's disappointing. It is no longer the Good Earth that we all know and love so much.
