I used to buy this at Walmart a couple years ago all the time. They quit having it. I finally found it here. I was VERY disappointed. The company that makes it has changed it. The texture of the bread is different. It is not a soft bread anymore. The taste is different, not as sweet. Taste is nothing like before. I do NOT recommend it and will not buy it any more.
