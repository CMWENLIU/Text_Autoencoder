I have been using stevia since the late 80's (yes, it was banned by the FDA at that time). Stevia has changed significantly over the years from the dark brown, licorice tasting product that sweetened wonderfully but definitely added its own flavor (was the only form available in the states), to the wide variety of products available today. This looked like a very good price, until I used it. I have to use 2-3X the amount to achieve the sweetness provided by KAL's powdered stevia, so it has turned out to be quite expensive.
