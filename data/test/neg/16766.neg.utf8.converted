This stuff comes from China and Cargill, king of GMO foods.  Emerald Forest xylitol is also from China even though it's advertised as American birch.  Now, it may have been birch at one time but Xylitol Canada bought them in 2010.  An employee at EF spilled the beans and I listened on the phone as she got chewed out by her boss.  Even without that little confirmation, the chances are certainly slim that EF would produce real quality American Xylitol when they are in bed with Cargill.  Too bad the FDA won't get involved.
