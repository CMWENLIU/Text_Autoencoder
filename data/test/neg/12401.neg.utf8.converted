I LOVE tamarind balls, sweet and tart like other's have described. HOWEVER DO NOT GET THESE FROM IMPORTFOODS. I wouldn't get these type at all no matter what company. Importfoods is bad because they did not bother to return my emails until I was forced to leave them a bad review on Amazon. And even then they ignored my request for a partial refund. I had FOOLISHLY decided to order this product in bulk and had paid them a lot of money.<br /><br />I did this because I had tried so many brands of tamarind balls and loved them all. Some more than others but all that I tried were good.<br /><br />These were the sad exception. They tasted EXTREMELY stale and salty, YUCK! The ones that Importfoods sent were covered in dust. So I'm sure they were stale. But the seller is only part of the problem. This BRAND really is inferior. It's full of stale sugar and salt and quite gritty. Barely any tamarind at all. So no wonder it tasted gritty, stale, with barely any fruit.<br /><br />It also had a weird burnt/molasses- like aftertaste. More just burnt than molasses.<br /><br />I'm leaving this review because there were no negative reviews,to warn me when I purchased these. Buyer Beware!!!
