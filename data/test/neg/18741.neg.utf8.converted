It doesn't especially taste like Miso soup. In fact, it doesn't taste like much anything at all. Slightly brown hot water. Miso soup is a wonderful thing, but these packets do not produce anything that I'd call Miso. Sure, opinions vary on taste, but don't get a 48 pack unless you're sure you like this stuff!
