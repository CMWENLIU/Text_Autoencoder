I've been buying the Art of Appreciation gift baskets for years for my family members. The recipients were always grateful and seemed to have enjoyed the varieties. This year, I got curious and ordered myself a basket after sending several of the same out to my family and friends. Upon receipt, I was shocked at the content and the presentation of the basket especially for the price paid. I could probably come up with a much better mix with less than $30 - in fact I will do so from now on.  I feel embarrassed that this is the type of baskets I've been sending out year after year to my loved ones. Don't be fooled that you'd impress anyone with the included caviar - it tastes like salty but unsweet flying fish eggs. As a person used to the Caspian caviars and even some cheaper American Paddlefish alternatives, I find it insulting and again very embarrassed to have sent the product as gifts. I should've known better... I called my sister (yearly happy recipient) and asked her if this is how it had been for years, and she giggled sheepishly and that's all I needed to know.<br /><br />Received contents:<br /><br />4 pieces (1.2 oz) of Belgian Truffles<br />3.5 oz Dill Salmon Spread (Alaska Smokehouse)<br />3.75 oz Pasteurized Cheddar Cheese (Northwood Cheese Co)<br />0.95 Oz Mochaccino mix - enough for ONE 6oz cup<br />2 oz Smoked Almonds (Los Olivos)<br />2 oz Wine & Cheese Biscuits (Los Olivos)<br />1.8 oz Chocolate Dipped (Truffle?) cookies<br />4 oz Tuscan Crackers (Focaccia Crisps)<br />2 oz Water Crackers (Three Pepper Blend)<br />4.4 oz Wafer rolls (Tiramisu flavor)<br />5 oz Pretzels (typical salted dried)<br />4.4 oz Angelina's Sweet Butter Cookies<br />2 oz green olives, pimento stuffed (Mille Lacs Foods)<br />2 oz Black Capelin caviar (Season brand)<br /><br />Missing Items:<br />2 Pakages Cafe Comfrorts White Chocolate Cocoa Mix<br />Sesame Crackers<br />Merlot Wine Cheese - or is this for the pasteurized cheddar flavored dip?<br />Stone Ground Mustard<br />Ms. Pinables Caramel Confections
