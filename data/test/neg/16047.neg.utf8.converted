I hate to be the only dissenter here but these are not the kind we used to buy in the sixties.<br /><br />They look the same but the texture is different. Now I admit I know nothing about the candy business or how bubble gum is made but I do know companies use filler and often cheaper ingredients to make more money.<br /><br />The old type you could bite off a hunk and wind up with a wad of bubble gum roughly the size you bit off. And the more you chewed the softer it got.<br /><br />These Bubble Cigars once you have chewed them for about a minute turns into a small lump a quarter of the size you put in your mouth and the lump is so tough you have to spit it out- it is just too tough to chew. Like a piece of hard rubber.<br /><br />I admit they look the same and the flavor is close to the sixties but they are not anywhere near the quality of what we used to buy. The old kind you could chew for hours, blow bubbles with , and the flavor would last as long as you chewed.<br />These will do none of that.<br /><br />They just seem to be made from very cheap ingredients with about 70% filler.<br /><br />It's a shame because they used to be really good. But these are not what we grew up with.<br />It is very cheap bubble gum made in the color and the shape of the old Bubble Gum Cigars many of us used to love.<br /><br />Fortunately, they do not cost very much so you can try them yourself without being out too much money.
