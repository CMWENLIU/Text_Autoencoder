I was really disappointed by this one. Brookside did such a marvellous job with both the Blueberry/Acai and the Raspberry/Gogi chocolates, even keeping the sweet/tart of the fruits intact, that I decided to take a chance on the Pomegranate, even though most places mess it up.<br /><br />Instead of getting the intense sweet/tart Pomegranate Seed taste, they got the bitter taste of the white rind! Very disappointing.
