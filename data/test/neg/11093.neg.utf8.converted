I usually buy Brazilian Nuts from amazon.com,this time my wife decided to give me this 5 pounds for my birthday.<br />The shipping and delivery time was wonderful, but he quality of these nuts are the worst ones that I ever got, some those nuts are stale and 99% of bags are composed with nuts cut in half.<br />I don't recommend this product to anybody.
