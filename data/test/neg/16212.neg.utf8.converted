I ordered a quart of "pure sorghum syrup" and it was delivered in good condition, packaged well, and arrived quickly to my doorstep.  That is where the compliments end.  This was not sorghum.  It was pale and sweet with a weird aftertaste, and had a taste more like karo corn syrup than anything that is like sorghum molasses.  I was very disappointed and had to throw it out since no one would eat it.  If you like karo corn syrup on your pancakes this is for you.  Sadly not for me.
