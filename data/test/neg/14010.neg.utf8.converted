I've seen the commercial, some mystery chef cutting up chicken breast while his dog drools, then he sets down a bowl of kibble for him. Why not feed the actual meat? because there certainly isnt any in this food<br /><br />Keep in mind that when a fresh meat is listed on the ingredient label its not true. The manufacturer lists ingredients based on weight prior to extrusion(cooking), since meat is 80% water, once cooked, it goes way down the list. So you are primarily feeding a ton of soy mixed in with mystery meat and a bunch of other cheap ingredients leftover from human food production like byproducts, wheat and corn. Also soy is responsive for hormonal disruption, so you may want to read up on that.<br /><br />this food is cleverly marketed junk thats very low quality, you can check the unbiased review yourself on dog food advisor website.
