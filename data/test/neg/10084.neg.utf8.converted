If you knew the dangers of aspartame you would not be consuming this drink with this artificial sweetener in it.<br /><br />I would recommend to do some homework on the dangers of artificial sweeteners and you will know what I am saying.  There is plenty of information on the subject.  If you have any kind of health problem,  suffer from any kind of malady and have no clue what is causing it and you consume any beverage or food that has aspartame,  nutrasweet,  splenda, sucralose any artificial sweeteners a like I would recommend stop consuming the foods and drink immediately.<br /><br />I personally do not like the taste of artificially sweetened foods and drink.  I have a strong sense of taste and can tell immediately if something is sweetened with this crap.  I have inadvertently consumed foods and drink that has artificial sweetener in it without my knowing and I could tell immediately by the horrible after taste it leaves me.  But besides the taste the dangers of this rubbish is what deters me from consuming it along with MSG (monosodium glutamate.
