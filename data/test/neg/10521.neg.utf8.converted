I am choosing two stars because it is very good mustard, but only that.  The reviews for this same mustard from other sellers can give the impression that this is some mind-blowing experience, but I am very disappointed that it is nothing better than Grey Poupon, though more expensive.  Obviously I like Grey Poupon, but I was looking for something with a lot more bite to it, such as some of those I had tried in France several years ago.  I'll keep looking.
