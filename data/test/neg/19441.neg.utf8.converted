I purchased chocolate covered gummy bears from "Candy Zone" and they were not very good. They were stale, the chocolate was poor quality and the gummy bears were all the same type/color: clear. Overall I was pretty bummed out as I've had GOOD chocolate covered gummy bears before and these just didn't measure up. Finally they were really EXPENSIVE.
