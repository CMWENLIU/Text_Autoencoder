I got a bag of this litter to try out in my ScoopFree litter box since I'd like a litter I can subscribe to.  Sadly, the fineness of the litter makes urine clump which causes it to jam the automatic box.<br /><br />It also seems that the litter became very wet and soupy 3 days after being put in the box.  Following the "1 cat - 1 bag - 1 month" formula, this litter should have lasted my 2 cats for 2 weeks, not just 3 days!
