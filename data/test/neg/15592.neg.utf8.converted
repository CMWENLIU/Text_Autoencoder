I have never written a review before but feel I must based on the terrible quality of this product. Before trying it, it smelled and looked fine. The nutritional profile is very good-protein, fiber, carbs, calories-but the taste is horrendous. I am personally content with bland foods, odd flavors and eat an almost sugar free diet. But when this stuff hits your mouth, the taste resembles that of soil mixed with feces. I mixed 2 tablespoons (half the serving size) with 4oz unsweetened almond milk and on the first sip I uncontrollably gagged. I immediately added a whole packet of stevia and that still didn't sufficiently mask the taste. It is completely obvious that the manufacturer spent all the money on finding a way to isolate the protein and absolutely NONE on taste, or taste testing.<br />Based on another review, I purchased Living Harvest. It is super delicious! It does have sugar in it, but not much. There's only 7 grams. The protein content is only 10 grams, but it's edible-which is more than I can say for Manitoba. I tried mixing the Manitoba with the Living Harvest, but it instantly turned it un-palatable.
