I ordered this candy bar (as I have done with other sites) and I just received it. It came with no type of cooling agent in the box, so I got 24 melted candy bars. I called Amazon and they were happy to refund the cost. However, having ordered perishable items before, they always came with some type of cooling agent in them so the items would be in the same fashion as they were shipped. Think twice about ordering these candy bars. By the way, Amazon was not the shipping agent. These came from a seller who didn't bother to send me an email as to who to contact.
