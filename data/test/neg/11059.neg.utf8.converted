This salt is only $5.00 from the manufacturer's website, celticseasalt . c o m , further more this website and this manufacturer is highly deceptive, and it is obvious by the comments on this website. all modern sea salt has significantly less trace minerals than ancient himalayan sea salt. the manufacturer provides a graph that seems to indicate this salt has more than 3 times the trace minerals, when all they are really comparing is the moisture content. you are paying for about 12% water when you buy this product by weight, which is about 3 times the amount of water in himalayan salt.<br /><br />Himalayan salt forms an alkaline solution in water, due to its higher trace mineral content, while all modern sea salt forms acidic solutions. this salt does have a decent flavor, which i find goes well with fish, but for all other cooking, himalayan salt is both tastier and healthier. a lot of reviewers have been duped by the spurious and misleading information on the manufacturers website. this salt has a significantly lower ratio of trace minerals to sodium than himalayan salt.<br /><br />Finally, the mercury and other heavy metal content in modern sea salt is much higher than in himalayan salt. harvesting "deep water" which protects against many organic pollutants that float like gasoline in a street puddle, does nothing to prevent the increased levels of mercury, cadmium, arsenic and other heavy metals from getting into the salt.
