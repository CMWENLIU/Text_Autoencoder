I have nothing against Hamburger Helper, and especially like this particular flavor.  But I was shocked to find that the "Best If Used By" date was August of this year, and I bought the packages in June.  This is a much much faster expiration date than if I were to purchase this item in the supermarket.  So, the price is great, but WHY IS AMAZON SELLING OLD FOOD?!
