While most pieces taste like mango it is not a very good mango taste.  Pieces range from 1" X 1" X 1/8" squares to 1/4" x 1/4" fragments.  It is very dry, the mental image of eating thin strips of leather form in my mind when I eat it.<br />A bag of dried mango lasts a max of one day in our house.  The first bag is still half full after 3 weeks.<br />As you can probably guess I won't be buying more.
