I've had this trap for 6 weeks plus and it's activated no less than 6 times. Quite simple it is junk, a flawed designed that cannot be improved. Every time it has activated it pushes itself out of the ground. With no penetration of the spikes in to the ground it lays lopsided...no affect on the mole. I have moved it around the yard (grass, dirt, and sand), tried deeper sets, and making a depression underneath the activation plate. But out of all the activations there is nothing to show for it. Absolutely buy something else, anything else.
