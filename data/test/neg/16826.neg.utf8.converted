Especially for this price, I expected this product to arrive in the famous white box with the individual cups and the map in the lid, NOT loose in a brown cardboard box with a scrap of white wax paper between the tape and the loose jelly beans.  No ziplock bag, not even cheap clear plastic bag, just the brown cardboard box (the outside was white).  Yes, the website says to read everything carefully.  No, there is no picture of a Jelly Belly box.  I just had my own expectations, and I wanted to give you my opinion.<br /><br />Good luck.
