Unless you like your cereal mushy in 10 seconds or less, don't bother with this one.  My kids all hated it.  I think the cereal shell was the problem.  It seemed to leave a taste in your mouth. Truthfully, I've tried to think of a cereal it reminds me of, but so far, I can't think of one.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this cereal, as I love chocolate and am always looking for a way to sneak chocolate into my breakfast, but I think I would have been better off just eating a Hershey bar.<br /><br />This cereal was a sad, mushy mess.
