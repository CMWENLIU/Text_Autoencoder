I recently visited a Cracker Barrel and bought a box or Dubble Bubble Original Flavor bubble gum. I remember chewing this gum as a kid, it was my favorite gum because of its great flavor. After I had a taste for the gum again, I wanted more and I am 100 miles away from the nearest Cracker Barrel, so I checked on Amazon, my go to place. I was excited to see they had it and two separate listings. One for "original" and a regular flavor. The tub that I received is not the original flavor bubble gum, even though it specifically states that it is on the product listing. This is the plain, old, gross, generic flavor they changed to a couple of years ago.<br /><br />If you are looking for the cinnamon/clove flavor you remember growing up, this is NOT the gum you are looking for, you will be disappointed.
