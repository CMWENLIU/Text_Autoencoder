This rice milk powder was terrible.  2 of the canisters arrived damaged and spilled all over the package.  It simply doesn't mix well leaving clumps everywhere which no amount of mixing seems to help.  Might be better if use a blender.  I bought this for long-term storage (similar to those who buy milk powder) so guess I'll pray I never have to use it.
