This is a very tasty tea, but you should be very careful if you are pregnant.  I decided to check the ingredients before drinking it.  As it turns out, there is some debate regarding the very first ingredient, raspberry leaf.  It is unclear whether this is safe early in a pregnancy, or whether it should only be used at the end...when trying to induce labor.  Rather than take any chances, I threw the stuff out!<br /><br />I think the manufacturer should warn people not to consume this during early pregnancy, or at least advise of the risks.  The advertising is irresponsible, in my view.  No more Yogi products for me.
