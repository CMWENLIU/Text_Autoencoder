Well I did find their radio ad & music enticing ("Dinner at eight, San Pellegrino...").<br /><br />Talk about incongruity.  Read the LABEL. CO3 added.  This is flat water pumped up with artificial carbonation.  At least they reveal it, unlike another mineral water company which hid this fact.<br /><br />Conclusion: does not belong in the same catagory as waters that are bottled in their true carbonated state.<br /><br />Save your money, buy a 12pk of seltzer or club soda in 12 oz cans for about four bucks.  Reason for recommending cans: once you open a bottle or can of sparkling water, they go flat in no time flat (no pun intended).
