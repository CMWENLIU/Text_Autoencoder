Im 30 yrs old. I have bought candy cigarettes my entire life. I actually bought 14 packs a few days ago from the ice cream man. Tasted wonderful, the same as always. THE ONES I ORDERED ON AMAZON WERE NOT THE SAME. ABSOLUTELY NOT THE SAME!!!!!!!!!!!!! Different taste/flavor, different texture, different moisture content... YET... the boxes are printed the same. The ingredients are listed the same. The manufacturer is the same. How then is it possible that the ones I bought 3 days ago so good and the Amazon ones to disgusting?!?!?! I do not know. All I know is, I WISH I HAD SEEN THESE REVIEWS BEFORE I BOUGHT 38 DOLLARS WORTH, 1200CANDY CIGARETTES FROM AMAZON. Of coarse to get a refund I must pay shipping. Total shipping... 24 dollars. Total refund... 28 dollars. I only receive 4 dollars of my money back and lose the product. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE TASTE BUDS AND A MEMORY IN YOUR BRAIN OF THE REAL FLAVOR. I am very disappointed and will NEVER buy from Amazon ever again. I had a gift card, only reason I did this. A gift from the parents of a 15 year old disabled child I work with on a volunteer basis. Thank you amazon. THANKS FOR NOTHING. Plus they lied to me by saying no one has ever complained about this... I saw at least 3 or 4 on this page alone. DO NOT TRUST AMAZON. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING WITHOUT REVIEWING IT FIRST. IF THERE IS EVEN ONE BAD REVIEW TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. I bet the good one are fake and used to support false claims as I personally know their claims are 100% false. I will be posting this on message boards and facebook all over to inform everyone I know.
