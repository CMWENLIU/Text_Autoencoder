This shampoo and conditioner is really creepy.  The first day I used it, I felt like my head was in a fog.  I figured it was just the summer heat, but after four days, I figured out the connection and stopped using it.  I immediately felt better.  This product also made the skin around my scalp, neck, and shoulders feel really difference than normal.  It maeks me wonder what the heck is in there.  I recommend avoiding it.
