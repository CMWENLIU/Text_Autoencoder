I ordered this just because of a special deal going on at Amazon. It turns out they were being sold cheap for a reason. Just one packet contains 38% sodium which is too much. And the problem is that you can taste the nasty oil and too much salt due to so much sodium which I think is added as preservative. Would not recommend for regular eating. If you have ever eaten Indian meals, this is totally not what you expect from them.<br /><br />Tried it on my friends too and they all hated it.
