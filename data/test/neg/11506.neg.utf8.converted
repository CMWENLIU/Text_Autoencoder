I bought these "flours" as kind of a funny/romantic gift for my wife. She was quite happy at first until she tried to actually use the flour.  When she opened the packs, every one was full of weevils! Disgusting. We had only had them for a few days before she opened them. I'm confident the weevils did not come from our home, especially since we have never had the problem before with any of our flour. I would return these, but not worth the hassle.<br /><br />I certainly do NOT recommend buying this flour.
