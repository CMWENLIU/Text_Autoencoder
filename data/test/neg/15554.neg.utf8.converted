The formula seems much healthier than Nutella, but some parts were too salty. Absolutely not satisfying as Nutella.<br />Also, my package had some chocolate outside. Why? The package was sealed internally and the pot was not broken, so I don't know why there was chocolate on the outside part of the lid. Poor handling at the factory?<br />Better would be something between this and Nutella.
