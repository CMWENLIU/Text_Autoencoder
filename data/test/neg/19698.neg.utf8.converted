Amazon website automatically suggest these pods with Nesspresso machines.  These pods are huge and INCOMPATIBLE with Nesspresso machines.  Please beware of that.  The coffee maybe good, but it's advertized with the wrong products.  As far as I can see the Amazon is not selling Nesspresso pods at all.
