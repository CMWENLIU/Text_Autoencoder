Two bites because the first bite was so horrible I couldn't believe anything could really be that bad.<br /><br />How a reputable company can put its name to a product like this defies credulity.  Dinty Moore Beef Stew is bad but edible as a last resort to avoid starvation; they should have left bad-enough alone.<br /><br />I'm a good cook and buy almost no pre-made foods like this, but there are a handful I think worth keeping on hand for emergencies. One of them has long been Sweet Sue's Chicken & Dumplings; perfectly edible heated right out of the can, but w/the addition of a poached & shredded chicken breast and its reduced broth, a splash of white wine, a shake of Penzey's Fox Point seasoning, some minced parsley,  it is quite presentable in a pinch and my grandchildren love it. (I once took a tweaked batch of it--6 big cans--to a church potluck, and one of the best cooks in the church (NC girl)  said, "Good job on the C&D!" :o)<br /><br />Compared to Dinty Moore's abomination, Sweet Sue's is 3 star Michelin.  Let me try to describe the former.  What you see first when you open the can is a translucent gelatinous sludge (thickened w/potato starch, I read).  If you move it around you see it envelops certain solids.  The almost non-existent chicken is pulpy, like ground chicken paste reformed in small lumps. The dumplings are hard, tough as shoe leather!  (How did they manage THAT?)  The taste I can't begin to describe.  A blindfolded person would never in a million years connect it with chicken.<br /><br />If you think I exaggerate, waste ~$14 (incl. shipping) on a can  (FOURTEEN DOLLARS????) and chalk it up as preventive health care.
