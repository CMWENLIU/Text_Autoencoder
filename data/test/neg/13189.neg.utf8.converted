This product seemed very good at first and at first, i loved it. However, around 2 months after using it, i discovered i was always itching my outer thigh and the area directly behind my armpits (i was using the new dove deodorant also) was getting very dry (something very uncommon for me because my skin rarely dries out). After changing my body wash and deodorant (about 3 weeks later) my symptoms are beginning to leave. This product is very harmful to your skin and it doesn't manifest its negative consequences until it's too late. The dry skin is almost impossible to get rid of and even now (almost 2 months after i stopped using this product), my itchy skin is still evident. I went to my dermatologist and he said that the irritation was caused by the chemicals in this body wash and it could take a long time for the irritation to recede because of how long i was using the product. I would never recommend the men's product line to anyone (but "regular" dove products have always been a favourite of mine). Stick with the brands that have been around for a long time - Axe, old spice, etc
