I'm a *BIG* fan of the Vitalicious VitaTop products ("maximum nutrition for minimum calories")--especially the Deep Chocolate version--so I was eager to try the BlueBran mix.  But I have to say I was disappointed with this product. Don't be fooled by the photo on the box, people! The "blue bran" name is misleading--I found approximately 3 freeze-dried blueberry 'chips' in my batter. You will definitely need to add your own fresh or frozen blueberries to the mix, otherwise you'll just have plain old bran muffins.<br /><br />Even after I added fresh blueberries to my batter, the end product was not very good--it was gooey and bland, with a weird after-taste.  My family usually inhales the Vitalicious products, but these are still in the freezer.<br /><br />I have two boxes of the mix left, so I'm going to try adding chunks of apple to the next batch, along with some cinnamon to give it some flavor, and see if I get a better result.  Bottom line: Skip these and go for the Vitalicious Deep Chocolate mix.
