I ordered three bags, not realizing they were 4 lb. bags.  The add made me think it was a 33# bag because the price of 50 something dollars was slashed through like this was some big sale.  I fell for it, but you can believe I will be a lot more careful in the future.  I have bought quite a bit from Amazon and it makes me unhappy that they would let this go on.  If someone would mislead on size/price, what else would they mislead you on.
