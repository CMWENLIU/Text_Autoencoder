A very nutritrious and delicious soup from Amy's not offered in the organic sections of grocery stores in my area of the U.S. But about a quarter of the cans in the case were dented, and therefore, not acceptable for long term storage.<br /> I wouldn't buy a dented can from a store, and therefore am dismayed that Amazon would ship damaged goods.<br /> If Amazon is getting a good price on this product because the cans are dented already, the product should be advertized as such. I don't like being sent a case of canned goods with the cans in the middle of the case crushed. What's up with that?<br /> I have been satisfied with the condition of other canned goods bought vie Amazon - but buyer beware.<br /> It is not worth my time to complain and return.<br /> But I won't buy Amy's soups through Amazon again, and in the future, will REALLY question whether buying ANY canned goods through Amazon is worth it - even if the price is right -  considering that the goods may or may not arrive damaged.<br /> Hey Amazon, Honesty is the best policy. It's not a "deal" if you send me damaged goods.
