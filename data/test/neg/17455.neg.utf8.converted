I've purchased this item a number of times and had been satisfied until my most recent order.  Aside from only including 28 bully sticks (rather than 30), they were all tiny.  On average, the sticks in my most recent shipment were only about 1/3 as thick as previous shipments and are absolutely nothing like the photo of the product.  Some were no thicker than a pencil.  I'm pretty sure my Goldendoodle will be able to eat one of these in less than a minute, which defeats the purpose.<br /><br />I was previously a satisfied customer, so I'm really disappointed in the sudden and completely unacceptable downturn in quality.
