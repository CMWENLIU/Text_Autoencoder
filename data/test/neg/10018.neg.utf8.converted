I just got these figs yesterday, I'm totally disappointed. I saw good reviews about this product, so I think I'll be safe to buy since at least 4 people thought they are good. The figs are moist but hardly have any taste, and they sure smell a little funny. I let other family members tried them, they said the same. I just wonder did I get a bad batch of figs.
