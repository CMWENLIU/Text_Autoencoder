I sent this item to a close relative for Christmas.  Having read the reviews on this product, I purchased it.  In talking with this relative I was told the item was "cute".  A bit confused I asked what was in the basket.  There were 13 boxes in the basket all containing ONE piece of whatever was on the front of the box (i.e. - Chocolate covered pretzel - contained ONE pretzel, Biscotti - contained three, 1" biscotti's (seriously...1" each), cookie(s) - ONE cookie, etc.).  Total in all - 13 boxes all with 1 item per box (give or take).  Since this basket was for 2 people, I have a hard time trying to figure out who will get the single pretzel or the "luxury" of the 3 - 1" biscotti's!<br /><br />Shipping date and speed was o.k. but having paid basically, $40.00 for this basket was definitely not worth it.  Will not order this item again and would hesitate about ordering another product from this company.
