I'm not sure what the other reviewers killed with this, but we used this product in our yard, (and yes we used as directed) and ants are crawling everywhere, still, even on the patio. Also we have a horrendous tick problem, still... we sprayed the yard, bombed and powdered the house and shampooed and dipped the dog... 2 days later he is covered in ticks. Mind you this is a dog that goes outside only to do his business and comes right back in.
