Time to order more cheddar bunnies.  But, wait, the packaging is new.  On further reading on this site, new information is provided - an alert that they are manufactured on shared equipment with peanuts and tree nuts.  No!!  These were great for my grandson who has those allergies.  The previous cheddar bunnies (snack packs)contained wheat and milk - and were manufactured on equipment that also processed egg and soy.  They used to be perfect.  Now, they will no longer be on my shelf.  So sad.
