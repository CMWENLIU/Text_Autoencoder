I purchased this product for a gift for someone who liked to reminisce about his old days are kid and the candy he use to eat all the time. After seeing this thought it would be a good gift. However, he opened and wanted to share some without and we found out that all of the candy was stale and was inedible. I would not recommend this product for anyone even if they price were to drop.
