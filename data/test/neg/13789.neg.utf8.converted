Note that the description provided by the...(?)...producer or merchant of this product says it's filled with "gurlic."  Maybe that's true.  However, the primary ingredient of this "seasoning" is nothing but MSG.  Then it has pepper.  Then some more MSG.  Then maybe a few specks of some type of powder, which I presume is some derivative of MSG.  Then it has one flake of oregano.  Then it has MSG.  Then it has one speck of parsley flakes.  Then it claims to have onion powder, but I think it's just more MSG.  Finally, it has MSG-powder, MSG-salt and MSG-flakes.  Perfect stuff for your next MSG-induced nightmare headache, the likes of which you've never known.  Other than that, you'll probably like this stuff.<br /><br />Edited to respond to the lone critic who claims this does NOT have MSG...an individual I can only surmise is a shareholder or employee of Goya...so, here's the ingredient list for you people, since he, while claiming it has no MSG (not true), failed to provide it himself:<br /><br />Ingredients: Salt, Granulated Garlic, Tricalcium Phosphate (prevents caking), Monosodium Glutamate, Oregano, Black Pepper, Tumeric, Onion Powder, Spices.<br /><br />Note that "spices" can also be termed to include MSG as well, but here they go the extra measure and at least spell it out for you...something this other reviewer must have missed or be unable to read.<br /><br />So, there you have it.  Enjoy your MSG.
