Thank goodness every drink that is 'GOOD FOR YOU' doesn't taste like this.  I rec'd the pomagra/acai flavor and it was absolutely awful.  I mixed it right after reading it several times, not that it was that hard to understand but it was just small print on the package. Mixed the powder with water and tasted it and wanting it to taste decent and it tasted like a nasty mediciny syrup you might have gotten as a kid. I left it on the sink and went back later thinking my taster might have been off but NO, it was just as nasty this time.  Down the sink it went.
