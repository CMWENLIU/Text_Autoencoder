Product arrived end of October-1st of November 2009.<br />All packages (60) were marked with "pull date" of 3 November 2009.<br />This PROBLEM appears to becoming worse on Amazon, and Amazon vendors.<br />Had a similiar problem with expired dates on OTC medications ordered via Amazon.<br />I'm just about done ordering anything perishable and OTC medications, until things improve!<br />  RS
