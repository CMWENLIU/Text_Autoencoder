** This review was done for the old formula - see update below for review of the "improved" formula **  Last year, I stumbled across a website that evaluates your current breakfast cereal for nutrition, satiety, etc. and this cereal was at the top of the recommended list as an alternative to my former option.  I've always found that original Special K left me more hungry and the suggested serving size was laughable.  The artificial chocolate pieces in Choco. Delight were vile, so with those strikes, I was a bit reluctant to try Protein Plus.  It didn't help that some reviewers didn't like the taste - ordering 4 boxes that I'd be stuck with was uncomfortable, but I went for it.<br /><br />That was nearly a year ago and this has been my "go to" cereal ever since.  I think it tastes pretty good, so I advise that you decide for yourself on taste.  It has a light and sweet cinnamon flavor, I love the added protein and it's very low in sugar (2 g's per .75 cup serving). The flakes are sturdy (great crunch) and dense - not airy at all - holds up well in skim milk or yogurt, but I typically eat it straight up - out of my handy measuring cup.  I don't need to sweeten it at all and a serving size, or just over, leaves me satisfied (really hard to do) and a box seems to last me awhile - another huge plus.  I even carry a bag as a snack - especially when I travel - so that I'm not tempted to make less healthy choices. While I can't give all the credit to Protein Plus, as part of an overall reduced calorie daily intake attempt, I've lost 20 lbs in the past year - and although near my goal - have no intention of taking this off my grocery list.<br /><br />**Update 8.5.12** - the  formula and stats have indeed changed, and significantly IMO.  I am not thrilled and I wish they left well enough alone.  Examples:  Calories from 100 to 120, Sugar (now the 3rd ingredient) from 2-3 to 7 grams (double - really?!), fiber and protein same, but the old box claims 5 grams of fiber when the fine print says 3.  The new box just has 3.  Other stats have changed too, I just don't have the old box available to refer to.  I am eating the new boxes since I have 4 from Subscribe and Save, but I got no warning of the change and there is a huge difference in texture, sweetness, etc.  Overall, it tastes okay, but it lost its edge.  I have cancelled this S&S and I am going to look locally to see if I can still find the old formula and stock up.  Big fat BOO to Kellogg's - other than the easier opening inner sack,this was a stupid move.  If I could choose no stars - I would.  I have found the old formula locally and I am stocking up!
