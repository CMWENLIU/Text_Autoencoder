I was excited to find ZICO on auto delivery, but really disappointed in the new packaging and recipe.  I ordered 2 boxes and they had a plastic after taste.  I thought maybe it was just this batch...so I waited for my next order. Same thing taste like plastic and made from concentrate.  It use to be so good!<br /><br />Cancelled my subscription today!
