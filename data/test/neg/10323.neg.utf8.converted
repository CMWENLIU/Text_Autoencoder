The product is great! However Amazon does not seem to know how to deal with the international market.  These are produced by Ferrero in Italy or at least in Europe. If one does a simple search in Amazon for this product you find two correct results and many fake results - the fake results are for a Hazelnut product (another Ferrero product but NOT Mon Cheri) The first product costs only $13 dollars with product count of 60 the second product costs $20 dollars for a product count of 30 (1/2) !!!<br />The first provider will not accept a shipping address in Italy (EU) - The second provider will accept a shipping address in Italy - however at more than twice the cost of the product!!!!  $50 shipping on a $20 product!<br /><br />AMAZON is clearly colaborating in this activity - AMAZON - GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER  Amazon should be responsible for doing the appropriate market research for a just and fair international market -- if not - what is Amazon as a world market provider doing for us???
