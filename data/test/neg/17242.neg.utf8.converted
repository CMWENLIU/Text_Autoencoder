This may look like a less expensive alternative to Roundup Extended Control, but here's the real deal:<br /><br />Roundup Extended Control:<br /><br />One bottle of concentrate (1 qt) makes 5 gallons and covers 1,500 square feet.  It's advertised to prevent new growth for up to 4 months.  In my experience, this is more like 4-6 months, even on gravel covered ground during the AZ monsoon season.  Cost at the time of this writing = about $35 (but I've found it for less at a popular big box Home Outlet).<br /><br />Ortho Ground Clear:<br /><br />One bottle of the "concentrate" (1 qt) makes 1 gallon and covers only 75 square feet. It's advertised to prevent new growth for up to 1 year, but when you open up the label on the bottle you'll find this figure revised to 6-8 months for areas of "heavy rainfall."  Cost at the time of this writing = about $10.  If you want it to cover the same 1,500 square feet as $35 worth of Roundup Extended Control, you'll need to spend $200 on 20 bottles of Ortho Ground Clear.<br /><br />I think I'll stick with the Roundup.<br /><br />By the way, the instructions on the bottle of Ground Clear tell you to mix 1 quart into 1 gallon, but the bottle is only labeled in oz and mL.  Somebody in the label making department wasn't paying attention.
