Illy can be celebrated as the creator of coffee pods, the best way to get a decent espresso (but not a great espresso)without being a full fledge barista and a US$ 10.000 espresso machine.<br /><br />Illy are the most expensive pods, however they come in a metal can packed in bulk. Other coffee pods come individually packed in sealed bags with nitrogen atmosphere, but Illy packs them in bulk. Great first time you open the can, awful 5 days later.<br /><br />Bottom line: A coffee scam.<br /><br />Regards from sunny chilean summer.<br /><br />Eduardo Costoya
