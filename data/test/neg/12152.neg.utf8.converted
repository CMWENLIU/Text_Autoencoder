Different than hot chocolate, tastes ok, slightly watery. Picked up a 12 pack from the grocery store to try it before ordering in bulk. A 12 pack was 6.99 or .5825 each. Using that price this site is has an extra 16.00 packed in the price. They should ship FedEx next day free for their price !!!!!!!!! Bet this doesn't stay posted very long.<br />Norm CT
