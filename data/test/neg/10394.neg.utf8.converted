I ordered this product at the beginning of February intending to us it for a Valentines Day gift for my parents.  As of today, March 3rd, I still have yet to receive it!  I'm extremely disappointed!  I've tried numerous times to contact the company via email but have yet to have any sort of response from them.  You can bet that this has already been charged to my card yet I have nothing to show for the charge.  I would appreciate some sort of customer service here!  This sure does make me think negatively about ordering items thru this company and thru Amazon again.  Egad! By the way, I wouldn't give this review any stars but this format wouldn't allow for that.
