Dear Ladies/Gentlemen; As the title implies, this "product" is really a ghost.  A tincan with nothing in it; (not even a seed.)  I have been gardening for 50yrs and should have known better than to purchase something on the internet.  I'll stick to my local sources for garden plants from now on.<br />Sincerely; Tom J
