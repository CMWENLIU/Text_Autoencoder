I'm not rating Pepsi itself because pepsi soda is wonderful tasting. I'm rating the price, which is a complete rip off. I'm currently a cashier at Kmart. Customers are constantly purchasing the 12 packs for about $3-$5 per case (so $9-$15 for 36 cans total), depending on if it's on sale or not. You can even go into most grocery stores for around the same price.<br /><br />Bottom line, save your money and take a trip to your local grocery store or other stores with a grocery section to save money.
