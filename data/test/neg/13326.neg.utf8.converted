I got these in hopes that I could replace some of my snacking habits with something a little healthier.  First of all, I love edamame in its normal form, cooking them like lima beans.  Unfortunately, either I got a bad batch, or my taste has changed.  I can only eat one or two beans before they get a funky aftertaste.  They are nice and crunchy, and just salty enough, but for some reason, the taste is off-putting.  Don't think I will buy these again.
