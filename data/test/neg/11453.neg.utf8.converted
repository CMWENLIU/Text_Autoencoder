The product is labeled as having "zero grams" trans fat, but it also has "partially-hydrogenated coconut or palm kernel" [sic] on the online ingredient list as of Nov 2007.  Note that "Partially-hydrogenated oil" is "trans-fat".<br /><br />The law in the united states allows them to claim "zero grams" if they have 500 milligrams or less.<br /><br />I will quote from the following article<br /><br />Mozaffarian et al "Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease,"<br />The New England Journal of Medicine, volume 354, pages 1601-1613 (2006).<br /><br />to explain why this is really terrible:<br /><br />I quote from page 1609 of this article:<br /><br />"However, the producers of foods that contain less<br />than 500 mg of trans fatty acids per serving will<br />be allowed to list the content of trans fatty acids<br />as 0 on the packaging, so even consumers who<br />read the labels might unwittingly consume substantial<br />amounts of trans fats in multiple servings<br />(for example, several pats of margarine or<br />several cookies per day)."<br /><br />Here are a few more quotations from this article:<br /><br />"given the 1.2 million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths from<br />CHD ["coronary heart disease"] in the United States,82 near-elimination of<br />industrially produced trans fats might avert between<br />72,000 (6 percent) and 228,000 (19 percent)<br />CHD events [i.e. "heart attacks"] each year.<br />These estimates are based on the replacement<br />of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however,<br />trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils<br />would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated<br />(cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have<br />additional potential benefits as compared with<br />carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit<br />is considered, greater proportions of CHD<br />events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted."<br /><br />Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only 2-3% of the american diet in terms of calories (and fat is high in calories!):<br /><br />"The average consumption of industrially produced trans<br />fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed."<br /><br />They conclude<br /><br />"On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental<br />studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational<br />studies, the consumption of trans fatty<br />acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides<br />no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable<br />potential for harm."<br /><br />Professor Willett has also written extensively about trans-fat for a general audience in his book "Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide for Healthy Eating."
