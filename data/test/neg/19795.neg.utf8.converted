It doesn't look healthy when I got it, but I thought I should give it a chance. But now, all the leave are gone.I am not sure if it will show a sign of life or I just wasted my money.<br />The other two bonsai are doing well. Still wondering why this flowering plant which looks so beautiful in the picture, might become a disappointment- I hope not....
