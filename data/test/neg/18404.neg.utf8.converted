I am a first time owner. I read that it is best to feed a puppy higher quality foods instead of the big commercial brands. After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try Wellness Super5 for Puppies. Worst mistake I ever made. My little bully's stool was never firm. It did however make his coat very shiny. But he developed a very bad case of diarrhea. He stopped eating and drinking for a day. I was so worried about the lil guy. After an overnight stay (& a very expensive vet bill), my lil bully returned home full of energy. The vet recommened that he would have to eat canned Purina EN for the rest of his life. Realizing that they really just wanted my money, I decided to switch his food. I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case. I started the "at home remedy" of pepto bismol and a bland diet. The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well. BJ fasted for 24 hours. After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared. I slowly started mixing the Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. All i can say is BJ is feeling 100% better and his stool is solid!!! This was the result I wanted with Wellness, but I was very disappointed.<br /><br />IF YOU WANT A HEALTHY PET AND A FEW BUCKS SAVED FROM A VET VISIT, PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS FOOD!
