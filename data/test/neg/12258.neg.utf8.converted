The order arrived in the stated delivery time frame and in good condition. That was the only thing satisfactory about this order and the only reason it got one star. The pumpkin seeds were very over toasted and covered in a white powder that turned to a paste consistency when wet. I have brought pumpkin seeds from many vendors and have never encountered this white powder. I suspect the powder was added to cover up the fact that the seeds were so very over toasted that they turned brown. I tossed these pumpkin seeds in the trash and suggest that no on e buys from this vendor.
