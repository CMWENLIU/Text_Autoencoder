My 1 yr old Pomeranian loved licking and nibbling on the treat on the ball. He had a blast with it until it started coming apart. It seems that in less than an hour my dog had destroyed it. He chewed the rubber trying to get to the treat. I threw away the ball so he wouldn't accidentally eat it. It was a good idea but needs to be stronger like the Kong.
