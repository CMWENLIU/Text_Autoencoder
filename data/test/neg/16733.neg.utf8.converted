I bought these at the grocery and was pretty pumped... organic juice boxes! Sweet. Well, not really. They are pretty watered down. After slurping on one, I flipped the grape over - 10% juice. Water and cane sugar top the list of ingredients. Pretty tasteless and I feel like a bit of a sham. I can flavor my glass of water with a spritz of grape or berry. (Beware the Berry Berry Lemonade flavor is 5% juice). I will go back to Apple and Eve (60% fruit and veggie juice) or Juicy Juice (100%, though possibly from China) until I find a better organic juice box.
