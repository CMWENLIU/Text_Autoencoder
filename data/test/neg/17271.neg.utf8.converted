I'll start off by saying that I don't care that these are Kosher.  I bought them because I could get marshmallows in bulk for a gift idea. That said, I'll start with the good.  These marshmallows are longer and skinnier than store-bought.  They have a very pleasant vanilla scent to them as well.  Holding them, they are nice and squishable and if you need to rip them into bits, they're not as gooey-sticky as store bought.<br /><br />As for the bad, I tried these out plain and in hot cocoa.  Raw, they taste and feel like puffy sugar. When half melted in my drink, the sugar crystals really took over and I felt like I was eating sugary grit.  Kids might like this, but if you're expecting a soft, light marshmallow fluff sensation in your drink, either make your own or stick with store-bought.  Because of this, I probably would not buy these again and I most likely will not use these for my gifts.<br /><br />Extra information: Yes, these marshmallows state they are pork free, but to get the gelatin they needed, fish products were used instead.
