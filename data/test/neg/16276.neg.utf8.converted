I was introduced to Giant Sunflower Seeds while on a fishing trip in Oregon. I liked how large they were, (and not too much salt). When I returned home they were hard to find. I went on line. I think I have ordered 3 times, may be 4. Each time the seeds get smaller, and smaller. The last I got in Jan. were no different than any number of others sell. I had written the Co. about this last year, got no response. What set off this writing is. Today I was going to reorder. The price for 6.5 oz. bags was $48.00. As I dug out my invoice from my Jan. order, I found they were $41.00 then. I am old but not stupid. I am sure I can settle for this product from many companies that advertise for some 25% less.
