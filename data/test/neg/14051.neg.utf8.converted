When my Whole Foods store stopped carrying the regular 365 Organic cake mixes, I decided to try Dr. Oetker's.<br /><br />It's edible--but not good.<br /><br />The cake itself is pretty flavorless. There's no rich, decadent chocolate taste. Instead, what you get is a cheap, imitation chocolate bar flavor. The texture of the cake is not terrible--it's not too dense and not so fluffy that it crumbles.<br /><br />If you like moist cake, however, DO NOT FOLLOW THE BAKING TIMES. They are at least 10 minutes too long, so unless you want cake that doubles as a dried out sponge, definitely stay by the oven to find the right time.<br /><br />Overall, this product is not worth the money.<br /><br />Will not buy again.
