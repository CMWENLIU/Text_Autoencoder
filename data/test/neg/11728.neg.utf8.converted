My husband and I love Patak's Tikka Masala cooking sauce (albeit with some tweaking involved), but we did not care for this korma sauce. We found it too sweet and not like the korma curries that we've tasted in Indian restaurants, and we eat Indian food quite often. There's a strong sweet flavor to this sauce which is not found in the korma dishes we've tasted. I guess I could tweak the recipe and add ingredients to minimize the overpowering sweetness but then I'd rather just cook the korma curry from scratch - the whole point of this sauce is to save time and fix an Indian curry with minimal fuss. I would not recommend this particular Patak sauce.
