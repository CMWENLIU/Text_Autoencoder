These freeze-dried liver treats from Pooch Passions are the best ever. My little Shih Tzu and Lhaso Apso love the flavor and texture. They race to their beds at the end of the day to get Pooch Passions treats. (I used Gimborn beef liver treats and wasn't satisfied with them. I even wrote the company when the quality of the treats deteriorated and over half of a bucket would be unusable.) The quality of Pooch Passions Liver Treats is consistently high. These Pooch Passions treats can be cut in half for tiny little guys like mine. I'm 100% satisfied and recommend these without reservation. Pet test them yourself with your dog and you'll soon be buying them in the large 21 ounce bags as I do. BEST EVER TREATS!!!!
