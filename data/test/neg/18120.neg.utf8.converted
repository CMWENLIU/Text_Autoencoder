I increased this rating to 2 stars because the product was edible, the wood packaging is beautiful, and considering the number of 5 star reviews, it is apparent that others found this salmon satisfactory.<br />My family and I are used to and prefer cured salmon that's closer to Lox which I make myself sometimes. This product appears to be cooked by heat or smoking and has a real strong smoke flavor. Unfortunately because of this no one in my family would eat this product.
