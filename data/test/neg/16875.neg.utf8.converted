A friend of mine gave me quite a few jars of this brand baby food leftover from her baby.  I tried the beef first and upon opening it thought it smelled like cat food.  I guess the cat thought so too because she came running.  I tried to feed it to my baby and she spit it out with a dramatic gagging fit.  I gave the food to the cat and she licked the plate clean.
