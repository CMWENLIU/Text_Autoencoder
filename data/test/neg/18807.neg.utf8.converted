I like Knorr products and have used them for many years. I just wish they would reformulate them to cut out the MSG and reduce the salt. These little cubes, which are a great idea, have 800 mg of salt in each one. That's basically the entire cube! They don't even have a good chipotle flavor - I thought they had a fake smoke flavor.<br /><br />Instead of these little cubes, I suggest McCormick's range of MSG and salt free seasonings (found here on Amazon, some with free super-saver shipping). They come in large containers at a great price, and are a better choice for healthy cooking.
