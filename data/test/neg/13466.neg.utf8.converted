I have used Spice Islands Beau Monde for over 25 years.  When I went to purchase it this time, I was directed to this item.  It is no where near the Beau Monde spice I was looking for.  When this arrived all I could smell was clove and cinnamon, neither of which is in the original Beau Monde seasoning.  I have no use for this junk, and it cost me a small fortune.
