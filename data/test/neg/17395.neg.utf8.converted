I got them for sprouting but ended up eating them.  They taste great but for spouting they sucked.  For every 1/4 cup of kernels I got about 20 sprouts.  I called the company on the back of the can and was told first that soaking them overnight like it says on the back of the can is not right.  You should soak them for a couple of hours at most.<br />That didn't work either.  I called again, got another person, a lady, who said soak them no more than 45 minutes.  That didn't work either.  I was told they might be a bad batch that had been stored improperly by the shipper.  I'll never know cause I ate them all.
