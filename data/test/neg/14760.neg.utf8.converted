I really like the flavor, health factor, and value of this organic cereal.  But it contains these incredibly hard bits that do not soften in milk and hurt my teeth and gums like no other food I have ever eaten before.  I actually had two of my molars spread apart by this cereal, which take a long time to heal, with weeks and months of rest between another atempt to eat this cereal, it happend again every time.  And the raisins are also very hard and chewy, which tires out your jaw and makes you wonder to yourself if you are ever going to finish this cereal before lunchtime.
