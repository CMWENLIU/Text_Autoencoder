I have purchased many brands of jerky from Amazon including Oberto. This time what I received was 8 bags of jerky that was very close to inedible. I tried to eat it, but half of it went into the trash. It was'nt old or close to the expiration date, just dry and tough with an unpleasant stale taste. I have ordered Obertos in the past and it was okay, maybe this was just a bad batch. I won't be ordering it again.
