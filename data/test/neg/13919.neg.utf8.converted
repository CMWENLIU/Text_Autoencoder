I also received the wrong tree the first time.  The first tree came quickly but was also the Gardenia tree.  After contacting Amazon they reshipped the correct tree.  It came quickly and was packed properly.  Upon arrival the tree looked good, but it quickly changed.  I have, in the past, grown Bonsai trees with success.  They do require attention and proper watering as well as light and growing conditions.  Both trees came in ceramic pots that did not match the description.  They were different colors and different from the photos on the site.  The gardenia tree did loose most of its leaves, but had new growth somewhat quickly afterwards.  This review is about the tree that I ordered.  This Fukien Tea Tree started to loose all of its leaves and appeared to be in distress.  I kept it watered, gave it great morning and afternoon light and maintained the temp around 75 degrees.  After several weeks, the tree has lost almost all of its green growth.  I had an expert view the tree and this gentleman seemed to think that the soil that the tree was planted in was too dense and didn't allow for any oxygen to reach the roots.  He seemed to think that the Gardenia tree was ok, but not the Fukien Tea tree.  He didn't think that transplanting the tree this soon after receipt would help since these trees need time to adjust to their new surroundings.  Also mentioned in the directions that came with both trees.  He also noticed some fertilizer beads in the soil which to him might also might not be the "ideal" for the tree.  He recommends a water based food mixed in with the water a given to the tree weekly.<br /><br />I wonder if all of these "conditions" were done to the tree since they had to send it to me to correct their "first" error of the wrong tree.<br /><br />Even though I love Amazon, I would recommend to anyone considering purchasing a Bonsai tree to select one from a local source.  These local Bonsai retailers are more interested in helping you get a perfect tree and have more a vested interest in your success than Brussel's does.<br /><br />Not that $50 is that much more than a good bunch of flowers from a florist, you still expect your tree to live for years.
