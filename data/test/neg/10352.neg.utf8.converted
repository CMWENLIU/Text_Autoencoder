When I got the bags, I threw them in the washer for an initial wash, since I plan to use them for groceries. When they came out of the wash, 3 of the 6 bags had their designs peeling off. They looked horrid. Kind of like they were leprous or something. The other 3 bags were still fine, so I hung those out to dry while trying to figure out what to do with the 3 bags that were failing.<br /><br />I tried just peeling the rest of the design off by hand, but that was just making a mess and was taking forever. Plus, a couple areas of the design were still stuck on.  Eventually, I came up with the brilliant idea of tossing the bags back in the washer to see if a second washing, this time with hot water, would remove the rest of the design.<br /><br />Well, after trying a few different things, I ended up just tossing the 3 bags with peeling designs. They were making a mess and looked absolutely awful, so there was no way I was going to use them.<br /><br />Very disappointed with the product. I'm afraid to use the other 3 bags, because I'm guessing they'll end up the same way soon. Poor quality. I'd rather not have any design than have one that peels...
