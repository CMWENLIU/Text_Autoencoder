Two stars is generous for this item's DESCRIPTION. I (and apparently MANY others) cannot find the details of what exactly one is purchasing here. The title is pretty clear "1 piece" which obviously is a misrepresentation, since no one in his right mind would want a 4 lb single cow ear (imagine what the size of the manure pie from THAT cow would look like!!!). I know Merrick is a reputable company, so I don't understand why Amazon has not demanded a detailed description of what is being purchased from them. According to some of the reviewers, they really did get just a single ear in a big box, and that's just ludicrous. Can we get this straightened out once and for all?
