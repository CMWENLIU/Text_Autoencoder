The product is great. My dog has been leaking less since using it so I do recommend the product itself. However, when comparing prices looking for the best deal, I came across the listing from Pet Food Direct and it doesn't give a detailed description of the product. Most of the listings are for a 90 ct bottle and this one was a 45 count bottle. The only way to notice this is if you look closely at the photo of the product and see the "45" on the label. I basically paid about $.50 less for a 45 ct bottle than I would have paid for a 90ct bottle as a result.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BXUWMM">Bladder Strength Dog, 90 Chew Tabs</a>
