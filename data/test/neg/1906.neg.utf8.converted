Didn't care for it. Color is wrong, doesn't have the flavor. Tastes almost as if it were watered down, or, maybe, birch beer lite. Gonna have to try a different brand. I had pretty high hopes, too, as Pa. is the state where I first was exposed to birch beer. Can't recommend this brand. On the off chance that someone reads my reviews, I will sing loud praises when I find one to my taste.
