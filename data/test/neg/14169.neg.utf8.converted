I received these for free on a mailer sample.<br /><br />Made them according to instructions and the result was a watery weak drink that smells if caramel, and in no way any coffee flavor at all.<br /><br />Don't know whats up with these great reviews but it was just colored water with lots of creamy looking foam it didn't have any sort of sweetness to it either and sugar is something I don't consume so anything sweet is usually to sweet.<br /><br />Just bland colored water with creamy foam and a nice smell/aroma.
