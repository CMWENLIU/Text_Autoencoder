first off this company is a joke. they sell expired tea. look at the back of your tea and see how it is expried. mine was expired in 2003 I bought in 2007. stale to say the least. They are crooks and trying to make a fast buck off Japanese culture. I am insulted to say the least.<br /><br />I filed with amazon and reported them to the better business burough.<br /><br />Would you serve your kids a 5 year old bag of chips? how about a five year old box of mac and cheese? this stuff will make you sick!<br /><br />They are the rudest people around and DO NOT SUPPORT THEM!! if you have any respect for Japanese culture you will boycott this company!!!<br /><br />no way will what you get even look remotely what is in the picture! they are a non successful company selling trash!!! Old stock and instead of keeping fresh stock the peddle out olld stock at a high fresh price!!<br /><br />BOYCOTT THEM!!!
