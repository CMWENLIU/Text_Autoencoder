First off, I usually don't write reviews on amazon but given that I feel so strongly I need to warn others. I'm an avid tea drinker and am always looking for new varieties/brands to try. I picked up this one at a local store as it was on sale and looked appetizing. It's advertised as "Organic" and "Premium" in a cute, presentable packaging. To put it bluntly, this is one of the worst teas I've tried in a long time. It's tasteless no matter how long you brew it. There's no aroma to it and it tastes like water. I've checked the expiration and it's got a good 2 years to go so it's not due to prolonged storage. Whatever it is, this tea is worthless and it might be organic but it sure isn't quality.
