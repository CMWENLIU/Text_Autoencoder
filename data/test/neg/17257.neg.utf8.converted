I orderd what was listed as 360 grm metal containers of Nido milk powder.<br />What I received was ones made from cardboard and a different size. I wanted the milk powder in the metal tins as adverized and shown in the illustration. NOT another stock item. The vendor said they were not produced any more. My question is why is this style still shown as being available on the website.? The metal tins work better in a more humid enviroment on my boat, the crdboard ones do not. I'm not happy and I will not order items such as this from Amazon again. I've learned my lesson.
