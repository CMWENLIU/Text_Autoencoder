This product should be labeled naturally sweetened instead of unsweetened.  They are sweetened with cane juice.  They do not have sulphured preservative.<br /><br />Since Mangos are sweet already, why do they even bother.  The following is my theory.  I think this importer gets the mangos un-ripened since they are shipped so far.  They then load them up with sugar to disguise this.  The result is dried mango which is nearly white in color and has very little mango taste to it.  It basically tastes like you're eating a chewy piece of crystalized sugar.<br /><br />Not what I was looking for.  Oh, and Amazon does not allow returns on this product.  Another let down.<br /><br />Country of origin for the mangos was Thailand if anyone cares.
