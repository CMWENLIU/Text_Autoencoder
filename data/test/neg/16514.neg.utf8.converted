WARNING WARNING WARNING! I searched for gluten-free oatmeal raisin cookies on Amazon and these cookies came up on the list. These cookies are NOT gluten free. Yes, they contain no wheat, but instead, they have barley flour. Wheat, barley and rye all have natural gluten and *must* be avoided. Do not buy these if you have Celiac disease -- that is, are gluten intolerant.<br /><br />Amazon should fix their search engine to NEVER display products that are not truly gluten free when people search for such. Even now, on the review form, Amazon is suggesting "gluten free" and "celiac" as tags for this product. That is flat out false.
