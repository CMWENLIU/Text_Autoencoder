I bought these because we love Mrs. May's Almond Crunch, which we've bought at Costco. We like walnuts, too, and thought this snack would be just as good as the almond crunch. Unfortunately it's not. The skin on the walnuts makes the walnut crunch taste bitter and there's a strange kind of health-foody malty taste, too. We kept opening bags thinking the next one would be better, but they were all the same. Buy the almond crunch instead, that's really good.
