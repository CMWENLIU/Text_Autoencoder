I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, but the positive reviews on this product made me hopeful. While mixing the ingredients, a foul smell filled the kitchen. When I poured the batter into the waffle iron, the smell improved slightly. Again... hopeful. Yet while the texture resembled a waffle, the taste was so bad I spit it out immediately. No syrup/whipped creme/fruit can cover up the taste. Skip the batter and try the Atkins Caramel Chocolate Nut Roll instead. Tastes just like a Baby Ruth :)
