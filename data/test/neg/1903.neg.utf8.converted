The product deserves 5 stars, Amazon's packaging deserves 0 stars. Amazon ships sturdy books with more protective packaging than these delicate biscuits had (they were in a cardboard sleeve).  Instead of getting a box of six biscuits, I got a box of crumbs. I wish I were exaggerating, but not one biscuit was even half intact. This was a complete waste of money, and a complete disappointment. I'll buy Viennese Whirls again, but not from Amazon.
