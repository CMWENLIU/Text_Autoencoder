I think the ratings for Mori-Nu Tofu would not be so high if more people were actually aware of what's in it. Mori-Nu's tofu contains soy protein isolate, a highly processed form of soy. As a busy student cooking for myself most nights, I'm always looking for grocery products that will make putting dinner on the table more convenient. But while I was intrigued by the shelf-stability of Mori-Nu Tofu, I'm definitely not counting on it as a staple-- Tofu is considered healthy because it is a fermented soy product, but the soy protein isolate in Mori-Nu's tofu puts it in the category of processed soy, the kind that will mess with your endocrine system if consumed it regularly. This means if you're eating tofu for the health benefits, you may as well look elsewhere. What I've learned is that most tofus packed in water have expiry dates two months ahead (unopened) so you'll only need to replenish your supply every 1 1/2-2 months. Sure, this would save me space in the fridge and I could stock up on a year's worth of tofu if I really wanted to (and I might want to, but a year's worth of tofu is hardly a necessity). But the bottom line is I'm just unwilling to make this highly processed food a staple, particularly when versions that are truly healthy are readily available.
