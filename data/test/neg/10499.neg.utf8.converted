I ordered two of these "fresh, whole rabbits" because I thought they would make excellent pets for my kids.  Imagine our shock, horror, and disgust when they arrived dead and mutilated.  Someone had killed the rabbits, skinned and gutted them, and even cut off their ears!<br /><br />I have ordered a second pair of rabbits, because I can't believe whatever horrible accident befell the first pair could possibly happen again.<br /><br />P.S.: I rated this two stars instead of only one, because we decided to eat the rabbits and they were tasty when sauteed with butter and onions, just like chicken or cat.
