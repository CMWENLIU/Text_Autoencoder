I usually don't write a review but this one I had to.<br />This was truly the WORST CURRY EVER.<br />Don't really need to mention for the taste and card board tofu but there's this strong MSG taste that paralyze your tongue that comes after each swallow. I've tried my best to make this thing eatable by adding fresh ingredients from the fridge but nothing helped. It still tasted awful. Keep away from this one. ....well, keep away from all of their products if you can.
