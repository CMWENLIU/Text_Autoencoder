I have purchased this item from the grocery store previously and really enjoyed it- I am a big fan of anchovies. Unfortunately, every tin in my order revealed a homogenous muck of anchovy goo with a few scattered capers floating about. I have to wonder if the case was aggresively shaken before delivery. It may have just been a fluke, but I am not ordering it again.
