I am writing this to inform you, and save you the headache. Like the others, I saw this 25-pack of snozzles at a price too good to be true, and naively purchased them immediately for my dogs. They were listed and sold by PetCo. When they came, I got one huge box, containing a lot of stuffing paper, and a single tiny snozzle....joke was on me it seems.<br /><br />After this, PetCo emailed me a generic message saying there was a discrepancy with the item listing, and they sent me the wrong amount. I emailed PetCo and never received a response. I checked their seller profile, and found a gigantic archive of negative seller ratings, many of them specifically related to the same issue I was experiencing. I then emailed them a few more times. I'm not surprised they never answered a single one of them. Probably too backed up with hundreds of other emails like mine.<br /><br />I never did get my other 24 snozzles, although they refunded me, probably because I kept emailing them. I gave my dog the single snozzle we got, and they did not even want it. I examined it, and it has a chemical smell to it, and looks old. It is quite unfair how someone does this, and can just get away with it, and one does not even get a personal apology.<br /><br />I have decided to join a few others in going to the Better Business Bureau about this. Hope you decide to join in too.
