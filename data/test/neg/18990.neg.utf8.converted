I ordered this product based on Nutrition Facts posted on the website.  The facts on the packages are different - specifically:<br /><br />Calories -  Web 120 / Package 130<br />Total Fat -  Web 4g / Package 6g<br />Dietary Fiber -  Web 5g / Package 2g<br /><br />I'm very disappointed by the discrepancy between the web presentation and the actual product.
