i purchased the giant gummy bear on a stick for the Girlfriend, on valentines day.  Apperance wise she loved it, but as soon as she was done eating the bears ears, she stopped. Being sweet and polite she told me she was full, but i bought this knowing she loves gummy bears and i finally got it out of her, that it had a bad aftertaste.  Thank god i didnt buy the 5lb one, otherwise i would be writing letters to president giant gummy bear.  All and all i don't regret buying it, because just the look on the loved ones face when they first see the giant blob of high fructose corn syrup and sugar is worth it!
