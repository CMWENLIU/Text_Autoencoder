Maybe my cat is spoiled. We've fed her "Soulistic" brand pouches since the day we brought her home. I saw this product when I last shopped for her food. It looked like a real gourmet scene, so lovely was the image of the food on the packaging. Now, I know there's always a disparity between the box image and the actual fare, but this has to be the most glaring, bald-faced LIE in the history of marketing.<br /><br />When I opened the package (which showed a expiration date well into 2012), I felt confused! Almost like I wasn't sure if my eyes weren't playing tricks on me! The entire brown, gelatinous mess slid out like a giant leech into her bowl. After some desperate prep work, mashing things up, I managed to get this glop to a state where it more resembled something that you'd see sliding down the wall in a monkey's cage.<br /><br />My cat took one sniff, and regarded me with a glance that can only be described as a "how dare you", and strutted away. Hungry, but with dignity in tact.<br /><br />I WILL get a refund for this gunk. Mark my words.
