I love white chocolate and this is nothing like it.  When made according to directions, this tastes like water with some sugar and a little powdered milk in it.  If you use less water in an attempt to make it more flavorful, it still tastes terrible and has a nasty aftertaste.  After looking at the ingredients I understood why - they include the artificial sweetener sucralose.  Now I have to figure out what to do with two boxes of this awful stuff since even my kids won't drink it.
