The output of Green Mountain Cocoa K-cups is highly variable - sometimes it's a well-flavored cup of cocoa, sometimes it's just brown water.<br /><br />This is because sometimes, a significant amount of the cocoa powder stays behind in the cup after the brew cycle. To really get a consistent product, you have to pierce the foil top to see if there is stuff left behind; scoop it out and stir it in, and you get the well-flavored cocoa some reviewers are raving about.<br /><br />This, however, is ludicrous - it defeats the fire-and-forget interaction that makes the Keurig worth it.<br /><br />The only thing that saves the product from a 1-star review is that its quick sugar hit has prevented many an afternoon nap at work. :D
