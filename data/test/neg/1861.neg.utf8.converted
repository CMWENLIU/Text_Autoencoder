I have purchased other coconut milks (Natural Value Organic Coconut Milk, 14 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) from Amazon with good results, but that product is no longer available. So I bought this coconut milk hoping the other reviews were wrong. This coconut milk is terrible! Even after 24 hours in the refrigerator there was no separation in the can, and thus no coconut cream to be whipped and the coconut milk is very watery.  If you just want to throw this into the blender for shakes then it should be O.K., but if you are wanting creamy coconut milk, look elsewhere.
