We recently purchased the 2 lb. bag of Krusteaz Buttermilk Pancake Mix and when we received it the bag was sealed. While serving pancakes to my family I bit into some crunchy pieces and immediately thought "oh I must have accidentally dropped an eggshell into the batter." After biting into another crunchy bit and then getting a jab in my mouth it dawned on me (duh) that all I added was water. I immediately told the family to stop eating!  I investigated further to find large shards of glass in the pancakes (two of them 3/4 of an inch long).  The measuring cup that I used was metal and the only glass in the process was the mixing bowl which after careful examination revealed no signs of chipping and it wasn't broken - it was fully intact.  I poured a cup of the dry mix from the original bag into a sieve and found pieces of glass - including small chunks (1-2mm in size) as well as additional shards.  I then contacted Continental Mills (the company who makes Krusteaz) as well as the FDA.  Let me be clear on something - I have no interest in any sort of legal action - I simply wanted to be heard.  Other than that I suppose that I wanted to hear them apologize.  I thought that was fair especially after I just served glass to my 1, 3, and 7 year old courtesy of Continental Mills.  The FDA was great - saying that they log complaints like this in order to agglomerate data to look for trends. THEY even apologized that I had encountered that problem.  Continental Mills immediately told me that it was impossible for there to be glass in the mix but they would send me a packet to send the Krusteaz Buttermilk Pancake Mix back to them for analysis.  I just received the reply stating that they did in fact find glass in the mix but "were unable to identify it as coming from our facility." They also included a $0.30 off coupon for Krusteaz products. I find their response to be absolutely unacceptable.  I am left with the belief that they do not care about quality nor the safety of their customers.  The glass came from somewhere - either from their facility or one of the suppliers that provides them with salt, baking soda, etc...<br />I recommend that you avoid this product for your safety and the safety of your family.
