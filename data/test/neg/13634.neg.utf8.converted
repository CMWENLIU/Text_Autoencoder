I'm always game for trying new food. I love graham crackers and always have since I was a kid (yeah, I know, I should go for the more fancy food by now). Back to Nature's Golden Honey Oat Grahams seem like a cool idea in principle--it doesn't have any added sugar, is made with oats and generally seems like it would be healthy for you with the possibility that it MIGHT taste good.<br /><br />It doesn't.<br /><br />Eating these made me think of what it must be like to be a termite and chew on the beams of a crunchy new house. Sadly, Back to Nature is a BAD thing in this case. If nature intended us to eat this type of stuff there would be trees that had cardboard squares hanging down from them.<br /><br />I realize that the makers of this product have good intentions. The road to hell is paved with "food" like this. I'd try the other road where the food that might be less healthy tastes a whole lot better.<br /><br />I'll be putting this in the recycling bin with the cardboard boxes that amazon ships their products to me in where it belongs.<br /><br />You  might want to chew on this for a while before ordering this stuff and keep in mind it's just food for thought. I will say one thing--it's rare that what's in the package tastes just LIKE the package.<br /><br />Avoid.
