I received these almonds yesterday, packed in a plastic bag inside of a mailing envelope. The package was like a bean bag. I was sure that they had been broken, having been mailed without protection, but they were all intact. (The plastic bag was completely plain--no brand name, no ingredients, no nothing.)<br /><br />Then I ate one, and knew why. The candy covering is very heavy and thick--kind of like protecting the almonds with concrete. It's also very sweet, making the almonds close to tasteless. It's necessary to suck the candy for quite a while before you dare to bite into it. My husband said that he would eat them if I ordered him a custom wood crab mallet.<br /><br />When I was young (50s and 60s) we got Jordan almonds from a vending machine at a movie theater, in a small box--The sugar coating was opaque, but almost like a glaze. You could bite right into them, and they had a delicate, sweet almond-like taste. Delicious.<br /><br />My sister tells me that the only Jordan almonds on Amazon that are good are the ones from France. I was trying to stick to my made-in-the-US resolution when I bought this variety.  I guess that I won't be eating any Jordan almonds until someone in the US learns how to ship them safely without covering them in concrete.<br /><br />By the way, you can sure tell that these didn't come from Amazon. They pack rolls of bubble-wrap in bubble wrap, and put the whole thing in a box.
