This was USELESS to me and a lot of others.<br />Difficult to set and I had no results!<br />There is a product called "NoMol" it's what my EXTERMINATOR used.<br />it's CHEAP, EFFECTIVE,but hard to find.<br />My EXTERMINATOR trapped 10 moles last year and I've trapped 10 So Far this year!<br />I have a lot invested in my Flower beds! these "Criiters" were DESTROYING them.<br />I've tried everything from poison gummy worms to smoke bombs, Castor oil to castor beans.<br />Gum, Bleach and contraptions like this that DO NOT WORK!<br />Look at NoMOL on YouTUBE.... it was the ONLY thing that worked for me!<br />The proff was always right there in that trap.<br />20 dead Moles..... So Far!
