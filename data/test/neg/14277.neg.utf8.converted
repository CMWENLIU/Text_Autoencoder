This product is a shoddy replacement for their European Dutch-Processed cocoa (in the silver container) which I used exclusively with fantastic results.  I was mortified when they discontinued it.  At first I was glad to see they put out another Dutch-processed cocoa. What a letdown.  This product is over-processed (they used too much alkali), is bitter and is headed for the trash.  What was Hershey's thinking?  They had a wonderful product that they discontinued and replaced with a lousy product.  I will now only use Peet's Dutch-Processed Cocoa or Callebaut.
