I will admit at this moment I have no hard data to back up my suspicion, but we have been feeding these to our two dogs, one of whom is diabetic. Due to the fact that the chicken and apple treats boasted such bona fides as "no hormones" and "no antibiotics", we felt good about serving these up.<br /><br />The other day, the diabetic dog began throwing up, and I took her to the vet yesterday. The vet called with the results of the blood work and said the dog's liver enzymes had spiked. She asked me if we were feeding her chicken jerky treats which might be made in China. I knew about the Dogswell treats, but I was certain they weren't of Chinese origin. When I was at the store later, I picked up a package and found to my amazement that they are, in fact, Chinese.<br /><br />The vet will run tests on the remaining treats in the package to see if there is any melamine in the meat, but the change in her liver coincides with her getting these treats. I wouldn't advise anyone feeding these to their dogs without first checking the health of their dog's liver and the chemical composition of the treats.<br /><br />Rated One Star, only because Zero Stars is not an option.
