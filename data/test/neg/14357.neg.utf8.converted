I can appreciate the expensive DoMatcha organic first harvest.  I won't say it's delicious but the flavor is obviously high quality.<br /><br />This cheaper 2.8 oz DoMatcha is acrid and astringent.  It tastes like regular bancha green tea and reminds me of a really bad dark chocolate (strong in a bad, not chocolaty, way).  I'll finish this stuff off since it probably is decent quality in health terms but I wouldn't buy it again for a nickel.<br /><br />There seems to be two strong opinions on which DoMatcha is superior and better tasting.  If you are looking for flat out strong flavor and "kick" then the 2.8 oz is probably your favorite.  I prefer the smooth and flavorful but subtle first harvest.  It's expensive but they are both relatively very expensive.  You are paying for the health and flavor quality and the absence of offensive taste which is hard to find in matcha.  If the flavor isn't that important, why not buy the cheap matcha by the pound instead of both paying a lot and not getting much?
