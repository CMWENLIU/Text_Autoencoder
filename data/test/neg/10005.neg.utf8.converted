I have had this item for years and I finally stopped using it because the ceramic drip cone does not drain very well. The coffee and water must create a vacuum and I have to lift up the paper cone and jiggle it to get the flow going. Sometimes the filter tears and then it's a real mess. I have also used the Melitta plastic cones and those drain perfectly.
