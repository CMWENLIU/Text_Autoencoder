Coming from Jelly Belly, I expected this syrup to have intense flavor just like their jelly beans. The syrup instead is rather watery. It has a rather low sugar content and the flavor is tepid.<br /><br /> I would recommend Torani syrups instead which have really great flavor (raspberry is a favorite). They are also much sweeter which means you have to use less syrup to sweeten your snow cone (or whatever it is you are flavoring).
