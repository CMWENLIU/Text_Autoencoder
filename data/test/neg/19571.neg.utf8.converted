Can't comment on the quality of the product yet, but I can tell you that the packaging was terrible. The cap on the jar was not tight, and a small amount of the contents had spilled out into the bag it was in.  This makes me question the freshness of the product now. Anyone who uses this product knows what a sticky mess it will be to wipe the jar down now.  Can't return it due to the return policy on food.
