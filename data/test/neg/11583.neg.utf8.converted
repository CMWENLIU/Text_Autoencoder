I tried this cereal dry and rather liked it- it had a dark chocolate flavor that, to my surprise, wasn't too sweet.  It had the consistency of a high-fiber cereal on the outside and a tiny smear of smooth chocolate cream inside- quite pleasant.<br /><br />However, when I tried it in milk to write this review the cereal got mushy in about 30 seconds or less in milk.  Great for the toothless crowd, I guess, but not for people who like their cereal to stay crunchy while they eat it!
