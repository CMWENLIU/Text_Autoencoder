Do not order these "noodles" unless you think tentacles off a jellyfish picked up off the beach might be yummy!  That is what these fishy smelling, gelatinous, packed in liquid horrors are like!  Oh and they are "nonreturnable!"  I threw them straight in the garbage!  What a waste of money!  Spare yourself.
