$25 for ONE pack?!? The fault is mine for not reading the description more closely but for $25 I assumed I was getting a pack of 3 like usual when I order from amazon. Needless to say I will be returning the item and will be more careful when ordering in the future. Shame on this seller for jacking up the price to a ridiculous amount!
