I was excited when I received this kit because I love sushi and have been looking for a way to make it at home.  However, I must say that I was disappointed by and large with what I actually got considering the price that I paid.  The products themselves are great but I don't notice a big difference at all from the items available at my local asian grocery store.  I purchased the same grade of items as well as all the ingredients necessary to make sushi that were not included (such as rice, vegetables, seafood, etc) for less money than it cost for just this kit.  I would not recomment purchasing it - instead, do your homework and find a local asian grocery store - the quality is the same but the price is much more palatable!
