I have lived in different places and eaten at many chinese restaurants and I have also had decent store bought chinese mustard, but I have no idea what this crap is.  It isn't even good mustard.  It is just horrible.  There is also nothing hot about it.  I am also not a fan of the Dynasty duck sauce, so I will be avoiding all of their products from now on.
