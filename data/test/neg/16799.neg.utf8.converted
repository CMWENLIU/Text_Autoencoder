I have a one year old Boxer and a nine year old chocolate lab.  Neither one was impressed with this nylabone.  Supposed to be bacon flavored but I couldn't smell anything resembling bacon.  (I would have tried it to be sure, but I figured that was too much to ask of me just so you could have an accurate review!)
