I never write a review but I thought I should to lower the number of stars this product has. We bought the subscribe and save package of 6 and after eating 1 cookie I am thinking on throwing out the rest. The cookies are chewy and you don't feel the crumbles you usually have in a good short bread. They leave a very unpleasant after taste in your mouth. I am extremely disappointed with these cookies. Please buy something else!
