While Fructose is the main sweetener used,they also decided to throw Sucralose in the mix.Big mistake!.Why they would want to use an artificial sweetener with potential safety concerns beats me.This product would have tasted great with just more Fructose(or plain Sugar) than that horrible metallic tasing Sucralose.Just make sure you like Sucralose before you buy this.Next time I'll make sure I read the ingredient label more closely......
