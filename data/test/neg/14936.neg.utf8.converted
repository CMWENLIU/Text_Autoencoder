This makes a cup of super-sweet 'black' flavored coffee, but when you add a touch of cream, the taste here is not too much different than those ubiquitous square cans of artificially flavored ersatz 'cappucino' and/or vanilla 'latte' put out my General Foods, Maxwell House, etc.  The difference being the over-inflated price for having the Starbucks name on it.  Color me unimpressed.  I must say, the price of the regular VIA coffees is too high as well, but at least the product tastes pretty good.  This product, however, is way too sweet and the flavor components taste fake.  There's very little to enjoy about drinking this.
