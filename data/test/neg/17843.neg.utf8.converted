The answer is:  not really.  All but one of my 4 cats picks around the Wysong kibble, leaving it in the bowl.<br /><br />I love the concept but the kitties aren't sold. Not by one little dry piece of kibble.<br /><br />I have mixed it in with their other foods - and they pick around it.  It's been over 4 weeks and they just won't eat it.<br /><br />The formerly feral kitten who has only been indoors for 4 of her 9 months won't eat it and PURRS when I give her the other dry food.<br /><br />The 7 y.o. cat who thinks broccoli stalk bits and mango and strawberry crowns are food - steals bitter lettuces out of the salad bowl.  Even he won't eat it (though grudgingly with some water added, he'll eat some).<br /><br />The greedy 6 y.o. cat - who growls at the 7 y.o. over broccoli bits and who always hoovers everyone else's food - won't eat it.<br /><br />The geriatric cat who has pretty much eaten everything I have given him in 14 years (he's 19) - won't eat it.<br /><br />Even the ants won't eat it!<br /><br />Is there any cat who eats this and likes it or is it basically kitty prison food?<br /><br />I updated my rating to a single star - great concept but if the cats won't eat it, it's not really worth buying.
