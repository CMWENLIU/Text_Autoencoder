Price is wayyyyyy above retail!!! I love DRY sodas.  However, I think that you should probably be aware that you can buy these sodas from drysoda.com in the same quantity for $32 right now, and that isn't on sale!  There is also a place on the site to see if someone carries it in your area.  I was just a few clicks away from purchasing this here, and decided to do a quick check on the website which is where I will buy it until the price is equal here.  Just to be clear, if it was just the soda I would give it 5-stars, but because the price is essentially doubled, I am driving the point home that the pricing is outrageous and hopefully giving it 1-star will get people to read this.
