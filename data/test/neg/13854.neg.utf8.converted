We must have gotten old stock. It does have the sponge material instead of peat moss, it did not have the liquid nutrients and the tablets were falling apart, and now after 4-5 weeks, I have one very healthy basil and one very small thyme, and a small mint. So 3 out of 7 actually sprouted/grew. So now I get to call the company and ask for a replacement :(<br /><br />Update: 9/3/2010<br />I called and they are sending a replacement. They are strongly recommending distilled water so there will be no trace minerals ... will update on success/failure when it arrives.
