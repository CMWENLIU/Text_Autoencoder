We have food allergies, so I carefully pay attention to what we buy and bought this specifically because of the ingredients listed.  When it came, we realized it has barley malt, and what the company sent us was not the same exact box as is listed on Amazon.  The box we have does not say gluten free, unlike the box photo displayed.  I am very disappointed.
