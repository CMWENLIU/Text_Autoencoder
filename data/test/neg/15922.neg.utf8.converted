This is incredibly too hot. I only use a quarter of the packet, and I can't see anyone eating this completely without really REALLY liking spicy food. i expected, idk, mild? but that's not the point; it was hot to the point that it actually RUINED the taste of the noodles.<br /><br />i think im going to stick to Nissin and Maruchan...more Nissin, i think.
