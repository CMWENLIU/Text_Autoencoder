I drank Tortuga's Rum Liquor Coffee at my girlfriend's apartment. We both claimed it was the best tasting coffee we ever had. She got it out of the country and after we finished the bag, I started to research whether I could buy it in the States. I thought I was doing good by buying the same coffee when I ordered these bags. It is the same company name and the same flavor, but I quickly learned the coffee is very different. The first couple times my girlfriend made it, I questioned whether she put too much water in the coffee machine. I knew she was not at fault when I made it myself. This coffee has barely any flavor, only a hint of what I originally tasted. It seems diluted or something. THe only difference I see in labeling/packaging is the original bag she had was goldish and the bag I ordered was red. I would love to learn what the deal is and where I could get the good stuff.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Brian
