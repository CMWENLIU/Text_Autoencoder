It bothers me that if you search Amazon for Organic Peanut Butter, this shows up at the top of the search results. It is NOT organic. Why do I care? Because peanuts can be a very high pesticide and carcinogenic-laced product; and I eat it every day.<br />I convinced myself that because the product page says "certified kosher, vegan, and is even gluten-free" that it was just an oversight that they didn't include the organic term in the description since it showed up so high in my search results. I bought a 6-pack, and thankfully Amazon refunded my purchase, but it doesn't change the fact that this is still showing up in the 'organic' search results.<br />I realize it's my own fault...but I still feel a bit duped and hoping to help anyone else looking for organic peanut butter.
