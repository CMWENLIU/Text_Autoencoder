I ordered this variety of Eden miso after having enjoyed their Hacho miso greatly. It's a big disappointment, lacking either the intensity of the Hacho or the sweetness of the lighter misos. "Barley"? I tasted nothing of this better grain for a miso blend and the overall taste was pretty bland. I  can't recommend it.
