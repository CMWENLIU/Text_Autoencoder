So, after reading every review, I checked to see that the country of origin listed in the description was Thailand. I tried not one but a replacement case as well, both a horribly greasy product from Sri Lanka. Amazon immediately reimbursed me. I had used this product before (not from Amazon) and my cans must have been from Thailand as the product is (was)so dreamy I really wanted it again.<br /><br />I decided to call the company because their description on Amazon is false advertising. The woman I spoke to was an absolute brat, borderline rude, with excuse after excuse. Maybe she was tired of fielding complaints, but isnt' that her job? I was so surprised because I have had such great conversations and learned so much from other small companies like that--like Nutiva (who I complained to about my leaking coconut oil and devleoped a great relationship with one of the representatives there who sent me a replacement even though I told him Amazon had already reembursed me. I just wanted to let them know about the problem.<br /><br />Her biggest excuse (among several side-stepping maneuvers) is that the sample sent to them did not match the product. To me this speaks VOLUMES about the lack of quality control at the company. Makes me wonder what is in those cans. So, Amazon and other poor consumers will have to suffer for Edward and Sons faulty business products until the Sri Lankan is used up 'in about another month or so'. Seriously?<br /><br />A small company with poor customer service is doomed to fail, no matter how great their product. And with a lousy product like this I am unwilling to try any of their other things if they don't stand behind their products.
