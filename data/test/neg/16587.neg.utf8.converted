This is an easy review because the judgement was made by our two papillons. They live for their treats and are NOT especially picky about treats. These items are dried, uniform in size, and although they may be "organic" they smell bad and my dogs would have nothing to do with them. I threw them out and wanted to share the expensive experience with others so they would not waste their money.
