I just opened this bag of Goji Berries, ate a handful and spit it out.  I emptied the bag onto a paper towel to examine.  The berries are moldy & lots of bits & pieces of seeds, stems, & half eaten parts of berries from insects or worms perhaps. It tasted like mold.  I checked the stale date, 9/26/13.  Yikes!  I can't imagine eating these a year and a half from now.  The item is not returnable.  It says USDA organic on package.  It's a product from China. Very poor quality.  I don't trust it, & will never buy it again.
