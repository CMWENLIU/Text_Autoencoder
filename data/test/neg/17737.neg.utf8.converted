I was told about this product at a Weight Watcher meeting. We purchased the "original" blend. I felt compelled to write and let potential customers know how horrible this product is. Our family of six tried it in soup, on eggs, on various vegetables, raw and steamed. No body liked any part of it. It sat on the shelf for about two months and we threw it out, all 21 ozs. We prefer Lawreys no salt seasoning or Trader Joe's no salt seasoning. Don't waste your money.<br />This product is made by Alberto Culver. Maybe they should stick to the hair care industry!
