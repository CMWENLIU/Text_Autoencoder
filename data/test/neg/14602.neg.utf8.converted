I recently purchased this item since these are my husband's all time favorite ramen noodles. Unfortunately, these noodles arrived with an expiration date of early February 2009. So now my husband has to eat 40 packages of ramen in the next 5 months, which averages out to 8 a month. My husband loves junk food as much as the next guy, but even he would not consume this much ramen in such a short time! If I had known that these were going to expire so soon, I would have never bought them. This is not the first grocery item I've bought from Amazon that has a close expiration date. In summary, don't buy this product unless you want to eat a lot of noodles in a short period of time...
