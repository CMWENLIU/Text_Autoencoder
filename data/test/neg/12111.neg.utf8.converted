This isn't the only vendor who does this, and is only singled out because I thought this was a great deal!  19-cents? Terrific....I'll get a dozen!  That is, until I went to checkout to find that the $4.95 shipping (which is far too much for one package) is PER ITEM.....as if these are all being shipped separately.  So, in reality, you're paying $5.14 PER PACKAGE...almost twice what I pay in local stores!  Pretty sad.
