I ended up buying this because Zico is now from concentrate (yuck) and based on reviews and comments from others who stopped buying Zico. Not sure what the others were drinking but it couldn't possibly be what I got. Amy and Brian's tastes like cotton candy. I love Thai coconuts even more than South American coconuts - in fact I go to Chinatown every chance I get to stock up on young coconuts just for the coconut water. This tastes NOTHING LIKE a real Thai coconut. I wouldn't even use this to make a smoothie. I guess it's back to Vita Coco until there's a good product on the market again. Or I suppose I could get a second fridge just to keep filled with green coconuts. Now I need to figure out what to do with the other 23 cans of this stuff.
