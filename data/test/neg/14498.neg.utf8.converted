We have large and small animals and needed something that would work for both. This isn't it. It's continuous shock will prevent animals that bite it from being able to let go and will cook them from the inside. It's killed two of our animals. We weren't 100% sure after we found the first one dead, but the second one was obvious.<br /><br />The company's website claims that none of their chargers will harm *any* animal so we called them up and let them know they kill. As it turns out, they already knew that their continuous chargers kill small animals so they sent us an intermittent one for free. (Doesn't really make up for the $400 worth of animals their product has killed and the fact that one was a pet.) They haven't changed their website even though it's a lie. I noticed that they also sell chargers specifically for birds that are continuous and run at the same power output as the chargers for larger animals. One has to wonder why they sell a product that they know will kill the very animals it's supposed to be protecting. Avoid this company.
