Saw a commercial about a new Flatbread product, thought I had to have it. I was so disappointed. First of all I'm not a wheat thins person, so maybe if you love wheat thins you'll like this. I'm Italian so I was thinking more along the lines of flatbread from Italy. Pretty gullible, right? Just because the product is called Tuscan flatbread, doesn't mean there is anything even remotely similar. My biggest gripe is the amount of sugar that is used. They are CRACKERS, not COOKIES! I couldn't get past the SWEET flavor. I spit it out. Why does everything have to have so much sugar?! We do have other taste buds in our mouth. Order them if you're just expecting elongated wheat thins and NOT if you really want flatbread.
