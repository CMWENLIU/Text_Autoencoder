To protect consumers from what they deem dangerous chemicals, and sometimes in their control in banning and outlawing certain additives put into foodstuff, the FDA acts over-zealous and over-reaching.<br /><br />Several years ago teenagers in sports were especially using energy-enhancing supplements and drinks containing large amounts of "ephedra".  A significant number of these adolescents abusively overdosed on such supplements and drinks that caused many to become serious ill where some unfortunately died.  To counter this harmful trend, and instead of being selective in creating pragmatic regulations concerning quantity, the FDA altogether banned "ephedra" (aka: "endphdrine").<br /><br />For centuries, the herb "ephedra" traditionally was used in herbal teas and other health products to help ease and alleviate asthma attacks because of its unique and beneficial antispasmodic properties that facilitated in opening bronchial air passages.<br /><br />In the past, I regularly used Taditional Medicinals' "Breath Easy" herbal tea for years with great therapeutic success in controlling my asthma symptoms since it had a small amount of "ephedra" in it.  However, after trying this product's newly reformulation (re: removal of "ephedra") for four months, all I can say that for asthmatic relief, today's "Breath Easy" tea no longer effectively works for that purpose.
