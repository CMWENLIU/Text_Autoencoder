The seaweed is excellent quality however you only get to make one piece at a time because the Nori is very small. It's awful if you're making a lot of sushi at once. I prefer larger sheets so I can roll and cut many pieces of sushi. I will not be buying this product again because of this. It was however delicious Nori and good quality rice and very quick to do. It's just no good if you're looking to make more then 10 pieces, plus that causes it to actually take more time then it should.
