I fell in love with this flavor - the original recipe.  I did the subscribe and save option to that I'd always have plenty on hand.  I had to cancel it and will not buy this again.  I don't know what they changed in the recipe, it now tastes horrible!  I can't even finish a whole cup.  I have to throw it out after only a few sips.  I'm a bit of a coffee snob, but I'll drink taster's choice instant over this.  I'd highly recommend you do not order this flavor.  It's worse than swill.
