Yes, These taste identical to a gummy bear (being sugar free).<br />However, there is so many dietary fibers and sugar substitutes which cause laxative that it's only worth buying these unless you follow it with a shot of pepto bismol.<br /><br />I mean quite literally you can't eat anymore than 5 of them or else you'll regret it. It's not worth it, Trust me.
