When i bought this product it said in the information, watermelon laffy taffy with seeds. When i open the box and start to eat one, NO seeds, i was quite made cause the whole reason i bought it was for the seeds. If i wanted a regular watermelon laffy taffy i could have gone down the street to the gas station and picked one up. If i would have known that i would not get seeds then i wouldn't have bought the product. I wanted one with seeds and i did not get any. im disappointed.
