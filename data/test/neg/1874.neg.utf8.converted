I was so happy to see Sugar-free Hershey's Syrup on the grocery store shelf.  Anticipated all day having a scoop of sugar-free ice cream with a drizzle of sugar-free chocolate syrup.  Am I ever glad I tasted the syrup before ruining the ice cream with it.<br /><br />This syrup has the most vile, bitter taste - totally not palatable at all.  Hersey's Company - WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?  I am a chocolate lover from way back and there is nothing to this taste that even resembles chocolate.  Very disappointed and wasted $3.50 to boot.
