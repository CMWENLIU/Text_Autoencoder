Being a lover of good, spicy, full-flavored Chai, I was SO eager to try Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf's Chai tea capsules for my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SH6UQ4">CBTL Kaldi S04 Single Cup Brewer, Blue/Silver</a>! Well, I tried my first cup today, and am sorry to say that it's my least favorite cup of Chai ever.<br /><br />My tea brewed up very weak, looking more like dirty dishwater, and smelling like licorice with the slightest hint of cinnamon. I really couldn't tell if there were any black tea leaves that'd even been brewed. The description on the front of the boxes states that these capsules, in decreasing order of ingredients, contain black tea, cinnamon, anise star, anise seed, black pepper, ginger root, and licorice root. For me, having mixed up my own Chai tea spice blend to add to my standard cup of Chai or black tea, the above ingredient list has very few spices that I'm used to tasting/seeing in a traditional Indian cup of Chai. Where are the cloves, nutmeg, and cardamom that are standard in traditional Chai, as further defined in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764135775">The New Food Lover's Companion</a> (one of my ever-updated, all time favorite Foodie go-to guides)? Not here. Instead, those more standard, and more palatable, spices are absent, having apparently been replaced with the more European anise seed and star anise. It also doesn't help that the black tea that's listed first is absent in the flavor profile here.<br /><br />I wonder if proper, long brewing and long steeping of a good cup of tea is just not do-able with the CBTL Kaldi brewer, considering how quickly the heated water is forced through the capsule. Either way, since I've now got 35 more of these capsules that I DON'T enjoy the flavor from, I suppose I can just keep them on hand and hope that I have some guests over that REALLY like the taste of licorice in their tea. Because I really don't, and that's all that I tasted here. Oh well...
