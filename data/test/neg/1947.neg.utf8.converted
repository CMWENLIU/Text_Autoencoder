I have been getting the Good Earth Sweet and Spicy Caffeine-Free tea for several months now on a subscription (pack of 6), and usually drink two to three tea bags a night. I don't know when they changed the tea to include 'Natural and Artificial' flavors, but the taste of the tea I got in July has totally changed for the worse, and I can't drink it! The only way I can describe the way it tastes is that it reminds me of burnt wiring. I opened up a second box (of the six) and tried one of tea bags in that box, and it's the same thing: it's undrinkable.<br /><br />I am really bummed out, because it was my favorite tea. Unfortunately, it can't be returned, so I've got boxes of the tea that I can't drink.<br /><br />I may try a box of the Organic Caffeine-Free version, but from the reviews it doesn't sound like it's got as much flavor as the Original blend.
