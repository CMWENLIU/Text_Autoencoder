I am very dissatisfied with the 3rd party shipper of this item, Netgrocer. The order did not ship until 5 days after it was ordered. I have tried to contact Netgrocer 5 times to resolve this, with NO call back. I paid nearly $12 for shipping and it took nearly 10 days to reach the destination by FedEx! It could have been shipped regular mail faster than that!  I would like to have the shipping credited back to my card, but I cannot get in touch with anyone from Netgrocer!  Until this is resolved, I will NOT order from Amazon or Netgrocer again.<br /><br />Jennifer Nawracaj
