I just received this product and was surprised to see that the bags were not hermetically sealed, just plastic-lined paper bags folded over at the top. Here are some tests I used: Aroma  upon opening the bag - not so much smell at all; Aroma after grinding - not too much smell at all; Packs firmly in the espresso machine - NOPE; Crema after brewing - fair; First sip - YUCH!!! I admit I am somewhat of a coffee snob as I prefer the taste and aroma of FRESH coffee. I recommend you stay away from this stuff unless you believe instant coffee tastes good. This IS better than instant coffee but that's as far as I can go. I'm disappointed.
