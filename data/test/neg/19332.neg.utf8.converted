The product arrived out of temperature control, fully thawed with no coolant remaining. When I attempted several times to contact the seller, every e-mail was simply ignored. Only due to Amazon's claim process was I able to get the issue resolved by obtaining a refund. I will never be even slightly tempted to deal with this seller again.
