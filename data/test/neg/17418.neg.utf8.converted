Tried the new coffee by Martinsons because I needed something new. Every cup I tried seems to have a lot of coffee dust and sludge on the bottom the cup. I know that some of these k-cups do that but it seemed much more than usual. I think the filter is not filtering the coffee properly and allowing the finer grounds to get through.
