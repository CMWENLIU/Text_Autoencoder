My husband and I had been using the omega paw rolling litter boxes for three years with few issues.  The only downside is that when rolled, after the plastic has had time to warp, there is some litter that leaks out when rolling the box.  Nothing a dust buster can't suck up in a jiffy.  These pans were a new addition and were a total nightmare.  No scoop needed is a lie.  My cats managed to practically empty the litter out of the pans and the mess that wasn't on the floor was left in the pockets of the sifter that required a separate scoop to clean out.  If you use Tidy Cats for small spaces or something similar, this pan is not for you.  The litter gets stuck in the cracks and you need a toothbrush and a head pin to get it out of the little cracks and crevices.  It seems like a great idea in theory, but for the type of litter we use and our cat's tendency to send litter flying, we would be spending hours scooping, sifting and cleaning.  :o(  We are back to omega paw and our poop drawer will do just fine.  Unfortunately after all this our cat for the first time ever left a pile for us on the litter mat in defiance when we returned to omega paw.  :o(  I guess she liked the mess.
