I ordered four boxes of truffles recently and they came damaged and melted! I had already given one bag away as a gift not knowing the goods are damaged. I also contacted seller and the seller claimed no responsibility. The Seller blamed me for using regular shipment, then sent me their "Summer Shipping Policy". If the seller knew that this type of incident happened frequently, then the seller should ONLY offer express shipping, NOT regular shipping.  The seller then argued that I purchased these truffles at a discount, implying that I should not be complaining. Purchasing the items at this so called "discount" (still more expensive than the price you can get at Costco) is not an issue. If the seller wanted to get rid of these damaged goods at a discount, the seller should have noted "damaged  goods" when they made an offer on Amazon. After all, isn't purchasing goods at a discount the reason why we all shop online at Amazon? The seller also brought up that I should have noticed that earlier (I just received these 4 boxes couple weeks ago, and just opened one box for myself today). Are we supposed to open all the boxes we order when we receive the shipment? Then, how can I give them away as a gift?<br />The seller also suggested that I should file a claim on Amazon and may be Amazon would take the responsibility and give me a refund. Overall, this is very unfortunate and bad business practice.
