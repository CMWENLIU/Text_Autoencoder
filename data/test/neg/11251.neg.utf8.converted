I am disappointed in the description of this product on Amazon. But I have to blame myself for the purchase because I could have gone to the Mariani website and seen that they DO NOT call these "Dried Apricots" [http://shop.mariani.com/Mediterranean-Apricots/p/MAR-1140091&c=Mariani@OrchardFruit].<br /><br />The product listing mainline on Amazon is: "Mariani Premium DRIED Ultimate Apricots 48 oz. Resealable Value Bag by Mariani" [caps are mine]. (That line is repeated also in Amazon's "Product Features".) The ONLY place on this product's bag that the words "Dried Apricots" appear is in the INGREDIENT list.<br /><br />The front of the bag says, "Premium - Intense Flavor and Aroma - Ultimate Apricots," and the back of the bag says, "We've taken our most luscious Mediterranean Apricots and infused them with a natural flavor essence to create Mariani Ultimate Apricots". Few of the apricots would qualify as "dry" compared to the dry apricots I've eaten my entire life (a long time) and some of them are almost mushy. When you open the bag it smells a bit like a fruity wine. No, I don't think they have fermented, I just think the odor is that special, ". . . natural flavor essence" that the MANUFACTURER adds to the DRIED APRICOTS!<br /><br />Although I don't like to publish "indelicacies", these are also the first dried fruit (including prunes) that ever gave me the bends from gas. I am not suggesting that will happen to everyone, but after eating some (a reasonable number) of them 2 days in a row and being symptomatic, then eating none and not being symptomatic, then repeating the process, I am a bit beyond buying into the theory of coincidence as a cause.
