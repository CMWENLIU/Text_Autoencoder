I have not tried these but I gave them a poor rating because of false advertising.  They claim to be sugar free but they are far from it.  Maltitol is a sugar which is identical in properties to sucrose (table sugar).  The only difference is that Maltitol is only about 80% as sweet as sucrose.  No matter how they are marketing this thing, it is a candy bar.
