Two of the six containers I received has a cracked and chipped lids and the aluminum foil sealer is torn. The packaging is really flimsy and thin, the lid cover is thin and easily cracked and chipped. The product however, is good but will not last very long if the packaging is not fixed. I will never order this item again unless the packaging is fixed.
