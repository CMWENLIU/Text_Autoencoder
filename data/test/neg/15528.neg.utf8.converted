I use cherry juice daily for my arthritis, and I bought this product because it represents a good deal...so I splurged and got a couple of quarts.  It's going to be tough to drink them both, because they have a very brackish and nasty taste.  As far as I can tell, it's still effective for my arthritis, but drinking it is like drinking very bad cough medicine.  Compare the taste of this to the product by Dynamic Health and believe me, you'll understand.<br /><br />I've been drinking cherry juice for a long time now, so this isn't just because I'm not used to it, or don't understand how to dilute it.  It's just a gross tasting product.<br /><br />Also--maybe this was just chance, but Amazon shipped this product on the same date it expired.  Maybe that's why it tastes so terrible, but whatever he reason I won't be ordering it again...64 ounces of concentrate is a lot to go through when you have to try hard not to puke when you drink it, LOL.
