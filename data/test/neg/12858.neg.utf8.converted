In theory these sounded very good - in reality, they were a huge disappointment.<br /><br />The ginger taste was very mild, and was unfortunately overpowered by the chocolate.  It seemed overly sweet, which was a surprise since I had expected Belgian chocolate to be less so.<br /><br />Also, the cookie itself wasn't as crisp as it could have been.  The overall texture wasn't enjoyable.<br /><br />This could just be my taste, but I think it would be much better if the cookie was a crisp "snap" type, and if the chocolate was more semi-sweet.<br /><br />With all this said, there is a chance that the cookie suffered from poor storage/packing.  Perhaps it was just going stale, and if a fresh cookie had been sent, it would have been crisper.  If that is the case, then I didn't get to taste the cookie at its best - maybe it typically is much better.
