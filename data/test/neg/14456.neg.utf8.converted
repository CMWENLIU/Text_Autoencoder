Forget the cheese sauce...the only way to use this product is to leave off the last step...they instruct you after cooking the product then to add the thick gooey cheese sauce which just ruins it....<br />I purchased a case of these...so before I cook them I add spices or herbs of choice and then after cooking I top with melted butter...I save the sauce packet for nachos..
