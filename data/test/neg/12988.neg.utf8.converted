Once I opened the package, there was a terrible smell resembling decay/rotting fish that came from these.  I tried to "air' them out to see if the smell would go away, only to have my next door neighbor tell me about a "dead animal smell" that she could smell all the way up from her 2nd floor apartment 300 feet away. Sure enough, I brought her over to where these were "aerating" and it was the culprit. (I guess the wind was blowing just right that day).  I have purchased other products from this brand previously with no issues. But whatever this was, the smell was too awful to give to the dog.
