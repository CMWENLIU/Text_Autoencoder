I bought these because of the sale price and because of the fact that I really like the Sun Maid peaches.  I regret to say I am disappointed.  The taste of the fruit is bland; you really have to struggle to find any apricot flavor at all.  Worse, my sensitive tounge noticed sulfur overtones.  Furthermore, these apricots are not really dried; they are really soft and mushy.  You will notice right away if you are used to dried peaches or apples.  Finally, I thought that it was odd that in this day and age they did not come in a resealable container.<br /><br />These might have a use in adding color to a salad.  But overall I cannot  rate them highly.  I will probably eat them since I spent the money (they are not horrible) but I will not buy again.
