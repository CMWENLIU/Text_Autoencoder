The Urbani Summer Truffle Carpaccio in a 2.5 ounce jar was going  to be a special gourmet treat for me and my wife to top a little bit of bread as a snack or alongside a meal.  Instead, I ended up with a bland mushroom-like topping that does little other than look appealing.  The texture of the carpaccio is pleasing and there is some definite truffle aroma if you take a big whiff from the jar.  The packing oil seems pleasant enough as well.  Really, the only thing lacking is the main event.  Sadly, I cannot recommend this product at all.  I would recommend checking out some truffle salt instead.
