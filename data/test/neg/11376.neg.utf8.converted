It has become increasingly difficult to get good Darjeeling tea.  I tried this one because it had some good reviews, however, it doesn't look, smell or taste like genuine Darjeeling tea.  The taste of Darjeeling differs by when it is picked and most tea companies sell a combination of 1st and 2nd flush.  This company does not specify but it didn't taste anything like Darjeeling and I have tried first, second and autumn flush as well as monsoon.  It was very bitter and astringent, it didn't look good when I opened it so I only used 1/2 teaspoon of tea.  However, the brew was dark and bitter with a nasty aftertaste,really undrinkable.
