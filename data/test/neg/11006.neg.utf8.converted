I purchased this product to use in baked goods for my son who has allergies to dairy, soy, eggs and corn.  He drinks rice milk as his normal beverage with no problems at all.  Unfortunately, the ingredients in the powdered version contain both corn and soy products.  Unfortunately, since this is a food item, it is non-returnable, so it was a waste of money.
