I really hate to do this (having been a fan of the Van Pattens for years) but feel that I must to save you money. Opening up a can of this substance will release the most ungodly stench into your home that you have ever had the displeasure to smell. To call this stuff &quot;natural&quot; is like saying that Michael Jackson is &quot;normal.&quot;<p>Not only will my felines do everything within their kittie powers to sidestep the pungent aroma spawned from this evil can, but I can't even manage to feed this to the most malnourished squirrel on the block.<p>When they produce this kind of product, they really must get some sort of quality control that keeps the stench in check.<p>Sorry.
