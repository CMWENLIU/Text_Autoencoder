No, I love these crackers.  I buy 'em all the time and they're pretty plain, but high quality and that cracked pepper gives a nice bit of zip to the taste that just makes it that much better.<br /><br />This SHOULD be a 5 star review; packaging was great, no crackers broken in the couple of boxes I've opened as of yet.  Just not too bad at all<br /><br />EXCEPT<br /><br />The order that I placed on May 8, 2007 came packed with 12 boxes of crackers that all expire on June 30, 2007.<br /><br />I've yet to see a single box of these crackers in the local stores with such an early expiration date.<br /><br />The nice price and the free shipping was quickly compromised by Amazon taking a batch of crackers with a short shelf life and pushing them on special.  In the end, the loser is me.  When calling Amazon with the hopes of a fair exchange or something a little reasonable, there was no flexibility.<br /><br />Lesson learned by me and a forewarning to others:  Take caution purchasing perishables from Amazon.<br /><br />Shame on you, Amazon.
