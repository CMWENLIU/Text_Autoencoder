I'm not sure I'm reviewing exactly the same Lindt 70% bar as shown here, but it's the best match I could find. Here goes:<br /><br />What's good: Silken texture, the Lindt trademark, and strong chocolate flavor.<br /><br />What might be good for some: Intermediate "dark" chocolate flavor, richer than traditional "dark" chocolate, but without the bite of 85% or 90%. Personally, I like the sharp edge that this only hints at.<br /><br />What's not: Vanilla. I meean, I like vanilla, and the warm vanilla musk fills my nose more than with anything else I can remember - including most vanilla ice cream. When I want serious chocolate, though, I find it a floral distraction.<br /><br />Nice, I'll never turn it down, but it's not at the top of my list.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
