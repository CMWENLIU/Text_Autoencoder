<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JDVFQ">Emerald Forest Ricochet Mints, Mixed Case, 100-Count Tins (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />I purchased the Emerald Forest Ricochet Mints, Mixed Case, 100-Count Tins (Pack of 6) from Amazon because of the natural Xylitol sugar that is suppose to help protect your teeth from plaque and cavities. Xylitol is suppose to coat the teeth to prevent plaque from forming on the teeth. These mints dissolve in your mouth within 5 seconds, very little flavor, and you will NOT feel that you just had any mints. I don't recommend these at all. Too expensive, and some of the flavors don't taste good.
