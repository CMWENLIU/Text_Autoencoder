The following is a review of the larger size product offering of this tea that I wrote after buying it:  This is NOT English Breakfast tea. In fact, it is closer to Chinese tea than it is to western style black tea. It tastes like the stuff that used (perhaps still is) to be served on the trains in Taiwan, ROC, or in restaurants...yes, that's right, it tastes just like cheap grade commercial Chinese tea (not Chinese/Japanese Green tea, but commercial grade drinking tea such as that given out for free in restaurants like we do iced water here in USA).<br />As such it is insipid, with just a hint of flavor. It may be decaffeinated, but who knows, its flavor is so weak and flacid that one hardly cares.<br />I feel ripped off after buying this and you will too. Do yourself a favor and avoid it. If you want good, strong, loose leaf decaf tea buy the stuff from Taylor's of Harrogate when it is available here on Amazon.
