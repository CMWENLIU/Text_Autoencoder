Bought the white and green tea from this brand and the tea tastes terrible. It has a terrible taste to it and leaves a terrible aftertaste. Im not sure what makes it terrible since it is supposed to only have 3 or 4 products but BEWARE THIS PRODUCT.<br /><br />Again... tastes terrible... and you know.. Chinese Organics.... also questionable<br /><br />(not racism... just what it is)
