i had bought these crackers at the store and loved them. they were so crispy. when i began eating the ones i purchased on amazon.com, they were not crispy. so, i emailed the company with the date code and it turns out they were manufactured over a year ago and were outdated in 10 days! 12  packs of expensive crackers that were outdated in 10 days! UGH!!!!!!  never again!!!!!!
