Wow, I  didn't like it at all.  Maybe it's just my palate, but I found the taste of Roland's White truffle oil to be extremely "chemically".<br />Roland makes a really good balsamic vinegar, so that's why I decided to try their truffle oil.<br />Now I have never had truffles before or any kind of truffle oil, but as soon as I dribbled a tiny bit of this in my homemade mushroom risotto, it was<br />extremely overpowering with a chemical odor/flavor.<br /><br />After I tasted it, I went online to research further and found out that most (not all) of the truffle oils are made with petroleum and other<br />chemicals.  I just googled "truffle oil tastes chemical"  and found some articles about making it with chemicals.<br /><br />Since I bought it in a 2 pack, I would love to return the unopened bottle, but there is a "no return" policy.  I still want to try white truffle oil, so<br />I'm ordering another brand that is not made with chemicals.<br />This is just my opinion and others seem happy so .... best of  luck.
