Serendipity 3 Frrrozen Hot Chcolate Mix Gift Package and several packs of the hot chocolate mix.<br />  In October, 2007 I purchased the gift set along with several packs of the hot chocolate mix to be used as stocking stuffers at Christmas.  Sometime in late November or early December I read a very short article in our local paper that read:<br />"Health inspectors close restaurant"<br />  "While serendipity may be the art of finding pleasant things by chance, what health inspectors found at celebrated eatery Serendipity 3 was not very agreeable."<br />  "Officials closed the restaurant Wednesday night after it failed its second inspection in a month.  An inspector spotted a live mouse and mouse droppings, fruit flies, house flies and more than 100 live cockroaches."<br />  "Both inspections revealed rodent and fly infestation and conditions conducive to pest infestation, including stagnant water in the basement, the department said."<br />  Needless to say, approximately $60 of hot chocolate mix was thrown away.  I would never purchase any products from Serendipity 3 again, even if it was a "must have" by Oprah. If there were a half star or less, it would be rated for this product.
