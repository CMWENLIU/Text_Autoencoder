First the good news: These groats have great flavor -- rich, nutty, slightly fruity, and just a little sweet. For many years, I have been eating steel cut oats, mostly from Honeyville Farms. (See: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006ZN4XY">Steel Cut Oats CAN, 4.38 lb.</a>.) Steel cut oats are so much better than smashed oatmeal and groats are even better. I don't know if these groats are a different variety of oats or if it's just that they are whole groats, but the flavor is distinctly different from the steel cut. I love the steel cut, so this is not to denigrate them, but these groats have a much more complex flavor that I really like.<br /><br />The bad news, which I hope only pertains to this supplier, is the number of husks. Sometimes it's only 1-2/bowl. Sometimes it 1-2 in every spoonful. There is also something gritty from time to time. This really detracts from enjoying the rich, nutty flavor.<br /><br />Groats require a lot more cooking than steel cut and they absorb at least twice as much water. My cooking method for steel cut is to bring them to a boil in a 2:1 water:oats mixture and then leave in the frig overnight. That barely gets is started with groats.<br /><br />So far, the best method I have found is to simmer them in a 4:1 (water:groats) mixture for about 30-45 minutes or until almost all of the water is absorbed or gone. I use the microwave with 1/2 to 3/4 cup groats and 4x the water. I bring it to a boil and then simmer on low power. I usually set it for 30 minutes and then check. When almost all of the water is gone, I put them in the frig overnight (covered). Sometimes they are too dry the next day. I'm still experimenting with the details. I like the microwave because I don't have to be right there to make sure it doesn't go dry and burn. And if it sits a little while, that just continues the softening process.<br /><br />I tried cooking them in my rice cooker (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G30ESY">Zojirushi NS-LAC05 Micom 3-Cup Rice Cooker and Warmer, Stainless Steel</a>). I used one scoop of groats (~3/4 cup) and, based on the results above, filled the pan to the 2-scoop level (double the amount of water). I set it to be ready at 8:30 the next morning. When I woke up, the house had a nice aroma of something cooking. It was a little like when I cook rice and a little like peanuts. Pleasant. When I opened the rice cooker, I found that the groats had expanded more than with the other methods. I added milk (half and half) and raisins and reheated in the microwave. The oatmeal was just about perfect. The groats had expanded to at least 2-3 times original size and were tender and soft, but still much more chewy than the steel cut. The yield was about 1.5-2.0 cups. Absolutely delicious, very filling, and completely different from steel cut oats.<br /><br />Now for the bad news. This really messed up the rice cooker. It cooked overnight, so I was not there so watch it, but I imagine that it bubbled up through the steam vent in the top. There was dried (cooked on) oat residue on the roof of the cooker and all inside the lid. I had to take it apart to clean it - about an hour. Do NOT try this at home. ;-)<br /><br />I imagine a slow cooker would work better, but I don't have one to try.<br /><br />I also want to try Moon Glough's suggestion of toasting them first.<br /><br />I also tried putting them in the food processor just to compare that with the steel cut. I tried several times with varying amounts of processing from just barely to almost a powder. They all came out like mush and tasted bland. It's a puzzle to me why the taste should be so much different.<br /><br />I love the taste, but am rating this product only 2 stars because of the husks and grit. It takes away too much of the enjoyment and it is not attractive if you are not eating alone. I'm going to try groats from other suppliers, including Honeyville farms. I hope someone has better quality control.
