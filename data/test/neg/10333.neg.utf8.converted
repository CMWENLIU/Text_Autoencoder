I did NOT like the flavor of this compared to other brands we normally get from Japan (did not realize this was made in China when we purchased it). This was WAY too sweet - there is a lot of sugar in it. This product should be spicy/seaweedy, not sweet!! I'm trying to get my 10 year old to eat it all so I can buy the good stuff.
