I received this Gloria Jean's Hazelnut coffee this weekend; the same brand from the same location I've always gotten it (in fact, its a Subscribe and Save order).  I went to make coffee this morning and almost all the coffee grinds came out of the pod.  I thought it may have been a fluke so I tried 2 more times...both times with the same result.<br />To make sure it wasn't my Keurig I tried a different brand of coffee that I had at home and it worked fine, no coffee grinds at all.<br /><br />I don't know what happened, but this lot of GJ Hazelnut is NOT GOOD!!!
