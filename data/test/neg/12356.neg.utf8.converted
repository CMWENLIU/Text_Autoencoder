The item for sale is advertised as Land O' Lakes Traditional Half n' Half Creamers, and I recieved Land O' Lakes Mini Moos with the experation of less than 2 months.  I actually paid a little more to order from this company to avoid getting mini moos.  The Traditional is says it has no preservatives and needs no refrigeration because it's Ultra-pasteurized.  The Mini Moos contain: sodium citrate, datem, tetra sodium pyrophosphate, carrageenan.
