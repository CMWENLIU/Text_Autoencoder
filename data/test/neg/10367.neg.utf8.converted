Please correct me if I am wrong, but ours was infested with bugs! I ordered the subscribe and save a few months ago and as the bag instructed, I refrigerated the contents of the bag that I opened. I left the other two bags unopened in my cupboard. I have never had any trouble with bugs in my flour or anything else (aside from ants near sugary stuff on occasion because we live near water) like it before. I just went to open a bag and the top was coated in these little tiny brown bugs. It was so disgusting. My second unopened bag had fewer bugs, but bugs nonetheless. I hope this doesn't mean that the original bag that I had opened and refrigerated had bug eggs in it or something, but I just don't know. The flour was a little strong-tasting and not worth the extra money, as well. I think I will stick with the TJ's white WW flour.
