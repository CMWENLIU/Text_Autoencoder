Got this for my husband who is having intestinal problems...have always used and loved raw honey, but after reading about the  special qualities of the manuka decided to give it a try despite the (for us) exorbitant price. Firstly, tastes terrible, but we were kind of expecting that. Secondly, and most importantly for us, didn't do a bit of good. Hear it helps some folks,but didn't help us :(
