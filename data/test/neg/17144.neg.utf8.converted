I have enjoyed this vanilla coffee taste for years but the new packets are inconvenient and not in the right portions. This annoyance could be overlooked if it didn't also cost almost twice as much. Used to pay about $1.37 per ounce in the old canisters and now it costs $2.55 per ounce for the same coffee. Thanks, Nescafe!
