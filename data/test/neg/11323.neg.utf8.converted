I've been drinking canned coconut water for years and there is considerable variation in the quality available out there. This stuff is, without a doubt, the most insipid, bland, flavorless product to ever come out of a beverage container. Even the cheapest coconut water available in a metal can has more flavor and character than O.N.E. What's even more disappointing is that compared to fresh coconut water it tastes like its' been diluted with about 4 parts water to ONE part coconut. They must harvest the coconuts as soon as they have any juice in them. Even adding sugar was no help. I cannot believe that there are any positive reviews based on the product that I received and can only guess that quality control is non-existant. Those who posted positive reviews MUST have gotten a better batch. I had a bad experience with O.N.E. Acai juice also. It was revolting (but, at least it wasn't bland). Please read my ONE star rating of that rot before you decide to buy any. No more O.N.E. products for me, EVER.
