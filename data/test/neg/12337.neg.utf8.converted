Benecol Smart Chews disappeared from the market for a while, and returned in a "new-and-improved formula".  I'm so disappointed with the new formula.  I have no idea if it works any more, and I won't find out, because the taste is not good.  I used to enjoy them as a snack - nearly as good as a caramel.  Now they taste grainy, greasy, and artificial, and it's nearly impossible to get the metal wrapper off the chew.  In addition, they give me gas, unlike the old formula.  I won't be re-ordering.
