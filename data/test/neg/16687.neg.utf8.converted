As I have problems with sleep at night and tried all sorts of things which are most commonly recommended to improve it, I tought I try this well rated product. I tried it in all the various recommended dosages. But it didn't make the slightest difference for me. Thus I guess that it probably only works if the cause of the unrest is a magnesium deficiency.<br />Reportedly:<br />"With supplements, overdose is possible, however, particularly in people with poor renal function; occasionally, with use of high cathartic doses of magnesium salts, severe hypermagnesemia has been reported to occur even without renal dysfunction".<br />"Safety Issues<br />The US government has set the following upper limits for use of magnesium supplements:<br />Children<br />1-3 years: 65 mg<br />4-8 years: 110 mg<br />Adults: 350 mg<br />Pregnant or Nursing Women: 350 mg"<br />"It has been called nature's calcium channel blocker."<br />"Magnesium assists in calcium uptake, but it also competes with dietary calcium for the same absorption site in the intestine. Excessive dietary calcium (or phosphorus) is much more likely to block magnesium absorption than vice- versa in the typical American diet. Magnesium absorption is also inhibited by excessive dietary fat, phosphate, lactose, phytates and oxalates which form insoluble compounds with magnesium. Magnesium is also lost in diarrhea, long term use of diuretics, excessive sugar intake and protein malnutrition...<br />...  there are lower levels of minerals in food today due to depletion of the soil in modern farming methods. (23) Modern methods of milling, processing and the preservation of food cause nutrient losses, eg 85% of magnesium is removed from whole wheat in the milling."<br />Thus it is advisable to consult a qualified health care provider if a deficiency is suspected.<br />It's usually best to avoid deficiencies by a healthy diet: "Kelp is very high in magnesium, as are whole grains, almonds, and cashews..."
