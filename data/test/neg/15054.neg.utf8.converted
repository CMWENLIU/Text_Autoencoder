Well, what can I say?  I regret this purchase of Bridgeford Italian salami (I didn't buy the hard salami).  The quality of the salami is just so-so, not terrible but not comparable in quality to slightly more-expensive salamis available at my local grocers.  The taste?  Not bad but not great either, a walk on the mild side (in other words, bland and a bit rubbery-tasting).<br /><br />Stick with Hillshire Farm, Genoa, Gallo, etc...Bridgeford makes good pepperoni but their salami is sub-par and not worth the money.
