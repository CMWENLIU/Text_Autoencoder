When it comes to doggy bags, I think consumers have the right to be outrageously critical. If 1 out of 1,000 bags rips during mid-poo-pick-up, the company automatically deserves zero stars in my opinion. In this case, about 9 out of the last 13 bags I've used from this brand has ripped either pre or post pick-up. It's incredibly annoying. And friggin gross. I've had to double-bag the last few times just to be extra cautious.<br /><br />The entire bag and its opening is very narrow, which makes flipping it inside out a pain in the ass, especially if you have an average or larger sized fist. Not only that, but if you have a medium/large sized dog that produces medium/large sized doggy doos, then in the process of flipping the bag inside out, you'll actually smear throughout the entire bag opening, which makes tying it up an even more delicate process. Just plain annoying. The seams are the weakest points, and that's where the rips tend to happen. No handles for easy tying -- also pretty annoying.<br /><br />In general, these suck.
