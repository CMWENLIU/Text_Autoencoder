I found this product to be unacceptable.<br />The first criticism goes to the flavor which I found to be missing.  The product is supposed to have an orange flavor.  I find it very weak.  I prefer a more robust flavor.  Secondly, to put it as delicately as I can, I believe it caused me lower abdominal distress.<br />I will be canceling my second shipment.  I drank four cans and had the same experience with each.
