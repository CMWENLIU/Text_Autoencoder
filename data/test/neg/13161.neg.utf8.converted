I personally did not enjoy this product.  However, taste is a matter of personal preference.  In an effort to help you decide, I'll provide the list of things that I noticed:<br /><br />1.  Inconvenient for the product to be mixed with 8oz of water, instead of the more standard 12oz.;<br />2.  Heavy foaming when pouring the packet may not be appetizing for some;<br />3.  Doesn't fully dissolve, leaving white specs on the bottom of the glass after thorough stirring;<br />4.  The flavor was very mild, and a little sour;<br />5.  Shortly after mixing, the texture was more like a little mild chalk was mixed in--there was no fizz;<br />6.  The color was a slightly cloudy dark hot pink; and<br />7.  My stomach was a little unsettled after drinking 1/4 of a glass.<br /><br />I hope this helps your decision.
