I bought these in a effort to give my family and I something healthier to snack on, and have a quick breakfast if need be.  I have to say, these are the WORST granola bars I've ever had.  They are very small, dry, and probably would make great hockey pucks.  Save your money and check out 18 Rabbits instead.
