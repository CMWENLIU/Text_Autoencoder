I originally purchased this product from Amazon a few months ago, and was very satisfied. Shortly after, I bought it in a health food store and could not understand the difference! I have since realized that the second jar, which still sits half-full in my cupboard, is a new formula. They have changed the recipe to include a hazelnut-almond blend. Definitely not the same texture or taste as the original. Very disappointed!
