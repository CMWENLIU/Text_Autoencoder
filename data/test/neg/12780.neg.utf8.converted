I was unimpressed with SWITCH WATERMELON/STRAWBERRY. It's just another entry into the sparkling juice market--a market that really didn't need another brand, especially not one lacking in anything new or interesting.<br /><br />Like all the other sparkling juice drinks, its flavor comes mostly from apple and grape juice concentrates; the flavors on the label are only a small part of the ingredients list. The result is that this doesn't really taste like watermelon OR strawberry.  Instead, it fits some food scientist's "flavor profile" of those two tastes, kind of watermelon-ish, kind of strawberry-ish, but lacking in both. The flavor is just not anything to shout about, and no better than the other products on the market.<br /><br />I'm also not sure why it's called SWITCH. I guess it's a marketing thing--they want people to "switch" from IZZE or whatever they currently drink. Well, I know that *I* won't be switching anytime soon, at least not for this boring, low-quality drink.
