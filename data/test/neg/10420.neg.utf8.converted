Unfortunately, this seller on the AMAZON website claims the Organic Matcha Green Tea Powder comes from Island Teas -- which I know is a trusted seller of this product. When received tea was NOT from Island Teas and it was a dark green color and more bitter in taste the "correct tea" is ceremony grade (the highest and most expensive and a light green color).  I returned the item and they claimed they would give me a full refund once receiving it. They received according to the tracking for the package and never responded to my email for the refund. Had to file an A-Z claim with Amazon and finally after weeks Amazon refunded my money.  Don't order from this seller - dishonest. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OS8RKS">Organic Ceremony Grade 1 Matcha Green Tea Powder 200 Grams Bulk</a>
