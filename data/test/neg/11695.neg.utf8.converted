Maybe I got a bad batch? This stuff doesn't even remotely smell like soy OR vanilla. It's so unappealing that I can't even bring myself to mix some up and try it - and usually soy protein powder is a pretty standard product that tastes pretty good (to me, anyway). Thumbs down on this one - something's not quite right here!
