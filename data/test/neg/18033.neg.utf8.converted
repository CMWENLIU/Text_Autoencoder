These were of a different quality than the first bag of 20 chews I purchased online.  They were the same brand, but the package was different and they were much lower in quality.  My dog had diarrhea for two days after downing one of these.  They were darker and different colors, compared to the first batch which were white and consistent. I'm almost afraid to order online again.
