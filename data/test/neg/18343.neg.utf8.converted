It isn't just this product where the prices are high. If you go the Hasbro site you will see that all the product prices are EXTREMELY OVERPRICED! I looked at "plastic food" and they were trying to sell it for over $50 dollars in some cases. Toys are a bad buy at Amazon plus the shipping is outrageous. I would suggest toys are something worth driving for if Amazon is the alternative.
