I purchased the Keurig OfficePRO for my daughter and her family as a Christmas present. She tried it out only to call me to tell me that this $$$$$ item made a very loud noise AND it wouldn't brew at all!!  She contacted the vendor to return it and was told she could only receive a store credit (my bad....didn't check that out before I purchased). So she went through the manufacturer directly and now she has to pay a substantial amount to get the home brewing system. Because she is a sweet, thoughtful daughter she refuses to tell me how much this is going to cost her.  I am very disappointed in this whole experience, as I read the reviews of the home brewing systems before I settled on the OfficePro. So I would not recommend this product through any vendor!!
