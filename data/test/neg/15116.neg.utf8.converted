I bought this product, and the Soda Stream Jet, just to experience the healthful benefits of Sarsaparilla. The word "imitation" does not appear in the product description.<br /><br />The motto "Don't Squeeze Use Fee's" makes it seem even more deceptive. What would I otherwise have had to squeeze? Imitation sarsaparilla?
