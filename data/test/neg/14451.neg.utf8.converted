My daughter and I have gluten intolerance problem, we could not even have oatmeal. Millets become one of the best choice for the breakfast. We ordered two 25 lbs before, and they were pretty good. So we subscribed auto shippment every two months. Suprisingly, there were so many unhulled millets in the third order, and no one in the family could swollow them. They are for birds not human being! I called Amazon.com to complaint about it, and got refund for it. I am not going to buy this product again!
