This cereal is masquerading as healthy.  Yes, it is organic and gluten-free, but it also is a processed food containing a fair amount of sugar at 7g per serving (second ingredient is organic evaporated cane juice) and gets its fiber from added inulin (and maybe additional sweetening from this ingredient), rather than just from whole grains.  The major grain constituents of corn meal/flour and brown rice flour are not the healthiest grain ingredients but might be needed to get a decent gluten free cereal (this contains no oats, which are also gluten free).  The amount of fiber per serving is 3g, not too great for a healthy cereal.  This is not a fortified cereal, so Vitamin A, C and calcium are 0% and iron only 4% of RDA.<br /><br />The package is somewhat deceptive in that it lists a serving as having relatively low calories (110 calories), but the reason becomes evident when looking into the serving size.  The cereal serving size is 2/3c = 30g = 1.10 oz, which is smaller when compared to standard natural cereal serving sizes (which I have found to be more in the 1.5 to 1.8 oz range), so this is the reason that the calories appear lower.  Possibly this serving size may be more appropriate for children.  As an adult, eating only 1.10 oz of this cereal does not fill me up.<br /><br />The cereal tastes pretty good, if you like a sweet cereal, and I think kids would like this.  It appears to be a mixture of organic versions of Kix (hollow corn spheres), tiny Rice Krispies and some kind of fiber flakes, with tiny bits of other stuff (possibly sugar coated puffed quinoa etc).  Maybe it has a hint of vanilla flavor, but it mostly tasted sweet to me.  It was quite good with fresh sliced strawberries on top and regular milk.  The cereal did not appear as appetizing as the glossy photo on the package.<br /><br />The box is only 10.6oz, so it won't last long if increasing the amount per serving and thus is not the best value.  I suppose this cereal may be a good option for people who need a tasty/sugary gluten-free cereal.  But there certainly are healthier and cheaper options out there (even standard oatmeal).  Rated 2 1/2 stars, rounded down to 2 stars.
