Although I like the idea of this product, my cats hated it. One is very picky, so no surprise there, but the other eats anything! He was meowing and excited but when I put the bowl down he sniffed it and reared his head back and completely snubbed it. I can't tell you how shocked I was by his reaction. I ordered it direct from the company, so it wasn't spoiled. I have to give it 1 star because neither of my cats would touch it.
