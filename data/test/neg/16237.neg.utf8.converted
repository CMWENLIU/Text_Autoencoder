I generally purchase Jeremiah's Fogbuster for a strong and rich French Roast coffee however I wanted to check out this brand and see whether it was any good (the price was right).  I'm pretty disappointed.  While the coffee is strong, it lacks depth and richness.  Unlike Jeremiah's, I found it lacking in flavor.  I would not buy this coffee again.
