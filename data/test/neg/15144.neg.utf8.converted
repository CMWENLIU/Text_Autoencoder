I have gone through 3 cases of this stuff.  The first time I bought two cases, because I like vita coco's other flavors, and this was on sale.  BAD MOVE.  One entire case was spoiled.  All the cartons had a foul odor and brown gunk around the lip.  So Amazon sent me replacement.  I think the new one was fresh, but I just cant bring myself to drink any of it because it still smells foul.  This product is just plain horrible, plan and simple.  Other flavors are great, but not this one.
