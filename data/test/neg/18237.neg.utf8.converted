Make sure when you shop for Kopi Luwak that you are getting the actual 100% Kopi. There are a number of blends out there that sport a whopping 2% or 3% of Kopi beans mixed with something else. The true Kopi has a remarkable smokey, silky character with a wonderful caramel finish that coats your mouth long after swallowing. I just shared some with my veteran coffee roaster (his first taste) and he remarked that it was the best coffee he had tasted since the old Kona before the quality dropped in the early 90's. Real Kopi should be treated like gold and with respect by: Using a burr grinder on the fine side of medium grind; making a single cup at a time; and using water at about 190F (boil filtered water and let it sit for 1 minute). Wet the grounds (about 2 standard coffee measuring scoops) with a little water at first, then pour just enough for one 8 oz. cup. BTW I discovered you can reuse the grounds from this process one more time with only a little reduction in quality if you make the second cup right away. You can stretch your Kopi dollars this way since you are spending about 7$ a cup.
