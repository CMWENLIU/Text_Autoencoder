My mug came today and I was so disappointed.  You put loose leaves in the infuser and the holes are so big that you end up with tea that is more "bark" than liquid!  I even tried loose tea that came with the mug and it was the same problem.  I would have to strain it again with some other strainer in order to drink it.  What a waste of money!
