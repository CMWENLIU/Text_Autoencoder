I buy these religiously for my kids lunches...until today.  From now on I will not buy these ever again.  For a quick dinner tonight I put in a pizza and pull out 2 milk boxes for my boys.  My youngest takes a sip and shakes his head dramatically.  I don't think too much of it (he just turned 2 yesterday), then 10 minutes later he takes another sip with the same reaction.  I take a sip out of curiosity and race to the sink to spit out the sludge/liquid rancid milk before I vomit.  Now I'm anxiously waiting to see if he gets sick.  I used to work in quality control and I now have no faith in Horizon's quality assurance/control practices.  Never will I buy this again!
