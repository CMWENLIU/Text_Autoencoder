The candy corn had many imperfections, was grainier, poorer appearance and just not the same.  As a candy corn officiando, I was taken aback by the foreign black spots found in the candy.  Then I looked at the bag to see where it was made and learned it is now made in Mexico.  So I went on a search for American made candy corn, which I found, so no more Brach's candy corn for this family.
