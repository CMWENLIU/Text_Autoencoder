The packaging for this product proudly proclaims they're organic, dairy-free, gluten-free, vegetarian and "manufactured" with renewable energy.  There's even a photo of a large wind-turbine for emphasis.  If you worship at the altars of environmentalism or political correctness you'll love this product.  But if you just want good food you're out of luck.  What's inside the package are not the glowing orange apricots shown in Amazon's listing.  Instead there's a group of very dark blackish-brown fruit that has an unpleasant off taste.<br /><br />( And to Amazon's credit I did get a refund when I showed them how what I got differed from what was shown. )
