I planned to make rainbow cake in a jar for my son's first birthday.  The colors were not vibrant like regular food color, but were pretty and rich.  At least in the uncooked cake batter.  But when the cakes came out of the oven, there was no trace of color at all.  It looked like I had just baked regular yellow cake with no dye whatsoever.  I was so so sad to be serving plain cake in a jar.
