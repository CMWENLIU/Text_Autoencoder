I have been a Cheerios consumer for the full 25 years of my life, and I've seen the prices for the little O's slowly climb over the years.  But here, on Amazon, only last Spring this same set of 4-pack 14oz boxes was hardly $12 for the set!  Now it's almost doubled?!  Most groceries sell the 14oz box at about $4 a box, this is close to $6 a box.  I never thought I'd give Cheerios anything less than 5 stars.  Until Amazon's price goes back to normal I will be getting my Cheerios at Target, for around half the price.
