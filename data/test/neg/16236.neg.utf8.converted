The product itself was just fair.<br />But the worst part of this order the condition that it came in.  All six bags were terribly broken up.  Each bag had very little chex pieces left in them because of poor shipping!  I purchased another item along with this one and who ever packaged this put a box in the middle of a shipping box and put the chex mix on the sides (as if they were packaging cushions)!  Who does Amazon have working in their shipping department?  Obviously not a lot of common sense.  I will not buy this product again.. or any other "fragile" items!
