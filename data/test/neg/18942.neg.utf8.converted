I wasn't expecting much from a calorie-free "chocolate" dip. I figured it would taste mostly like artificial sweetener, and so I didn't plan to eat it straight. I sliced up a banana, put a tablespoonful or so of the dip on it, and then topped with with some fat-free whipped topping--so there were two things I *really* like in the bowl with the dip.<br /><br />I still couldn't finish it. I'm a diabetic, so I have to watch the amount of sweets I eat; I have a real sweet tooth, so I'm *used* to the flavour of artificial sweeteners and "fake" foods. (People, I think Fat Free Cool Whip is *good stuff*. We're talking "not a gourmet," here. Definitely not a food snob. But I thought that this was NASTY.<br /><br />Why two stars? Because my housemate *loved* it. He's happily spooning it onto oatmeal, fruit, graham crackers... he may be putting it on his hamburgers, for all I know. :) And if someone else thought it was *that* good, I can't give it one star, even if I personally loathe it.
