I put this on my wish list and luckily someone purchased it for me. I don't want to sound ungrateful at all but this is not at all what I had expected it to be. It is NOT the same as the one Alton Brown uses on his show. Which is hard to see that from the photos (when I first looked at the item there was only 1 photo), now there are additional photos of the item which shows that is has basically no handle to hold the salt cellar. The seal on mine keeps the lid from closing and it looks like it is ajar and will allow moisture in. When I tried opening and closing, when holding by the "handle", the lid of the cellar I about dropped out of my hand. I don't know about anyone else but I'd prefer not to spill a bunch of salt and have broken glass in my kitchen, because of a poorly designed item. I hate to return gifts but I think this has to go back.
