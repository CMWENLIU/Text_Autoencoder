On the upside, it's herbal so I haven't felt bad giving it to him, and he doesn't mind the taste at all (we just drop it on a treat first). On the down side, it hasn't done much (if anything) for our dog's separation anxiety. We've tried it for about two weeks and haven't seen any improvement. We wanted to give it a go first before having to try prescription drugs. He's not upset/anxious/afraid of anything else, so I can't speak for it's effectiveness for any other events/traumatic situations, but for us it just isn't working for separation anxiety. Fortunately, it's perfectly safe for human use, so we'll probably just try the rest of the bottle for ourselves!
