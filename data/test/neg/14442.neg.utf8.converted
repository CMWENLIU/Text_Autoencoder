As I said above, the "vanilla" you'll get is artificial; it's Vanillin, not the way more expensive Vanilla being advertised.  Personally, I don't care for Vanillin, because it tastes harsh and chemical-laden to me.  This stuff tastes no different than the fake vanilla at the supermarket, and I didn't have to trouble my poor mailman into delivering it.
