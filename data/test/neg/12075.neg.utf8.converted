If you are looking to experience matcha, do not buy this product!  This product is common green tea powder.  Matcha is the result of stone grinding a very high quality tea called tencha.  Because tencha is shade grown, it is sweeter, less bitter, and has a much higher l-theanine content than regular green tea.  L-theanine is partially responsible for the feeling of well-being that real matcha produces.  For the details, look up the wikipedia entry for matcha.  This ain't it!
