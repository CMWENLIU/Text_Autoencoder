I had tried the Betty Crocker GF Brownie mix and loved it, so I bought these without testing them first. Silly me... They must be eaten while still warm. If you wait too long, they develop a sandy texture and loose much of their flavor.<br /><br />Just the two of us, so I mix up a batch and roll them into balls. I refrigerate the balls until we feel like warm out of the oven cookies. Then I only bake as many as I know we will eat for that one treat time.
