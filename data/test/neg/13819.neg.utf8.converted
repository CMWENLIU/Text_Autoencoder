We are on our third Keurig Coffee Maker.  The original model has worked well for three years, although it's internal timer has given out. (We just turn it on and off)  The second and third machines were the B70 Platinum, and worked well for about 9 months, at which point they either refused to pump water through the K-Cup altogether, or "short cupped" us by pumping some of the water back into the reservoir. Keurig replaced the first, and the replacement began to act up in December.<br /><br />After two hours on the phone today with both Keurig and Green Mountain Coffee, their K-Cup division (Timothys, Tullys, Newman's, Caribou, etc.) it turns out that some K-Cups get "domed" because the "coffee is so fresh."  (The dome is apparently caused by gases emitted by the coffee grounds, creating a slight overpressure - bold coffees appear to be most susceptible to this phenomen.)<br /><br />When a "domed" K-cup is placed in the machine in accordance with the manual, however, the upper needle, which includes the water channels, can be clogged by grounds forced up into them by this internal overpressure condition.<br /><br />Keurig claims to have just discovered the problem and to be developing a solution, but in the interim, they advise puncturing the bottom of a "domed" K-Cup first by forcing it down on the lower needle before closing the top.  If the machine is already clogged, their recommended technique is a paper clip to ream out the water channels, then running water (without a K-Cup) into a measuring cup to verify that the various cup settings are producing the correct volume of water.  (None of this is addressed in the manual.)<br /><br />We've been buying the K-Cups from Amazon in bulk because of their good price, but have lately had two boxes of mostly "domed" Timothys Extra Bold Rainforest Expresso, which seem to have caused our difficulty.  (Keurig claims that they've not had any problems with the smaller 24 count boxes which they market directly.)<br /><br />There is a "best used by" date on each K-Cup, and most of our "domed" K-Cups seem to either approaching or beyond their use by date, so "caveat emptor" when buying in volume from Amazon and other quantity purveyors of K-Cups, where the boxes may spend more time in the warehouse than otherwise . . . .
