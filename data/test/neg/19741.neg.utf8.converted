I purchased two packages of this product, but have only opened one of them. Not only did this package contain seeds, but the seeds have been sliced and broken up into small sharp pieces that may harm one's esophagus and/or intestinal tract if swallowed. The only way to eat the tamarind is to hold a small amount in your mouth without swallowing, and allow your saliva to loosen the tamarind while your tongue locates the pieces of seeds so you can remove them with your fingers. Only when you're sure all pieces of seed have been removed should you begin chewing the tamarind. I gave this product a "1" rating but only because I wasn't allowed to give it a "0".
