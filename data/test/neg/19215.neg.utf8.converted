my cat, Rosie, was having loose stools, diarreah, etc on and off. I finally found the best cat food for her and thought we were done with her intestinal bouts. I had not given her Greenies for a few months and never thought that 4 to 5 of those little treats could cause a problem.....I was wrong.<br /><br />She has only been back on Greenies for a week and once again, diarreah.....and she is a long haired Ragdoll, so imagine the mess!! I'm taking her to the vet today to rule out anything else, but I've got this gut feeling that Greenies and Rosie do not agree with each other.<br /><br />My male cat has no problem with them. So, I'm not saying Greenies are bad for every cat, but maybe some cats are too sensitive to their ingredients.....<br /><br />anyway, always, always look at your pet's food when their health declines in anyway......its the single most important thing we do for them everyday.<br /><br />oh....and as far as tartar and dry food/treats keeping their teeth healthy....that's bunk! that would be the equivalent of saying that if humans eat pretzels, their teeth will stay clean.....it does not work that way with US or our pets. You must brush their teeth, or take them to the vet for that.
