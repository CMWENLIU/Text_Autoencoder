I ordered two of these and will basically have to throw them away.  I make chocolate truffles with all natural ingredients, and I normally make my own candied lemon peel.  The process is lengthy, however, and I was looking for a small way to save time by ordering this item online.  The problem I found is that the ingredients are far from all natural, and I cannot in good conscience use these on my truffles.  Not to mention the fact that the preservatives in them would taste bad.  I immediately called Barry Farm and asked to return them and they refused to help me in any way -- no returns, no credits for other items, and no compensation whatsoever.  If you are concerned at all that the ingredients are natural, I suppose you have to zoom in on the label (which is illegible otherwise).  This is a lesson learned for me, and I won't be ordering from Barry Farm in the future.  The two 8 oz. containers are still new and sealed tightly together with shrink wrap.  Anyone care to purchase them from me for a bargain???  If you comment on this, I should receive an email.
