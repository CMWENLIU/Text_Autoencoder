I was so excited to hear they were bringing this sweet strawberry flavored licorice roll back....only to order two boxes and I could tell the minute I opened wrapper and smelled them, they weren't even close.  What ever happened to the sweet original licorice taste from when I was growing up?? Licorice now tastes waxy and synthetic.....so bummed!
