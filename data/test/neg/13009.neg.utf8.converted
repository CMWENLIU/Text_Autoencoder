Let me just kick this off by saying that I like most of what Taco Bell has to offer in their fast food restaurants. I can't stand their red sauce that comes on some of the burritos but that is about it.<br /><br />How are you going to know if your taste matches mine? Let me list a few like and dislikes and that may help you decide if this sauce is for you.<br /><br />Like: Mustard, sour creme, ketchup, buttermilk ranch dressing (on pizza only), sweet hot mustard, brown mustard, spicy stuff. So, generally savory condiments and food.<br /><br />Dislike: Mayo of any kind shape or form. All salad dressing except Ranch as noted above (that's right, I eat my salads plain and it is oh so good). Sweet things that should be savory like sweet pickles or relish or chow chow. Things I know are mayo based like guacamole.<br /><br />This jalapeno sauce is savory not sweet.<br /><br />Really TB won me over about 20 years ago when they came out with their Wild Sauce. That stuff was awesome! Anyway, since then I am always open minded when they come out with something new.<br /><br />So, when I saw this in the store a while back I grabbed it up! Jalapeno sauce?! Yum! heh<br /><br />Made tacos that night just so I could try it out. Yuck. I gave it a real try too, first just a taste and then a good little amount. I tried it with a little on a tortilla chip. I had another person try it. She didn't like it either.<br /><br />First off, there is a distinct flavor that has nothing to do with jalapenos. And it is not a good flavor. I assume this sauce is sour creme based but I guess they could be using some kind of cheap mayo. Whatever.<br /><br />Secondly, jalapeno? Where's the jalapeno flavor? Perhaps it has one but it is so mild it is overpowered by the other strong flavor in the base of whatever makes up this sauce.<br /><br />It wasn't spicy.<br /><br />So. If you are not a big fan of TB then I'd give this a wide berth.<br /><br />If you love all things TB then I think you should try it out. This is the sort of thing that really demands a taste test to know if you'll like it or not.
