They were delivered quickly in an undamaged box. Every milkway bar was cut in half, sometimes in thirds and the edges where it was cut were hard and discolared.  Every bar was contaminated.  The seller refused to admit they sent me damaged merchandise and would not accept a return,  I have spent 9 months in the hospital, am dirt poor because of medical expenses, and was buying these to try to gain weight as 96 pounds and 5'7" is down right skinny.  I put together my pennies, literally, to buy these and this seller ripped me off.  I will never buy anything like this from amazon again.  I complained the day I received it and neither the seller or amazon would help me.  BE CAREFUL, YOU GET LESS THEN WHAT YOU PAY FOR ON AMAZON.  One time on ebay I had a problem and ebay helped me right away.
