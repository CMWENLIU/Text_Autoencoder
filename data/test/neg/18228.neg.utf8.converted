My son wanted cotton candy cupcakes for his 8th birthday so I searched online and found this flavor mix.  It's horrible.  When I opened it to mix with the frosting starter base, the flavor mix smelled of chemicals.  I asked my 8 year old to taste it and he hated it.  I tasted it and threw it away.  It's got a really bad after-taste that I couldn't get out of my mouth.  I would not recommend this product, at least the cotton candy flavor, to anyone.  Yuck. P.S. I gave it one star because that's the least I could give it.
