Mostly decaf. I won't order this mix again. While I knew there would be a few in the mix I assumed it would be mostly caffeine. Lots of teas. At least 2 of the cups are past the "best before" date. One of the cups had been cut open & had leaked coffee grounds in the package. I'm not very satisfied.
