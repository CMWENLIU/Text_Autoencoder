If you're trying to avoid aspartame, this gum doesn't have any but like other chiclet-type gums, the flavor is gone in about two minutes and what you're left with is a sickening blob that you probably won't want in your mouth for very long.<br /><br />I chew gum to help with acid reflux, but I can't stand chicklet-type gums and would not have bought this had a I known that's what it was. I much prefer stick gum, so the search continues for something that more closely resembles stick without the aspartame.
