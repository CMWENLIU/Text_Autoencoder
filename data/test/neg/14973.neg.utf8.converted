I'm pretty adventurous about trying healthy foods, so after hearing about making your own kale chips on blogs, I decided to buy some first. I think the word "chips" is what mislead me - a chip to me is crunchy and dense - these literally taste like dead leaves off a tree. They are very airy and light (very leafy and paper like) and not very filling. But that may be just what you're after - a lot of people give kale chips rave reviews, so I guess it's best to say "to each his own." I just can't get past the texture and density. On the other hand, I researched kale and found it's super safe for dogs, so . . . my two dogs give this product 5 BIG stars; they LOVE this stuff!
