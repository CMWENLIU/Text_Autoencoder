I ordered two dozen beautiful red roses for an out of state friend, who was sick and on the couch with a new cancer diagnosis. Looking at the picture I thought that this would be just the pick me up that she needed. After placing the order I patiently waited for my friend to call to say that she had received this beautiful surprise. The flowers...one dozen not the two ordered arrived regular mail, "Deader than a door nail," per the recipient and the kicker was a note on the box postage due. So cancer girl gets dead flowers and that postage due??? Nice really nice. Two Dozen Red Roses
