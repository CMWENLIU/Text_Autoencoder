I couldn't wait to receive these Cafe Mocha flavored K-cups and try them. I was sadly disappointed in the first sip, there was a funny after taste. I tried it again, funny after taste was still present. Just to make sure it wasn't just me I had other co-workers try it too and they also thought it tasted funny. Don't waste your money.
