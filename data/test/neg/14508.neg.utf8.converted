After reading the reviews I bought one of each Zuke's mini bakes flavor. I have offered them to my own dogs as well as several training client's dogs. The reaction varies between dog smelling treat and turning away, dog taking treat and spitting it out, and dog taking treat reluctantly and eating it but not looking for more. All three flavors have a stale sawdust smell. No, I will not buy them again.
