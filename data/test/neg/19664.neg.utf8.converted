9 year old, domestic shorthaired:<br />I made the mistake of purchasing a large 14lb bag. I read the ingredients and they seemed pretty decent vs IAMS. The percentages were fairly comparable with each other. I figured let's give it a try. After a month, my cat has thrown up food+hairballs at least 3 times already (but at least no diarrhea). It seemed like it would've been a good change and my cat certainly didn't object to it.....but he's never thrown up so many times and consistently too. I emailed Purina to see what they say but I'm sticking with IAMS. There's no substitute for quality.
