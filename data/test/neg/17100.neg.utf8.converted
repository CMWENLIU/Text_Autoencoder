So, a pack of 8, 64 0z. containers of Westsoy milk is $38.68 - reasonable price.  But the shipping to my location is $56+.  So why would I ever order this?  It's insane & the sellers must have removed their brains from their heads to even suggest anyone would pay almost 1-1/2 times the cost of the product to ship it.  Get real!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTITQ0">Westsoy Nonfat Plain Soy, 64-Ounce (Pack of 8)</a>
