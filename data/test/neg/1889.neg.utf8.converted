My cat, who has been on a gluten-free all-canned diet for a few years, did not like this food.  I got her to eat maybe two tablespoons over the course of two days and that was all it took to wreak havoc with her system.  I bought the food based on my complete satisfaction with the same brand of canned food and also because I would like to be able to feed dry food in addition to canned.  I thought my cat would appreciate some variety as would I.  So here I am wide awake at 3 am laundering sheets because immediately after a near liquid litter box episode she bee-lined it for my bed.  Obviously this food is a huge success in some households and I wish more than anyone that my experience was positive too.  But considering my lost night's sleep, the total waste of money, and the negative impact on my cat's health, what other rating can I give this product?  I rate based on my own experience and this purchase was disastrous for me and my cat so I give one star.
