The order was received as promised - overnight - My disappointment came when I opened the Amazon shipping box to discover that the lollipops were an Oriental Trading Company product - The lollipops were in the original packaging from Oriental Trading - It did not mention this anywhere on the shopping page - The second disappointment was the quality of the candy themselves - I needed 14 lollipops for a party so I ordered 2 boxes - Lucky for me I had to over order because out of the 24 lollipops - 6 were broken!!! Unacceptable!!
