It's no wonder they had to break up this little cup of soup into 2 (TWO) entire servings. They are obviously trying to distract the casual viewer into to believing that there is only 300 mg of sodium in this tiny cup. There is actualy 600 mg of sodium in this tiny snack and that is NOT HEART HEALTHY!!! Avoid these products if you have high blood pressure!
