********Buyers Beware of Pegasus Enterprises******<br /><br />I have been a customer of Amazon for several years but, I have recently been high utterly disappointed with a transaction that I made with Pegasus Enterprises.  Of all my years on Amazon.com, this by far has been the worse.  On December 24th, 2008 I ordered a Vend Star Vending Machine.  The listed shipping price was $14.99 and the total amounted to $59.99.  I made my purchase and eagerly waited for my vending machine to arrive. Around three weeks elapsed before I heard from the company.  When I was contacted by the company, they told me that the machine would not be shipped unless additional money was sent to cover the shipping.  Although I had already made my monetary purchase for the listed price (including shipping), my order was being held and I was told that I had to pay more to cover the additional costs for Pegasus Enterprises because they listed the wrong shipping price.  Needless to say, I was not willing to pay additional to cover Pegasus's Mistake.  They cancelled my order and I will not receive my machine.  This was the most unprofessional business transaction I have ever endured.  I will never buy ANY item from this company again and I suggest that no one else does either!!!!
