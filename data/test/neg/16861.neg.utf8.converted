I have been a fan of this company's other soups that I've tried. To my taste, the cream of crab just doesn't cut it. On the lable it shows a white colored soup. What you get inside is tan colored. Why? Beats me. The flavor is very off putting, perhaps from too much low class sherry. I'll make this review short and to the point. This product is not enjoyable.
