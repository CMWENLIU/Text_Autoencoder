Very dissatisfied.  I ordered this variety of K cups because of the wonderful assortment of flavored coffees.  I don't like to drink straight black coffee of any kind, so I was excited that I would be getting something of a treat to look forward to.  This was not the case.  I received it 2 days ago and when I opened it, found only 4 flavored coffees in the whole 24 pack; 2 each pumpkin spice and spiced eggnog.  The rest of the entire order was non-flavored, regular coffee.  I am totally disappointed and upset that I didn't receive at all what I wanted and paid for.  Needless to say, I won't be buying anything from this company again.
