I just cancelled a subscribe and save on this because of a problem with the quality control.  3 packs out of 6 I opened had less than a dozen red kidney beans in each pack. It was more like a thin soup than the Curry as pictured on the packages. The other 3 packages had the proper among of red kidney beans.
