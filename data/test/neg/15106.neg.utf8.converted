Do yourself a favor and do NOT Buy the U.S. version of this product.  This is a bastardized, truly corrupted form of the original made with (GASP!) peanut oil -- surely not to increase its tastiness but to fatten corporate profits.  If you can find a local retailer, try and get at least the Canadian version or even better - original imported Italian or German.  I grew up in Europe and have had many a jar of Nutella in my lifetime but this U.S. version has nothing to do with the original we so much love.  How sad!
