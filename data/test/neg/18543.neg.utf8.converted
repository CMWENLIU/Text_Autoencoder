The taste is bad.. plus it is from concentrate so I dont think it has the same work out<br />recovery effects.<br />Now dont get me wrong Zito had a great idea on being able to take the drink to the gym or<br />biking, but I much prefer the new Vita Coco new screw top, they have much better flavors<br />ONE is pretty good but not as good as Vita coco and this one is about as good as those<br />cans which are terrible.
