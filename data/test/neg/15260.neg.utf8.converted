These literally made me sick.  First, when you open the package you have to drain off the water, which is fine except that once you do the whole thing has the faint scent of fish.  I guess that's not so bad if you like fish, but I don't. (2) Then you have to put them in a pan full of water and boil them for about 1 minute.  What you come up with are these small little pearls that essentially smell fishy and taste like nothing at all unless maybe its pearls of tasteless rubber.  I tried butter and salt, the flavoring from ramen noodles, spaghetti sauce, velveeta for mac and cheese.  Nothing made the consistency of these little pearls any better.  In essence it feels like you are taking a mouthful of big metamucil (which makes me gag anyway).  But beyond that, after I ate the smallest amount of them, they made my stomach cramp and I was nauseated for the rest of the evening.  At first I thought it was just a quirky thing, but I tried something else on them to see if it made them better and I got even sicker.  At that point I was done.  Yeuck.  A waste of money.  I'm going to try the kind mixed with tofu and if they stink as bad as these, or make me sick then I'm done, if I don't end up in the hospital with some gastric illness.
