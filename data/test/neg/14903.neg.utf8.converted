I too stopped feeding Evanger's to my German Shepherd. I do not trust their products because the owners have done some very dishonest things. The company can say whatever they want but I personally feel that if a person is dishonest in one area of their life, then most likely they will be dishonest in all areas.<br /><br />My GSD did eat the lamb and rice and the beef flavor. I want to point out here that my GSD did have frequent diarrhea and nausea when I fed him this can food mixed with a high quality holistic dry food containing oats, barley and rice.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I have changed ALL his food and put him on a grain free diet. I did it for his itchy skin but soon realized that his diarrhea and vomiting/nausea went away completely.<br /><br />I feed him Taste of the Wild dry dog food (salmon formula and lamb formula) mixed with canned EVO 95%. He loves the EVO 95% Beef the best but he just happens to prefer beef. I have used Evo 95% Beef, Duck, Salmon and Chicken/Turkey combination (NOT THE TURKEY/CHICKEN COMBINATION BECAUSE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE). No more digestive issues. This is the regimen I am sticking with.
