I have had this on order for about a total of 8 bags. I first had a good experience and what seemed like a quality jerky and continued to keep it ordered on my subscribe and save account. The next 2 bags were awful. There were tiny bits and they were extra hard and grisly. I thought maybe it was just a bad run and let the next order come through. They were terrible also. It was like there was one or two decent strips of meat, and the rest was inedible. I'm not sure how this keeps happening. I had meant to cancel this subscription but remembered after I was shipped another pack of two. Maybe they'll be better but I haven't been eager to to open them. Roll of the dice, I guess.
