I have had these from Trader Joes few yrs ago when they carried them. They were big juicy and yummy.<br />Navitas ones that got shipped(had 2 bags) were small, more bitter than sour and dry. I will be in search of<br />better ones.<br /><br />Update: i got the same 8 ounce pack from whole foods. 10 times better. Most are juicy, soft and consistent quality.<br />fyi the lot# of whole foods ones is 2521 and one from amazon is 405. That may explain the dried berries from amazon<br />seller.
