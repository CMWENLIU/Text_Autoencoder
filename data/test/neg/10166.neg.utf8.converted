I'm a huge soda fan.  I'm also a huge bacon fan.  Thus, I thought this would be the greatest drink ever made.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's pretty terrible.  It's in-your-face strong.  The aftertaste makes me cringe.  It really felt like I was drinking carbonated bacon grease.<br /><br />I'm not sure the idea of bacon soda is totally junk; this may have just been very poorly executed.  It needs to have a more subtle flavor.  I couldn't even finish half a bottle, it was that disgusting.
