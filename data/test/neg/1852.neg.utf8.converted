After reading reviews from 8-12+ months prior to my purchase complaining about how inferior the milk from Sri Lanka was, I felt confident that Amazon would stop stocking that product and ordered a case. It was from Sri Lanka. It is a thin product that becomes greasy when heated. It lacks the thick rich taste I'm used to from Native Forest. Very disappointed. I only gave it a 2 star because of the BPA free can. I'd like to rate Amazon a zero for not listening to us complain.
