I'm a fan and repeat customer for Leonard Mountain soup mixes, but I was very disappointed with the Minestrone Italian Soup.  It was awful.  I started by gently sauteing onions, celery and carrots in a little olive oil.  Even that base didn't help.  I don't like to waste food, but actually dumped this soup down the garbage disposal. And I do love minestrone soup from Olive Garden, Progresso, as well as my homemade versions.
