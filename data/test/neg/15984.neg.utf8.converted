The bag I got from my vet does not list HFCS in the ingredients.  I was shocked to see it in the ingredients here and at other online stores.  I guess Butler has changed their formula recently?<br /><br />You have to be an extremely bad pet owner to knowingly give your dog HCFS or any type of sugar on a regular basis.<br /><br />What kind of sick company produces this?!
