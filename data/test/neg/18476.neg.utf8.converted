I used Earth's Best 3 years ago for our 1st son. We have a new baby, and I was shocked to find that they had changed lactose to glucose solids (SUGAR). In Europe the practice of adding corn syrup and glucose to infant formula has been banned. All organic formulas in the US have now switched from lactose to a syrup solid or glucose. We are switching to HIPP organic from the UK which is available on Amazon and a british store website. Plus Earth's Best practice of how they get the DHA/ARA is very questionable. #FAIL
