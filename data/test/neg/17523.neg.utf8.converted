I purchased the "I Love You" basket for valentine's day for my boyfriend.  It was total garbage.  All of the snacks were stale, I mean everything, the popcorn, the cookies, and the cheese straws.  I was so disappointed, and was really embarrassed.  The cellophane wrapping was even ripped..............I wish I could get my money back.....
