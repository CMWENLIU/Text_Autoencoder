On my second bag of this cereal I pulled a big black hair from my mouth while I was eating it and on a few spoonfuls later a long black hair with clumps of granola clinging to it was dangling from my spoon that I just lifted from the milk, thats when I decided this cereal was a little too organic. The flavor was not bad just cant get past the hair. And did I mention it was pricey very pricey.
