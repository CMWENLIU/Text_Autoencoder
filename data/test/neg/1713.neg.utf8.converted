My vet suggested we put our yellow lab on an all venison diet.<br />I tried this brand and it seemed to work and her skin issues went away.<br /><br />I ordered another bag of the same product and noticed the texture of the kibble was different but didnt think much of it since the packaging was identical.<br /><br />My groomer noticed that my dog is loosing her hair and asked if we changed her food.<br /><br />I think the first bag was working but something must be different with this second bag.<br /><br />I'm going back to using the venison formula from our local dog food store. $20 more per bag but she wasn't loosing her hair.<br /><br />wish I could get a refund but the bag is half gone and wouldn't know how to return dog food.
