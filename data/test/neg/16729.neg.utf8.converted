My first review on Amazon, and It's a real downer. Ever since I walked over the the vending machine here in the office a few minutes ago and dropped my last 75-cents on Kellogg's Cherry Flavored Fruity Snacks, I felt compelled to log on to the first website I can find that sells these and give them a horrible review, and warn everyone and anyone about this poor excuse for a food product. They taste somewhat like plastic, and the "cherry flavor" is worse than the worst tasting cough medicine you can think of. These don't taste ANYTHING like fruit. These are supposed to be cherry flavored, but the word cherry appears no where in the ingredients (apple puree concentrate is the only fruit item listed), and the word "fruit" doesn't appear anywhere at all. They also pull that bait-and-switch telling you 70 calories per serving, but there's 2.5 servings in these dinky little 2.5oz bags. These are disgusting. It's been 60 minutes and I still can't get this taste out of my mouth. Next time I want something fruit flavored, I'll just eat a piece of fruit. Don't give these to your kids unless they did some horrible thing and you're planning on using these disgusting "Fruit" snacks as some form of punishment.
