I thought this was similar to the Jack Links Peppered Beef Jerky, boy was I wrong.  This stuff is like eating pure SALT.  Nasty as hell.  One package serving is 57% of your recommended daily intake of Sodium.  This is one of the highest content of sodium I've found in Beef Jerky.  I don't recommend this unless you really really like SALT.
