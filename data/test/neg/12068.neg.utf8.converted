I don't usually write negative reviews ... I just don't write anything at all ... but this product is SO BAD that it deserves a really bad review.  FIRST PROBLEM: it is supposedly low in carb but it takes a stick of butter and a mountain of heavy cream to make it.  Huh? Low carb but heart attack fat?  YUK.  SECOND PROBLEM: it is very difficult to make - it has three different bags, needs three bowls, lots of measuring, lots of utensils, lots of work.  It would have been less work to create from scratch.  THIRD PROBLEM: it did not create a "jelly roll" type item - it created a big gloppy sticky mess that was difficult to work with.  FOURTH PROBLEM:  It did not come out like a roll; it came out like a biscuit or a scone.  Just a baked glob.  FIFTH PROBLEM:  it tasted LOUSY.  Just plain lousy.  Not even the pecan topping tasted good.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this mess.  This is the second one of the Dixie Low Carb items I've made and each one is worse than the next.  Don't bother.
