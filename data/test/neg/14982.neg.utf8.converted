The bottle says, "A Difference You Can Taste." For me that would not be a good thing. I don't want my water to taste like anything. Fortunately, this water disappointed...it tastes like, well, water.<br /><br />Now comes the problem. Essentia's Web site is full of hype, but what it comes down to is this: Essentia is filtered city water, just like Aquafina or Dasani...using essentially the same methods. I suspect the raise in pH is from the second ingredient, sodium bicarbonate, aka baking soda. I compared the water test results provided by Essentia on their Web site and those of my local water authority.<br /><br />Essentia says, "Electrolytes are dissolved minerals in the body that conduct electricity, such as calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium. We add trace amounts of those same elements in a formula that complements the body's naturally occurring mix and concentration." They must be really trace amounts. Reading their water test report, neither calcium or potassium are listed, and only .68 mg/l of magnesium. The sodium level is about the same as in my tap water. Certainly not the electrolyte levels of Gatorade.<br /><br />I can find nothing in my research that indicates a pH of 9.5 is anything special.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I'm not impressed. I often buy bottled water instead of soft drinks when traveling. If this were on the shelf in the mini mart, I would reach for the Poland Spring or Aquafina instead.
