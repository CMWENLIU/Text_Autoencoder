Stevia based sweeteners have now proliferated like dandelions. This product was available locally and was on sale so I tried it.<br /><br />Their quality control is abysmal. At times it takes one package to sweeten tea or hot cereal. Then there are other times when it takes three packets to achieve the same sweetness. Same beverage and same hot cereal but some packets just don't have the same amount of the Stevia extract in them.<br /><br />A second problem is that this product tends to clump. It will dissolve OK but the clumping is quite noticable. I would recommend that you look at the reviews and then select some other Stevia based sweetener. I WOULD NOT buy this product again.
