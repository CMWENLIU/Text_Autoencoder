I am from a generation which does not throw away food. But these noodles went in the trash.  Some of the 1 star reviews were correct in stating the texture as being the primary problem. This is a great way to ruin a good meal by using these noodles as a base. Rubbery describes them well. It's like your mouth does not know what to do with them. I don't gag easily, but this had me close. There are other ways to lose weight, which do not include this kind of food torture. They do not even deserve a single star. Buyer beware.
