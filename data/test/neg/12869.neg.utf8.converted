I had been using these with much success for my cat for the last 8 months.  He has to have seizure medication twice a day, and he loves the pill pockets.  About 3 months ago, he started having chronic diarrhea that got worse and worse.  The vet tested him for everything and did x-rays and tried multiple medications, but he still didn't get better.  Than as a last thought, we decided to try to stop using the pill pockets completely and just giving him his medication in his food.  Within 5 days, our cat was back to normal, and within a few weeks he wasn't dehydrated anymore and gained some weight back.  I was very pleased with this product until I realized it was what was making my cat sick.  I thought it might just be him, but I found other sites online where people had cited the same problem.  I think this is a great product for help administering short-term medications, but I would make sure to monitor your cat if you are using them long-term.  If your cat starts getting chronic diarrhea, these may be the cause.
