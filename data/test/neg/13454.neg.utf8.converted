The first ingredient in this sauce is vinegar. That's mostly all you can taste. The majority of the heat in this comes from habanero peppers, which is a totally different flavor from ghost chilis. I'm not saying it isn't spicy, but compared to other ghost chili sauces, its pretty weak. The flavor as a whole is just garbage.
