Alvita  Nettle tea is lousy. It does not taste good. The tea bags have very little tea in them. Some of the tea bags were open and the contents spilled into the outer packaging. I will stick with another brand of Nettle tea. First they sent Parsley tea and I had to send that back. Don't waste your time or your money on this product.
