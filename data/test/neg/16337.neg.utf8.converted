Ordered 5.5oz cans and received 3oz cans. Called Petcare Rx for return, and have to jump thru hoops even though error is on their side. No timely or satisfactory resolution. BEWARE from buying from them and be prepared to have extra food on hand for your animals if you do because it'll take quite awhile to get the food you ordered. I made that mistake. NEVER again!
