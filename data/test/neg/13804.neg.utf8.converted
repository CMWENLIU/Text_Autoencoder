I own an Illy x6 and it came with a sampler of illy ese pods. When those ran out I researched online and ordered these pods. First of all the pod is not tightly packed and has a looseness which makes the fit in the holder improper. As a result sometimes the illy machine keeps on going and overflows the normal quantity which an espresso cup would hold.<br /><br />Secondly the flavor body and aroma are diffuse and not good for espresso. If you are making a cappuccino you will likely not taste much difference. I do not recommend Lavazza for espresso on an illy machine.
