Based on the four 5 Star reviews, we purchased two tubs of these on Amazon.  While the chocolate outside is flavorful, the inside nuts are stale, and very old tasting.  They do not compare to higher quality and more expensive name brand nut products.  Imagine a several year-old opened can of peanuts, and that is what these almonds taste like.  Buyer beware - these are Costco low ball priced chocolate covered almonds being resold by a distribution company.
