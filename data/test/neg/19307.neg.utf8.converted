Instead of coming in a nice bagged package, as the picture shows, I received 4 mylar balls shoved loose into the mailing envelope. There was no sign of the original packaging. They were crushed flat and ripped in several places, and appear to be old and dusty (possibly used?) The balls were so badly flattened that I could not return the balls to a "round" shape even when I tried reshaping them. It may seem petty to complain about packaging for a cat's toy, but the items recieved were NOT as pictured, and were squished entirely flat and all 4 of them were torn. I was very disappointed that I did not even receive new-looking items from this seller for the price I was charged.
