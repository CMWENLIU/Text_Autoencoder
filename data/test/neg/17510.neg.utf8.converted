(I wonder if anyone else has seen the"Saturday Night Live" sketch about a convention of pirates whose discourse is limited to the"arrrgh" sound.)  This product tastes like alfalfa/barley juice, except the popcorn texture makes it difficult to make the taste go away simply by holding your nose.  As for all the health benefits, the veggies indeed impart "flavor" to this mish-mash, a bag of which equals 8 grams of protein plus nearly 600 calories, but what do the veggies contribute and what percentage of the product do they represent?  Unless I notice some dramatic health benefits, I'm going to have trouble disposing of 12 bags (Lesson: Even though Amazon limits you to large quantities, don't order 12 bags if you haven't first tried one).  The only way I can consume this stuff is to wash down every bite with a mouthful of cold Coke.  Or, picking up on the company's pirate theme, Coke laced with a lot of rum.  Unassisted by such complementary beverages, I'm afraid this booty elicits no pirate's celebratory "Arrrgh!" from me.  Just plain "Yuck!" is more like it.
