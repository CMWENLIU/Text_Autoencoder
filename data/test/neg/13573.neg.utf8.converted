I just tasted these chips in peach flavour. It's delicious! However, I was astonished to see that this product was made in China. Organic food from China is an oxymoron. Why not make it in the US? I will not buy Organic food from China. I don't trust their QA on food safety and quality. Even the people from China are trying to get healthy and organic food from outside China. If they don't trust the Chinese food producers and government, why should we? NO ORGANIC FOOD FROM CHINA!
