Texas Pete's is the #1 hot sauce in the South - it's ubiquitous in every type of restaurant.  If you ask for Tabasco, you're likely to get Texas Pete's hot sauce instead.  The company was founded in 1929 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina; their first product was their barbecue sauce, but the hot sauce soon followed.  This is a basic hot sauce - peppers, vinegar, and salt - and it can be used as you would Tabasco or a Louisiana hot sauce.  Unfortunately, it's extremely mild.  I often find that, in order to add the desired heat to food, I have to add so much that the food becomes watery.  My scrambled eggs end up a mess and still taste bland.  If you like a mild hot sauce, then Texas Pete should be one of your top choices.  Otherwise, avoid this wimpy selection.<br /><br />The company's website includes a plethora of recipes using their products - the Chicken Brunswick Stew is a North Carolina tradition.
