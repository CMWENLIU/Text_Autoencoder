I've tried this product before and like it very much. It's one of the only stocks/broths without tomatoes/tomato paste, which I find makes the broth richer tasting. In the past, I've ordered this product and received it well packed with groups of three boxes wrapped in bubble wrap. On my most recent order, I purchased two cases, 12 boxes.  The 12 boxes were wrapped in one plastic bag and put into an oversize box - no bubble wrap. Two of the boxes ruptured, soaking the plastic bag and ruining the integrity of two other cartons. I ended up with 8, a little over half the order, and a big mess. It's not possible to file a damage report online because this is a non-returnable item.<br /><br />Not sure if I would order this product again, just because of the packing and the damage policy.
