If you can get past the weird chemically smell when you open the package, these are okay -- the apples are definitely much much better.  One of my girls won't eat these at all, the other one will if I take them out of the package and put them in a snack cup.  I've purchased a lot of different types of dried fruits, and I'm not sure why this one has the weird smell.  It's not anything that will make you sick, but still just strange and not pleasant.
