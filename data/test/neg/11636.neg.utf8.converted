After reading all of the positive reviews here I thought I'd give this a shot when one of my cats needed a course of antibiotic pills.  She would not touch the pockets even without a pill in them.  It may be because my cat routinely eats wet cat food so moist pellets like this are not so much a treat for her as they may be for cats that eat a dry diet.  I had high hopes but this did not work for us - our dogs do like them though!
