The candy is shown in a sealed zip bag with a label sating what it is. It was shipped in a plain baggy taped shut. My order was for three different types of chocolate covered nuts, all pictured in labeled zip bags. I received three unlabeled sandwich bags without any packing labels or content information. The pecans inside the chocolate were stale. The peanuts are Spanish peanuts with the skins still on them. Who dips Spanish peanuts in chocolate? The skins make them taste bitter. I had intended to give some of them as gifts, but since I had to open each bag to figure out which was which I wasn't going to give an opened bag, especially after tasting them!  I contacted Bayside Candy and requested a refund. The response was to tell me not to rely on what the advertisment showed, but to pay better attention to what their seller page states regarding their bulk products. They also stated they would not give a refund unless I shipped the chocolates back to them.  You are not supposed to send opened food products through the mail.
