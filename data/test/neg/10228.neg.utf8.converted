How badly can someone mess up teriyaki flavoring? This noodle bowl is the least edible thing I've ever tasted. I'd compare the taste to Vegemite/Marmite and those Halloween blood capsules, and the smell to a burnt capacitor. After one bite I went outside to throw it out, I didn't want it stinking up my indoor garbage can. I have never been compelled to call a 'satisfaction guaranteed' hotline, but if Annie Chun's had one I'd be on the phone right now. After this disaster I nuked a Annie Chun's Spicy Szechuan which was a huge improvement, actually edible.
