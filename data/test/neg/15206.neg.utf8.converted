Flavor is a bit bland and something I'm not used to.  Smell and appearance is not very appetizing.  This is the only Nong Shim instant noodle I've had to throw away due to the taste.  It's probably just me not being used to Korean cha jang noodle (at least the Nong Shim one).  I'm more accustomed to the Chinese one where it's more flavorful/deliciously aromatic and not black.  I've had 5 other people in my apt agree that it's the worst instant noodle they've tasted from Nong Shim.
