I was unimpressed by this product.  When I put this product out on my counter, the moths looked a little dazed and confused.  Most flew near the trap, but less than 10 percent got inside the trap, near the sticky part.  The rest just kept flying around the kitchen.  I also tried placing the trap inside the cabinet (with everything removed) with similar results.  I would find moths within inches of the trap, but none inside.
