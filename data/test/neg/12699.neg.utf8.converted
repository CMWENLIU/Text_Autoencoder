This used to be a favorite a few years ago. Raw taste, nice texture, stays crunchy in hot milk. I loved it! Then I changed to a different brand for a few years just for variation and yesterday went back. Didn't even look at the label. When I tasted it for the first time, I thought: "hey, the taste changed!"... and I glance at the label: last ingredient - Aspartame. WHY? WHY? It ruined it for me completely, not only the taste, but the AFTERtaste is horrible. that artificial sweetener - bitter chemical taste. What a shame! Shame on you, general mills!
