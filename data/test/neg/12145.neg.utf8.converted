I got excited after reading the reviews and how cats went nuts for this product..I even paid for overnight shipping...<br />However my older cat ignored these flakes when I gave them to her...<br />Then I gave some to the 12 strays I feed...They will eat anything...<br />Some of them showed some interest, but none of them got excited and several<br />of them just walked away after smelling....<br />So either I got a bum package, or its all hype...Either way I'm out<br />20 bucks, and highly disappointed.....
