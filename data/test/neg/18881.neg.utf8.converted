I love the regular PopChips, especially the Salt and Vinegar.  Was happy when these became avilable on Amazon.  I decided to try the variety box so I could taste all the flavors.  What a mistake, these are the worst things ever.  They have a terrible after taste.  I took them to work for our break area, and I only received bad comments from people.  I believe PopChips messed up with these.  Will definitely not purchase again, nor will my friends.
