I love the novelty of miracle fruit tablets. I purchased another brand a few months ago and loved it. The sensation was that of eating fruit for the first time. Everything was sweet, and the sensation lasted about 30 minutes of some serious taste testing of really sour foods (Vitamin C powder was the craziest, it was like eating pixi sticks.)<br /><br />When I received this package of Frooties XL, I figured this would be as good if not better experience than before. I shared a few with some coworkers and while it did at first go as the tablets before, it wore off very quickly. Perhaps in the span of 5 minutes or so.<br /><br />The tablets are oval in shape and almost twice as large as the ones before, but I noticed the tablets tasted a bit different from the other brand. I couldn't be certain, but the mixture they form these tablets with could be binder heavy and less product overall. It could also be that during transport they degraded as it recommends you keep the product at or below 20 C or 68 F and it's warm in FL. Either way, I am sad that this batch for whatever reason was not up to snuff with what I had remembered.
