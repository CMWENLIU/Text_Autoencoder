Please don't order these, I received mine close to the expiration date. The candy was so stale and it has some arabic writing on it? When I ordered, it said shipped from U.K. so I don't know why they have foreign language printed on it. It doesn't matter to me where it's shipped from but they shouldn't ship products that are expired or about to expire. Disgusting!
