Maybe we got a bad batch, I don't know, but these taste nothing like the full size packaged Pringles.  They are thinner, much thinner, and oily tasting.  My kids turned their nose up at these and they love regular Pringles.<br /><br />They're not horrible, just not good.  No one in the family liked them.  Won't buy again.
