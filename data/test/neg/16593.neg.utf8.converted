I drank 3 of the drinks, one on 3 different days to realize that the feeling of high level heartburn and a low level general nausea that did not go away for days, was due to this cola.  I didn't recover from the 3 drinks completely for about a week.  The taste was only good if the drink was ice cold.  I did receive a refund.
