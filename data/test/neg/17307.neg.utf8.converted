The manufacturer of this pate has been shown to run an extremely dirty unhealthy production facility.  They routinely induce liver disease so that the liver is as big as possible<br />and keep the animals caged in their own filth.  The animals are stressed and terrified and release glycogen into their liver which results in an extremely low quality product.<br /><br />Yuck!!!
