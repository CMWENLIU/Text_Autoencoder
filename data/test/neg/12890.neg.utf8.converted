We really wanted to like this coffee, but we find this one not as flavorful. Before this, we were having Jim's Together Decaf Organic Coffee and though Jim's is a little more expensive, if we have to use twice as much of this coffee to get enough flavor, couldn't save anything - even then, it still didn't have as much aroma.. Maybe because these are ground coffee and with Jim's, we buy the beans at a supermarket and grind them there - I don't know. But I don't think we will use other 2 bags of this coffee...
