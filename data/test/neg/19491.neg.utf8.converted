Beware: This is just man-made doggy junkfood. I always try to give my dog natural minimally-processed chews and treats, she goes through a lot of bully sticks, pig ears, & himalayan chews. When I bought this in a store, the label didn't say what it was made of & I thought it was a bully stick or other bit of dried anatomy like a large tendon. Nice that it's odor-free but the texture seemed unusual, it's sort chewy like a heavy dried dough, not tough & durable like a normal bully stick. My 20lb bicha-poo ate a WHOLE 12" Chew-A-Bull in about half an hour. After looking it up online I discovered that this is not a natural meat product at all but a man-made fake bully stick. Ingredients: Potato starch, meat by product, corn starch, sorbitol, liver, cellulose, water, egg, lecithin, calcium stearate, titanium dioxide, caramel color, sorbic acid. I won't be buying a Chew-A-Bull again: Full of weird ingredients, not natural, and it does not last.
