For those used to the 20-pack boxes of Constant Comment, these will be a big let down.<br /><br />Constant Comment is all I drink. I have bought countless 20-pack boxes from Walmart over the last couple years. So I decided I would save some money and buy this in bulk. The first thing I noticed is the packaging is different. In the 20-pack boxes, they're normal thick tea bags, all packed together sitting in the box. In the 40-pack box, the bags are different - cheaper, thinner slip bags, with 4 each in metal-lined paper wrappers that you have to rip open. (See the photo I have attached to this page by scrolling to the top of the product page and clicking on "See customer images")<br /><br />The next thing I noticed was the smell. Whereas the 20-pack bags have a deep and distinctive smell, the 40-pack bags had none of that. It reminded me of some cheap Lipton orange spice tea. Then the taste. I tried my usual 1 bag in a 12-ounce glass of hot water. The taste I have come to know quite well just wasn't there, at all. It tasted diluted - as if there's less tea in each bag - and less rich, again reminding me of Lipton orange spice.<br /><br />So, 239 more bags to go, and I'll be switching back to the Walmart 20-pack boxes I'm used to. This was a big let down, but I'm still a fan of (the Real) Constant Comment.<br /><br />Update: I've tried doing two bags in a 12-ounce glass as well, and it's simply brought out the worst parts even more. There is a weird aftertaste that just ruins it. If I hadn't already given it two stars, I would drop it down to one now.
