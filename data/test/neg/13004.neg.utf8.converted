I am Brazilian and have always loved anise seed tea.  This tea is dirt and makes tea that tastes like muddy water! Now I am stuck with this stuff and don't know what to do with it!  I don't know where I can find good anise tean in the United States.  When I first came to the U.S. there was a source but they went out of business.
