I bought a carton of these popsicles from Costco ( not from this supplier) and they gave my two year old son massive allergies on his face, eyes and body. When we digged deeply into the reasons for this reaction, we saw that they use red-40, yellow 5, yellow 6 and blue 1 dyes in the product. If you search on the net you will find that there are volumes on why these dyes should be avoided by children and adults. We stopped and my son recovered very quickly.<br /><br />This review is about the product and not the seller. I mean them well but they need to know what they are supporting.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00290W1CY">Flavor Ice Pops 200 Count Variety Box</a>
