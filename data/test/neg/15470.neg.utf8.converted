These donuts used to be a favorite treat for me and my family when I was growing up.  They were good out of the box or, we liked to put them in the refrigerator and let the chocolate coating get crackly.  I don't know what the company did to them, but there is a definite change.  My family doesn't buy them at all anymore after a few bad boxes.  We thought maybe it was a bad batch the first time, but no, we then tried boxes at different times.  It's just not the same recipe or ingredients anymore.  The yellow cake part is a little drier than it used to be and not as flavorful as it was.  But the most changed part is the coating.  The chocolate is like a fake wax coating that leaves a greasy feel in your mouth.  I suspect it is from all the hydrogenated oil in them, and probably very little or no real chocolate.  I could barely finish one donut each time I tried them as opposed to when I could eat a few in one sitting.  They've never been healthy-they're donuts after all-but the ingredients must've been higher quality in previous years.  My whole family agreed they are not the same, and not good.<br /><br />We remember many delicious Entenmann's products throughout the 80s up until the past 5 years or so.  My favorite was the Marshmallow Iced Devil's Food Cake.  I tried it twice over the past year and it is not the same at all.  It leaves a very strange aftertaste, and the frosting no longer tastes like marshmallow.  It's also stiff and not even slightly fluffy like it used to be.  I would give it one star if I could rate it here.  I heard the company was sold to another at some point, which I suppose then changed the recipes.  Anyone who tastes these products for the first time now is totally missing out on what Entenmann's used to be.<br /><br />I'm rating these 2 stars because they aren't as bad as the cake was, and they are passable for anyone who doesn't remember the way they originally tasted and is desperate for a donut fix.  But if you hate fake chocolate and oil-based coatings, do not buy.<br /><br />If I'm going to eat unhealthy snack foods or desserts such as donuts, cakes, and cookies, I want them to taste great or at least good.  This is way beyond disappointing and not worth eating anymore.  Please Entenmann's go back to your old recipes, they were great.  We miss them.
