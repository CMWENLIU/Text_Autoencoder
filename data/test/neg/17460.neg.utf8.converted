The first time we ordered these bullies the quality was good and our dog was very satisfied. We were happy too because they were low-odor. However, the order we got this time is very much NOT low-odor, nor are the sticks as thick as the first batch. They look as though they've been split lengthwise. These are also very greasy, and I'm afraid to give them to the dog for fear they'll leave a mark on the furniture.
