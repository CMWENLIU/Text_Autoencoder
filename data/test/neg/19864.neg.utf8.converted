Several years ago, we got these patties at Halloween time. We tried them, only to discover that they had no taste at all and were incredibly chewy, so much so that you would have to be Andre the Giant (RIP) to masticate them. Anyway, we decided that they might be stale. Throughout the past years, we have always tried the patties when received at Halloween time, as Valentine's Day treats, etc., wondering how a cute concoction such as this can be so weirdly terrible. Yes, it is true- they are not stale, just inedible, which is a shame for a product that is supposed to indeed be edible. Your teeth and taste buds will thank you for not purchasing these patties.
