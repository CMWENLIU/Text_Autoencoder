When I received the package about 1 week today, opened the package and saw 6 pack of Jans All Natural Juice 33.8 oz each container. There was one container that has very little leak because the box was little too big that caused the juice move too much. I tried the taste of the juice was pretty good good but I was very disappointed with the expiration date. It was overdue, September 22, 2012. Imagine that I ordered the juice on September 18th, 2012, and received on September 25, 2012 while someone packed overdue expiration date, September 22, 2012. It doesn't make any sense and all business is want is MONEY!! They might not care about customer's orders. I really have no idea WHY they did it. I have the right to give 1 out of 5 star for that kind of reason! I am a long time Amazon member. Wake up!!
