I used to think that all popcorn was the same.  However, I've been buying an eight-pound container of Orville Redenbacher's popcorn from Costco for awhile, so I have another brand to compare with the Paragon popcorn while my memory is fresh.  Paragon is less expensive than Orville Redenbacher's, but the texture and flavor of Orville's product are significantly better than Paragon's.  While Orville's has almost a buttery flavor even without seasoning, Paragon's has much less flavor.  While Orville's texture is marshmallow soft, Paragon's is much crunchier and less enjoyable to chew, almost as if the kernel hasn't completely popped.  Both brands seem to have the same rate of kernels popping, i.e., pretty much all of them pop in my air popper.<br /><br />So I've learned that you do get what you pay for with popcorn.  It isn't that Paragon's product is bad, and in fact I've purchased it before and enjoyed it; I just didn't have Orville to compare it with at the time.  Although I'm generally quite frugal with my purchases, after I've popped my 12.5 pounds of Paragon popcorn I'll be stocking up with Orville's again; it's worth the extra money.<br /><br />I've come back to downgrade my rating from three stars to two, because after eating this popcorn for a few weeks I'm realizing that I'm just not looking forward to the experience the way I used to.  It's just too crunchy, and too much of the popcorn is husk.
