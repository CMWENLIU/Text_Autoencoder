Growing up in Florida, my family ate Hearts of Palm on a regular basis. I decided to buy some on a whim from this company and I was thoroughly disappointed. It was mushy AND woody with a tinny, fishy flavor that was truly unpleasant. I had a sample from Costco from a bottled source recently which was excellent but I don't recall the brand off-hand. For the price of Hearts of Palm I think I will stick the the bottled versions. For me it Roland was a waste of money.
