the best part was the white chocolate, but you can buy that anywhere for cheap<br /><br />this crap crumbles into thousands of pieces when you take a bite, so you can't even anywhere with you. Gotta eat it over the kitchen sink as it is so messy<br /><br />avoid this at all costs. Buy the chewy counterpart instead
