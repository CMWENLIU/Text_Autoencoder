I ordered this coffee for my Keurig brewer and I was very disappointed with the flavor.  It was very bitter and acrid.  I like strong coffee--but this was just unpleasant to drink.  I ordered 2 cases and we managed to finish off one of them... I'm giving the second one away as I can't bear to drink another sip of it.  It tastes like burned rubber.  Blech!  I can not recommend this product.
