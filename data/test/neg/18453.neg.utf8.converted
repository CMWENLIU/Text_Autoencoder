The only positive thing I have to say about this formula is that it has Organic Milk in it, and that's pretty sad because that part is a given.  Here are the negatives:<br /><br />- Dissolves horribly.  I have to prepare bottles ahead of time, refrigerate them, then warm them to use it.  My baby would take a bottle at room temperature, but if I did that there would be clumps of formula left behind.<br />- Has corn syrup in it (listed as Organic Glucose Syrup Solids).  Ok, so it isn't GMO corn syrup, but who cares?  There is no reason to include this except to save money.  It is a cheaper carbohydrate source than lactose, so they can use less lactose (lactose being something that actually has nutrional value).<br />-Has Palm Olein Oil in it.  Again, it is organic, but so what?  Another cheap ingredient (this time a fat source).  Palm Olein oil has been shown to block absorption of calcium in the body.  Oh good, because the first year of life isn't a crucial time for bone development or anything.  Even Similac won't use it.  Here is a link to study by the American Acadamy of Pediatrics from 2002(!) showing infants fed formula with palm olein oil had lower bone density than those without, and yet Hain doesn't care enough to stop using it: http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/111/5/1017<br />-Has Martec DHA/AHA in it.  This is a genetically modified product and the fact that it has been allowed in organic food is just an example of how powerful lobbyists are.  If they have to use chemical neurotoxins to get the DHA/AHA, I'd rather just do without, thanks.  I know of no studies that show the level of DHA/AHA in baby formulas do anything positive for a baby's brain development.  There have also been reports of babies experiencing stomach upset from DHA/AHA in formulas.  It is hard to get this feedback though since almost every formula has Martec's DHA/AHA in them now.<br />-It smells like death and when my baby burps in my face I gag a little.<br /><br />I never planned on even trying this formula, but Baby's Only constipated my baby like no tomorrow.  Even with the arsenic ridiculousness, I'd still use Baby's Only if the Brown Rice Syrup didn't make him scream every time he had a bowel movement.  And Similac Organic has no lactose and is filled with table sugar.  Organic formula options in this country are horrible.  (I am unable to exclusively breastfeed due to medication)
