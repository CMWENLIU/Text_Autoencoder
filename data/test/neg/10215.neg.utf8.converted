My wife loves Coconut Juice, and we had been buying Zico liter's from Trader Joe's for $3.75 each.  This is the best deal available anywhere that I have found.<br /><br />Well, as someone who values my dollar, as soon as I saw the pricing on these I rushed to purchase it.  There was no picture of the can with the nutrition facts or any mention of it being only 75% juice.  Well, that's what you'll get if you purchase this.  It is an inferior product in terms of juice quality compared with any of the 100% juice brands.  They've added 13 grams of sugar (I used calculations based off how much sugar a 16.9 FL OZ can would have it was 100% juice), and they've also added something called Sodium Metabisulfite and of course they've watered it down with water.<br /><br />They cleverly call this Coconut Drink versus Coconut Juice because this is not Coconut Juice.<br /><br />All the Best,<br />Geoff<br /><br />PS, The reason why I give this 1 star is because they don't disclose on the product page that it is 25% water, sugar, and sodium metabisulfite.
