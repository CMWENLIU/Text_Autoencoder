I'm not sure what is considered Thick Select...sounds like an industry term, but I received 10 bully sticks and most of them were barely thicker than a pencil.  I don't associated pencils with being thick and these bully sticks are better suited to a Pomeranian then my German Shepherds.  I seldom complain about products but when its completely misrepresented, I have no choice but to warn others.  If there is a way to leave a picture, someone leave me a comment on how too and I will.
