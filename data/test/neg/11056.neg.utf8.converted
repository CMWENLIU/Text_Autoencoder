I normally do not comment when I dislike a product. However, this is (I am currently attempting to eat one) so horrible I just had to.<br /><br />First of all, the directions to add a cup of water... that fills the bowls mostly up, and the microwave time as given doesn't properly cook the noodles (yes I started with very hot water to begin with). Even when cooked more, the texture of the noodles reminds me of rubbery spaghetti. The noodles are wheat, so this could be expected, but it is still very unappealing.<br />The included sauce is bland to the point of being tasteless (it does have a mildly spicy aftertaste though).<br /><br />Finally, and most horribly, I can taste the plastic leaching out of the container into the noodles and sauce. This is just unacceptable.<br /><br />I will give credit to this bowl for having a better selection of dried vegetables than others I've eaten; they are in fact quite good.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and give this one a miss.
