Did the company that makes this product bother offering it to cats first to see if they would even eat it?  My cat won't eat it.  Pixie gives it two paws down. I tried offering it to the starving feral cats outside, and they won't eat it either.  I bought two bags of it for nothing.  My cat actually did try it once, and promptly threw up.  No fur balls came up any time after that, either, so I know she wasn't sick at the time.  She still refuses to eat any more of it.  It might be great from both nutritional analysis and organic points of view, but it's not any good if cats won't actually want to eat it.  I'm going back to Purina when I feed kibbles to the cat because I know from information that I've seen on TV that Purina actually taste-tests their products.  My same cat will eat the Newman's Own canned cat food with the same degree of enthusiasm that she eats Purina, but the same is not true for the kibble.
