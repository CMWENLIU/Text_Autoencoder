Someone's review claimed this litter box is good for the Feline Pine pellets.. NOT TRUE!  The pellets fit exactly in the grid.  You can shake a bit of the sawdust through, but for the most part, it's a huge hassle because the holes are all blocked with the pellets!  It makes a huge mess!  SO BUMMED I just wasted ~$20 on this thing!  (Get the official Feline Pine sifting box.)
