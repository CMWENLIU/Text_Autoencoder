I was born and raised in India and I cook a lot.  I had this at my friends house, they all liked it but I must say that this is pure junk.  If anyone who has ever cooked or had real pav bhaji, they know what this should taste like and what the texture should feel like in your mouth.  Basically this thing taste like it was cooked several months ago by someone who is not the best at cooking such a dish.  I have also tried various other brands besides this one, and they all are more or less in the same boat.  For the sake of taste and health, this is not what you want.  Look-up a video recipe on the internet and make it at home (preferably in small batches to make it taste more like the street food that it was supposed to be).  I have yet to find Indian food stored at room temp that is heat and eat and it taste good.  Some of the frozen Indian foods are a lot better, but do not exepect it to be impressed by ready cooked stuff.  For something good, just go to a good restaurant; and for good and healthy, make it at home.
