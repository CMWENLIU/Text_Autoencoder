First, this tea smells like synthetic jasmine. Purely chemical induced. Secondly, once you let the tea sit and become room temperature, it begins to change its smell to something like urine. I hate to leave such a poor rating, especially saying that it smells like urine, but what else can I do? I love jasmine and drink it solely, everyday, but this is probably the worst tea I have purchased. I guess you have to look at it this way. If you're going to pay such a small price, compared to a pound of tea elsewhere, then you can assume that the saying you get what you pay for is going probably be true. In my opinion, it is in this case.
