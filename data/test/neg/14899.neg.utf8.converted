The product arrived at the door, with the inside content completely melted. I called the company to let them know what happened, and their only response was that they were so swamped with product orders that they just had no choice but to ship out the product without proper ice/temp-controlled packaging. Seriously?  This is chocolate covered wine grape they are selling!  No refund. No credit towards next purchase. Needless to say, I would never order from them again. Shame, because it's a great product idea.
