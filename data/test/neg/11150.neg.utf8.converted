I called Barry Farm and spoke with two women to find out if there is any possible gluten contamination with the beans. Neither knew if the beans could have gluten on them because they are from a supplier and don't actually grow them. When I asked who the supplier was she rather curtly said, "I will not give out the names of my suppliers". I found that odd, on so many levels, and wondered if her suppliers are in China. A company has never refused to give me their supplier before. The best part was telling me I could wash the gluten off when I rinsed the beans. Due to all the recall mania, I am not willing to gamble my family's health.  Anyone else wondering what they do grow at Barry Farm?  The whole thing left me with the heebie-jeebies.
