Was looking to buy some dried strawberries when I came across this offering.<br /><br />In the description it says air dried strawberries without sulphur dioxide.<br /><br />In the picture shown the ingredients list sulphur dioxide!<br /><br />Not saying it's good or bad but why can't they describe what they are selling accurately???
