I purchased a box of 6 of these November 2011.  They are really big and I noticed they were slightly moist in the middles.  The dogs liked them - however they had terrible gas from them.  By the time I opened the last bag in February 2012,I noted that they were covered in a white mold - absolutely f urry or otherwise I might not have noticed it.  I wondered whether some of the previous bags might have contained slight mold that I did not notice. I contacted the vendor using the 'contact us' on their website, but no reply.  I won't take a chance on them again.
