Received box of these, and they were packaged in Thailand, and one of the cups package was leaking black through the box, and when opened the cup was completely black with mold, and had only one orange in it.  The leakage had contaminated the other 4 packs.  I would appreciate you stating in your description where the product was packaged, and processed at.  Amazon was excellent and refunded my full amount, but I am very leery about ordering these again.
