My husband and I LOVE this flavor of oatmeal, especially with a few crushed walnuts and dried cranberries added to it.  I have not been able to find it in our local stores, so I was THRILLED to find it on line.  Imagine my surprise when I got my package from Amazon and discovered that the oatmeal was outdated by THREE YEARS!!!  Yes, I got a prompt refund for the purchase (and let Amazon know about my outrage at being sold expired food), but I still don't have my favorite oatmeal.  The search continues.
