The chocolate flavor is weak.  What you need to do is use the smallest cup size, then after it is done take out the cup, open the lid of the K cup and scoop out the rest of the powder.  It's drinkable, but barely.<br /><br />Worse then the extra fuss of mixing the powder yourself, is the flavor.  There is a VERY DISTINCT plastic aftertaste.  I thought maybe the water was just so hot it melted the cup, but the plastic cups are made of seem to be the same as the coffee ones which do not have this aftertaste. I think the chocolate is just not a good flavor.  Next time I'm going to try ordering a different brand.
