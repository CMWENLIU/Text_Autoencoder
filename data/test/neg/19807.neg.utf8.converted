I read the reviews before purchasing this product and I have to say I was disappointed.  I acquired a taste for kimchi while I was living outside of DC and have not found any suitable since I left.  I live in a rural area and most people do not know what the word is let alone have a place to buy it.  I was really looking forward to this shipments arrival.  Well it arrived yesterday and of course I had some for dinner.  I will say it was well packed and arrived in a timely fashion but other than that I was truly disappointed not at all what I was looking for.  We all have our own tastes so others seem to like this; it is worth a try if you are jonesing like I have been for a good kimchi fix - I hope you have better luck than I did.  I a giving the item 2 stars because it was well packaged and arrived in a time manner.
