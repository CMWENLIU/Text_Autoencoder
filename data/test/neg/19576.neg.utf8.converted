smelled weird when i opened the container. a little earthy but kinda like they have been sprayed with something. after preparing it the water tasted strange too, not like the usual Pee eS Tee flavor. it kept me from wd's so that was good, but as far as catching a good buzz...eh 1-10 it was about a 3.5
