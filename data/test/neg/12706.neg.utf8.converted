"M&uuml;esli" is the diminutive of the German word for "mush", and as some of the favorable reviews declare, mushiness is the goal for M&uuml;esli-eaters. Authentic M&uuml;esli becomes mushy almost instantly when milk is added, though modern commercial Mueslis usually contain desiccated fruit and nut chips that stay gritty in the mush. And a lot of sugar to melt the mush together! If you've spent time in Germany or Switzerland, you'll know that you're expected to add fresh fruit and berries to your Mush, and to soften it with yoghurt or quark in preference to plain milk.<br /><br />The stuff is supposed to be wonderfully healthful, but if you compare the calories to various brands of granola, you'll find that both are higher than you thought, because of the sweeteners. Unsweetened oat bran flakes will get just as mushy almost as quickly, and you can be selective about your mix-ins.<br /><br />The 'Familia' brand dominates the supermarket shelves in most parts of the USA. If you've tried it and you like it, Mazel Tov! But don't buy M&uuml;esli in bulk or in six-packs! It gets stale and extra-tasteless on the shelf, even when the box is unopened. Honestly though, wouldn't you rather have a crisp buttery croissant or a stack of Swedish pancakes with lingon to start your day?
