Puppy LOVES this food BUT the manufacturer has so far failed to take the steps necessary to eliminate BAD BAD Ethoxyquin used to preserve the fish meal ingredients from its suppliers.  It is NOT necessary to use ethoxyquin to preserve fish meal; there are alternatives.  If the manufacturer would comply with dog lovers' wishes and reject supplier use of ethoxyquin, then this could be one of the great foods.
