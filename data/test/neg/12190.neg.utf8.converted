The candy was delivered on time as promised. The only thing I had a problem with is that my product did not taste like what I purchased. Wherever they stored it, it must have been close to bubblegum because that is what the candy tasted like. Just like when some of your food is in the refrigerator too long and starts to take on the taste and smell of another item in the fridge, thats exactly what I dealt with. I hope the wholesaler fixes this problem but until then, I'm done with ordering candy online.
