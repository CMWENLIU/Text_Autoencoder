I wanted to start making my own mac and cheese instead of buying it, and had hoped this would work well.  What I found was that it tastes terrible, I only managed two bites before I spit it out and threw it away.  I guess my first clue should of been the greenish tint to the sauce in the daylight.  I would not buy this again, and I would not recommend it to others.
