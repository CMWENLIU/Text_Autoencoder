I have a cat named Charlie who loves this food. I have found that he looks healthier and his coat looks nicer when I feed him Iams then with other foods. He also seems to love this food and gets excited when I go in to the kitchen... that's his time to show off (I think) that he can eat.<br />This comes in a 5 pack and Amazon shipped it right away, so no complaints there.<br /><br />Edit:  March 20, 2011<br /><br />I can not recommend this food anymore. Too many recalls and the ingredients are garbage. I am using Chicken Soup for the Cat Lovers Soul and my furry friend looks better, lost weight and is more active. To Iams... you have lost a customer due to your outsourcing and horrible product quality control.
