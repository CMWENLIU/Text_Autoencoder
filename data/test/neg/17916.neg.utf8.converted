Like others here, I acquired a taste to these things when I was a child.  I can understand that they make some people uncomfortable; they look like slimy worms from a deep dark cave.  And their taste is nothing like a real hot dog.  They are sort of in a class by themselves like a Dorito.  You eat it knowing that it has to be one of the most highly manufactured foods in existence but, putting these considerations aside, I heat them up on toast and with a little cheese they are quite good.  If I had a can here now I'd eat it.<br /><br />But I don't have a can here.  Why not? Simple: $75 (and climbing) for a box of 20 cans.  Hey Loma Linda, I know that you had to torture a lot of wheat to make them contort into slimy worms but there really should be a golden ticket in one of those cans at that price point.  On second thought maybe I don't want to tour your deep dark caves.
