I'm not someone who is particularly sensitive to salt - I don't have high blood pressure or anything like that.  However, with 800 mg of sodium (33% of your recommended daily value) - in only 1/2 cup of this - I was a little concerned.  But, the reviews for this product are pretty much good - across the board.  So - I TRIED to like it - I really did - and the smell was incredible - I do agree that it's not got the most appealing visual effect, but I don't really care about that.  My first bite was just some of the spinach puree - and I thought "Wow, that's good - a bit salty, but good" - then, I had a second bite with some of the cheese, and the salt level in it hit me.  I tried one more bite after that, but that was it for me.<br /><br />I'm hoping I just received a bad batch - I most likely will try one of the other packages, but I'll prepare it with something else (maybe chick peas? Lentils? Potatoes?) to tame it.  As is, I can't eat it at all.
