Special k protein plus has recently changed their recipe to involve an additional 20 calories per serving, and decreased the fiber by 2g, effectively adding a bunch of carbs.  I used to buy this cereal by the dozen, but I will have to switch.  Now I have a dozen boxes of cereal I don't like sitting on the shelf.  This makes me very unhappy :(
