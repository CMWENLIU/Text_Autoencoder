I ordered my first 5# package and we thought they were some of the best we've ever tasted. A few months later I ordered another 5# - what a difference! We can't even eat them. What went wrong?<br /><br />The first order was spicy and full of flavor. The second has almost no peppers (I saw one) and the taste is fragrant and flowery. We had to throw them out which was a significant loss.<br /><br />Update - I contacted Roland and they offered to send another package although it wasn't in stock - at least they offered to make it right.
