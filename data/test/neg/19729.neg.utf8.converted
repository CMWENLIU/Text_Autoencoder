Be Careful - We bought the juicy juice apple juice for our kids and saw in light ink the words 'product of china'.  I will never buy apple juice from Nestle.<br /><br />I live in a Michigan where apples are exported and a top crop that support many people along with meeting all the FDA requirements.  By the way are fresh and taste great.  How does the economics support processing apples in China and sending them here to be cheaper then made down the road?  Obviously, there is something wrong - I am not anti-globalization but seriously WTF.
