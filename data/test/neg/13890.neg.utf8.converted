When I read the positve reviews on this product, I ordered it.  It is definitely low sodium and if you have a medical condition that requires very low sodium,  this soup would fit the bill.  If you are just trying to cut back on salt, again this soup will work fine.  I personally feel that most of our food has way too much salt and sugar in it so I thought I would give this product a try.  I like the convenience of it being ready to serve but I must admit, it has very little flavor.  It's almost like drinking water with a slight mushroom taste.  Truthfully, I miss the salt.  I think that soup, generally, needs salt but as I stated, most are much too salty, however, this soup is just too bland.  When I added a little bit of salt, that made a big difference.  Also, I noticed that the soup is very watery and thin.  I like my mushroom soup a little more substantial.  I do think this soup would work very well in casserole recipes.  I probably will not purhase the low sodium variety of Campbell's Mushroom Soup but I do like many of their other products.  However, and this is important, if it is an absolute necessity that you cut back on salt for health reason, then this soup would be perfect for you. Some non-salt seasoning could make it more flavorful.  I give Campbell's credit for trying to make their products more health conscious.  More companies should do the same.  Salt and sugar must and should be reduced -- a little can go a long way.
