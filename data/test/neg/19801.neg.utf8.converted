I HATE TO SAY IT BUT THIS CANDY IS HORRIBLE. IT IS TASTELESS AND IN-EDIBLE. I TRIED IT AND THREW THE ENTIRE 2LB BAG AWAY. CONSIDERING I PAID $11 IN SHIPPING FOR A $5 PRODUCT I WASN'T HAPPY ABOUT THAT. I BOUGHT THESE TO MAKE FRUIT LOOP NECKLACES WITH MY NIECE. ENDED UP USING THE TWIZZLER EQUIVALENT AND MAKING BRACELETS.
