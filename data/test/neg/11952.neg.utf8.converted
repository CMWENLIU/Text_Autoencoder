Besides changing the bowl to a very thin plastic one that gets too hot to touch, the new recipe is not an improvement that I care for. It's too bad because the previous version had bits of dried mushroom that gave it a more complex flavor -- now it's kind of a blah generic spiciness.<br /><br />Have to mention they fiddled with the noodles too. They are thinner, and don't have that chewy bite. Very disappointed that Nong Shim USA made these changes. I'll have to look for the better Made in Korea kind at the local Asian markets to satisfy my Shin Bowl cravings.
