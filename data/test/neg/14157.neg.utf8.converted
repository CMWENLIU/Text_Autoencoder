I got sold on the product when I read the review and hope the only reason for the review was that people all over the world have different taste.<br /><br />The tea arrived in a package which does not match the picture...that's not a good start.<br /><br />The side of the package was not sealed and thus I believe the aroma compromised. I wish I had not purchased the tea from China Mist<br /><br />I actually tried another tea store in NY, Ito En. They have an online store too, which you may want to try. I would easily give it five stars or more
