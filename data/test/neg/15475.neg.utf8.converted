My cat won't eat them, plain and simple. I've tried many a' cat treats and while I can tell which ones he likes more than others this is the only one he will chase after, sniff or taste then immediately walk away from. So my review is simple, he hates them so I hate them.<br /><br />Also, for some back info on cat(in case it matters). He doesn't eat people food, has a a bowl of dry available all the time as well as half a can of wet twice a day. Also, he hates beef wet food(turns to it and kicks back as if poo in a litter box). The brand of treats were chicken though, which he loves usually.
