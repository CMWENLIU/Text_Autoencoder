I tried this product, but saw no drop in blood pressure.  I found that hibiscus tea helps a great deal.  I started taking some blueberry hibiscus tea from [...] and it really works.  3-4 cups a day takes me from about 135/97 to 120/80.  I've actually gone below 120/80.  It is extremely effective in my case.
