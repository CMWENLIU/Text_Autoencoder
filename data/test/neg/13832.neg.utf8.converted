I ordered the large box of creamers for the office. It seemed we were always running out. I compared the cost and it would have been much cheaper to continue to buy at the store but I was tired of stopping.<br />The box arrived with 1/8 of the creamers broken open or having the creamer all over it and still not useable.<br />So the overall cost became even more so when you consider the damaged creamers.
