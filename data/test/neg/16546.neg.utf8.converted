Can you stand a differing opinion?  Please read this.<br /><br />Recently, I bought the box of 24 of this product.  I thought it might be good food to have in case of emergency.  However, this is the first time I've bought something on Amazon that had universal praise, but I disagree with it.  I am wondering what kind of Italian food these people are used to?  Do they actually know how Italian sauce is supposed to taste?  Because this is not tasty!  Actually, I found it rather yucky, and three other members of my family confirmed the same result.<br /><br />I followed the directions & made this exactly as was stated on the box.  The sauce you end up with has an undefinable, very strong taste to it.  Looking at the ingredients on the side of the box, it just lists "spices" so I don't know what that bad taste is really coming from.<br /><br />Also, the Kraft brand spaghetti is not very good quality.  The only good thing about it is that you don't have to snap it to make it fit in the pot.  Other than that, the spaghetti is tasteless, fat, limp and bland.  Thank goodness there is not very much of that spaghetti (it only serves 4 from the box).<br /><br />On top of not liking this product, I found that the actual components are overpriced.  You should just buy some excellent pasta, such as Barilla spaghetti that doesn't cost very much and makes alot more servings.  Add to that any jar of pre-made sauce.  In a side by side taste test, I bet the Barilla+jarred sauce would taste way better.<br /><br />For now, I'm going to use up the awful Kraft noodles as well as I can, and chuck the "flavor" packets into the garbage.
