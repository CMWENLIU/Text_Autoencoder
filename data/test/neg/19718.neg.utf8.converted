Greetings:<br /><br />I blew off your first request for a review....however, will respond to your second request & trust that you will never print it....am not interested in casting any bad light on the vendor nor do I want any retaliation from same....with that said, suffice it to merely say that I was most disappointed in what I received for what I paid....the actual weight of the frog legs was @ 3 1/2 #s & they were small (I went to Wal-Mart & bought a diet scale to weigh them)....my total cost was @ $65.00 & divided by the #'s was costing me @ $18.57 a pound....imagine my surprise when I discovered the next week that I could buy JUMBO frog legs for @ $3.99 a pound locally....in fact, just purchased 10 #s yesterday for @ $40.00....want to see the receipt?  I'll send it to you....<br /><br />Bottom line, it has opened my eyes to NOT think that ordering anything online is going to be cheaper than buying locally....from here on, will always exhaust all local vendors for anything I want before resorting to online....that's a reversal from the way I used to shop....suffice it to say, I will NEVER order frog legs from you folks again, & short of the great deal you offer on Colman's Mustard, will check locally on everything from here on....thanks for the lesson learned!  Have a Nice day....tfg
