I like the Sixlets, not only do they taste great, but they are wonderful as gingerbread decorations.  I love buying the candy without the wrapper; there is nothing more time consuming than sitting around unwrapping this candy.  But Candy Direct is NOT the company to buy Sixlets.  I bought 5 lbs of the candy for $21.00, and paid $18.00, for shipping--regular 7 days later delivery!!!  Unacceptable!!!!  Never again Candy Direct.  It doesn't cost $18.00, to deliver this candy via the United States Postal Service.  For heaven's sake--$18.00!!!  $3.00 more and I could have had another 5 lbs of Sixlets!!!
