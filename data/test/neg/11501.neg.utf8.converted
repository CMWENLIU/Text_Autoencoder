I bought 2 dozen of these monkey lollipops as party favors for my daughter's 2nd birthday party.  I was happy they arrived within 2 days of ordering.  They are as cute as the photos depicted and they arrived well packaged.  Each dozen is packed in a box that has the nutritional info on the box, but I was disappointed to see a label on the back of each lollipop to have in huge font "Made in China".  For nutritional info, call this #. This label took away from the cuteness of these lollipops.  I had intentions of giving one to my 2 year old, but after seeing this label, it makes me think twice whether I should.  Everything now is made in China, and when it comes to children's products, China = RECALL.  I wished the website posted where the lollipops were made because I assumed USA, had I known they were from China, I would not have bought these lollipops.  I will just use them as decorations.  Using something that's made in China is one thing, but eating something from China requires caution!
