Well, this would make a beautiful gift, that's for sure.<br />Nicely packaged, pretty foil packets.<br /><br />Now, the coffee - so far, we've only tried one of them. If that is any<br />indicator of the rest of the coffees, this was a big waste of money.<br /><br />We just made a pot of the dessert-sounding Turtle Sundae.<br />GROSS! Yes, that's all I can say about it. The coffee tasted<br />like burnt cocoa, like you tried to make hot chocolate, left out the milk and used water,<br />and let it boil dry on the stove. I tried adding creamer. Still bad.<br /><br />I sure hope some of the other flavors are better. I'll update my review<br />as we try the other flavors, but I don't hold out much hope right now.<br />This was a Christmas package, but sealed in foil, it should still be fresh enough<br />to taste good. If this was their best going in to the foil, then avoid at all costs.
