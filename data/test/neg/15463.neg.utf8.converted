I purchased three cases of this kettle corn in the small bags when it was on an Amazon special price.  Unfortunately, I found that each bag has WAY too many small unpopped pieces, both full kernals and smaller pieces.  Many of these hard pieces are fused to the popped pieces with the glaze, so you don't know what to expect until you crunch down on a hard piece.<br /><br />After breaking a molar on this stuff, I have resorted to eating each piece with great care to make sure it doesn't contain hidden surprises that will send me back to the dentist.  It's tasty, but I won't be ordering it again.
