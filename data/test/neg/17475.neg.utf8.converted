This toy is a waste of time. One can only assume that there is great educational value if the seeds germinate, which they did not. All instructions were followed and the toy was placed in an ideal place, still, nothing.  I would buy the seeds yourself and let your little one help plant them without the use of the dome. Simply use sandwich bags and an elastic band to create small greenhouses.<br /> A WASTE OF MONEY!
