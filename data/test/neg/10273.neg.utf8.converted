I love coconut water.  It's so refreshing.  I've been wanting to try some of the flavored coconut waters and grabbed this when it was on sale.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say that I didn't like this flavor at all.  It had a sour taste to me that I really disliked.  I drank down one, but was not happy to think of drinking the other 11!  sigh... I gave the rest of them to my brother and I hope he enjoyed the flavor more than I did.  I wont be getting this flavor again.
