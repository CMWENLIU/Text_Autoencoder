I bought a 12-pack of Redi-Burger about three months ago after reading the previous reviews. I have tried numerous Loma Linda, Worthington, Morningstar Farms, Boca, etc protein or meat substitute products over the past 30 years, but this is without doubt the worst of them.<br />I ordered this product for shelf storage during the winter months since my freezer space is limited and thought it would be convenient to occasionally open a can to slice for burgers, or chop up for use in tacos, chili, casseroles, etc. I expected the quality would be similar to other Worthington and Loma Linda canned products. I have tried to use this product in these various ways for several months and it's just horrible and can't be disguised even in other dishes. I'm going to donate the remaining cans to local meals program. The problem is the taste and texture. It tastes burned right out of the can, and has a sandy/gritty or mealy texture that doesn't help. After much consideration, I would describe the taste as a concentrated, burned hamburger bun that caught some of the aroma or seasonings of a hamburger or veggie burger along the way.<br />I love Worthington and Loma Linda's other products and would quickly recommend them such as the canned veggie sausage links, Tender Bites, Burger, the frozen Morningstar Farms and Boca burgers, sausage and crumbles, etc. Redi-Burger though is so bad that it could make a vegetarian reconsider eating meat.
