My (indoor only) cats LOVE Fancy Feast Elegant Medley's but this flavor is the very last plate they eat from. For some reason they do not enjoy the Wild Salmon at all. I started feeding it to the "community cats" that wander up for breakfast and lunch and I have noticed that even they (being hungry and outdoors) don't scarf it up like like they do all of the other flavors. If you decide to give it chance make sure that your cats are real seafood lovers or try a few cans before buying it like a did; I bought 2 cases of each flavor (turkey, chicken etc...) so they are going to have eat it at some point.
