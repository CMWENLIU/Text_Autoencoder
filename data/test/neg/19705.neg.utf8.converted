Every time I ordered this, half of the quantities they shipped are outdated. Every time they intentionally wiped out the expiration date. Most of the time they tasted bad or not as good. The other half with long expiration date taste good.<br /><br />Amazon should stop doing this. If Amazon does not know this, it should make sure it won't happen again.
