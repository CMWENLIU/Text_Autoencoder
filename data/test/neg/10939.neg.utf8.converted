Having bought this product in a grocery store, I know what it is like when purchased fresh.  I highly recommend this sugar from my previous experiences with it.  Unfortunately, this online purchase was about as far from that as you could get.  All six of the items I received were stale and hard as a rock.  Here's the kicker...I went online to return them and couldn't, because food products aren't returnable evidently.  What a waste of my money.  Don't waste yours...don't buy brown sugar online from the retailer I used.
