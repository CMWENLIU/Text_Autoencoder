I buy mine from the local middle eastern store in NY and it costs me $1.59 for the 10 oz bottle. This is ridiculously overpriced. Just bought one yesterday to make some desserts and cookies. This brand, however, is much better than Ziyad brand in terms of quality and overall taste. That being said, I would never pay $4 for a 10 oz bottle. Even the 17 oz bottle is cheaper than $4 at my local store.
