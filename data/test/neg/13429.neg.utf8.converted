For a number of years, I have purchased Pellegrino by the case at, Costco.  I have three problems with Pellegrino:<br /><br />(1) I don't know how much a bottle used to hold, but to me it seems that the bottles over the years have decreased in size, it seems like the company slimmed down the bottle to hold less water.  I am certain the price didn't decrease.<br /><br />(2) Just recently, I purchased a case and found the seal on the bottles so insufficient that I have had to pour out all the contents of a newly opened bottle, no fizz. Just this weekend I had to pour out the water in two brand new bottles.<br /><br />(3) If I do have a newly opened bottle that is fizzy, I've also noticed that the bottle tops do not hold the fizz for long after the bottle has been opened, say only a few days in the fridge.  I usually replace the Pellegrino top by recycling a lid from a plastic Coke bottle.<br /><br />I have heard that the store, ShopRite has a nice store-named product that is imported from Italy and tastes like Pellegrino. I'm switching.<br /><br />(Let's hope ShopRite keeps the cost reasonable, keeps bottle size the same, and has a better lid.)
