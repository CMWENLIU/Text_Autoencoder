I am incredulous. Who are these people who actually ate/liked this product?  After reading the high praise for this eeeuuuuwww rice, I ordered it with confidence.  So much for that effort.  This stuff (not what I'd like to call it), is incredibly nasty--totally tasteless, gummy, and sticky.  And it was down the disposal immediately after I attempted to taste it. Ugh! Now I have to go to the trouble of returning it if I want to get a refund. GRRRRRRRRR!!!
