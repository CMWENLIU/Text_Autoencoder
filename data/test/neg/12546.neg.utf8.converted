I really made a mistake ordering these, but in my defense, I didn't notice anything in the description to give me a clue that these are really chocolate covered cookies, not regular graham crackers.  But I thought, well, at least maybe I'll get some antioxidant value from the chocolate; but no, come to find out it uses "Dutch" alkali processed chocolate, so no redeeming value there.  They actually don't even taste as good as regular graham crackers.  I guess I'll have to stow them away until the next food drive.  I'm sure if someone is hungry enough, they'll probably get eaten.
