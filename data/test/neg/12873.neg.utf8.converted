Like the idea of getting some samples, but once you refrig these it is tough to get the sauce out of the small bottles.  Do not buy.<br /><br />I should add - a few came broken during shipping. I was not upset. But the refrig directions make them un-useable. I have yet to pull them out or open the others since.
