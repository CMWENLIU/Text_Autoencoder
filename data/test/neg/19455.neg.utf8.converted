I have loved every Amys product that I have tried [well over 30 items].  This is the exception.  The soup is a runny liquid with few vegetables.  The flavor has much to be desired--very oily with an over-powering lemon aftertaste.  The flavor immediately made me think "so this is what lemon pine sol tastes like."  There have to be a better options.  Don't give up on Amys if this is your first experience--close your eyes and pick one of the other Amys flavors because it will taste better than this.  If it were thicker, with more vegetables and a bit more coconut over lemon, maybe it would be worthy of three stars. Maybe.
