I bought this product with the idea I would get a cheddar cheese powder.  It's not!!  It's mostly whey powder with very little cheese in it.  The cost of shipping is way to much and the stuff is crap.  I think Amazon is in violation of the law.  Nowhere do you find any ingredients of this food product.  Except for the shot of the front of the bag that says it's Cheddar Powder.  That's false advertising and against the laws put down by the FDA about food products.  Keep looking there is better out there.
