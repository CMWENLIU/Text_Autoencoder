The definition of meat by products:<br /><br />The non-rendered, clean parts, other than meat, derived from slaughtered mammals. It includes, but is not limited to, lungs, spleen, kidneys, brain, livers, blood, bone, partially defatted low temperature fatty tissue, and stomachs and intestines freed of their contents<br /><br />In summary, it is NOT meat, and is NOT safe for human consumption. So why feed your pets this stuff? Sure, it's cheap, but food such as Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul does not cost much more and is free of it!
