Where I come from "bait & switch" is called fraud.<br />I thought that surely by now Amazon.com would have corrected this "bait & switch" problem of offering a premium coconut milk from Thailand, but then sending an inferior "oil & water'" product from Skri Lanka, since there were lots of reviews warning about this.<br />I had carefully verified that what I was ordering was truly from Thailand-but it is NOT! It is from Skri Lanka, instead.<br />ALSO, the product I received from Skri Lanka was in the old style yellow lined (Phenol lined?) cans-the yellow kind with the white stripe down the side that theoretically products you from the metals they use to seal the can! (And I am allergic to the chemical phenol!)<br />The Thailand product comes in a silver colored can-I opened both products today and did the comparision side by side.<br />So not only is Amazon.com allowing a bait & switch to happen, they are allowing an older style (a potentially harmful style) of can to be sold.<br />I had to use a couple of cans for a party tonight, but I will not eat it!<br />I have asked for my money back and cancelled by subscription, and will buy the rich creamy Thailand coconut milk from my health food store!
