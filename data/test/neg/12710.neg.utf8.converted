I have enjoyed Maxwell House's latte products but, don't like the flavor of this one.  Making it to the manufacturer's specifications, I mixed in 1 1/3 tablespoons (that's 4 teaspoons)to 6-8 ounces of water.  The foamy top layer looked good, just like a restaurant latte.  But, the proof is in the aroma (light pumpkin spice scent) and the drinking.  I did not taste the coffee at all.  In fact, it was more of a tea-like flavor.  Too weak.<br /><br />Reading the ingredients list is a sojourn into a science class.  To paraphrase an old TV commercial, it's 'better living through chemistry'.  Chemists have created many products that mimic natural ones--just not this one.<br /><br />While I like pumpkin pie, pumpkin spice scented candles and the like, I don't care for this drink.  And neither did two others who tried it.
