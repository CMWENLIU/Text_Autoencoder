I love the premise of the SodaStream.  I loved the idea of not lugging heavy bottles of soda home from the store.  I loved the idea of not having to save and return bottles to get back my deposit.  But......the soda flavors all definitely disappoint.  I only tried the Lemon-Lime and Rootbeer, and decided they both tasted odd and too sweet.  I literally couldn't/didn't want to even attempt to finish either liter.  Count me in on this machine if Pepsi/Coke actually offer their syrups for use.  Til then, I'm taking this back for a refund. :(
