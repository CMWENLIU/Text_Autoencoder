I was keeping an open mind when trying the hot chocolate as I had read many of the reviews. The ones that expressed dissatisfaction were right on. Felt it was extremely watery and tasteless and that was using the smallest cup setting. I would suggest using the machine just to heat the water and use a packet of hot chocolate (Swiss Miss, etc.)
