I think anybody who buys bottled water ,especially high priced water in plastic bottles is an idiot.Could someone please explain to me why someone would go to a website ,buy some really expensive water in plastic bottles ,have it sent to them,think that there is some benefit to drinking high priced water in a plastic bottle?<br /><br />I will listen with an open ear.
