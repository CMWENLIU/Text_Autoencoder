Luscious, dry, grainy cookies, leaving the tiniest speck of dry crumbs stuck in your teeth, a gift of flavor for hours to come. The dry cottonmouth experience is hard to forget.<br /><br />Yes, I tried these little beauties, and I must admit, they fulfilled my expectation of an as-good-as-can-be-expected treat from your friendly health-food provider.<br /><br />The chocolate chips were delicious, but I was hoping for more of a cookie consistency--my mistake for raising expectations too high.<br /><br />I should have gone for the full-fat experience--it never lets you down.
