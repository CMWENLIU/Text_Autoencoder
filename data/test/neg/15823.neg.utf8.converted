I have recieved two packages of these oats.  The first package was packed properly and the oats were wonderful.  The second package was damanged badly and almost all of the oats were scattered throughout the box.  In addition, the policy states that I cannot return the item.  That is $19.00 flushed down the drain.  Had I been able to return this package I would have been happy.  I do understand that damage sometimes happen.  As it is, I have just lost money on this purchase.
