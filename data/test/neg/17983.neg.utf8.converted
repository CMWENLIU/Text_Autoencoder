I ordered this OfficePRO with the office in mind.  When I received it, I unboxed it at my house and set it up.  This is the loudest coffee machine I have ever heard.  It produces a LOUD noise when the water is being pumped and while it is brewing.  The noise this machine produces is a bit too extreme for an office setting, unless you work in a place that is naturally loud or don't mind loud distracting noises all day, I wouldn't recommend this brewer.  The functions that this machine has are very interesting and I would be extremely happy with the machine but the noise it produces is beyond reasonable.  Love the brand, hate this model.  I replaced this one with an Elite.
