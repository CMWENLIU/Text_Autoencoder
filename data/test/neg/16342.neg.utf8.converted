These snacks are only ok.  Beware.  When it says "5 pack", it means one box of five very small graham snacks with a very thin layer of yogurt.  The box is the size of a poptart box, but is half air.  Not a lot of flavor either.  This small box was shipped to me in a carton easily large enough to hold 12 or more boxes of 5.  Maybe if they used an appropriately sized carton, they would not have to charge $10 for shipping. One dollar each for these tiny snacks is already ridiculous. I notice there is no place to leave seller feedback for this company.  -Annoyed
