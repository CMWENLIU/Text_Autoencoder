The product is mainly rice, and not very well milled rice at that.  Second Ingredient is corn, I found whole corn kernels in the bag.<br /><br />It does have rye etc. but the rice is overpowering, and considering that you can get 20lbs of rice for $7-8 at an asian market, this product seems overpriced.<br /><br />I thought this was going to be comparable to the traditional muslix type breakfast cereals (oats, rye, barley, wheat) but it is corn,rice, barley, millet etc and tastes pretty bad -- If you want the experience of this cereal, overcook some rice, and throw some oatmeal + bird seed into it...<br /><br />I tried to eat this for 4 days,  decided well if its not that healthy, and taste bad, why am I even bothering.  the birds in the back yard can enjoy it, because i didn't.
