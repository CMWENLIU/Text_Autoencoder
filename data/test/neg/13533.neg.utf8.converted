This has to be one of the most disgusting products I have tasted. If you are on the Atkins or low carb diet it is NOT truly low carb. The nutrition information was deceptive and when I tried to return the product (unopened) the return policy does not allow for returns. I had to throw the 6 bottles away. Avoid this product at all costs! You can buy a ZERO carb maple syrup at any grocery store. Do not be fooled by this company.
