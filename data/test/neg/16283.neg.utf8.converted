First off, letme say  that I am not Indian, but I did live in India for 10 years. Many years ago I purchsed the Chana Masala (chick peas in sauce) and remember liking it. After many years, I recently came across Jyoti products again, and thought I'd give them a try. I bought Mattar Paneer, Sag Paneer and the yellow lentils with vegetables (carrots). All three were horrible. First of all, they all had an aluminum can flavor. They were all extremely greasy and salty. They smelled horrible. I managed to eat most of the Mattar Paneer when I mixed it with rice, but the others were inedible, mostly because of the can taste, as well as that the ingredients (vegetables, paneer etc.) being completely liquefied/mush from a can. I felt sad throwing all that food away, but I honestly couldn't get it down without feeling like I was going to get sick. I bought something from them a year ago and it was the same thing. I had just assumed it was a bad batch, clearly something else is going on with their product.
