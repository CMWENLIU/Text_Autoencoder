Ok. So I bring it home (from Wal-Mart) and look for the directions on the jar.. What Directions!?<br />Since my hair is dry especially on the ends and in my excitement of actually finding something to help my problem, I immediately hop into the shower and start gobbing this stuff all over into my hair/scalp. Oh NO! That was a BIG MISTAKE!! I had the greasiest head of hair (and I have very long hair).. UGH!<br />And let me tell you, washing it out with your average shampoo won't cut it. I contiued to wash multiple times for two days until this morning in a moment of desperation (lightbulb turned on) I run into my kitchen and snatched the Dawn dishwashing liquid which did help immensely after two good latherings. It's not all out but I'm on my way..<br /><br />Buyer beware of what you are getting yourself into when you see this innocent looking jar of "hair therapy".
