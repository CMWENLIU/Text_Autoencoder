I have a 7 month old springer spaniel puppy, and I've been going through toys at a rapid clip. I bought this because I thought it might keep him occupied awhile and that the toy part would last. He wasn't terribly interested in it at first, but later on he made a project of it. I was encouraged when he stayed working on it for about 30 minutes. He popped the treat out soon after that. I didn't mind so much because I thought he'd just keep chewing on the plastic part - and he did. Unfortunately, it only took another 1/2 hour or so before he had chewed little bits off. I give it poor ratings because a toy named "everlasting" should hold up better than that, esp. one so expensive.
