I have tried other products from Pataks and liked them. I also like Korma curries in restaurants. Trader Joe's discontinued their Korma sauce, so I tried this one. It is probably the worst thing I have eaten in at least a year. I decided to throw it out and made something else for dinner.<br /><br />It is extremely sweet and thick (not thick in a good way). Also, there is a very strong taste of what may be anise. The anise and the sweetness are all I could taste.
