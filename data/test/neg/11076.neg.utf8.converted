My 8 months old loves this, but I just read the label this morning and discovered that it containes milk powder and it is made in China.  With all the recent recalls of milk products in China due to melamine contamination, I've decided not to give to my baby any more until I have evidence that it is safe.  Has anyone done any research on this topic?
