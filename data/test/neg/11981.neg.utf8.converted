I had the same experience as the previous reviewer. The tea was stale. I was hoping, after reading his/her review, that their experience was just a fluke and that I would receive usable tea. I was wrong.<br /><br />I now have a pound of tea I have no use for. Tried to contact customer service but they asked me a single question and never responded again. Highly disappointed.
