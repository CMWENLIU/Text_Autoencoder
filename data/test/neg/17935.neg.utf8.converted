I should have read the other reviews more carefully before purchasing these for our Australian Shepard. These bones are so tiny he just looks ridiculous with them.  Even more, I have to watch him with them because they are so small that I am worried they are going to get lodged in his throat while he is trying to eat them (which takes less than 5 minutes).
