The first thing I noticed when I open the box was, the whole foil pack seems too light, so I weighed it, the whole foil pack weighted merely 8.5oz while the foil was pretty heavy one, after took the fish out of package, I weighed again, without water, the fish was exactly 6oz. So here comes the question, why the manufacturer stated "Net weight: 8oz", 8oz is the weight include water and foil packet, even with the added water, I would say not more than 6.5 oz. when you buy this brand, take it into account, for whatever the price you paid, you are not getting 8oz (half pound) but 6oz fish.<br />The taste is nowhere close to real smoked salmon from the better brand, the fish was soft(contain too much liquid), fragile, very light smokey, taste more like a canned tuna in the water.<br /><br />Fortunately I did not buy from Amazon, and did not pay the $22/pk price, I paid $9/pk at local grocery store and now I know why, I was able to return 2 out of 3 packs after ate the first pack. will never buy this brand if I can remember in the future.
