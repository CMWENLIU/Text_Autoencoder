I thought that the first reviewer may have been overexaggerating, but this one really does taste bad. I believe the only way to come close to enjoying the cheese part of this is to store the box, in its entirety, in a humid environment so the cheese can, well, get soft. Other than that, it's horrible and you should simply discard it. The Slim Jim, on the other hand, is "so-so" but may taste better with a dip or something. This is not the same as the skinny Slim Jims (you know, the addictive ones) so if you don't want to ruin your taste buds with so-so beef and horrible cheese, move on.
