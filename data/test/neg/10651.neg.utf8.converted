I had been happily using these bags for about a year, and ordered them through Amazon's subscribe and save, but in my last shipment of 4 boxes, two of the boxes had bags with weak side seams which split open when I tried to use them. Also, in one of the boxes, some of the bags were slashed or cut, even though the box itself was whole and unmarked. That's 100 bags that are completely unusable.<br /><br />According to Amazon's return policy, this item is not eligible for return, so you'd be out some money if you order this item and it's defective. I have contacted Amazon anyway, and also written to Biobag USA to register a complaint.
