I thought I was buying the candies in the picture, the ones I ate in<br />Europe.  Unfortunately the ones I received was not the ones in the picture.  The ones I received, was not the same candy, even the shape was different.  I receive disc instead of round candies.  I was very disappointed.  I paid a high price for one particular candy and received another. I tried the first one and did not finish it, I thru it out.  The whole bag is still there.  Very Disappointing!
