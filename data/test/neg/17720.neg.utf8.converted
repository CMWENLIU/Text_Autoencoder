Too bad, I was looking forward to these, but they were awful.  Unusable.  Smelled EXACTLY like my anatomy class dissection room, unmistakable odor.  My guess is that chemicals were added to them to preserve them.  Anyway, what a disappointment: returned.  Thanks for making that easy at least, Amazon.
