I bought this believing it was an all natural product.  When I took my first sip I thought it tasted artificial and after researching discovered that it contained sucralose. It is deceptive  not to include this information prominently on the packaging when claiming all natural flavoring. In fact I did not see it mentioned anywhere unless you read the ingredient list, where it is easy to confuse the 'sucralose' with 'sucrose' -a natural sugar.<br /><br />The advertising on the package claims to be unsweetened.  Not true, it is sweetened with an artificial sweetner.<br /><br />This is the product description on Amazon:  "We start with pure, natural water, add carbonation and 100% fruit essences to create 10 distinctly thirst-quenching flavors." Very misleading.
