When you purchase canned tomatoes, you do not expect to find a plump, juicy intact tomato like you would purchase in the produce aisle. So, expecting these tamales to equate to fresh or home-made tamales is just not realistic. The texture of these tamales is soft, perhaps "mushy", and more add a hint of tamale flavor rather than being what you may be thinking in terms of a traditional tamale.<br /><br />If you are like me and crave a tamale from time to time, these may provide a bit of instant gratification. But, I think it is better to be realistic in your expectations, than to be disappointed because of them.
