It is odd that my taste buds reported to me the opposite of the reviews here.  I'm disappointed by that, as I paid this premium price based on the 5 star reviews.<br /><br />I'm old enough to remember "old time" licorice that was sold for 1 cent (even 5 for a penny) and that is the flavor and consistancy that I was looking forward to when I purchased this licorice.<br /><br />I have some anise spice in my cupboard for baking, and I just tasted it to make sure that I didn't have my spices mixed up.  Based on that comparison; My verdict is that this licorice tastes strongly of anise (NOT licorice).<br /><br />I thought it was much too soft.  There was no "chew" to it.  It was mushy.  The only thing I can think to compare it with is a soft cheese, such as Havarti.  It is even softer than a mild chedder.<br /><br />Sorry... only 2 stars from me.
