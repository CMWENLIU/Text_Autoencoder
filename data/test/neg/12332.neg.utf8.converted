[As evidenced by the 'Not Helpful' votes on this review, folks apparently don't want to hear what I point out below (the idea of popping a candy-like caramel to save your heart is just TOO appealing), but I'm going to keep this review available for the rationalists out there.]<br /><br />I purchased a couple boxes of these and enjoyed them for several months. They are convenient, they taste great, and supposedly they're good for my health -- what's not too like? Eventually, I uncovered three problems:<br /><br />1) My physician mentioned something I hadn't realized: 75% of the cholesterol in our bodies is synthesized BY our bodies. Only 25% is ingested through food. Then I read a WebMD article ("Cholesterol Control: The Alternatives") which mentioned that plant sterols/stanols like Benecol only block absorption of about 10% of the cholesterol in the food we eat. So essentially, these Smart Chews are blocking 10% of 25%. I'll do the math for you... we're blocking 2.5% of total cholesterol. Surprisingly, you'll find other reviewers reporting much larger cholesterol drops, but then it turns out they've changed their diet, gone on statins, started exercising, or introduced other confounding factors... These are wildy uncontrolled experiments from which it is impossible to draw cause-effect conclusions.<br /><br />2) The whole idea behind this product is based on the "diet-heart hypothesis" -- which is the scientific name for the idea that eating cholesterol causes heart disease. At this point, nearly every reputable scientist in the field has dismissed this idea. Ancel Keys -- the father of this hypothesis in the 1940s -- said in 1997: "There's no connection whatsoever between the cholesterol in food and cholesterol in the blood. . .Cholesterol in the diet doesn't matter at all unless you happen to be a chicken or a rabbit." (A reference to the inability of certain animals to process dietary cholesterol). Most researchers now believe the primary causes of heart disease are inflammation and oxidative stress. So what exactly are we doing here with these Benecol chews?<br /><br />3) This might be my own weakness, but I found myself sporadically eating things that I would never normally touch. The guys at work are going for fried chicken? Sure I'll join them -- why not! I'll just pop a Benecol and feel better about it. It was a strange "enabler" of bad eating behavior.<br /><br />Ultimately, I'm not sure there is much benefit here, but there certainly is cost! If you want to improve your HDL/LDL ratio (without a prescription statin), you would derive much more benefit from a natural statin (e.g. red yeast rice) which will lower your LDL, or Niacin which will boost your HDL. The key here is that both these approaches act on the more important side of the cholesterol equation: the body's production.
