My last purchase of 4 cases of this food had a sour off- smell. Called natural balance customer service, they said they hadn't received complaints about that batch, they'd pass info along to tech dept, they'd send me a coupon for 1 case.... But, it's a natural product, and variation "was to be expected".  They suggested I return it to the retailer. Paying for shipping 3 times (receiving, sending back, receiving again) for a heavy product like this makes it very expensive.<br />I've fed this variety to my 3 cats for a year (alternate with Natural Balance Ultra), and they have always loved it.  They will only eat this batch if they are very very hungry.  I can barely stand to open the cans. All other batches had a clean fresh smell.<br />I'm disapointed with the customer service response to a quality issue from a heavy user of their premium priced product. (I have 3 cats). I won't buy from Natural Balance again. I'll use the coupon locally, and make sure I'm mixing production runs.
