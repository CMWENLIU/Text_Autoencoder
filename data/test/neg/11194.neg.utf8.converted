Looking at the other reviews, I have to wonder if the the box I bought was a dud.  However, it's the only one I have ever (or will ever) buy, so I'll have to judge it off of this box.<br /><br />The texture of these caramels was extremely sandy. The first flavor that hits you is salt, followed by a slightly sour taste akin to condensed milk, finished off by an overwhelming sweetness.  Not once did I enjoy the creamy mouthfeel or the complex flavor I associate with a good caramel.<br /><br />For the price they charge, I expect delicate, balanced flavors with proper texture. My box tasted like the caramels crystallized during the cooking process, ending up more like a praline than a caramel.  I would have been better off buying a bag of Werthers.
