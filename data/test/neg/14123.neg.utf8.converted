This pasta was terrible. First of all, it is expensive, even on sale. Second, it has no flavor whatsoever. I expect that from a rice-only pasta, but this was not hearty or interesting at all. And the worst part was that when we cooked it, it broke into tiny pieces! The longest strand of "spaghetti" we got out of this box was less than one inch long; average length maybe 1/2 inch. It turned the cooking water into a thick, nasty soup of excess starches, and even covered in a hearty sauce was hard to eat and certainly not worth it. Never buying this again!!
