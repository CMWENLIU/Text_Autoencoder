Was unaware this product was made and irradiated in China<br />Amazon should really have a country of origin for all products listed on Amazon.com<br />especially when irradiated<br /><br />I'm quite uncomfortable with buying food products made in China. Even more so for pet products, where the track record is dubious at best.<br /><br />I know the FDA approves of food irradiation, but I remain skeptical<br />and China's guidelines(on pet goods especially) are much more laxed than those of the FDA
