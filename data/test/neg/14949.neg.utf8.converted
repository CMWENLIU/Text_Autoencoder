This item is a gyp and the seller produces false advertising. I received this item today and its horrible.  I paid $30 for this? The tins of tea appear larger in the add. This set will make about 8 cups of tea (for $30). The packaging is not the same and it is NOT a GIFT set.  Basically, I got 4 tiny tins of tea in a plain brown box and I did NOT get the tea strainer as promised. I was supposed to get a nice flat-style green box that looks like a gift box.  This thing looks like it was packaged by UPS or FedEx. The FREE gift wrapping was a piece of red ribbon tied around a cardboard box.  How can I give this as a gift?! How can I CALL this a gift?! I could have gotten a set (locally) that was twice as nice for about $10.00 more (fool me once). When I tried to contact the seller, I got their answering machine eventhough it was during business hours and the mailbox was full so I could not leave a message. Do not do business with these people. Maybe they are fine throughout the rest of the year but when its Christmas and when the going gets tough, they get going....right out the door, close shop, take the phone off the hook, lock the doors, etc.
