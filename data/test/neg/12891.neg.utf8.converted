I tried this decaf and found it to be an pretty good. Thought I would give it a second try but when I went to order more it was out of stock. I called Jeremiah's Pick directly to find out about that. A rude detached phone sales person responded with a flat voiced response: "It's out of stock". I asked how long she thought it would be before they roasted more and had it back in stock and she said: "It's out of stock". So I was curious and asked her if it would ever be back in stock and she said: "it's out of stock". I asked one final question in hopes of finding out whether I would ever be able to get it again. I asked why they were out of stock. Was it a bean shortage, a roasting delay- please give me any insight you could about the future prospect of being able to buy this product. The response? A flat, no energy "it's out of stock". What poor customer relations. I will never try to order this coffee again. Customer service is important. I switched over to BackCountry "No Trace" organic, water processed fair trade decaf and this was a wonderful surprise. I was in luck. BackCountry is now my top of the list, great flavor and aroma and their service is friendly and they ship the same day they roast. Love BackCountry coffee. Hey Jeremiah's Pick.... "you're out of a customer!".
