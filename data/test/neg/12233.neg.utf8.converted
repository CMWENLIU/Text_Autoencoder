This was actually a free sample, and thank goodness because I would not want to spend money on it.  Let's get one thing straight here, I love tea both iced and hot.  I also love the flavors of mango and pineapple.  But this version of instant tea from Lipton is not my idea of tasty.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Convenient single-serve packet.  Stir it into a glass of water or shake it up in a bottle of water.  Goes with you for whenever you're ready for iced tea.<br />- No aspartame or asculflame K<br />- No artificial flavors or colors<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Contains sucralose<br />- Not a good overall flavor<br />- The sucralose tickles and irritates my throat<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />While the pineapple and mango flavors are certainly prominent, there is absolutely no green tea flavors my taste-buds recognize.  To me, it's like some kind of cheap drink mix.  Judging by the taste, it's hard to believe it's made with natural flavors!  It has a chemical taste to it that I cannot stand.<br /><br />I do no recommend this drink mix.  It sounds good and seems like it would be okay (aside from the sucralose), but it's bad.  I cannot even finish my one glass.  Sorry Lipton, but this product was a flop.  I'll stick with your hot teas.
