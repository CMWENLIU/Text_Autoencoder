I was surprised at how light each cup was, then had some trouble w/my Keurig even puncturing the bottom of the k-cup.  I opened one up and realized there wasn't any filter!  No wonder the instructions say to brew w/the smaller size cups only.  Everything brewed into my cup.  Now I wish I read the reviews before buying. and realize that it's instant coffee.  I feel so ripped off that I'm writing my 1st review to warn people NOT to buy this.  Terrible product, bad taste.  Grove Square should be ashamed of themselves!
