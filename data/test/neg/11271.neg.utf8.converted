I usually drink the carnation breakfast, but in the individual packets. I recently bought a pack of 3 of the canisters. My husband cautioned me that the ones he saw all said WHEAT in the store. Online, it was not listed in the ingredients. With his advice I double checked the ingredients. It used wheat flour. Obviously, it's a cheap way to fill the product. The smaller packets which are more expensive do not have flour. If you have Celiac disease like me, this could lead to a serious illness b/c of the bad labeling by AZ.com. Even if you do not have a wheat allergy, taking in more processed carbs is not good for your body.
