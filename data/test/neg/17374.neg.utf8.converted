I had to return this product,unsued, because I felt the cost was out site for the size that I received. I sent the supplier an email yesterday asking where my refund was w/ a copy to you. I'll be out $20+ just for shipping costs but would say this is not a good value. Have you heard anything about my refund? Gene Wathey
