How does a multimillion dollar company ship a product to it's customers in a paper bag? Yes, it came in a shipping box...but the product itself (24 flavored K-Cups) were all thrown inside an unmarked brown bag and stapled. Leads one to believe that they're cashing in on unsellable broken boxes of K-Cups, sad part is that they're still getting PRIME FULL PRICE!!! Well, a lesson has been learned and I will not purchase this "item" again...Thanks Amazon! And by the way, almost a third of the contents were that disgusting GROVE SQUARE brand and various decaf (of which we don't drink!) Such a convenient way to dump your stock of the brands & brews that don't move! Shopping via the internet is okay most times but it can damn sure bite you in the ass as well. The only reason they got ONE STAR is because of the Kahlua Blend, which was very good.
