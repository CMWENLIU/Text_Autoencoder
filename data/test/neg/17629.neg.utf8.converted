Texas Pete is the worst. First of all, its made in Winston-Salem North Carolina and served in all the diners here in the Carolinas like ketchup, which it complements very well, but doesn't add any heat too.<br /><br />Rates out at about 500 Scoville units, Texas Pete can only be described as "hot sauce flavored thinned-out tomato sauce." Don't go out of your way to find this stuff, it ain't worth it.
