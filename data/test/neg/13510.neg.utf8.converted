I have been purchasing there products for 2-3 years now. Not always, but sometimes the box contains bugs inside the bones, that make my dog sick. After further examination it seems the bugs come inside hte box. Today I opened a new one only to find it full of bugs to, I threw them all away and probably wont purchase again. I dont urge you to stop buying the product but rather check it thoroughly before giving it to your dog. If it does contain bugs contact the company and tell them where you bought it.
