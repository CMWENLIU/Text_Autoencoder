I liked the taste of the bags that were sealed good, but probably about half of the bags were not sealed properly.  The ones that were not sealed correctly tasted stale, so I was really disappointed with these.  I have had this brand in a larger bag, and really liked them, so I don't know what happened, but I do know that I won't be buying these smaller size bags anymore!  There were openings in a couple of the bags on the end, but most of them just did not have the air tight seal in the bag.
