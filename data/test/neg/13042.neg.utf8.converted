My dogs (1 5month old and 1 7year old) both got diarrhea and vomitting after eating these treats. They liked them a lot when we bought them, but within a week both dogs had upset stomachs. When the puppy was sick we assumed she had just gotten into something, but she had diarrhea for 3 days and then had blood in her stool. When we took her to the vet they could not attribute it to anything specific. When the older dog got sick a day after eating one of these we concluded it must be the bones. She has never been sick enough to warrant any medications before and we are putting her on medicine and prescription food to get over this. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
