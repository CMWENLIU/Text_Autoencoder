My second purchase of this product was unsatisfactory. This sweetener was "chrystalized" in small pieces and did not sweeten at all.  I called to complain and was sent a replacement to no avail. Same situation. The manufacturer must have a quality control problem. After these results , I do not recommend purchase of this product.
