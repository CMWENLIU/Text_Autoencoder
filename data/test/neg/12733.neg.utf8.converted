I read another review of this product that stated that this product's first and main ingredient is whey.  Whey is a by-product of milk (remember that little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet eating her curds and whey).  Whey has a somewhat acidic taste that is rather crude.  Cheddar cheese is way down the line in terms of percentage quantity in this stuff.  I couldn't think of what this stuff tasted like until I read the other review.  It's taste does not resemble that of cheddar cheese.  I knew the product had an odd taste which I did not care for.  I just didn't realize what that taste was until I came across the other review.  There are no ingredients listed on the label.  Now I understand why most liked the product.  I assume because they are used to the taste of boxed macaroni and cheese products available in the grocery store with the orange/yellow powder in the packet inside the box.  And most have come to think of that taste as cheese.  Finer tastes however will reject this stuff, I think because it has little cheese.  Cheddar cheese is made with the by products of milk as well.  The big difference is the cultures that are added to produce the various types of cheese.  Plus the aging.  Whey requires no aging or cultures.  Another of the characteristics of whey is that it has little orange/yellow color.  This stuff has food colorings added to produce the appearance you see in the bag.  I read another review where the writer complained about the lack of labeling.  I agree because it is important to most to know what they are consuming.  If you look at the ingredients of some of the other cheese powders you will see cheddar as the first ingredient unlike this stuff.  I believe the reason that this product has no ingredient labeling is to hide that fact.  By regulation ingredients are to be listed in the order of the percentage contained therein.  In other words the first ingredient would be the highest percentage and therefore the last ingredient would be the lowest quantity contained.  I'm not sure what the percentage of cheddar cheese is in this stuff but its way down the line and not the first.  I have tasted other cheese powders with ingredient lists.  Some of best are those with cheese as the first listed ingredient not the 3rd or 4th.  I really don't like the taste of whey powder.  It is crude and acidic.  And that is to me what this stuff tastes like.  I doubt whether I'll buy any more of this.  To each his own taste, though.  I don't purport to know what anyone else prefers.
