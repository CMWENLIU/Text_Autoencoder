So, I ordered a box with 12 bags of sunflower seeds. Sunflower seeds are healthy; they're rich in that "good" fat that lowers your cholesterol; and I think they're also rather tasty.  This final adjective, however, doesn't describe Sunridge Farms' Organic Sunflower Seeds.  I opened the first bag.  Took a couple of bites and then spit them out.  I tried a second bag.  Same reaction.  I wondered whether or not there was something wrong with my own taste, so I offered them to someone whose sense of taste I respect.  She had the same reaction I had.  In short, these sunflower seeds are inedible.  It's like chewing on rancid, tasteless cardboard.  I threw out the entire shipment.  There are far better options available.
