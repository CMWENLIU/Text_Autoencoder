I have worked for a major retailer for the past 20 years, we sell Soda Stream and all its accessories.  I even performed ALL the product samplings this past 4th quarter.  I bought one for myself.  I like it okay but slowly came to realize that every time I drank the diet cola my face would erupt with cysts that were huge and raw.  I thought it was stress or something else.  I went to an allergist and tested with very strong reaction to "sulfites".  everyone, I mean EVERYONE look at your bottles of syrup and despite all the "healthy" mumbo jumbo find the small print "contains sulfites".  My Dr. told me to stop drinking the soda stream diet cola (I believe all the flavors have sulfites, but I could be wrong) for several weeks.  I complied and stuck with good old Diet Coke.  My face cleared up within a few days and was cyst free.  Them my Dr. instructed me to make a batch of the diet cola in the 1 liter bottle and drink it throughout 1 day.  The next day the cysts were forming again and then progresively got worse.  Stopped using soda stream products completely and have had NO flair ups since.  I would be very careful as sulfites have many bad side effects.  I truly loved the product, its simplicity and sold tons of it because I thought it was great.  Little did I know I was selling something tainted with sulfites.  If you have noticed any strange blisters, cysts or acne do as I did with my Dr.s instructions and see for yourself.  I am male so don't insinuate it was a "monthly menstrual cycle".  BEWARE.
