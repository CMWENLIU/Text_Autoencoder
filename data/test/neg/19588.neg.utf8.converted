I used to love these crackers.  They were a staple item.  A few months ago Sesmark changed the recipe and added flax seeds.  I like flax seeds as a rule, but the new crackers taste very different - very bland with little sesame flavor.  Big mistake Sesmark.  Bring back the original!  Since I couldn't find the originals on the store shelves (or private labeled at Trader Joes) I turned to the Web in desperation.  My pleasure at finding them on Amazon (which I didn't even know sold groceries) and at a great price with auto-shipping lasted only as long as it took for the first shipment to arrive.  It was a case (dozen boxes) of the new recipe.  Argh!  Amazon doesn't take groceries back so I didn't bother fighting them.  They do need to update the listing though.
