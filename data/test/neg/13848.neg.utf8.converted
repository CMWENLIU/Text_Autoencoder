The herb kit that came with my Aerogarden was superb and I enjoyed caring for my little garden. Once it was time to replace it, I purchased the cherry tomato seed kit. These also grew rapidly, but one day I noticed that they had completely fallen over...how would I stake these on an Aerogarden? And yes, the lights were as close to the plants as possible. I kind of leaned them against each other to keep them upright. But they still fell over several times. So they grew and grew but I never got any tomatoes. :( I also did follow the directions to ensure that they had complete darkness for proper flowering. Fortunately we have several tomato and cherry tomato plants in our outdoor vegetable garden. Unfortunately, I spent $20 on 3 cherry tomato Aerogarden plants and got zero yield.
