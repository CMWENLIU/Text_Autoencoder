I am shocked that Amazon would conspire in rabbit slaughter and their consumption by the public.  Rabbits are cute and furry.  They are the most popular pet in Baluchistan and parts of Vanuatu.  Many people have expressed their desire to marry rabbits, and the 9th Circuit will soon affirm our Constitutional right to realize that desire.  Many rabbits are wealthy and productive members of society.  Rabbits invented the steam engine, the toaster oven, the pneumatic bolt gun, and Spandex.  Rabbits pay 27% of all U.S. income taxes. This fall, for the first time, rabbits make up the majority of incoming freshman at Miami University of Ohio.<br />Since they received the right to vote in 1979, rabbits have been reliable supporters of the Whig party, which is the only thing standing between the world and utter chaos.  Last March, while the rest of us were cowering in basements and bomb shelters, rabbits were defending Earth against the Venusian invasion.<br />Of course the rabbits have begun to fight back against our heartless exploitation.  Roving bands of rogue rabbits have remained armed since their defeat of the Venusians, and `wilding' by rabbit gangs has made New York's Central Park unsafe at all hours of day and night.  A radical Whig splinter group, led by the mysterious rabbit who calls himself Lucky Lepus, has even been calling for armed revolt in pursuit of a separate, nuclear, Rabbit Republic.<br />If we know what's good for us, we will put down the butcher's knife and make peaceful accommodation with the rabbits while it is still possible.  Amazon, for the love of God, stop selling this product before the rabbits come for us all.
