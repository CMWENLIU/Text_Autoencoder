This item and the other two I ordered were canceled without bothering to contact me!  I still needed to get Valentine's Day gifts for my wife, Mother, and Mother-in-Law, so I would have considered a more expensive option, but I wasn't even given one.  I assume this was a price mistake, but I wasn't even told that for sure...
