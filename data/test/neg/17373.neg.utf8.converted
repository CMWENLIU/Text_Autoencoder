The product itself gets a 5 star rating.  Amazon selling it through another company, even with the free Amazon Prime shipping, is a rip-off!  This product is available at Williams Sonoma for $12.50!  Williams Sonoma has high prices on a lot of things, but for this vinegar, it's a much cheaper buy to go to the pysical store and purchase it for half the price.  I know, because my husband found it on Amazon, put it on his wishlist, and I purchased it right away because his birthday was in two days.  Meanwhile, he makes a trip to the mall to use some gift cards and returned delighted that he found it for half the price! Of course, by that time, my order had already been shipped!  Ergh!
