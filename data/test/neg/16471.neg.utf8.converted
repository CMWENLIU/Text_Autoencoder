To each their own taste and for me I do not like this one.I cannot describe the off taste I get from this but I just do not like.I am use to getting my tea from a "Special" tea store and now they have merged with another and do not carry the tea's I liked so am trying to find a good ceylon tea to my taste and this is not it.I liked Kennleworth estates and Koslonda and a couple others and am just trying to find something close.<br />This has almost like a chocolate taste and I do not want that in tea.
