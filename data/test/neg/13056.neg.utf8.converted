I paid $20.00 for them and am very disappointed. I agree with the other reviewer,  "...they came in a clear plastic bag taped like they were added in from a larger source instead of as pictured in the manufacturers packaging, I didn't like that, pictured people bare handed throwing them in plastic bags....yuck!"<br />My 3 year old loves butter mints and our Walgreens don't carry them anymore. I can't give them to him, it seems gross to me and I will return them.
