I'm terribly disappointed in this product and here's the reason why.<br /><br />The front of the containers I received (and the photo of the item being sold by Senyx) read CRYSTALLIZED LIME and LEMON.  I've purchased True Lemon from my local grocery store and the carrier sweetener was cane sugar...that's what I was expecting with these two products.  Unfortunately, I now have two products that are primarily MALTODEXTRIN (a starch generally made from corn and probably genetically modified corn at that); and the ingredient labels on both items also state the products contain SOY.<br /><br />MALTODEXTRIN is a food additive...a filler...an artificially created sweetener!  I HATE artifical sweeteners. I doubt these shakers contain very little crystallized lime or lemon compared to the amount of maltodextrin.  What I do believe is that this product is primarily maltodextrin flavored with lemon or lime oil with just enought bits of crystallized lime or lemon to be FDA legal.<br /><br />I accept that I should have researched further before purchasing this product.  That is why I won't be returning the items; but I'll NEVER buy them again.  My trust was misguided.  My purpose for writing this review is the hope of educating anyone else from making the same mistake.  I wasted $17.89 and in this day and time...wasting money is NOT advantageous.
