I've had marrons glaces plenty of times before out of the country and these were a mediocre imitation at best. I figured it was too good to be true to get so much for the price - the good ones are very pricey. Instead of the delicious syrup they're supposed to have, these had that gross donut glaze. I tried to pawn these off to my little brother and his friends (they've never tried real marrons glaces) and they didn't even like these for what they are! Again, with these, you get what you pay for.
