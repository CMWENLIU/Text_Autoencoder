I have never had such horrid instant potatoes!  I tried Bufster3's suggestion but honestly nothing would help.  I also agree with MJ, who wants Palm Oils?<br /><br />I say if you want FANTASTIC instant mashed potatoes then try "Honest Earth All Natural Mashed Potaotes" they are 100% Real Potatoes and they have No preservatives!<br /><br />I think that Edwards & Sons should give this brand a try and quite trying to produce there garbage.
