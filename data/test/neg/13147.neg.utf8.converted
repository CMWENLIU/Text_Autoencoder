In an effort to be ecologically responsible, Nestle has reduced the amount of plastic in their bottles making them almost impossible to open without spilling alot of water.  To unscrew the cap, I have to grip the now very soft container in such a way that water is forced out the top even before the cap is completely off. Be prepared to wipe off your desk or clothing.
