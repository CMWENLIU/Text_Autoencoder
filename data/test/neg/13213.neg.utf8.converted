ORIGINAL REVIEW: Don't you hate how standard 100W (equivalent) CFL bulbs are always HUGE and won't fit into a normal lamp or overhead fixture?  Well, look no further than this product!<br /><br />Finally a COMPACT 100W (equivalent) CFL Light bulb!<br /><br />These bulbs put out equivalent light to 100W bulbs (using only 23W) and are very compact!  They are the same physical size as a NORMAL light bulb!  I needed these for several of my overhead lights and lamps which couldn't take a larger sized bulb, but that I still wanted to put a BRIGHT CFL bulb into.  These bulbs produce a comfortable "warm" white color that is not blue at all!  The color is perfect, almost identical to an incandescent bulb.<br /><br />According to the packaging, these bulbs are supposed to last for 10,000 hours! (That's much longer than the lifespan of a standard bulb) Also, all six bulbs arrived very well packaged and all of them work great so far. (None were broken)<br /><br />UPDATE: After 5 months of light use, one of these bulbs started flickering and turning off randomly (while the switch was in the "on" position).  I replaced it with another of the same type of bulb, and the problem went away.  Am now questioning the supposed "10,000 hour lifespan" that these are supposed to deliver...<br /><br />UPDATE 2: After 7 months of normal use, another bulb has started flickering and turning off randomly, just like the first one that went bad, and had to be replaced also!  STAY AWAY FROM THESE BULBS!  They don't last anything close to 10,000 hours!  More like 1,000 hours...<br /><br />Frankly, for the price I paid for these, I expected better quality.
