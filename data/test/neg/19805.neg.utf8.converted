It is the most difficult thing to find good melon seeds in US.. I gave this a chance because of the option of returning to Amazon. the seeds are packed well, taste freshly roasted, little salted, so fantastic taste on the outside, but the inside is almost empty, nothing, very thin and no taste.<br />since the price is not cheap I am returning them...
