I'm well into my sixth decade of life, and tuna has always been a favorite food.  By now I've found Chicken of the Sea to be my favorite brand with larger, lighter, firmer chunks.  That's not what came in the case I got.  Perhaps this only happens when the product is discounted deeply (I paid about fifty cents per can), but what I got was darker flakes of mushy tuna floating in water.  When I squeezed out the water by depressing the lid the tuna filled less than half the depth of the can.  I suppose I got what I paid for, but with each can I open my opinion of Chicken of the Sea goes down another notch.
