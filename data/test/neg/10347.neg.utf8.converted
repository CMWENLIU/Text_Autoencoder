I was keen to know what this chocolate tastes like though unfortunately when it arrived it was clear it had melted sometime during shipping which changed the structure and turned a bunch of it back into cocoa powder.  I'm rather disappointed that it barely tastes edible and as a fan of really dark chocolate I'm doubtful that's how they're supposed to taste.<br /><br />By contrast I ordered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001S34CUW">Ghirardelli Chocolate Intense Dark Chocolate Bars, 86% Cacao Midnight Reverie, 3.17 oz.</a> and was rather confused by the higher shipping costs.  I figured out why when they arrived.  They'd been shipped with special freezer packs and bubble wrapped.  The freezer packs kept the chocolate from melting and they arrived in perfect condition.
