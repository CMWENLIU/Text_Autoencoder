Oh, my, how awful this was. Beth Hilson should be spinning in Bette Hagman's grave.<br />I am a highly experienced baker. I'm not new to GF baking, but I am new to GF pie crust (I've avoided it and pie for years).<br />The package is too small, especially for the money. The product as packaged should be increased at least 25% by weight. As it is, it barely makes the prescribed-size 8" pies. And good luck finding an 8" pie pan in a retail store (Amazon has them). There is no reason Gluten Free Pantry cannot market products that are sized to fit standard-sized U.S. pans (9" or 10"). This is just cheapness on their part.<br />The instructions should be written so as to be as foolproof as possible. Making a GF crust is not the same thing as regular pie crust. It will not look or feel the same. For instance, when cutting in the 2nd 10 oz of shortening, the flour turned to a solid, waxy mass, nothing like regular pie crust. This was before any liquid was added. All ingredients were chilled. This made it difficult to mix in the liquid ingredients. No guided descriptions or instructions are offered.<br />Moreover, the instructions say "3 tsp vinegar," "2 Tbsp water" and 2 eggs. 3 tsp is a tablespoon. Eggs vary in size, and instructions should be given regarding the total amount of eggs and water so as to be exact. My eggs were extra large, so I reduced the amount of water. Nevertheless, the dough was still far too wet, so I held off on adding all the eggs + water + vinegar. You could add some AP GF flour or starch if things get too wet.<br />Even after 90 minutes of chilling, the dough was very soft. It did roll out between sheets of plastic wrap, and transferred to the pan with some tearing that was easy to patch. However, I found this a tedious and moderately difficult task, and I am a very experienced cook and baker. There was almost no extra crust - maybe 2 oz, or a ball the size of a walnut - left over. I had to struggle to roll the crust in the exact size and shape to fit my pan.<br />My unattractive result looks nothing like the crust on the box, neither in thickness, nor in texture. It is too thin on the pie, and it collapsed unattractively and did not set in the oven. Also, the crust browned on the edges of my tin pie pans too quickly (because the edges are too thin because there isn't enough crust), with only 30 mins of baking at 350 deg. Usually vinegar retards browning in crust. Even covered with foil, the edges burned and won't be eaten.<br />A subsequent insult is that somehow the top crust on my berry pie partially dissolved into the filling before it set in the oven. Then I poked the top crust with my finger and it has turned into this loose, sandy mass - ghastly.<br />I will update after I taste it.
