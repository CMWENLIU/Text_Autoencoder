Well, once again a great product has been cheapened in the name of "American taste".  I find it hard to believe that anyone would prefer this "new" recipe that Lindt is using for its Chocolate sold in the USA.  I should of known something was up because I noticed that the Lindt bars were on sale for far too long at the supermarket.  That is often a sign of a product being cheapened some time after an acquisition from a conglomerate or private equity company; Kettle chips come to mind.<br /><br />Those who were previously in charge of marketing and merchandising Lindt bars in the USA had to know that their market was a little more upscale and refined than those who consume a Hershey or a Reeses.  I bet some new (American) management got involved.  That "market taste test" someone referred to is mostly BS; they already knew that Americans in general have unsophisticated child like tastes, that pander to the overly sweet, artificial and creamy.  Sweet artificial and creamy pretty much sums up American food with the exception of meats.  However in the case of meats sweet artificial sauces and fake smoke flavor abound for "dipping"; Americans love their finger dipping food!  Coming off the diatribe, it is clear that Lindt is now more interested in competing with Hershey for the taste of the "average joe".  After all it costs less to produce chocolate for their taste.  So the gamble is this; will they profit more by making a cheaper bar and competing against Hershey for the taste of Joe average or by keeping their quality high and catering to those who know better?  American management is notorious for pursuing the "quick money", and I know this is a pretty audacious assumption but i bet that Lindt hired on a few Americans to run local manufacturing / Marketing and this change is being conducted at their behest.  Short term, these American managers look good (the quick win) because they lowered their cost basis by decreasing production cost.  Long term, American management mostly moved on and Lindt is now a cheapened brand that just barely survives (in the USA) competing with the likes of Hershey.  We shall see, but I will not buy another Lindt product while Stateside.<br /><br />Can anyone advise of an alternative European dark chocolate bar (70-90%) that is reasonably priced and available in the States.  My favorite bar,  Neuhaus is very expensive and limited in terms of availability.
