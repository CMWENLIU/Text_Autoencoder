I know there are excellent reviews on this crust. It even smells great when it comes out of the bag but that is where it ended for me. I am a celiac as well but I will find an alternative crust or not eat pizza. I thought this stuff tasted horrible. It doesn't cook right, even following the directions to a T. Maybe these other reviewers know something I don't. Bought it at a health food store for 8 bucks a bag so at least buy it off here so you can save some money.
