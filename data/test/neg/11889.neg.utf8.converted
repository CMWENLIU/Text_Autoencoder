When you buy this chocolate sauce, you have to pay an extra $11.99 (as of 1/29/10) for the pump.  If you buy it directly from Ghirardelli, you pay $1 more per bottle, and they send you a free pump with each one.  So, at least for your initial purchase, you save about $11/bottle.  As for the sauce itself, it's fine.
