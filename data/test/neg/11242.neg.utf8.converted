The ped suggested I get my 6mo old teething biscuits. I got a package of these and the barley ones yesterday. I gave him one of these. He was gumming it pretty well, with both my husband and I present. Yes, it was messy, but he liked it and seemed happy. I was keeping a pretty close eye on him. He dropped it in his lap and it got stuck, so I went to pick it up and noticed much of it was missing. I immediately looked into his mouth and saw a piece. As I started reaching for him, he had a coughing fit and inhaled it. I immediately picked him up, tipped him over, and gave a few good pats on his back which dislodged the nearly quarter sized chunk. I don't trust giving these to him any more.<br /><br />On the ad for the barley ones, a reviewer raving about the product wished to start out by telling us all how we need to supervise our children while they're trying out new foods because food is "dangerous". This may not be helpful, but.... duh, ya think? So because one person thinks these type of biscuits are the bees knees, that makes the rest of us incompetent parents? Hardly. Not only am I a parent, I have also been a healthcare professional for nearly a decade now.<br /><br />I love the company, but I don't trust these biscuits. Period. I gave it 2 stars, because my son went crazy for them and I am impressed with that. Perhaps I'll grind them up and turn it into cereal instead.
