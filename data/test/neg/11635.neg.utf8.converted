I tried the chicken flavor, hoping I could disguise the nasty flavor of pills and/or vitamin supplements. Unfortunately, my 17-year-old cat doesn't just swallow it, he chews and reveals any stuff inside. Of course, he now refuses to eat them, even empty. They're simply too large for my cat (who is no tiny thing - he has weighed between ten and 13 pounds) to swallow easily. I'm switching to gelcaps instead.
