A coworker brought a box of these into the office.  It ranks as one of the worst things I have ever put in my mouth -- and that's saying a lot.<br /><br />The first experience is not awful -- a pleasant crispiness to it, almost reminiscent of a Rice Krispies treat, but no flavor.  Oh, if only it remained flavorless.  Instead, my taste buds were assaulted with anti-flavor.  It took every ounce of self-control to not immediately spit the product onto the floor.  Overwhelming bitterness with notes of burned vegetation and industrial products flooded every synapse devoted to taste impulses.  As I chewed the flavor intensified, and the texture disintegrated into a strange, grainy pulp.  Anyone who finishes a bar must fight against their baser instincts; nothing about these bars resembles a food product in any way.<br /><br />These bars are, quite simply, not fit for animal consumption.  If I saw a person feed a Simply Bar to a starving dog, I'd call the ASPCA.  I can only hope that the other reviewers gave this product 5 stars as a cruel, well-orchestrated joke, and not as a sincere reflection of what they think food should taste like.  But what kind of person thinks that it is funny to inflict psychic pain on a person they will never meet, and whose reaction they cannot see?<br /><br />No, these reviews bear investigation; if not the criminal sort, then at least the sociological sort, where we reflect upon what we have become as a society.  The Simply Bar, if it does anything positive for us, will remind us that food should have a pleasant taste and texture, and is not simply the aggregation of its ingredient list.  Find a person you love.  Give them a Snickers.
