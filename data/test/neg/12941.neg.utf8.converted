I am very disappointed in this tea and wish I could return it.  I've brewed two pots so far "just to make sure," but this tea does not taste like Russian Caravan tea.  I went to Davidson's website and found the reason why - they apparently don't use lapsang souchong in this tea.  I understand actual Russian Caravan tea to be a combination of lapsang souchong and Assam teas.  This one claims to be a combination of Assam and Sri Lankan teas.  Typically Sri Lanka produces Ceylon teas, whereas lapsang souchong is produced in China.  At any rate, this tea does not have the strong, smokey flavor that is associated with Russian Caravan tea, and one of the previous reviewers was correct in stating that it is bitter, no matter how you brew it.  It's a real shame, too, because I was very happy that this tea is organic.
