The trap worked well when  it came with a square bait package that was fit into the back slot. The bait was changed to a square pink  piece that sticks to the inside of the trap<br /><br /> It is compltely ineffective. Moths fly all aroound the pantry. infest boxes of food, and never go near the trap. If you trap a moth in there yourself, it doesnt stick to the glue,  and flies right back out.<br /><br />I have made this known to the Safer mfg. co. as soon as they changed the bait but they have done nothing.We have wasted about $100 on these traps in the past year. Have found nothing to replace it since other companies are using the same kind of bait.
