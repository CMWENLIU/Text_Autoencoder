I'm currently doing the Jorge Cruise "low sugar/carb" diet (which works)and Matlitol is called for in some of his recipes.  Well, no where did it say that if you use it, you're likely to have stomach issues, and by issues I mean severe gas and diarrhea.  Sorry to be graphic, but better you know what you're getting yourself into before hand. It took almost 24 hours to "return to normal".<br /><br />If you have no issues with the above, give it a try, it tasted fine.  You may want to Google Matlitol side effects for more information. I will not make any more recipes that call for this.
