Amazon.com maintains that review should focus on specific features of the product, and my experience with it.  Price is an integral part of a product feature, and I think in that respect this product is terribly over-priced.  You can get the same thing offered by Amazon.com at half of this price ($20 vs. $41).  And Costco does it even better, a 12lb bag of Lundberg organic short grain brown rice costs a little less than $14.  So if you want to eat healthy, there are better options than this one.
