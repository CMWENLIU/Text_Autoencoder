I'd never buy these again.  We purchased these Nov 22nd, 2011 and the date on the bags say Best Before Oct 18, 2012.  For the past several months whenever I open a new bag, half the contents have gone bad.  They are covered with what looks like fungus or something and we end up throwing it all out(not knowing what it is).  It's too bad  because early Okay bags tasted fine.  Perhaps it's because they are unsulfured, I don't know.  They have been stored just like other dried fruits we buy, in a Pantry.  Either the Best By date is wrong or something is wrong with the processing of the dried plums.
