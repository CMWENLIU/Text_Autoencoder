i have loved this product for years, and when I saw them on sale at Amazon, I jumped and placed an order.  It si very rare for Amazon to mess something up, but they did this time.  Their shipping method reduced the cookies to shards and crumbs.  You could never serve them in that condition.  But they make a fantastic crust.<br /><br />Lets face it, on this one item, Amazon completely dropped the ball on shipping.
