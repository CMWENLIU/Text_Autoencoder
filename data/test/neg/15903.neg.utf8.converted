Paying fourteen dollars for six K-cups is ridiculous. Go to any store that sells them (Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, Kohl's, Belk, etc.) and you can get a pack of eighteen for around ten dollars. If you want a variety pack, Amazon has plenty of others at a better deal. I think the idea of a random mix of cups is interesting, but not if you're only getting six at this price.
