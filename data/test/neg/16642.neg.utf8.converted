Never thought I would see people actually buying simple syrup. They're paying $7 for sugar water.<br /><br />For $7 you can go out and buy yourself 15+ pounds of sugar and get water for free out of the tap and have all you'll ever need. Pour two parts water in a pot for every one part granulated sugar. Turn the pot on medium and stir until the sugar is dissolved, which takes maybe a few minutes if you're making a large batch. Wait for it to cool, then pour it into the container of your choice. It keeps indefinitely in the refrigerator as long as it is tightly capped.
