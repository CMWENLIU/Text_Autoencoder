This is a difficult review for me because I love the Cadbury Flake bars. However, the bars I received from Trade Concepts are stale and brittle. I thought I'd cut cost instead of having a friend send them to me.  You get what you pay for.  Instead of my tasty flakey chocolately bar, I got a flat, pale looking crumbling mess (except for the places where it had melted and fused together).  In all Flake is an excellent product.  I'd give it 4.5 stars.  But you have to be careful of the seller.  It might be better to buy them from an import gourmet food store or have someone in the UK (if you know someone) mail them to you.  I've learned my lesson.
