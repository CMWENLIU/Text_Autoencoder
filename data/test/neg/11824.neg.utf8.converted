I ordered these Monday night and received them Thursday afternoon, very quick delivery. The only ISSUE is that the product information stated 58 madeleines were in the box for [...], but when I checked there were only 44 madeleines in there. I am still trying to discuss this issue with them but I haven't heard anything yet. I feel that if your product information states a particular count, then there should be that many in there; otherwise change the product information so there won't be an issue. Very upset right now because I was charged more than what I should have been for these. We will see what they decide to do, and I will post back again.
