I bought this thinking it would be a wonderful macadamia nut flavor. Boy was I wrong. My taste may be different to most other people because of my diet, but the macadamia nuts are blended with PEANUT OIL and that is ALL that I taste, smell, and feel on my tongue. Peanut, oil, yuck. I even tried baking what I had into a dish, tried puting it on top of something to add some flavor. I still only taste, smell, and feel peanut oil. Maybe the company thinks that is ok, but in my opinion if someone is buying something niche like macadamia nut butter, it should be macadamias and maybe salt.
