We received a SodaStream for Christmas this year. I bought this variety pack so I could sample the various flavors without having to invest in a large bottle of each. I'm grateful that I bought this variety pack or my house would now be full of large bottles of disgusting flavored syrup.<br /><br />There are 6 regular flavors and 6 diet flavors. The flavor selection is good. We were so excited to try them.<br /><br />For us, the only flavor that was drinkable was the lemon-lime, which really did taste almost as good as name brand 7-Up. The orange and root beer flavors were disgusting. All of them, except the lemon-lime, left a terrible aftertaste in my mouth.<br /><br />Still, this kit was nicely packaged and the kids did have a lot of fun trying out the different flavors. I just wish they would have tasted better!
