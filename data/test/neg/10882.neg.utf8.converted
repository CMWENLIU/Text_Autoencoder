This brand does make a superior coconut milk, but Amazon buyers are always on the lookout for a good deal.  The only difference between this Lite Coconut Milk and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZSDZI">Thai Kitchen Pure Coconut Milk, 13.66-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> is water!  That being said, stretch your dollar and buy the regular version.  To cut calories and fat, add the water yourself.
