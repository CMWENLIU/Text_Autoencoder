Increase in vitality, energy, stamina etc. were promised but to date, after taking the product for a month as directed, I haven't seen any change in my general health or fitness. Either "Salba Super Grain" is a total hoax or I'm just so healthy that I couldn't get any better!<br />I would not recommend the product to anyone except maybe Cheyney and his silly sidekick.
