These are rice crackers and not very good ones. There are many other brands of rice crackers that are really moist and flavourful from Japan. If I had Celiacs disease I might consider having these around but you can't serve these to guests without a lot of explaining and some really sharp cheese. Be wary of making a 12 box commitment. Also these crackers come in a bag which means between 10%-25% are broken and they cannot be resealed which means they go flat very quickly. If you bought these and don't know what to do with them try opening the box and leaving it in the bathroom when you shower, it reduces the choking hazard. If you still can't adjust put them in a Zip-Lock and use them as packing material.
