I love Celestial Seasonings rooibos based teas--in particular their Madagascar Vanilla Red, and Moroccan Pomegranate.  Red Safari Spice tries to do too many things and creates a busy blend that did not grab me. The combination of fruit and spice was just not tasty--and I am not a fan of banana flavoring in tea.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box: "In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous."  Aristotle.
