It's hard for any cookie to be considered truly bad (to me, at least), so the question becomes "is it worth the calories?" Sadly, the Lazy Day Dark Chocolate Ginger Cookies don't clear this hurdle for me, though in fairness I'm not gluten intolerant, and these cookies may be ideal for someone who is.<br /><br />Like another reviewer noted, the cookies don't fare well in a hot mailbox (which isn't their fault, but did result in the cookies being welded together by melted chocolate). The cookies have a somewhat soft and chewy texture, and each has a half-dip of dark chocolate. Unfortunately, there's not enough ginger in these cookies for me to have identified them as "ginger" in any way without the label. Overall, the impressions I got were simply "soft and sweet" - and, in fact, TOO sweet.<br /><br />Considering their rather steep price, I'd pass on these in the future...though as I said, if it's really hard to find gluten-free cookies these might be worthwhile for someone who has more restricted dietary choices than I do.
