I picked up a box of this GoodEarth Caffeine Free Original tea at a discount store lately. I drank several cups. I was really impressed by the intensity of the flavor. How could it be so sweet with no sugar? If you look at the packaging it "looks" natural and healthy, but then read the ingredients - number three is "ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR." Considering that the order of the ingredient listing indicates relative percentage of contents, a significant portion of this tea is "Artifical Flavor." Which means what? What the heck is it made of? Who knows - this stuff is getting tossed in the trash and I'll never trust GoodEarth again. By the way, this is manufactured by Tata Enterprises out of India - you might want to do some research about them.
