I just ordered this product and from what I can tell, its not organic chicken. It doesn't say organic on the packaging or in the ingredients list.<br /><br />NOT ORGANIC: The reason I purchased this product is because I thought it would be organic. It is important to me to feed my dogs foods that aren't pumped with hormones and preservatives. Additionally, I choose organic as a animal lover in the hopes that animals raised to be organic are typically given a better quality of life.<br /><br />GARLIC IS AN INGREDIENT: Look at any "Toxic to Dogs" food list, and you find garlic on that list. The toxic level for a dog is large; however I have no idea how much garlic is in these treats. I was looking for something that I could feed my dogs on a regular basis as a training reward...and I can't do that in good conscience not knowing the long term effects of regulary ingestion of the garlic in these treats.<br /><br />Only good note is that my dogs do love these treats, but they also love all kinds of other treats that I as their human care taker know better than to give them.
