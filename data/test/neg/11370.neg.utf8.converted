FYI Gluten-Intolerant Folks! This product contains Rye and Barley which contain gluten. The package states that the gluten is removed in the processing, but my personal experience drinking this doesn't support that claim. I am gluten-intolerant, and I reacted to Dandy Blend as if I had ingested gluten. Too bad, because it is pleasant-tasting and a nice coffee substitute!
