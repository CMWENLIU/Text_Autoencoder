I saw that the price advertised for the "Subscribe and Save" was $6.79($0.35/oz).  Since that was a good deal I ordered it.  After I placed the order I did the math on my own and realized that it is actually $.43 per oz.  If I would have done the math before, I would not have placed the order.  I am very disappointed that the would lie about the price.
