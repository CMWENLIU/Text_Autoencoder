These are not cookies, they're crackers, crackers with chocolate in them.<br /><br />Imagine a Ritz cracker without salt and chocalate cream on it and that is exactly what these tastes like. I've tried them with milk and they still taste bad.<br /><br />I'll try to find someone to give them too but if I can't I'll just throw the whole box in the trash.
