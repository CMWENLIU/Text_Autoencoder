Pros: low carb, seaweed nutrition.<br /><br />Cons: thin as paper cannot be used as chip substitute, horrid-horrid fish taste.<br /><br />After eating through 75% of 1 package I became violently ill and spent the day vomiting. Either I am intolerant of something in these (not likely eat seaweed often) or I got a bad package... Seriously, my body clenches when I think of the horror of these things.<br /><br />I am NOT a picky eater, but these are inedible in my opinion.
