I read the box at the store and it said "low sodium soy sauce".  I can't imagine how the regular soy sauce would have tasted.  I only used half of the sauce packet and I still thought my face was going to explode.  It is just unbelievably salty.  Of course, if I had read the nutrition facts carefully, I would have noticed the 980mg of sodium.  980!
