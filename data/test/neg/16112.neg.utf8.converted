Nowhere on the Amazon page does it say that this stuff is pasteurized.<br /><br />The whole point of kombucha is its probiotic properties. Pasteurizing eliminates those properties.<br /><br />Therefore, this stuff is BOGUS. If you want kombucha, get real kombucha, = some kind that isn't pasteurized.<br /><br />Shame on them for even calling it kombucha.
