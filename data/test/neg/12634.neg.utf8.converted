Tried the Turducken this year. I was very disappointed. The bird doesn't stay together like the photos you see. After it's cooked, you don't know to slice or scoop out the bird. There was very little turkey meat on the outside and the inside had more rice than duck or sausage. Plus, it was dry. There were no juices when I cooked it. Luckily, we also cooked a traditional turkey which fed everyone. After all said and done, after $110, the Turducken was stuffing.  I will never buy again.
