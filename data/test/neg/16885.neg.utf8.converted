Since Costco don't have this product, I decided to buy from Amazon in order to ship to the military.  This cooked quinoa tasted TERRIBLE (sour & salty or something....!), why using 10% salt...?  I prefer to cook the fresh quinoa made by "Bob's Red Mill Organic Grain Quinoa" from Costco, it is very delicious.  Costco Cooked Brown Rice (6 packs) made by [...] is very delicious and cost only $6.99.  This cooked quinoa(12 packs) from the same company cost $20.31...!!!  I NEVER take a chance buying the grocery online again...What is the RETURN POLICY..???<br />Well, this cooked quinoa has to donate to Waste Management Landfill...<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003U35BQC">gogo rice Organic Quinoa, 4.2-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a>
