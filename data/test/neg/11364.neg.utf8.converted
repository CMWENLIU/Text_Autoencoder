The Kahlua K-Cup smells excellent freshly made out of the Keurig. The taste is a different story...it is really a lousy tasting coffee. It is drinkable, but that is about it. I would not recommend it, or ever purchase it again. In fact, I would never drink it if it was given to me for free. It received one star from me because I could drink it if I had to. I would advise that you taste a single K-Cup if you can, before you waste your money on a box of it. By the way...I love real Kahula in coffee. Good luck.
