Amazon is incorrectly advertising this product as "gluten free".  The first ingredient of this product is Durum Semolina, which is well known for having the highest gluten content of all wheat products.<br /><br />So, Celiacs and people with gluten-allergies, DO NOT ORDER THIS!  This pasta will only make you sick!!!!
