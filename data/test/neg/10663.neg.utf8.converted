These are the first treats I had purchased for our new puppy after reading several reviews on Amazon.  He'd only been home a few days and we were trying to reward him for going potty outside - these treats were completely counteractive.  The first night after starting the treats, his stools became very runny and he made many messes in the house.  We continued to give him the treats for another three days as we didn't realize the connection - his stools hardened the day after we stopped using these treats and he can now hold it and go outside!  He's been doing MUCH better on other puppy treats (went to PetCo for them) and I'm so thankful the runny poo messes are no longer a threat to my barefoot family.<br />Puppy is a 10 week old Staffordshire Terrier.
