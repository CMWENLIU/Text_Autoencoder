I purchased this thinking "the Italians are good with food, this should be delicious."  If you know anything about food, it looses its nutrition the more it's cooked.  This product comes pre-cooked, par-boiled.  Black rice is a rich, nutty, food that is so filling it's like a whole meal.  Foodies love it because it balance out the usual plate of protein, vegetables, and starch with flavorful starch.  It can be eaten alone, with milk as a breakfast, with beans in the forest or as a centerpiece of exotic meal.<br />However, the reason we love this stuff is because it's high in vitamins.  Not this stuff.  Par-boiling then drying it out destroys much of the vitamins and flavor.<br /><br />Stay far, far away if you want vitamins and flavor.
