We really loved the first batch. The dried cherries tasted organic and fresh. So we ordered second box and found it was shipped from a different farm because the inner package was different. Their product was loaded with SUGAR and tasted artificial and cheap. We are very reluctant to purchase any more from this company because of the inconsistency of the product!
