I tried this product because it has a lot of things I like and routinely use in it: shea, argan, almond oil, and I am always looking for natural, plant-based products.  It might well make your hair shiny, because it doesn't come out (I have washed my hair twice now... and am off for a third round :(<br /><br />I was a bit skeptical when I put it on, as it has the consistency of wax mixed with petroleum oil.  Thick, so thick it is difficult to apply evenly (or in a thin layer).  It does smell nice, I will give it that, so- there's the 1 star (I could not give it a zero).<br /><br />I used this after I washed my hair last night and it felt greasy, so I washed it again.  It didn't come out.  I washed it again, and went to sleep.  In just a few minutes, I will be washing it again :(  :( and hoping that I can get it out this time, and that it did not ruin the sheets.<br /><br />Consider this review not so much a recommendation as a warning.<br /><br />______________________________________________________________________<br />update: I have now washed my hair 4 times and have not been able to get it all out :( It feels greasy, damp & heavy,  and is getting all over my clothing , sheets.  I would say that this is singularly one of the worst products I have ever used.  I would not even recommend a trial, unless you are willing to live with it.<br /><br />Because of all the nourishing oils, and the consistency, it might make a nice furniture or (wood) floor polish, but unless you like the greaser look, I would not put it on your hair (and am hoping a third wash will get it out of mine).<br /><br />It even made my dog mad! He usually gets walked before I get in the shower, but today he just has to wait.<br />___________________________________________________________________________<br />some hours later... after 6 shampoos (twice by my hair dresser, I came home & tried her recommendation:  Liquid Joy.  Two rises with dish soap got most of it out.  This is being posted for those who tried it and feel like the only way to get it off is to shave their heads (my stylist actually suggested that- laughing :P  If you have not tried it... think seriously about what you are getting yourself into.<br /><br />I read some of the other reviews and it seems maybe it's good for some people with different hair, different issues.  I wish the manufacturer were honest and said that!  I liked my hair before I used this stuff.  Now... I just hope I can get the last of it out.
