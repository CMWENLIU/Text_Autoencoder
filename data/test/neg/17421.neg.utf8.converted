After I saw the long list of glowing reviews I decided to try a box of these. I miss my days of cracker eating before becoming gluten free. After I tried them I can only scratch my head in wonder. I don't get it. I didn't enjoy them at all, and I couldn't even bring myself to tolerate them with cheese on top. I'm sorry, they really do taste like dirt and they are so hard that you could probably break one in half and shave with it.
