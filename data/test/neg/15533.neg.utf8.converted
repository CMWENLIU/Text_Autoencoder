So PG Tips Special Blend was an excellent bagged tea. So excellent that the think tank at PG Tips / Unilever decided to discontinue it. They claim this blend is the replacement. The Strong One is a worthless brew if you ask me. PG Tips Special Blend was an excellent tea this replacement is terrible (undrinkable). If anyone at PG Tips is listening please consider reintroducing Special Blend - remember what happened to the new Coke? If it isn't broke don't fix it.
