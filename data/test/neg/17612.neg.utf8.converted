Now, addmitingly one of my cats, my youngest had no problem with this. My middle cat (3 years) put on 2 pounds in a month! (she was healthy way before) my 19 pound cat developed diarhea and refused to groom herself. The light had come out of her eyes! It was so despressing, it maybe good food but its not for my babies. I stopped feeding it immediately and switched to chicken soup with much better results.<br /><br />Yes, its grain free, which can be agrued is 'better' but it has added fat/protein, which is what the vet said put the extra weight on my middle cat. Maybe its a quality cat food but, its not for me. I donated the rest of the bag (about 10lbs) to a shelter.
