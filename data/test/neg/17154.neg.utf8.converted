As other people have stated, you will not receive this product, you will receive "React 2" - a different flavor!  I love this gum, I chew it all the time and thought I was so clever buying it online in bulk since stores seem to only carry it some of the time.  But I was disappointed to open my package and find a box full of packs of the wrong flavor.  I understand that the packaging and name are very similar, but really Amazon?  Doesn't it fall under false advertising to order one product and receive another, especially when React 2 has its own product page?  I guess I won't order Wheat Thins on Amazon for fear of receiving Triscuits instead...<br /><br />What this isn't, yet what you will receive: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YZ4LN0">Wrigley's Gum 5 -  React Fruit 2, 1.76-Ounce Packages (Pack of 10)</a>
