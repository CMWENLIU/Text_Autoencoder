No where near the quality of the original made in Germany Melitta. This cheap imitation is ill executed junk. To top it off they did such a poor packing job and I received the product with the handle broken clear off. The quality is so bad that the lid does not even fit on (too big) and the glaze was applied so sloppily that you can see it running down the side. This is a far far cry from the elegant quality original German Made Melitta drop coffeemaker.<br /><br />Melitta needs to find a new more competent supplier. The should hire Americans or Germans to produce a quality product.
