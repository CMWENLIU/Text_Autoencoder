I have always enjoyed Orville Redenbacher brand popcorns, whether it is SmartPop or Natural or Sweet & Savory type. And with such past experiences, I went ahead and bought this particular popcorn (Pop-Up Bowl Butter Microwave Popcorn), even though this particular product is way more expensive than the bag version.<br /><br />First impression: Packaging looks great and the illustration on the box lures you to try it at once as soon as you look at the box.<br /><br />Cooking: I used my Sharp microwave 1200 W, 1.2 cubic feet of sheer raw cooking power. Even though my microwave has sensor based cooking feature for popcorn and other food items, I set the microwave timer to 2 minutes and 30 seconds, so as to not leave anything to chance. Instructions on the pack are very clear about up & down side markings, cooking time, handling instructions etc. After cooking for 2 & 1/2 minutes, I carefully removed the popcorn bowl (as it miraculously transforms itself into).<br />Now comes the little tricky part. Instruction on the bowl clearly indicates how to handle the bowl and how to remove the top plastic off the bowl, so as to dig in and help yourself with the buttery popcorn. So I tried opening the bowl by pulling the plastic from one side, but to no avail. So I tried the other side with more frustration and no better result. I contemplated using a scissor to cut the plastic open, but then I would have to clean the scissor, since all the residual butter would be transferred to the scissor creating a mess. I was surprised that all this hype and commercial about bowl popcorn really amounts to such bad packaging. Then, I forcefully pried open the plastic and got hot residual vapors on my fingers. Boy, what a scalding experience it was!! But I endured the agony so as to try this new popcorn.<br /><br />Taste: Popcorn kernels were large and uniform, and so were popped popcorn. It smelled very buttery, very aromatic indeed. They were crunchy, buttery and crisp. However, I could not have distinguished this final product from the regular Orville Redenbacher popcorns from regular paper bags.<br /><br />Conclusion: If this product tastes the same as regular same brand paper bag product, why am I spending 3 times more money to buy this item? So that I could just eat from a bowl instead of a paper bag? Now I am not a dodo and neither are regular Amazon customers looking for a better bang for their buck, so then what on the earth would make one shell out more money? I am amazed at the marketing department at work here. Do they really think that giving people bowl instead of a paper bag would somehow cast a Harry Potter like spell on us and force us to buy this product on a regular basis? Well guess again marketing guys, as far as I am concerned, No Popcorn Bowl for me. If you like the idea of eating your popcorn from a paper bowl, and if you are willing to put up with the inconvenience and mess and higher price, then this is the product for you.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Clear instructions<br />2) Tempting packaging<br />3) Giant uniform popcorn<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) EXPENSIVE<br />2) No easy way to tear apart the plastic top off the final popcorn bowl<br />3) Did I mention EXPENSIVE
