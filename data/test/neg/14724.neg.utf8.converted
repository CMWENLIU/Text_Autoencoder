I don't know from what planet these guys are from but the honey arrives in tiny jars that are not even sealed... and the lid comes of very easy (just to make things worse). As far as I am concerned, they can put inside whatever they want - there is no way to prove that the contents is the intended one or if it ever was in France (as they claim). 100% pure junk!<br /><br />As the jars are not even sealed, they might add poison as well or spit in your honey - just for the kicks of it! Why would anyone in his right mind expose him/herself or the family to such low class, dangerous product?!
