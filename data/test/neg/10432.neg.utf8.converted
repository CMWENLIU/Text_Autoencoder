NEVER buy Pedigree. I made a huge mistake trying this. It has the nutritional value of a cardboard box. It's full of corn and by-products. Your dog deserves better than this. If I could give Pedigree a -0, I would. My dog's coat is softer and shinier and she's much more energetic on another brand. There's dog food info all over the NET. Please, steer clear of the ugly Pedigree.
