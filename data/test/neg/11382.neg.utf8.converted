As you can tell just by the picture of the cereal, this stuff contains enough sugar to wipe out an entire village of diabetics. So unless you want to be another victim of Mary Poppins' misinforming ways, steer clear of this. That being said, I expected a lot more out of this cereal aside from the usual great cereal marshmallows. That's all this stuff has going for it! It's too bad, since Fruity Pebbles is easily one of my top 10 cereals, and I was hoping this would be at least somewhere in the same ballpark as those. Nope, not even close.<br /><br />The marshmallows are what you'd expect- the same kind like in Lucky Charms. But the pebbles portion of the cereal looks like hamster pellet food. Seriously, pouring it into my bowl, I frowned and wondered what I was getting myself into. But after I poured the milk, I was debating on if I should dump it down the drain. Not one to waste food, I took on the bowl, and was disgusted by the texture of the pebbles in my mouth. These things get soggy FAST. Unless the free prize inside each box was a twenty dollar bill, I'm not going back for more.<br /><br />If you need marshmallows in your cereal, stick with good ol' Lucky Charms or one of the knock-offs. Don't fall for poor Fred, who obviously doesn't look that thrilled on the box about what he's holding. You just know that off to the side, someone's got a gun pointed at his head.
