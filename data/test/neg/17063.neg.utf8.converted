I mostly don't like green olives because they are too bitter or too salty. However, Castlevetrano oilves are different. I've first purchased Castlevetrano olives from the olive bar at my local Whole Foods store. I was impressed by the bright color, the minimal amount of saltyness, the minimal amount of bitterness, and the buttery flavor of the Castlevetrano olives that I found at Whole Foods.  The Partanna Castlevetrano olives (reviewed here) were *NOT* as buttery as the Castlevetrano olives that I bought at Whole Foods store.  The Partanna olives taste like they are packed in vinegar, but vinegar is not on the list of ingredients.  These olives are not cheap and I would *NOT* buy the Partanna Castlevetrano oilves again because they don't taste as good as other Castlevetrano olives I've bought elsewhere.
