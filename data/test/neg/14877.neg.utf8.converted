I love pretty much every tomato soup I've ever tried & like the Dr McDougall's brand, so this should have been a no-brainer. The first issue I had was with the smell, which was hinting at being rancid. I heated it and tried it, though, but the taste was no better. It tasted burnt and had no tomato-y flavor. I opened another one and ...same smell, so I threw them all out. Maybe I got a bad batch, but buyer beware.
