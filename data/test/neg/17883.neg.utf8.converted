I ordered 2 cans on Amazon.com with this vendor because S&H was free. Please STAY AWAY from this INDIRECT VENDOR: Amazon does neither  store nor ship the product. The cans arrived both badly bashed in from Phoenix AZ, although the well-packed box containing them showed NO damage whatsoever. The vendor had knowingly shipped damaged products.<br />I gave a 1 star rating solely to alert customers not to order from this vendor. The Marron spread, of course, is always 5 star: same great taste and same iconic label as decades ago! Yes, it is the flavor of my childhood!<br />Subsequently, I ordered product from Lepicerie.com  ("The grocery store" in French) where a 6-pack (same net weight per can) cost me a little over $8.00 per can INCLUDING S&H. I returned the damaged cans using Amazon's free shipping label. As always Amazon provides excellent customer service.
