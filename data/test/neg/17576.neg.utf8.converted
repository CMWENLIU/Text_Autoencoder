I bought these instead of chef boyardee trying to have a "healthy" late-night college dorm snack, but I really can't stand the taste. Unfortunately, if you are looking for a Chef Boyardee alternative, you will be disappointed. These are healthier but still not an alternative due to the disgusting sweet tomato sauce (if you can even call it tomato sauce). It's so sweet that it tastes like bland ketchup.<br /><br />The remaining 11 cans of my pack are going to be donated at the next canned food drive.
