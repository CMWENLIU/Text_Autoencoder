We began feeding our 10 week old German Shepherd puppy Blue Buffalo Large Breed Puppy food, transitioning her from Purina very slowly over the course of several weeks.  Initally she seemed to do fine but then began getting very loose stools. We couldn't even pick up after her.  It was terrible. We took her to the vet for tests, added pumpkin to her diet, vet gave her probiotics, nothing seemed to help. After about 6 weeks of this (and working unsuccessfully with my vet to find a solution)I switched foods.  In about 3 days her stools were nice and solid.  While the ingredients in Blue look good on paper , it just wasn't good for her digestive system.  Now feeding California Natural Lamb and Rice Puppy and she's doing great on it.
