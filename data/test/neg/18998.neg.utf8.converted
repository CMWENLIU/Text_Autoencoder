Well when I recieved my order it was liquid, understandable because of the heat. I originally bought this for weight loss it has given me a little more energy, enough for me to start exercising again, however I gained 3 lbs that I had just previously lost before taking this. So that was upsetting. The funny thing is I only take like a teaspoon in the morning with my coffee. So if anyone is reading this, can you please let me know if I am wasting my time trying to loose weight with this or if it's normal to gain weight first before you loose it? I have only been taking it a week. I have tried to use it as a moisturizer as well, it does absorb nicely after 5 minutes but my fine lines are more noticeable. Any suggestions?
