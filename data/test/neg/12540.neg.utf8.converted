I was happy to find this vegan alternative to powdered coffee creamers. Sadly, when I tried it the taste was quite unpleasant. I even gave it another shot in a second cup of coffee later that day, but by then the disgusting smell was such a turn-off that I couldn't even gulp it down. Looks like it's back to refrigerated non-dairy creamers for me. I am also frustrated that I had to buy this product in a two-pack--what a rip-off!
