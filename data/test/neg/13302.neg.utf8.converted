I've ordered about 2 boxes a month of these cherries over the past few years and up until the last shipment (a few weeks ago), they have been excellent. Now, the latest shipments have lacked the quality that they once had. They are now smaller and the taste has changed for the worse. As I eat the dried cherries as a standalone snack, the taste is extremely important! It's very unfortunate that Traverse Bay has changed this and I will no longer be ordering them if this wasn't just a one time difference!
