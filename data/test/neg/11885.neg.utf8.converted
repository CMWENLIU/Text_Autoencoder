I purchased this product with a new set of electric salt and pepper grinders<br />(which were great).  When I opened this salt is seemed "wet" and when I put it<br />in the grinder it would not work because it would not fall into the grinding<br />area unless the grinder was bumped or shaken.  The salt tasted ok and I will<br />use it for cooking, but it will not work in a grinder.
