My wife and I drank nothing but the Timothy's 2fer 24 pack decaf from Amazon and it was fantastic coffee.  We just received and tried the new light colored fifty pack boxes (that now have no expiration date).  The coffee was horrible.  It tasted like it was ground years ago and left to air dry.  Please return the sealed, date on box, FRESH coffee!!
