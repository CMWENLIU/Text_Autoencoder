So the Almond Butters that I've had and grown to love have an almond taste.  This is really just peanut butter.  As in if I gave you a spoon of this and a spoon of Jiff, you wouldn't be able to tell me which was which.  If you're allergic to peanuts but love PB&J's then this may be a heaven send.  If you're looking for almond butter... keep looking.<br /><br />So the above, would normally leave me with a 3-star review... but when the package arrived all three jars were really oily on the outside.  Like, I can't wash these clean and don't want to touch them oily or put them on my counter oily.  Additionally, when I opened one of them, I saw the small container was half full (I'd say close to 40% full).<br /><br />For $6 a jar this just isn't worth buying unless as I stated above you are allergic to peanuts and looking for your PB fix.  But if that's the case... I'd say get this for sure but be prepared to scoop the contents into another container.
