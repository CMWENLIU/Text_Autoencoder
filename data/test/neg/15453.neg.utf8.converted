Kellogg's Pop Tarts are a good source of GMOs! They hit a home run here with 4 out of the 5 biggest GMOs in these products. Kellogg's just spent $632,500 on propaganda in California because they don't want you to know that Pop Tarts (and their other products) contain ingredients which are patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab and turned them into EPA registered pesticides. That's right, folks... the corn and cottonseed oil in these Pop Tarts comes from GMOs that are registered with the EPA because every cell of the plant makes it's own pesticide. When the insects bite into it, their stomachs rupture. We can only guess what happens when kids eat this stuff. The toxins have been linked to cell membrane death in humans... and have been found in the blood of 93% of pregnant women and 80% of their unborn babies in a recent study.  Pop Tarts also contain GMO sugar and GMO soy. Both (AND the corn and cottonseed) have been engineered to withstand heavy doses of RoundUp. Glyphosate, the active chemical ingredient in RoundUp, has been linked to birth defects, organ damage, inflammatory bowel disorders, cancer and who knows what else. GMO soy caused sterility by the 3rd generation in two studies done on lab animals. I wouldn't feed this stuff to my pets. It hasn't been subjected to long term peer reviewed studies to prove that it's safe. Kellogg is fighting against labeling of GMOs in California. It's no wonder why! My family does not eat EPA registered pesticides. We are saying NO to Kellogg's GMOs.
