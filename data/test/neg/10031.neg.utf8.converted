I totally agree with those expressing their requests for more ingredient information.  There are so many gluten-free products on the market now because it's "popular" to do so and bucks can be made.  I recently opened a wheat-free, gluten-free bakery because most commercial products take short-cuts and include ingredients which should not be combined, even if they are wheat-free & gluten-free.  Also, most commercial gluten-free products contain a ton of sugar.  Please be very selective and pay attention to how your body responds - you can learn to do that even before you eat something.
