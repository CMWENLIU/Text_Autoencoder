I was so excited to try this based on the other review here but to my disappointed surprise, this is just terrible tasting jelly.  It MUST be an acquired taste. Several of my coworkers tried it too, because I thought I would just give it to someone, and not a single one liked it. Four of us tried it and one described it as like walking into a room recently sprayed rose scented air freshener and getting choked up on it. Definitely do not recommend.
