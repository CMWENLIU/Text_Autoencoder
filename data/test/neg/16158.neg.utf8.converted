There was just a news item that several shipments of Cento "San Marzano" tomatoes were impounded in Naples, Italy before being exported, because they were fake.  I don't feel like overpaying for some regular Italian peeled tomatoes just because someone cheats and puts a "San Marzano" label on them. They probably weren't even "organic".
