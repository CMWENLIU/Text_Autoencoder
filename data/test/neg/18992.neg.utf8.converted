I got the Skinny Girl margarita and was so pleasantly surprised I couldn't wait to try another offering from them. I love cosmos so I bought this one next. I kinda thought the idea of a white cosmo was kinda lame but whatever. Well, it's gross. It taste like a seriously watered down originally not so delicious cosmo. Not sure how i'll even finish the bottle of this, it really is so lame.
