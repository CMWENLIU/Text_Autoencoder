based on reviews and ingredients ordered this food to change out with wellness food, my 9 yr old cat developed stones in his bladder. he underwent surgery this past Tuesday. It will be a long touph recovery for him.  he never had this problem until I mixed this food into his diet.  it could be a coincidence but I think it is strange this happened about 1 month after starting this food. His stones have been sent to the lab to see what caused them from his diet.  Anyhow the food does look good, just might not have worked for my little guy.
