I actually love this product. Because I can't have sugar, I have to seek out products like Barbara's sugar free/fruit only fig/blueberry bars.<br /><br />The only problem is that the expiration date on this product was Jan 9 2008, and this product was sent to me in March 2008.  When I asked for another batch with a later expiration date, I was sent another 6 boxes<br />in April with the same Jan 9 2008 date.<br /><br />Get with it Amazon, that's not okay..... The product gets noticably goey<br />and is not a firm cookie past the expiration date.  I really wanted this<br />product, but had to ask for my money back due to this expiration date problem.  Amazon gave me a $10 coupon for other Amazon products,<br />but no cookies. Oh well, I guess I'll loose a few pounds....
