My review is 'don't bother.'<br /><br />I put this on my wish list after seeing it on (I think) the 'Cool Tools' website. I wish I would have read Joseph Rukaj's review so I would not have received the 'almost right' size as I prefer the Trader Joe's PB. Regardless, I have sufficient hand strength to hold it securely during use but, I still need to finish mixing the PB with a knife, spoon, spatula, whatever, like before because the peanut butter is merely 'stirred,' not really mixed.<br /><br />What use is a tool that requires you to finish the job with the tool you bought the first tool to replace? Clever doesn't count for much if it doesn't solve the problem. I'd return it if I could.
