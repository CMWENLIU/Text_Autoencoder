Please do the research before choosing a formula. When my daughter was first born I used Earth's Best. Not being able to breastfeed I wanted to ensure she was getting the best formula possible. Imagine my surprise and horror after discovering the methods they use to extract this supposed healthy DHA and ARA. Hexane is highly toxic. It's a gimmick used to move product. Once I switched I knew I made the right choice, and my daughter did much better with this on top of it.
