I was very disappointed with this product.  It is mostly sugar syrup with some raspberry flavoring (15%).  The raspberry taste is very weak, being overwhelmed by the lemon and other berry flavor.  Another brand that I ended up purchasing as a replacement was far better, but I admit it cost a lot more. I wish the ingredients had been viewable before receiving it (at least I couldn't find a link to see what the ingredients were). Perhaps the bottle that I got was too old, though the date on it says 02/2011.
