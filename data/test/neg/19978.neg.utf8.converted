I ordered this product almost 2 months ago. The order came as 2 packages. The first package I opened was fantastic, Loved it. Yesterday I opened the second package and it's infested with worms that produced web like silks. I've been trying to find a way to contact Amazon to have this package replaced and I can't. It not a returnable item!
