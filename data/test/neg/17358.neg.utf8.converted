I read that chicken jerky from China is dangerous for dogs so I was looking for another treat they would eat.  This was not one of them.  It didn't matter how hungry they got, they wouldn't eat these.  They sat on the floor two days.  I picked them up, threw them away and then tried again a few days later with fresh treats.  I left them in their treat spots.  They sat there for days.  They would not eat them.  It doesn't help if they were made in America but my dogs find them unpalatable.
