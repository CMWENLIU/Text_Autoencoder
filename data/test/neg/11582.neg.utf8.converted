Honestly, with the hype on this product right now I expected a lot.<br /><br />I'm a chocolate fan and this cereal looks great in the commercial and on the box. They did a great job advertising it because I bought it, but I won't again unless I decide to try the original version. The cereal has an awful texture and loses a lot of flavor in milk. It seems to be instantly soft and soggy.<br /><br />I was prepared to give it one star and then I saw some reviews that suggested to try it dry. I did and it has a good taste and texture dry which earned it another star.<br /><br />Honestly I can't see why this made it to stores. There should have been improvements made before this was released, could have been great and ended up below average.
