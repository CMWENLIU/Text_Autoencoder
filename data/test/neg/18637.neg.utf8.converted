I'm a big fan of Quinoa pasta, but I was not satisfied with this particular product.  The three colors cooked at different rates so you were left with some hard, and some completely soggy pasta on the same plate.<br /><br />I had 3 boxes left, so I sorted them by color.  This works, but it's a pain to do.  I definitely would not buy again.
