Imagine ordering chocolate that is supposed to be from England and receiving chocolate wrapped in paper with Pakistani language(Urdu)all over it. Yes, it contained English translation but I didn't order candy from Pakistan. I ordered candy from England thru Trade Concepts. The candy is rather stale and old and tasted like cheap milk chocolate. If this indeed comes from England, why do the wrappers indicate they are from Pakistan?<br />I also ordered the "Flake" These too are from Pakistan. The center is not flaky or crunchy or crumbly but rather stale and old.<br /> Because of the Urdo language all over the wrappers, I can only assume that perhaps Trade Concepts imports from England, removes the wrapper and then rewraps them in their own wrappers? I'm sure the FDA would be interested in this practice.<br />This review refers to the seller Trade Concepts
