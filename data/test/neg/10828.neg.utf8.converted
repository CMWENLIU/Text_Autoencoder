I loved Fralinger's as a kid, but this just doesn't taste the same. It's gooier (sp?) for one thing, and the flavors seem terribly artificial now. So gooey, in fact, that when left at room temperature it's almost impossible to separate the taffy from the wax paper wrapper. I wind up keeping mine in the freezer and taking them out a few minutes before I want a taffy. Of course, that's probably good for the waistline, but it's a bit of a disappointment overall.<br /><br />On another note, I can't help noticing the over-abundance of licorice flavored taffies in my bag. Ick.
