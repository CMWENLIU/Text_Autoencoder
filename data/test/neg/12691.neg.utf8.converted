Based upon other reviews here, I gambled and bought these.  Yuk!!  These are the most awful-tasting gummies ever.  They have a strong chemical odor and taste.  Now I'm stuck with 10 pounds of them...  Total waste of money. I hate to just throw them away, but I'll never eat them.  The Haribo gummi bears are far, far superior to these.  Even the made-in-USA Haribo gummi bears that they sell here on Amazon in 5-lb bags.  (The Haribo gummi bears - "goldbaren" - made in Germany are even better than the USA-made ones, but they're considerably more expensive.  Haribo Germany also makes some fruit-juice goldbaren, called "Saftbaren" which are slightly softer and have exquisite real-fruit flavor.  I wish they sold those here on Amazon...)
