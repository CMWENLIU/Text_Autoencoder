The Everlasting Treat Ball is a great concept but poorly executed. The Everlasting Treat end caps come off very easily with a minimum amount of slobber. My puppy would lick them (because I'm sure they taste great) and within 5 minutes, the caps were off of the ball. The soft rubber makes it very easy to get them out this way. And they're a little too expensive to be made so poorly.<br /><br />My puppy loves to chew the ball to get any inner treats and food out, but there are better products on the market for that. Very disappointing product.
