I loved the taste of this organic soymilk and enjoyed it<br />until I drink one that smells off. When I realized there was something wrong with the taste and smell,<br />it was too late because I already drank with straw....<br />I was breastfeeding my newborn baby and I had to skip next feeding because I didn't want my baby to drink something wrong.<br /><br />If you want to give it to your child,<br />you'd be better taste or smell it before you hand it over.<br /><br />I feel terrible since I have 3 boxes(pack of 27*3, ordered too much...) left. If I can, I'd like to return it and buy another refrigerated soymilk.
