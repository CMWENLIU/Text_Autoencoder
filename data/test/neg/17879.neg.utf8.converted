THIS SO CALLED COFFEE IS JUST AWFUL!! IT IS BITTER AND DOESN'T EVEN TASTE LIKE THE FLAVORS THEY ARE DESCRIBED AS. AMAZON SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THIS RETURN AND REFUNDED MY MONEY AS ANY OTHER COMPANY WHO WANTS TO KEEP YOUR BUSINESS WOULD DO. GREEN MOUNTAIN COFFEE IS A WONDERFUL COMPANY. THEIR CAFE EXPRESS GIVES YOU FREE SHIPPING AND 2 FREE BOXES OF K-CUPS WITH YOUR FIRST ORDER. IF YOU DON'T LIKE SOMETHING JUST TELL THEM AND KEEP YOUR ITEMS. THEY WILL REFUND YOUR MONEY OR SEND YOU A REPLACEMENT. THEIR COFFEE IS 100% BETTER THAN THIS FAKE FLAVORED COFFEE!!!
