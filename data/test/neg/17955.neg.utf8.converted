Looking for an alternative for Splenda, I found Truvia in my local grocery store. Truvia is granular like sugar, sweetens well, and even causes Strawberries to produce Juice--something that Splenda, Equal and others do not do.<br /><br />So I searched for Truvia on Amazon and found this product as well. I ordered a box and just tried it. Yuck! It is a fine powder, not a granular substance; the packets are very tiny and hold very little substance. It is difficult to dispense over a quantity of food (like a bowl of Strawberries), and gives the food a bitter taste like Saccharine.<br /><br />I'll be heading to the store for Truvia soon!
