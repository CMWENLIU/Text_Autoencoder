I bought this based on the Coffee-Mate brand name, and some good reviews here on Amazon.  So tonight I decided to give it a try in my best coffee mug.<br /><br />This Italian Sweet flavored Coffee-Mate has a strong artificial and chemical taste.  I like the standard unflavored Coffee-Mate, and will stick to that in the future.<br /><br />My mistake was not trying one container of this stuff in the supermarket first.  Come to think of it, I've never seen it sold there.
