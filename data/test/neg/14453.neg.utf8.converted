I lived in New England for 26 years and have eaten more than my fair share of lobster bisque. It's one of my favorites.<br /><br />The stuff that came out of the can is very dark orange-colored which is not typical for lobster bisque, devoid of any flavor, and just plain gross. It could not be eaten out of the can because of the dreadful flavor. There is no cream in this soup and any bisque is heavy with cream. There's milk, wheat flour, and teeny dots of lobster. I'm a good cook but I doubt that I can doctor this up to taste like anything worth eating.<br /><br />When I read the other negative reviews, I thought...oh well. Folks from other parts of the country don't know what real lobster bisque tastes like, but surely Bar Harbor is doing it right.  WRONG. As a New Englander, I know what good lobster bisque tastes like and it's not this.<br /><br />Unless you enjoy mystery food and dislike lobster, I'd advise against purchasing this.
