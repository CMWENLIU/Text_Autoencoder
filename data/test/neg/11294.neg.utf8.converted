I thought the idea was a good one, I drink a lot of water. I'm a Diabetic so I'm always looking for more flavor where and when I can find it. Unfortunatly this tastes just plain bad to me, I squeezed a healthy amount into my cold filtered water and wow the first thing I noticed was the strange chemical smell. Then after tasting it, it  really was a sweet artifical flavor, very chemically not at all like good diet peach ice tea like AZ Ice Tea or Snapple. That's the flavor I was hoping for really. I tried it again and I just can't use this stuff, what a pity because I really wanted it and needed it be good. I would have been a customer if I liked it at all. I could not even give this a two star, I just thought it was that bad.
