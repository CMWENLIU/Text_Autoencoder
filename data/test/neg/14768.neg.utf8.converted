Robertson products are usually quite good, but this was disappointing.  Baked as is from the jar, there was little flavor other than orange peel.  There seems to be a lot of mashed up fig (or something seeded which resembles fig).  The product is overpoweringly sweet. Sugar is the first ingredient on the label - should have checked before buying!<br /><br />However, it makes a decent base.  Add two cups of diced tart apples, some brandy and a bit more cinnamon/nutmeg and it isn't bad for a quick mincemeat filling.
