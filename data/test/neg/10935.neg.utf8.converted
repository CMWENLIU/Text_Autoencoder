I like the idea of the pouch baby food, but I was hoping that with a baby on the cover and a Stage 2 written on it, that it would be thicker. It was almost like water. It was a disaster. Maybe these are meant for older kids that get the concept of sucking them out of the pouch instead of being spoon fed to infants.
