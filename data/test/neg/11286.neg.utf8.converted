I was given some of this candy as a gift and liked it so much I wanted to share some with my family members during the holidays.  I ordered this bag from Amazon. When the bag came, I open it up as I found the bag a bit wore looking. I did not mind too much as I was going to create little bags out of the large bag. I ended up eating one... I glad I did. I was saved from giving a poor gift to my daughters.<br /><br />Found the inside of the ball had a large hole with only half of the smooth cream stuff the other candies had. Tried few more and found the same thing.  I ended up taking the candies to school and let my students have one on the last day before Christmas break... They all found the same thing.  Some had NO center of the cream at all. While the candy tasted ok - they were not the kind of candy I was looking for and were of a poor and inferior made.<br /><br />Would I buy this again?  NO WAY!
