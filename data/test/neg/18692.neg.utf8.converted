I try and feed my cats the good stuff, avoiding fillers, grain etc etc. Having read glowing reviews I felt confident that at least one of my three would enjoy this food (aged 16, 1 year and 16 weeks). Well I have been through most of the flavors and so far, they have walked away from all of them. Packaging is great and the stuff looks almost fit for human consumption !!! But sadly, not for my kitties.
