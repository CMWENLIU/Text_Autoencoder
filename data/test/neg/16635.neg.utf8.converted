Last month our cat started throwing up and had diarrhea all through the house and was sick for five days. I went through the cans and found that ALL the Venison & Green Pea Formula flavor cans were not properly sealed. I returned them to the store, whereby I discovered more Venison & Green Pea cans bulging on the store shelf. I made the clerk aware of the cans so they could be removed.<br /><br />Note: When our cat first got sick, I checked the Natural Balance "Buy with Confidence" Database, but it showed no toxins or contaminates tested positive. I have notified the Natural Balance directly and their in-store representative, however, as of time of this review, they have only posted a voluntary recall for their Dog Food Products, NOT Cat Food.
