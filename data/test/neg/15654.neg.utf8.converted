I am pretty sensitive to caffeine so I was a bit nervous about taking this stuff. If I drink coffee or tea on an empty stomach I tend to get the heebie-jeebies. I drank a full bottle and didn't really feel anything. Nothing good and nothing bad. I took the berry flavor and it wasn't that bad at all. I think I'll stick to some strong Irish tea.
