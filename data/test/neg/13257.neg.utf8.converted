I had been using Bob's Red Mill coconut flour for all my gluten-free baking but decided to try this brand because it was cheaper. And, let's just say you get what you pay for!! This coconut "flour" isn't flour at all... it's coconut meal. It's much more course than Bob's Red Mill and leaves all my baked goods with a undesirable grainy texture. I would absolutely not recommend this brand, however, I do recommend coconut flour in general. It's an absolutely wonderful substitute for grain flours.
