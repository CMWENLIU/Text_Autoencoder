I had to give this a one star because it not only was not as advertised (Carbonated Water, Cane Sugar, Caramel Color, Sodium Benzoate (A Preservative), Citric Acid, Natural and Artificial Flavors) but I received one case of vanilla soda and one case of dad's root beer long necks. Both cases contained fructose ( the first item on the bottles list). So customer service said they would send me another case of dads beer with the hopes that it is as advertised, with cane sugar NOT fructose. I spend a lot of money on this site buying food because it's impossible for me to go shopping due to a disability. Now I have a case of fructose laden root beer and a fructose laden case of vanilla soda, both of which I cannot drink because I'm allergic to fructose. If this is not resolved by Amazon.com customer service then I will stop buying everything on Amazon.com and believe me, I spent thousands of dollars a year here on this site. It was nice of customer service to offer me a free case to replace the vanilla soda with dad's root beer but what happens if it turns out to have fructose and it like the other cases I received. I would imagine it would be the end of our relationship because this is not the first time this has happened to me,, it's the third time in less than two months. Now I see a disclaimer claiming they are not responsible for what's inside of the product or the pictures they describe the product looks like. I guess it's time to pay somebody to go shopping for me. If you are allergic to or do not want fructose in your diet I suggest you don't buy this item that claims to be " fructose free". Disclaimer or no disclaimer I call that false advertising. Forewarned is forewarned. The motto on their advertising says" If it isn't dad's you've been had", then my motto is " it sure is dad's and I've been had"
