Tastes good, but sorry, I'm breaking up after some 20yrs. Goodbye Sriracha Chili Sauce :P If you want it spicy, why buy or eat something that has SUGAR as the #2 ingredient? Check the ingredient list of food stuff you buy, unless you're buying SUGAR, sugar and high fructose corn syrup has no business being on the top 3 ingredients of what you're buying :) Live healthy, be happy.
