These baits are peanut butter-based, as it says on the can.  The ants I have seem to be drawn to sugary things, but they leave these baits alone.  I'm going to try another type; I know some ants are drawn to some traps so I think it's mostly a matter of trying different kinds until I find one that these particular ants like to eat.
