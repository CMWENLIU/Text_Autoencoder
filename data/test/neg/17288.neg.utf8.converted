I had great hopes for this product.  Unfortunately, the inulin soluble fiber that is used as "filler" does not dissolve in drinks, such as iced tea.  You can try shaking and shaking, but the stuff just won't dissolve.  It reminds me of those snow globes that used to be popular, with the little flecks of white floating down like snow on a pastoral scene.  Letting the drink sit for 2 hours still does not do the trick.  This stuff still can be found at the bottom of your drink.<br /><br />What's worse is that the manufacturer did not care. I called them to complain, and they simply replied, "OK, we'll report this to blah blah blah."  They never bothered to send me a refund, or to offer me coupons for some other product, or ask that I send them samples of the product, like most companies do when you report a complaint with their products.
