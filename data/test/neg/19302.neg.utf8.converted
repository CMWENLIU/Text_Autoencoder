The color looked very white compared to the other garlic powders I have used so I tasted it as is and it didn't have strong garlic taste at all. I tried to make sauce for my chicken anyway but it didn't blend with other liquid ingredients. I have been using garlic powders for a long time but this is not what I expected. Very disappointing. They are in my trash can now.
