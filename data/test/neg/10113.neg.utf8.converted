I'm going to buck the trend of reviews here.  I have eyed these at Whole Foods before.  We frequently make hummus and fried chick peas (yum!), and when I saw a good deal on a case, after reading all the great reviews, I thought I would give these a try.  I was particularly impressed to learn that the can was BPA free.<br /><br />Usually, I enjoy snacking on chickpeas right out of the can as we are preparing our recipes.  I popped one into my mouth, and was underwhelmed.  The second one, I thought maybe I just need to get used to them.  The third was as bland as the first two.  We ended up adding lots of seasoning to give these any flavor at all.<br />My husband teases me occasionally about using up the remaining cans.<br /><br />Maybe I am just not the target audience for this product.  Mine is strictly and clearly the opinion of someone who does not look for low sodium products. I am sure these are great for others (as indicated by other reviews), but I wanted to give the review of someone who does not regularly eat foods without any salt - I wish I had read one before I purchased these.  if you are not used to no-salt added products, like me, these may be to bland for you too.  As for me, I will save some coin and stick with the Goya brand (recommended by Cooks Illustrated),  when I have finally used up all of these.
