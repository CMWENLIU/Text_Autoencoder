First of all, make sure you really like the taste of licorice. The licorice flavor is very strong in this, easily overpowering everything else. I could barely choke down a cup. Also, Stevia has an after taste to me. Always has, and this was no exception. Admittedly, I was hoping with all the other herbs--i.e. cinnamon and ginger amongst others--in here, those two flavors would be overpowered. I was wrong. Did this product work after I forced it down my throat? No! What worked was the two capsules I took of kava kava liquid phyto-caps from Gaia Herbs. I'll also be trying their liquid extract--in a cup of chai latte tea I make myself.
