I'm a Wasabi Peas lover and usually buy them at Target or Whole Foods. I love Wasabi and GREEN peas.<br /><br />However, THESE are NOT green (despite the photo on the bag). Subscribed to this product and the first box arrived (12 bags) with 6 of the bags open on the bottom (seems like pressure popped). In all of the bags the peas were almost brown colored and the wasabi taste was so mild I could have eaten a handful without even blinking. Some of the peas even tasted a bit stale.<br /><br />I called Amazon and had the order refunded, canceled my subscription.<br /><br />Going back to WholeFoods for the time being.
