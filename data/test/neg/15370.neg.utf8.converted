I don't see how they can get away with calling it 'blue cheese'. I cannot taste any cheese chunks in this particular dressing. Calling it ranch seems more appropriate. This appeared to be the predominant flavor throughout.<br /><br />I know this is one of the 'budget' salad dressings available in the local grocery store. And it might explain the composition.<br /><br />But because Kraft is obviously famous for producing cheese products, they should put a little more work into this particular item. They could probably do it.
