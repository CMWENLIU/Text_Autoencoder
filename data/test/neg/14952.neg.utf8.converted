Nothing more to say here. I really had high hopes (i love carrot cake). This tastes like stale cereal that has been left out for 10 years, then freezerburned, and then coated with some fake chemical tastes. I am a HUGE fan of the Nugo organic chocolate bars (delicious!) which is why i am so surprised a company can make such a great product alongside this sorry excuse for a bar.
