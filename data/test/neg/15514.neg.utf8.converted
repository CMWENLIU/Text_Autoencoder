To start with, these bags do NOT contain 70 treat packs.  They contain 65 treat packs.  I checked more than one bag, and the shortage seems to be consistent.  The packs themselves are skimpy.  Some only contained 4 or 5 pieces of candy corn.  Packs available from other sources are much more generous in their content.  So, if you are satisfied with a short count of skimpy treats, I suppose you might buy these, but I like a little more for my money.<br /><br />Note: Since posting this earlier review, the company seems to have corrected the shortage problem (I counted the contents of a bag purchased this year).  The individual packetts are still on the skimpy size.  There were some extra packetts, so if you discard the ones with only three or four pieces of candy corn, you might end up with 70 that each have about 7 pieces of candy corn.  That compares with a different source that has packetts with about 14 pieces of candy corn (at a somewhat higher price).
