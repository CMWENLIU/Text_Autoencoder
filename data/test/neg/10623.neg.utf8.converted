Cats are obligate carnivores.  They should eat 97%+ meat.  A lot of Weruva varieties are packed with veggies.  Veggies aren't good for cats.  Grains aren't good for your cat.  Knowledgeable cat nutrition friends think the Paw licking chicken is fine and their cats love it.  My cats and I hate the veggie-containing varieties they tried.  Look closely at the label before you buy.
