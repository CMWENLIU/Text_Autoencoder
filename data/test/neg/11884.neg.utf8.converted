I buy this syrup all the time when I'm down south, but forgot to bring it with me to Wisconsin. I ordered this expecting to get the usual size I buy from the grocery store, but this teeny thing showed up. The photo is deceiving - it doesn't state any where but the label that it is only 12 oz. I assumed since it was $8.99, that I'd get more! I think with shipping I paid over $15! I learned my lesson.<br />I did get it in a timely manner at least (but its all gone!)
