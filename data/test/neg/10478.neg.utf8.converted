Maybe I should have said "this is not 100% white tea." But then, so should Lipton have said just that. Even though it does not say so in the tea name, the sub-title name, or any of the information anywhere on the box EXCEPT the ingredients list in very very small type (had to get my reading glasses!) -- the second ingredient in this "white" tea is green tea.<br /><br />Why? Because white tea is very expensive. It is costly because it is hard, labor intensive work to harvest white tea. If they sold this product made completely out of white tea -- they would not make as much money.<br /><br />But then, they also would not be deceiving their customers. I drink white tea and rooibos red teas because they are naturally either caffeine free, or so low in caffeine that it doesn't give me the migraines which caffeine cause for me.<br /><br />Lipton's deception did cause a migraine. And they have permanently lost a customer because of their intentional deceit.<br /><br />All of the other major tea companies make sure their products are clearly labeled as "caffeine free," "contains caffeine," "naturally low in caffeine," "those sensitive to caffeine please read ingredients...."  But not Lipton.  They made these pretty little pyramid tea bags, but put the same old sad corporate ethics inside.
