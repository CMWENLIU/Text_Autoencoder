The trend of blending packaged foods with medicine is one of the driving forces in consumer products.  This product and its cousins are no exception.<br /><br />First off, the product tastes just like Spenda to me in my Iced Tea.  It is good to know that I might be getting some nutrition with my sweetener, then I looked at the economics of it.  Nutritionally enhanced Spenda costs ($0.09/packet) about three times more than regular Splenda ($0.03/packet).  Now that may not seem like much but if you put two packets in your coffee that is 12 cents a cup.  Many of us have multiple drinks in a day, adding to your routine. No so much to make you think twice as you get 'more' with Spenda Essentials, but it adds up and you may want to think again.<br /><br />I am a little concerned that the addition of the antioxidants requires putting the Spenda in a foil packet rather than the simple paper cover for regular Spenda.  The packaging kept reminding me that I was getting chemistry along with my sweetener.<br /><br />I am not saying that you should avoid this product and its better getting some vitamins rather than none.  But it seems to me that a more effective approach would be to use regular Spenda and take a multivitamin.  Not only is it less expensive, but the vitamin provides a broader range of nutrients than what is found in this product.<br /><br />So as a product, its great, tastes like regular Spenda, delivers antioxidants and mixes well in my drinks.  Economically, I think that you have a better alternative that is cheaper, better nutritionally and still gives you all of Spenda's taste.
