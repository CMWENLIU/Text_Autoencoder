These are some of the worse biscuits I've ever tasted.  They were very gritty and very heavy.  I tried making them several times (altering the recipe to try to get added lightness) and nothing really resolved the problem, especially the grittiness.  I have used many different Bob's Red Mill products and have loved all of them except this one.  I have used several other GF products from other producers, and, this takes the cake for the worst.  This is especially sad since Bob's usually has such great products.
