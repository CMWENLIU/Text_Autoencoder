My cats are just over two years old. They will eat any cat food put in front of them, so that was not an issue. However, the stench was a real issue. Of all the dry foods I have ever fed my kids (or their predecessors) this was by far the worst on the other end. The smell was unbearable, had to switch after a one bag experiment. Smell went back to normal within a week or so of getting them off this stuff.
