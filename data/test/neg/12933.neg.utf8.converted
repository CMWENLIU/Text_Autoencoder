I think anything that makes light of cigarette smoking is disgusting!  I've watched two close friends die horrible deaths related to their inability to quit smoking.  I recall puffing on the candy cigarettes and thinking it made me cool like a grown up, like my parents...  Then I recall how "cool" it was to smoke as a teenager in high school.  Took me 14 years to quit!  I have watched two people die from smoking... One went through being horribly cut open to remove a cancerous upper part of one of her lungs, only to go back to smoking a year later.  Another had emphazema (spelling?) from it and die a long painful suffocating death.  There's nothing "cool" about candy cigarettes or anything that would make light of such a horrible addiction!
