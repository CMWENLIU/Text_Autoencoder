Wow, this rice has quite a few positive reviews but I'm really not sure why. I did buy this from the "Clearance sale" - but even then. The rice smells funny and doesn't actually taste much like rice, it tastes just like it smells, funny.<br /><br />I was hoping for a decent quick and easy meal but this one is not it.
