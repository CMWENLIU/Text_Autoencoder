I am very disappointed with this SELLER!<br />What a waste of money!<br /><br />They again used a very flimsy box which was virtually opened during shipping. 8 of individual packages out of 20 were already open and had no residual air to cushion them while shipping. This also had weird old oil smell and expiration date was again Sep 2008.  I ate a couple of them which looked intact. Usually Nomshim snacks have 1 yr expiration date and the seller sent the old product which were about to expire. I wouldn't recommend you to purchase from this seller.
