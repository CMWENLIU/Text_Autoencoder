Amazon sent me the wrong thing (separate packages of cranberries, tart cherries, and bing cherries--not a dried fruit mixture as advertised) but seeing the ingredient list on these is enough to have me avoid the Melissa brand altogether. Ingredients include high fructose corn syrup, sucrose, juice concentrate, partially hydrogenated oil. Yuck.
