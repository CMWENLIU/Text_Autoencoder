I was SO excited to receive the cereal I loved as a child.  I didn't get it all the time back then, but often enough that now, 25 years later, I could close my eyes and ALMOST taste it.  When I saw it for sale, I'd nearly forgotten it existed and was thrilled to order.  As soon as I opened the box, I realized this was not going to be the same experience.  The cereal has completely changed, in both appearance and taste.  It's very similar to Cap 'n Crunch Crunchberries now -- only not half as flavorful.  I wouldn't at all encourage lovers of the original to give this a try.  You will be sorely disappointed.  :(
