This pasta is fine if you do not care about a glucose spike 3 and 4 hrs after eating. It contains inulin which is in the clear version of Metamucil. Only slows down absorption for an hour or two for me. Caution if eating left overs the rise is quicker. If you eat this with tomato sauce realize all tomato sauce has carbs you need to take this into account. People have said it is the acid in the tomato sauce that causes the rise, some sauces contain a lot of carbs and added sugar. These same people must have forgotten the stomach produces one of the strongest acids in nature to aid digestion so my guess is look at the carb count in the sauce for that rise. I can not believe by adding inulin which is found naturally in onions and bananas could prevent starch breakdown completely. It does seem to protect the starch to glucose breakdown but only for a couple of hours than by the third to fourth hour comes the spike. It is only tested for glucose rise for one and two hours after. Do a 1, 2, 3, and 4 hr blood meter test for your self. Many who really need to be careful with insulin spikes should check the 3rd and 4th hour to make sure it is safe. If you are on a low carb diet and you fall out of ketosis a couple hrs after eating anything get a blood glucose meter this way you can see a cause and affect from anything carb questionable you may eat. If it works for you that is great but be cautious. I am not a diabetic but follow a low carb lifestyle I get no rise at all the first hour than slow rise by the second. Than it comes for me between the 3-4 hour as if I ate a normal portion of regular past. I have never tested past the 4th hour.
