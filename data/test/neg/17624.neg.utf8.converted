Splenda is an amazing artificial sweetener. But you already know that if you drink Diet Coke with Splenda or you've been to a coffee shop in the past few years. Now you're looking to purchase this expensive sweetener for less money, right?<br /><br />Recently, Amazon has consistently amazed me by being the product price leader and the place that wins my final purchase. I'll Google the heck out of books and electronics seeking the best combination of delivered price and seller reliability. Amazon wins more often than not.<br /><br />Which is exactly why I'm so annoyed at myself for buying this 1000 count box of Splenda for $28.45.<br /><br />The day after I ordered I was in a big-box member club (four letters starting with S) where I saw, to my shock, the exact same 1,000 count box for $20.50. Yikes. I paid nearly _40% more_ the day before and thought I got a deal.<br /><br />Caveat emptor. Today on Amazon I now see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3N7AC">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener 1000 Individual Packets Value Pack (Net Wt. 2.2</a> for as low as $22.89. But the less-than-sweet moral of this story is that things may not *always* cost less on the web.
