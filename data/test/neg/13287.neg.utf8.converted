I purchased this package of Premium American Beef Hide Retriever Bones thinking I was getting a good product at a good price.  I was wrong.  These bones are the same ones I had previously purchased at BJ's for a lot cheaper.  These bones are made in Mexico, not the United States.  I had to throw out many of the bones from the package I bought at BJ's.  These bones are NOT premium quality.  I will never again purchase these bones for my dog.  I guess you do get what you pay for.
