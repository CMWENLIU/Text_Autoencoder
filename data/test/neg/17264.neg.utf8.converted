Lollipops look cute in the picture but came in a clear plastic wrapping that had black writing all over both sides so if look is what you are after (I was) you need to unwrap each lollipop.  And... taking the wrappers off was not an easy feat!  Once I did get the wrapping off (and ended up breaking 2,) they were great!  The kids loved them!
