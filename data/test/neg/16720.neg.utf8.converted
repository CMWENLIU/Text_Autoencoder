I know people are going to rate my review not helpful but I can't help it... I think this tea is one of the worst I ever tasted. I grew up in a place where everyone enjoyed green tea, so this flavored green tea thing tastes just horrible to me. At Starbucks they serve this tea with boiling hot water, so naturally the green tea flavor is killed (like always as they never tell customers that hot water kills green tea flavor and make it bland). If you want herbal tea thats good, but if you are looking for "real green tea", I recommend you get once that don't have funny names like this one or Samurai, Sakura, because they usually arent real green tea but something people who haven't had real green tea thought would sound oriental and cool.
