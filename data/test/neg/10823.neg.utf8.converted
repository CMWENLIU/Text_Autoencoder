Sent to a relative based on positive experience with the product. The recipient found the raisins stale, dry and sugar crystalizing on raisin surfaces. This is not a good gift. We recently ordered these raisins from Amazon for our own use. Unfortunately they were the same. Did Amazon get the dregs from a many-year-old stock? Sorry to be negative, but something is missing in quality control of this item.
