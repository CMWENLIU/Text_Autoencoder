There were no Measurements of this product.  They were way too small for what I wanted to use them for ( party favor containers).  The boxes were about 3" across the middle (it tapers down), 2" deep, and 4.5"  tall.  Don't get me wrong; they're cute if you want miniature popcorn boxes.  Check out Hobby Lobby.  Target has some tall hard plastic ones in the dollar section at the front of store.
