As a big fan of the old Cool Brew Blueberry Ice, I bought this because the other had been discontinued.  I thought this may have just be a "repackaging" (40 instead of 48 tea bags) and would taste the same.  I was very disappointed because this pale green tea had very little blueberry taste.  In fact, there was very little taste at all.  Since I have six boxes, I am experimenting with ways to make it palatable.  I'm adding a couple of bags of other teas (Blueberry Breeze) when I make it, to add a hint of flavor. I wouldn't recommend as a blueberry tea.  Guess it is a good alternative to water.  Hope Celestial Seasonings brings back the old version.
