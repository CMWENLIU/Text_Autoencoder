I am a big fan of gummy candies, and I bought these after seeing the rave reviews on Amazon. I think they are awful! Every flavor has a strong chemical taste. I admit that the soft, chewy texture is nice. However, the flavor is so off and artificial you almost feel as though you're eating a non-edible item, like a scented eraser.
