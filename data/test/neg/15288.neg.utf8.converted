This is no Chef's Taste award winner - maybe the brand won the award, but no one could have tasted these Omega 3 Gummies. They invoke thoughts of week old seafood gumbo left in a hot car or maybe 'red tide' flavored gummies. We were actually looking to improve on Nordic Naturals, strawberry but now are going running back to the Nordics. I am not sure anyone in our family can choke down these giant squishy, fish blobs. Even my non-picky child is grossed out by these. I can barely manage to swallow one only if I cut (not bite) one in half then swallow each piece without chewing. There goes my 20 bucks, unless maybe they are good for the dog? Hmmm...
