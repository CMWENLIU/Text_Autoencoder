I was an avid fan of Horizon's chocolate milk until the recent change of last month.  Everything about their product has been cheapened: the carton, the price, but most importantly, the taste.  It used to taste like creamy chocolate pudding.  Perhaps they use less chocolate, but the taste is no longer there.
