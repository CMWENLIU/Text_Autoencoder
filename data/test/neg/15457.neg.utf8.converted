This would be a great litter box for some litters, especially with the double bottom trays that make cleaning easier.  However, contrary to a previous review, I found this box bad for Feline Pine wood pellet litter.  The slots in the top sifting pan are exactly the same size as the Feline Pine pellets, so pellets block most slots.  In addition, the top sifting pan does not sit sufficiently high above the pan below it.  Both lead to powder piling up very quickly in the top pan, defeating part of the purpose of Feline Pine.<br /><br />If you use Feline Pine (and I recommend that highly) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176CC20">Feline Pine  Original Cat Litter, 40-Pound Bags</a>, buy the box made specifically for it, sometimes offered on Amazon but, if not, at [...].  It has the right sized holes in the top tray and the proper height difference and thus works terrifically.  It costs a bit more but is completely worth it.
