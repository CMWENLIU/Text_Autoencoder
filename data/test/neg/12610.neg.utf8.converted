Full of crushed up little bones, spinal tissue, and skin. Impossible to consume. I've purchased canned salmon before that was quite excellent but this stuff is disgusting. I am stunned that anyone would give this anything other than a 1 star review. Do look at other 1 star reviews - especially the person who had to go to the doctor because of bones getting stuck in throat. Not only is this product inedible it is dangerous. That is no exaggeration.
