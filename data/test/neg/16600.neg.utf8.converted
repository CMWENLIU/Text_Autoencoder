I purchased this soda from my local health food store, thinking that because it came from a health food store and claimed to be 'natural', that it didn't use GMO ingredients (yes, I know, I was naive, lol) . After reading some of the comments here, especially the one about the ingredients not being as advertised by the company, I decided to do some research. I ended up emailing the company and asking them why they used erythritol and where their erythritol source came from. The response that I received appears below. I don't appreciate marketing that is designed to mislead consumers by throwing the word 'natural' around like this product does. I have enough labels to sift through to try to remove GMO from my diet. Figured I'd pass the info on.<br /><br />Hi Joanna,<br /><br />Erythritol is 100% natural. It occurs naturally in grapes, melons, pears, corn to name a few sources. It is made through a fermentation process like yeast. Erythritol has no calories and no effect on blood sugar levels. The reason we blend stevia (hundreds of time sweeter than sugar) with erythritol (only 70% the sweetness of sugar) is because the combination yields a natural sweetness that tastes like sugar. Using either sweetener alone would not please the palate like Zevia does.<br />------------------<br />Hi Joanna,<br /><br />Zevia is always considering ingredients that are safe for personal safety and health and that of our environments. Our erythritol is not certified Organic by the USDA and is not certified GMO-Free and is made from corn.  Zevia does seek out suppliers of GMO-free ingredients when they are available in the market and when it is a viable alternative, but we cannot make the claim that all of our ingredients are GMO-free. We promise that we will continue to explore ingredient alternatives when available and will always choose to do right by our customer and the environment.
