I wanted to make a black and white cake so I got this at a store near me. As soon as I got home I sprayed a tiny bit on my hand and licked it. It smelled and tasted horrible. I threw it out within minutes of coming home from the store. I own quite a few Wilton products but would advise against getting the black spray.
