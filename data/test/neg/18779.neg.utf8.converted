As others have stated, this product has recently undergone a reformulation. Sugar has increased from 2g to 7g, fiber has decreased by 2g, sodium has increased, potassium has decreased, and several other micronutrients are no longer listed (presumably removed?) or have decreased. Also, the serving size has increased by a few grams. Buyer beware, this product is not nearly as health as it once was due to this new "tastes even better" formulation and Kellogg's has lost me as a customer because of this change.
