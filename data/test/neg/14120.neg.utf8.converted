I live in southern california and my yard is over-run by gophers. I bought this trap first from amazon as it supposedly is meant for novice users who are just beginning their gopher-eradication journey.<br /><br />The trap arrived in a paper box, which had pretty much no useful instruction in placing the trap. Should you place one trap in each direction of the tunnel? Should you cover up the end hole? the top opening? Should you place bait? Should you wear gloves? Should the joint of the trap and the tunnel be air tight? Should you use it in the main run? Or can it be used in the lateral openings? No help on any of these items in the instructions.<br /><br />Anyway, I set the trap 3 times, and each time the little critters filled them up with dirt. I finally got fed up and bought a couple of the victor easy-set traps. With those, I have had good success after placing them in the tunnels. This one is a waste. I don't know how it got such high reviews.
