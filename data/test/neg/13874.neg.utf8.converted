For starters, it comes in a clear plastic bottle, not the dark glass in the picture.  Then there's the ingredient list:<br /><br />Water, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, natural and artificial flavors, Phosphoric Acid.  Doing a bit of research, I find that while propylene glycol is what goes into modern antifreeze and hand sanitizers, the US FDA has determined that it is "generally considered safe.  According to the rest of the reading, it would take a LOT to cause a problem.  But my question is: Why are we using it at all?  Is there nothing else that will do the job?  Theoretically, it's an alcohol, but then again wood alcohol makes people go blind, so...<br /><br />Lots of questions, no conclusive answers.  I'll likely try a drop or two, but I wish Amazon had revealed this in the first place.  At $8.xx, it's not responsible to the carbon footprint to ship it back... but that doesn't mean I've go to like it.<br /><br />EDIT: put a couple drops into some oil... it doesn't mix.  Not even a little bit.  So it is being returned.  Not worth buying, IMO.
