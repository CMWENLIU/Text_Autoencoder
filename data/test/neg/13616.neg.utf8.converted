Taste is too sweet and not garlicky, to me. Also, it is named Gilroy Farms, but the label does not indicate the origin of the garlic. I think it just says packed in CA or USA. When I called and emailed about this I got no answer from McCormick, the company that distributes the product. I will not buy any more. There are other products on Amazon that give the country of origin without having to wait for answers that never come!
