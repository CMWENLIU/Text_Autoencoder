I love Barbara's baked cheese puffs, so I thought I'd give these a try.  Much to my disappointment, these were not nearly as cheesy or jalapeno-y as I had hoped.  If you're looking for big cheese flavor, the baked puffs are a much better option.  Sadly, there's no jalapeno baked version though. :-(
